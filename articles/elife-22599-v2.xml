pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22599.001</object-id><p>Cell junctions are scaffolds that integrate mechanical and chemical signaling. We previously showed that a desmosomal cadherin promotes keratinocyte differentiation in an adhesion-independent manner by dampening Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activity. Here we identify a potential mechanism by which desmosomes assist the de-neddylating COP9 signalosome (CSN) in attenuating EGFR through an association between the Cops3 subunit of the CSN and desmosomal components, Desmoglein1 (Dsg1) and Desmoplakin (Dp), to promote epidermal differentiation. Silencing CSN or desmosome components shifts the balance of EGFR modifications from ubiquitination to neddylation, inhibiting EGFR dynamics in response to an acute ligand stimulus. A reciprocal relationship between loss of Dsg1 and neddylated EGFR was observed in a carcinoma model, consistent with a role in sustaining EGFR activity during tumor progression. Identification of this previously unrecognized function of the CSN in regulating EGFR neddylation has broad-reaching implications for understanding how homeostasis is achieved in regenerating epithelia.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22599.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The outer layer of skin – the epidermis – forms a critical barrier against a range of stresses from the environment. The epidermis itself consists of multiple layers of cells that are constantly being renewed. New cells are made in the deepest layer and move upwards until they eventually reach the skin’s surface. During this journey, the cells change the molecules they make in a process called epidermal differentiation.</p><p>To maintain an effective barrier, the epidermis must balance the division of cells in the deepest layer with the differentiation of cells in the layers above. When activated, a protein called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (or EGFR for short) encourages cells in the deepest layer to divide. However, it remains poorly understood how the balance between cells dividing and cells differentiating is achieved.</p><p>The desmosome is a structure that can link together cells within the epidermis. Najor et al. now report a new interaction between the desmosome and a very large protein complex called the COP9- signalosome known to remove protein-based tags from other proteins. The experiments show that the COP9-signalosome results in the removal of these tags from EGFR. The status of the tags on EGFR regulates whether or not it is found at the cell surface. Najor et al. propose that that the desmosome acts as a scaffold and holds the COP9 signalosome close to EGFR. The enzyme in the COP9 signalosome then removes protein-based tags from EGFR, which triggers a series of events that remove EGFR from the cell surface. This dampens down the signals EGFR would normally send to make cells divide, and allows differentiation to proceed.</p><p>The balance between cell division and differentiation is a fundamental process that is affected in many skin conditions, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. EGFR is also commonly overactive in cancers. As such, understanding how epidermal differentiation and cell division are controlled will shed light on a variety of disorders, allowing for the potential development of new treatments for these diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>COP9 signalosome</kwd><kwd>epidermal differentiation</kwd><kwd>epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)</kwd><kwd>desmosome</kwd><kwd>neddylation</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship (F32AR066465)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Najor</surname><given-names>Nicole Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Training Grant (T32GM008061)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harmon</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Albrecht</surname><given-names>Lauren Veronica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albrecht</surname><given-names>Lauren Veronica</given-names></name><name><surname>Harmon</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Program Grant (R01 AR041836)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Kathleen Janee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Program Grant (R37 AR043380)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Kathleen Janee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Program Grant (R01 CA122151)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Kathleen Janee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A protein interaction screen revealed desmosomes as a scaffold for the COP9 de-neddylating complex, to promote epidermal differentiation by governing the balance of Nedd8 and Ubiquitin modifications on Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis are critically dependent on the proper spatial control of receptor tyrosine kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casaletto and McClatchey, 2012</xref>). This is particularly so in complex regenerating tissues, such as the epidermis. The epidermis is a multi-layered epithelium that continuously renews itself through a highly choreographed program of morphological and biochemical changes, which are necessary to form a barrier against environmental insults and water loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koster and Roop, 2007</xref>). This process requires proliferating basal cells to stop dividing and undergo a commitment to differentiate as they transit toward the outer surface of the skin. Chemical cues governed by Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and other signaling receptors must be tightly regulated to maintain a proper balance of proliferation and differentiation and to drive critical steps at each stage of epidermal stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs and Nowak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs and Raghavan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koster and Roop, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lopez-Pajares et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While the mechanisms that dictate EGFR activity and dynamics during epidermal differentiation are not well understood, properly positioning the receptor in proximity to effector and regulatory machinery is likely to play a role. Candidate cytoarchitectural components that could serve in this manner are cell-cell junctions. In the epidermis, the most prominent of these junctions are desmosomes, which confer mechanical strength to tissues by linking the intermediate filament (IF) cytoskeleton through the IF anchoring protein Desmoplakin (Dp) to sites of desmosomal cadherin-mediated adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kowalczyk and Green, 2013</xref>). The importance of the desmosome-IF complex is underscored by the existence of mutations in genes encoding desmosome components that lead to skin, heart, and hair defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai-Cheong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrof et al., 2012</xref>). While the desmosome has classically been regarded as an adhesion complex, recent studies have demonstrated that it can act as a signaling scaffold to ensure the spatial and temporal execution of the epidermal differentiation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broussard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harmon and Green, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt and Koch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sumigray and Lechler, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In particular, we showed that the desmosomal cadherin, Desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), is not only required for maintaining epidermal tissue integrity in superficial layers, but also promotes keratinocyte differentiation as cells transit out of the basal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Getsios et al., 2009</xref>). It performs this function at least in part by attenuating the activity of ErB receptors (EGFR and ErbB2) and downstream MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Getsios et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harmon et al., 2013</xref>). Dsg1 is optimally positioned to exert this sort of spatial control on the EGFR pathway, as it is first expressed as cells commit to differentiation and becomes progressively concentrated in the superficial epidermal layers. Thus, it is a good candidate to serve as a scaffold for machinery necessary to down-regulate EGFR family activity, which is required for this commitment to differentiation. The unusually long cytoplasmic tail of Dsg1, but not the adhesive ectodomain, was required to suppress EGFR and Extra Cellular Signal-regulated Kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) signaling, indicating a previously unrecognized function for Dsg1 that transcends its canonical roles in adhesion. However, the molecular machinery that integrates the desmosome-IF scaffold with the biochemical differentiation program is not well-defined.</p><p>To identify mediators of Dsg1 signaling functions we carried out a yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) screen using the cytoplasmic domain of Dsg1 as bait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harmon et al., 2013</xref>). Among the putative binding partners identified was the third subunit (Cops3) of the eight-subunit complex called the <underline>C</underline>OP9 <underline>s</underline>ig<underline>n</underline>alosome (CSN). Discovered in 1994 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the <underline>Co</underline>nstitutively <underline>P</underline>hotomorphogenic (COP) mutants, <italic>cops1-8,</italic> exhibit a photomorphogenic phenotype in complete darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chory et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miséra et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei and Deng, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei and Deng, 1999</xref>). The CSN functions as a Nedd8 isopeptidase to remove Nedd8 moieties from its substrates, an activity depending on the Cops5 subunit. This hydrolysis has been classically studied in the context of de-neddylation of cullin-RING (<underline>R</underline>eally <underline>I</underline>nteresting <underline>N</underline>ew <underline>G</underline>ene) E3 ligases (Cul1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cope et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saha and Deshaies, 2008</xref>), which regulate fundamental processes important for development and tissue homeostasis, including cell cycle, signal transduction, transcription and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>). To promote the activity of cullin-RING E3 ligases, the CSN de-neddylates and partners with de-ubiquitinase enzymes to ‘de-ubiquitinate’ and rescue the cullin from spurious self-ubiquitination that occurs when the Nedd8 modification is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetfeld et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>). These functions create activation cycles allowing cullin-RING E3 ligases to focus their activity on specific substrates. Cells deficient for the CSN are unable to remove Nedd8, and as a consequence cullin-RING E3 ligase subunits are autoubiquitinated resulting in reduced function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosu and Kipreos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetfeld et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hotton and Callis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwechheimer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>). It has yet to be demonstrated whether the CSN is able to de-neddylate other substrates modified by Nedd8.</p><p>In this report, we show that the Cops3 subunit of the CSN interacts with desmosomal components, Dsg1 and Dp. Loss of Cops3 results in an increase in phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), which is associated with compromised keratinocyte differentiation, suggesting that Cops3, and consequently the CSN, inhibits EGFR signaling to promote differentiation. Further, Cops3 deficiency compromises the ability of ectopic Dsg1 to promote expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers, consistent with functional cooperation between desmosomes and the CSN. We go on to show that EGFR is neddylated in human keratinocytes and genetically interfering with desmosomal components or Cops3 results in elevated EGFR receptor neddylation, suggesting that EGFR is a non-cullin substrate for CSN-dependent de-neddylation. Importantly, this increase in neddylation was accompanied by a decrease in ubiquitination and altered EGFR dynamics in response to an acute ligand stimulus. A reciprocal relationship between Dsg1 and neddylated EGFR was observed in a 3D carcinoma model, raising the possibility that loss of desmosomes during cancer progression unscaffolds membrane-associated CSN complexes, resulting in hyper-neddylated EGFR. These data support a model whereby epidermal differentiation is assisted by desmosome-dependent scaffolding of the CSN complex to down-regulate EGFR through removal of Nedd8 modifications.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The COP9 signalosome (CSN) interacts with the desmosome</title><p>We recently identified a role for the desmosomal cadherin, Dsg1, in promoting epidermal differentiation through attenuation of EGFR/MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Getsios et al., 2009</xref>).

Cops3 was also present in immunoprecipitates of endogenous Dp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). To narrow down the domains in Dp that were necessary for Cops3 interaction we performed a Y2H analysis utilizing Dp truncation constructs. While the N-terminal portion of Dp harboring the amino acid residues 1–584 (DP-NTP) was not sufficient for Dp’s interaction with Cops3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), a 32 kDa truncated version of the C-terminal tail of Dp co-precipitated with endogenous Cops3 in the SCC9 cell line, which was used to overcome the limitations of ectopic expression of the Dp S-tag fusion protein (DP-S-tag) in primary cells. This suggested the site of interaction on Dp resides within the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). To further examine the relative disposition of Cops3, Dsg1 and Dp we carried out structured illumination microscopy (SIM), which produces two times the resolution of conventional optical microscopes, resulting in the minimal overlap of associated proteins in co-localization. SIM images revealed Cops3 to be distributed throughout the cell, impinging upon Dsg1 or Dp concentrated at cell-cell junctions. Cops3 was also closely associated with cytoplasmic Dsg1 and Dp particles, which could represent vesicles or cytoplasmic precursors, previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Godsel et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).</p><p>To further address the interaction between desmosomes and the CSN we took advantage of the proximity ligation assay (PLA), a powerful technique that provides an indication of protein proximity from 40 to 100 nm to examine the spatial relationship of endogenous Dsg1 and Cops3 in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weibrecht et al., 2010</xref>). A positive PLA signal was observed for the Dsg1 and Cops3 antibody pair, which was abrogated by treatment with either <italic>DSG1</italic> or <italic>COPS3</italic> siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with an association between Dsg1 and Cops3 in NHEKs. In addition, PLA analysis revealed a positive signal for Dp and Cops3 in NHEKs treated with high calcium media to induce epidermal differentiation, which was likewise inhibited through knockdown of Dp and Cops3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To investigate further the possibility that the entire desmosome serves as a docking site for the recruitment of the CSN, we also assessed whether Dp knockdown diminished Cops3’s ability to co-localize with Dsg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). In both cases, PLA signals were significantly reduced, supporting the idea that the integrity of the entire desmosome is required to scaffold the COP9 signalosome.</p><p>To address the specificity of Cops3 interactions with desmosomes we paired the Cops3 antibody with the adherens junction protein E-cadherin (E-cad). As a positive control, E-cad and Beta-catenin (B-cat) were paired as well as Alpha-catenin (A-cat) and B-cat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). These experiments clearly show that while Cops3 interacts with desmosomal molecules Dsg1 and Dp, it does not interact with adherens junction components. In addition, we used the cell-cell junction protein Plakoglobin (Pg) as a fluorescence marker for cell-cell junctions to determine the extent to which PLA signals co-localize with cell-cell interfaces. These data show that while not all desmosome-Cops3 interactions are in close proximity to the Pg signal, a large percentage of PLA dots do appear to be localized at cell-cell interfaces (~60% for Dsg1/Cops3;~67% for Dp/Cops3), although to a somewhat lesser extent than the positive control PLA pairings Alpha-Catenin/Beta-Catenin (~82%) and Ecad/Beta-catenin (~88%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4c</xref>). Cytoplasmic Cops3 interactions with desmosome molecules may occur between non-membrane bound Dp precursors and endocytosed membrane associated Dsg1 vesicles that we have previously identified in these cells, which could account for cytoplasmic PLA signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Godsel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harmon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nekrasova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dsg1-induced differentiation requires Cops3</title><p>We previously showed that Dsg1 promotes epidermal differentiation and that the adhesive ectodomain is dispensable for this function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Getsios et al., 2009</xref>). Towards addressing whether the interaction between Cops3 and the desmosome contribute to this function of the Dsg1 cytoplasmic domain, we silenced <italic>COPS3</italic> in NHEKs through electroporation of siRNAs targeted specifically against this CSN subunit. Biochemical analysis revealed a reduction in differentiation related gene products including Dsg1, Desmocollin1 (Dsc1), Keratin1 (K1), and Keratin 10 (K10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Similar impairment of these features of the keratinocyte differentiation program were observed using five oligos each with independent targets within the <italic>COPS3</italic> sequence (siCOPS3-465, siCOPS3-Dharma3, siCOPS3-IDT pool including 3 oligos), supporting the idea that the observed changes were not due to off target effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further address whether Cops3 contributes to proper epidermal differentiation and morphogenesis, we generated Cops3 deficient 3D organotypic cultures lifted to an air-medium interface (epidermal raft cultures) and harvested 3 days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Biochemical analysis of raft lysates revealed similar differentiation defects when compared with monolayer cultures reflected by a decrease in Dsg1, Dsc1, the suprabasal keratins K1 and K10 and the cell envelope protein Loricrin (Lor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Immunofluorescence of siCOPS3 Day 3 rafts also revealed defects in the differentiation marker K10 and Dsg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Interestingly, we noted a decrease in Dsg1 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and c</xref>), which could contribute to the differentiation defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Getsios et al., 2009</xref>). To test whether aberrant differentiation was due to the loss of Dsg1 protein expression, we introduced ectopic Dsg1-FLAG in the background of NHEKs deficient for Cops3. As we previously reported, ectopic Dsg1 promotes expression of differentiation specific markers in control cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Getsios et al., 2009</xref>). Biochemical analysis of cells retrovirally transduced with a Dsg1-Flag vector revealed that Dsg1-Flag was unable to drive expression of Dsc1, K1, and K10 in Cops3-silenced cultures after inducing differentiation for 2 days to the same extent as control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). To directly capture the impact of siCOPS3 on early differentiation in a specific population of cells expressing Dsg1, we scored NHEKs transiently expressing a GFP-tagged version of Dsg1 for an early differentiation marker, K10, in control and <italic>COPS3</italic>-silenced cultures after 1 day of differentiation. We observed that Dsg1-GFP expressing cells were unable to express K10 upon silencing of <italic>COPS3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f and g</xref>).

Upon loss of Cops3 and Dp we observed reduced ubiquitination of EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).

Additionally, PLA analysis revealed an association between EGFR and Ubiquitin upon the loss of Nedd8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Further, neddylation has previously been shown to stabilize substrates including other membrane receptors such as TGFβRII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zuo et al., 2013</xref>). Together with the results described above, this raises the possibility that by scaffolding the CSN near EGFR, desmosomes might promote EGFR turnover by shifting the balance of neddylation and ubiquitination modifications on the receptor. A prediction of this model is that EGFR would fail to re-localize in response to an acute ligand stimulus in the absence of the desmosome-CSN complex.

We propose a model by which the desmosome scaffolds the CSN in proximity to EGFR, to control the balance of neddylation-ubiquitination modifications, thus affecting receptor dynamics. Our data is consistent with a model whereby the CSN de-neddylation function contributes to EGFR turnover to promote differentiation in a regenerating tissue, in this case, the epidermis.</p><p>Previous work has shown that the loss of one CSN component affects the formation and function of the entire CSN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei and Deng, 1999</xref>). Thus, silencing of the <italic>COPS3</italic> subunit, shown here to interact with the desmosome, is predicted to compromise the entire CSN. Similarly, silencing either <italic>DP</italic> or <italic>DSG1</italic> disrupts the association of Cops3 with the other junction component, consistent with the idea that entire desmosome is involved in scaffolding the CSN. This idea is further supported by a mass spectrometry study that identified multiple desmosomal proteins (Plakophilin2 (Pkp2), Pg, Dsg1, and Dp), and not adherens junction proteins, as putative interactors with the first subunit (Cops1) of the COP9 signalosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2012</xref>). The fact that desmosomal control over the neddylation-ubiquitination balance occurs in SCC9s and keratinocytes in the absence of Dsg1 supports the idea that desmosomes of varying composition broadly regulate the CSN.</p><p>Our data provide further support for a functional role of Nedd8 modifications on less commonly reported non-cullin substrates, in this case EGFR. Further, our findings are consistent with the idea that neddylation of EGFR stabilizes the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and prevents EGFR from ligand-induced internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>). While one study reported a correlation between EGFR neddylation and degradation in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the majority of studies have linked neddylation with an increase in protein stability (e.g. MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watson et al., 2010</xref>), L11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sundqvist et al., 2009</xref>), HIF1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ryu et al., 2011</xref>), and TβRII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zuo et al., 2013</xref>). It is unknown whether specific neddylated residues on EGFR are important for driving EGFR towards certain outcomes or whether the number of Nedd8 modifications on EGFR is important. Poly-Nedd8 chains have been demonstrated, but it is still unclear whether these chains have a function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xirodimas et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, our data showing a reciprocal relationship between neddylated and ubiquitinated EGFR suggest that Nedd8 and Ubiquitin compete for lysine residues on EGFR to regulate receptor dynamics. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that EGFR ubiquitination can occur independent of neddylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting a new level of regulation that could have broad-reaching implications for receptor-mediated signaling in multiple contexts.</p><p>While we show changes in the neddylation state of EGFR, we have not ruled out the possibility that the desmosome-CSN super complex also regulates other proteins at the membrane, such as better-known substrates for the CSN, the cullin proteins, which could promote local Ubiquitin activity at the membrane. It is possible that a uniquely targeted protein degradation program could work in concert with transcriptional epidermal differentiation programs to remove proteins that inhibit, or are no longer required for, epidermal differentiation. Such a process could contribute to the re-sculpting and polarization of cell membrane proteins known to occur during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niessen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wollner et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>In addition to a role for desmosomal scaffolding of the CSN in regulating normal epidermal differentiation and homeostasis, our data from a 3D organotypic cancer model suggests that EGFR neddylation may contribute to elevated EGFR/MAPK signaling in human diseases including inherited keratodermas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harmon et al., 2013</xref>) and cancers such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–c</xref>). EGFR has been shown to be a strong prognostic indicator in epithelial cancers, and increased expression has been associated with reduced survival rates in 70% of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nicholson et al., 2001</xref>). This suggests the possibility that elevation of EGFR in different types of cancer may be partly due to the stabilization of the receptor through increased neddylation. Additionally, Cops3 has been implicated in keratinocyte interleukin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banda et al., 2005</xref>), which is interesting in light of the recent observation that loss of Dsg1 leads to an increase in inflammatory mediators in SAM syndrome, featuring severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, and metabolic wasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Samuelov et al., 2013</xref>). A desmosome-CSN super complex could thus serve as a general mechanism by which desmosomes regulate multiple downstream functions that guide normal skin homeostasis and paracrine signaling pathways in which keratinocytes participate. Further, components of this super complex could provide new targets for treating diseases associated with inappropriate epidermal differentiation, inflammation, and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and drugs</title><p>Primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were cultured in M154 media (Invitrogen) adjusted to 0.07 mM calcium (termed as low calcium) and supplemented with human keratinocyte growth supplement (HKGS) and gentamicin/amphotericin B.

The CytoTrap screen (Stratagene) utilizes the temperature-sensitive cdc25H strain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which is deficient in Ras signaling and unable to grow at 37°C. While yeast grow at the permissive temperature of 25°C, only yeast that are co-transformed with a bait (pSos) construct that binds a membrane-associated myristoylated target (pMyr) protein activate Ras signaling to allow for growth at 37°C. pMyr constructs are expressed under galactose promoters; thus, growth at 37°C on galactose plates without growth at 37°C on glucose plates indicates target-bait interaction (growth on glucose plates at 37°C indicates temperature sensitive revertants). A library of HeLa cell cDNAs expressed in the pMyr vector was co-transformed with pSos-DP-NTP or pSos-Dsg1 into <italic>cdc25</italic>H yeast. After obtaining putative positives by identifying clones that were capable of growing on galactose plates at 37°C for interactions with Dsg1, pMyr constructs were purified and individually co-transformed with pSos-Dsg1 to confirm specific interactions. pMyr-Pg was used as a positive binding control for Dsg1, and pMyr and pMyr-SB (Stratagene) were respectively used as negative and positive controls for the screen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Glutathione-S-Transferase</title><p>Dsg1-GST and GST constructs were bacterially expressed by adding isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to BL21A1 bacteria (Invitrogen).

For each independent/biological replicate, multiple experimental/control arms were processed and analyzed in parallel. Representative experiments are displayed throughout the figures and where indicated in the figure legends, quantification of experiments is reported as mean ±standard error mean (SEM). For biochemical analyses, cell lysates were derived from a population of cells grown in 10 cm dishes (approximately 4 million cells) or 3 cm dishes (approximately 1 million cells). For immunofluorescence or PLA analyses, cells were plated onto a coverslip in a 3 cm dish and quantified as follows: PLA particles were counted for 5–10 randomly selected fields, each containing 20–100 cells (depending on whether image was obtained using a 40X or 63X objective and/or whether the image was from cultured cells or 3D organotypic rafts). Parallel analyses of protein specific antibodies with IgG (mouse or rabbit) were performed to control for false positives. Fluorescence pixel intensity at randomly selected cell borders was determined by multiplying the mean pixel intensity by the area of the defined border divided by the border length. Background intensity was randomly selected from an area on the image and subtracted from the border intensity.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watts (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Reinhard Fässler (Reviewer 1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

How Dsg1 controls EGFR activity is unknown. The authors report now that the desmosomal components Dsg1 and Dp in keratinocytes recruit the COP9 signalosome (CSN) to de–neddylate EGFR resulting in increased ubiquitination and turnover of EGFR, and keratinocyte differentiation. These findings are highly significant and shed new light on the regulation of EGFR during epidermal differentiation. However, a potential conflict with previous reports on the role of EGFR neddylation for ubiquitylation should be resolved and important controls included into a revised manuscript. The essential revisions and the minor issues follow.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In contrast to the authors' finding that EGFR neddylation allows signaling and EGFR ubiquitylation leads to degradation, the Yarden lab (Oved et al., 2006) reported that EGFR neddylation is required for the subsequent ubiquitylation and degradation of activated (EGF–bound) EGFR.

The potential contradiction between the separation versus dependence of these events should be solved.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the extent to which separation versus dependence of ubiquitination (ubiquitylation) and neddylation of the EGFR receptor is important in terms of further understanding EGFR dynamics. To clarify the relationship between neddylation and ubiquitination in human keratinocytes, we performed EGFR immunoprecipitations in SCC9s that have been silenced with siRNA directed towards <italic>NEDD8</italic>, starved, and then stimulated with EGF. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, in spite of virtually complete loss of Nedd8, EGFR remains ubiquitinated, providing direct support that EGFR neddylation is not required for its ubiquitination in keratinocytes. Additionally, PLA analysis demonstrated that while PLA signals for the EGFR–Nedd8 pairing were negligible upon loss of Nedd8, ubiquitin remained robustly associated with EGFR. This result has been included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>. We have adjusted the text to include the new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, and subsection “EGFR neddylation is elevated in desmosome and Cops3 deficient cells”).</p><p>In addition to remaining ubiquitinated, EGFR stability was decreased in Nedd8 silenced cells following a cycloheximide chase (see essential revisions #2, below). Further, as shown in new figure panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, upon an acute EGF stimulus, EGFR exhibited a more rapid redistribution away from cell–cell interfaces as measured by loss of fluorescence intensity in Nedd8 knockdown keratinocytes, consistent with more rapid internalization in the absence of Nedd8. Collectively, these data provide direct evidence that in human keratinocytes, Nedd8 is not required for ubiquitination and turnover of activated EGFR, and that neddylation stabilizes the receptor.</p><p>These data are a departure from those reported by (Oved et al., 2006) in which it was concluded that EGFR neddylation and ubiquitination occur on competing lysines in CHO cells to drive turnover of the receptor. As described above, our data support the idea that EGFR neddylation stabilizes the receptor. Possible reasons for differences between the two studies include a) the use of different cell types and b) differences associated with analysis of the dynamics of ectopic EGFR (Oved et al., 2006) and endogenous EGFR (current work). The research performed by Oved et al., 2006, studied turnover of ectopically expressed EGFR in CHO cells, which do not endogenously express the receptor. In our manuscript we are studying dynamics of the endogenous EGFR in human primary keratinocytes and epithelial cell lines, in which EGFR activity and stability are subject to a complex regulatory network that assists to control the balance of proliferation and differentiation. While it is likely that some aspects of EGFR regulation are shared (for instance, our data show a reciprocal relationship between neddylation and ubiquitination, thus indirectly supporting the idea that these modifications may compete for the same lysines on EGFR in keratinocytes), mechanisms regulating the dynamics of EGFR modification and turnover are likely to exhibit biologically significant differences. Collectively, our data provide direct evidence that depleting the system of endogenous Nedd8 does not prevent ubiquitination of endogenous EGFR in keratinocytes, and that loss of Nedd8 destabilizes the receptor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What happens with EGFR stability and signaling when Nedd8 is depleted with specific siRNAs?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment we carried out a cycloheximide chase and quantified total EGFR over time in keratinocytes treated with siRNA directed towards <italic>NEDD8</italic> (siNEDD8) or a scramble oligo (siCONT). We found that upon silencing of <italic>NEDD8</italic> there is a significant decrease in EGFR levels over time (*p &lt; 0.02), further supporting our hypothesis that the neddylated state of the receptor is more stable. We have adjusted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to include the cycloheximide chase data and the quantification from three independent repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We have also adjusted the text to reflect this supporting evidence (subsection “EGFR neddylation is elevated in squamous cell cancers and its loss accelerates keratinocyte differentiation” and Discussion section).</p><p>Additionally, we investigated the signaling effects in NHEKS upon the loss of Nedd8. While the simple prediction of our model would be a decrease in EGFR activity, we did not detect reproducible reductions in EGFR phosphorylation or the activity of downstream effectors at a population level in differentiating cultures. The data is included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. A population analysis of primary keratinocytes, silenced for <italic>NEDD8</italic> (using a pool of oligos as well as four individual oligos) and differentiated for two days in 1.2mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> media, revealed the complexity of changes within these heterogeneous cultures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Through visualization of the differentiation marker, Dsg1, and Dapi–positive staining nuclei, we saw that overall there were more cells in the Nedd8 knock down cultures (*p&lt;0.05) and a significant population had initiated the differentiation program (*p&lt;0.05), which would be predicted to occur when EGFR activity is suppressed (bar graphs to right). However, due to the large number of cells in the cultures that were still undifferentiated, changes in differentiation markers on a population level assessed by western blot did not allow for appreciation that these cultures were robustly differentiating. It seems likely that feedback mechanisms stimulated in response to complete loss of Nedd8 may mask changes that occur at a local level such that on average there is no apparent change in signaling. The observed increase in differentiation is shown below for the reviewers’ information, but not included in the paper as while multiple Nedd8 oligo targets were used, the experiment was only performed once.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22599-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The siCOPS3 should be rescued with an siRNA resistant COPS3 cDNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewers concern related to off target effects. We took a multi–level approach to addressing this question. The first was to generate several silencing resistant constructs (two tagged and one untagged). Expression of these constructs appeared to further reduce differentiation rather than rescue the defect, but did so even in the context of siCONT, raising the possibility that the expressed protein (which is part of a 8 subunit complex) was exerting a dominant negative effect. In this regard, we noted from the literature a number of instances in which Cops3 was knocked down with either lentivirus or siRNA, and none of those sources reported overexpressing a silencing resistant version of Cops3 as a means to rescue (Banda et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2009; Pang et al., 2017; Peth et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2012). Along these lines, a recent systematic analysis comparing multiple strategies for reconstituting protein expression in RNAi experiments, demonstrated that while off target effects could be convincingly ruled out using RNAi to 11 different targets of mitochondrial creatine kinase 1, it is not always possible to rescue cells by reconstitution of protein expression (Datler and Grimm, 2013). Therefore, as an alternative means of ruling out off target effects, we used multiple oligos directed against different target sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>) to ensure that the observed differentiation and signaling changes were specific to the knockdown of Cops3 and not an off target effect of the siRNA. These data have been included in the text in the Results section and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22599-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors perform several PLA assays to illustrate direct protein interactions in vivo. Unfortunately, PLA assays are prone to give false positive results and the data would be more convincing if another junctions protein that does not physically interact with Dsg1/DP was used as a negative control for the experiment. Along these lines, the signal distribution in the SIM and PLA experiments appear different. It would help if the authors could provide phase contrast or junctions marker staining to better illustrate cell–cell adhesion in the PLA data.</p></disp-quote><p>To provide additional controls for the PLA experiments, in addition to knockdown of individual components already included in the manuscript (Dsg1, Dp and Cops3) we paired Cops3 antibodies with antibodies against the adherens junction transmembrane protein E–cadherin (E–cad) and the cytoplasmic adherens junction component, Α–catenin (A–cat). As a positive control, Β–catenin (B–cat) was paired with both E–cad and A–cat antibodies. These experiments clearly show that while Cops3 interacts with desmosomal molecules Dsg1 and Dp, it does not interact with adherens junction components. In addition, we used the cell–cell junction protein Plakoglobin, Pg, as a fluorescence marker for cell–cell junctions to determine the extent to which PLA signals co–localize with cell–cell interfaces. These data show that while not all desmosome–Cops3 interactions are in close proximity to the Pg signal, a large percentage of PLA dots do appear to be localized at cell–cell interfaces (~60% for Dsg1/Cops3; ~67% for Dp/Cops3), although to a somewhat lesser extent than the positive control PLA pairings Α–Catenin/Β–Catenin (~82%) and Ecad/Β–catenin (~88%). These results are now included in the text in the Results section and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that cytoplasmic Cops3 interacts with desmosome molecules in non–membrane and membrane associated cytoplasmic particles and vesicles that we have previously identified in these cells (Harmon et al., 2013; Nekrasova et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2014), in addition to their localization at the cell surface.</p></body></sub-article></article>
