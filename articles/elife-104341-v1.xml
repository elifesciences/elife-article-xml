Upon reviewing the figure, we have confirmed that in the left panel of Alkaline Phosphatase staining, the bottom right image in the irisin (ISN) group is the same sample as the top left control (CTL) image. Noting differences in lighting, we consulted the raw images and confirmed that this unintentional duplication occurred when the control sample well was mistakenly imaged twice from different orientations and then included as the third irisin sample. The correct image of this irisin sample has been included in the updated figure below, and the raw image files provided to the editor. No changes to the text or legend associated with this figure were necessary, and the authors note that the interpretations and statements made in the paper both regarding this figure and in general remain unchanged.</p><p>The corrected Figure 1—figure supplement 1 is shown here:</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-104341-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The originally published Figure 1—figure supplement 1 is shown for reference:</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-104341-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The authors would like to further update the Data availability statement to reflect the updated status of RNAseq data made available on the Dryad repository.</p><p>Corrected text:</p><p>Data availability statement: All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript figures and Source data 1, with the RNAseq dataset uploaded to the Dryad Digital Repository under “Eben Estell, Phuong T Le, Yosta Vegting, Hyeonwoo Kim, Christiane Wrann, Mary L Bouxsein, Kenichi Nagano, Roland Baron, Bruce M Spiegelman, Clifford Rosen (2020).
