regulatory networks (GRNs) that integrate the activity of signaling effectors and transcription factors (TFs) on enhancers. Sox17 is a key transcriptional regulator of definitive endoderm development, and yet, its genomic targets remain largely uncharacterized. Here, using genomic approaches and epistasis experiments, we define the Sox17-governed endoderm GRN in <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrulae. We show that Sox17 functionally interacts with the canonical Wnt pathway to specify and pattern the endoderm while repressing alternative mesectoderm fates. Sox17 and β-catenin co-occupy hundreds of key enhancers. In some cases, Sox17 and β-catenin synergistically activate transcription apparently independent of Tcfs, whereas on other enhancers, Sox17 represses β-catenin/Tcf-mediated transcription to spatially restrict gene expression domains. Our findings establish Sox17 as a tissue-specific modifier of Wnt responses and point to a novel paradigm where genomic specificity of Wnt/β-catenin transcription is determined through functional interactions between lineage-specific Sox TFs and β-catenin/Tcf transcriptional complexes. Given the ubiquitous nature of Sox TFs and Wnt signaling, this mechanism has important implications across a diverse range of developmental and disease contexts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>sox17</kwd><kwd>beta-catenin</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>endoderm</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD073179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Ken WY</given-names></name><name><surname>Zorn</surname><given-names>Aaron M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30DK078392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zorn</surname><given-names>Aaron M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01HD093363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zorn</surname><given-names>Aaron M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genomic analysis of <italic>Xenopus gastrula</italic> reveal that the transcription factor Sox17 interacts with the Wnt signaling effector ß-catenin on enhancers to regulate the transcriptional program underlying endoderm germ layer formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During embryogenesis, the pluripotent zygote progressively gives rise to specialized cell types expressing distinct sets of genes that, in turn, define the cell’s identity and encode proteins necessary for its function. Lineage-specific gene expression is controlled by the genomic integration of signaling pathways and transcription factors (TFs) on DNA cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), such as enhancers, that control transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stevens et al., 2017</xref>). An important goal of developmental biology is to elucidate how signaling effectors and TFs interact on distinct sets of CRMs within the chromatin landscape to form gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that activate lineage-specific transcriptional programs whilst repressing expression of alternative fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charney et al., 2017b</xref>). This will provide a deeper understanding of how transcriptional networks are established, dysregulated in disease, and how GRNs might be manipulated for therapeutic purposes.</p><p>We have addressed this in the context of endoderm germ layer specification: one of the earliest cell fate decisions in vertebrate development that provides a relatively simple model to elucidate how GRNs control lineage-specific transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charney et al., 2017b</xref>). In embryos and pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), Nodal/Smad2 and Wnt/ß-catenin (Ctnnb1; hereafter Bcat) signaling cooperate to initiate the mesendoderm program and subsequent development of definitive endoderm progenitors, which gives rise to the epithelia of the digestive and respiratory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sumi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zorn and Wells, 2009</xref>). Downstream of Nodal and Wnt, a core set of endoderm TFs: Sox17, Gata4-6, Eomes, Foxa1/2 and Mix family of homeodomain TFs execute the endoderm GRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charney et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinner et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> where endoderm specification is well studied, the Nodal and Wnt pathways interact at several levels. First, maternal (m) Wnt/Bcat, active on the dorsal side of the blastula, is required for high levels of <italic>nodal</italic> expression at the onset of zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hyde and Old, 2000</xref>). Then Nodal and mWnt cooperate to promote the expression of endoderm TFs Sox17, Foxa2 and many dorsal mesendoderm organizer genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xanthos et al., 2002</xref>). A few hours later, zygotic (z) <italic>wnt8</italic> (a Nodal target) is expressed on the ventral side of the gastrula where, together with Nodal signaling, it promotes ventral and posterior mesendoderm identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charney et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stevens et al., 2017</xref>). In mammals, early Wnt/Bcat similarly activates expression of Nodal and core endoderm TFs, with prolonged Wnt promoting posterior hindgut fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zorn and Wells, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Functional interactions between the core endoderm TFs and the Wnt pathway are thought to (1) segregate the transient mesendoderm into endoderm and mesoderm, (2) pattern the nascent endoderm into spatially distinct subtypes and (3) execute the downstream differentiation program to give rise to endoderm-derived lineages. But mechanistically how the Wnt signaling machinery interacts with core endoderm TFs to execute this differentiation cascade is unresolved. The transcriptional targets of the endoderm TFs are largely unknown, and it is unclear exactly how Wnt/Bcat regulates distinct spatiotemporal transcription programs in the embryo. Indeed, how the canonical Wnt pathway elicits context-specific transcriptional responses in its multitude of different biological roles in development, homeostasis and cancer is still poorly understood. According to the dogma of canonical Wnt signaling, Wnt-activated Fzd-Lrp5/6 receptor complexes sequester the Bcat degradation complex, resulting in the stabilization and translocation of Bcat to the nucleus. There, it interacts with one of four HMG-box Tcf TFs (Tcf7, Tcf7L1, Tcf7L2 and Lef1) at Wnt-responsive CRMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuijers et al., 2014</xref>), ultimately activating a multiprotein ‘Wnt-enhanceosome’ with the scaffold proteins Bcl9, Pygopus and the ChiLS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gammons and Bienz, 2018</xref>). In the absence of Bcat, Tcfs are coupled with corepressor proteins Tle/Groucho and histone deacetylase Hdac to inhibit transcription of Wnt target genes. Bcat displaces Tle and recruits a co-activator complex including histone acetyltransferases Ep300 or CBP to stimulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012</xref>). How distinct context-specific Wnt target genes are selected is unclear since all Tcfs have nearly identical DNA-binding specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ramakrishnan and Cadigan, 2017</xref>) and for the most part they are ubiquitously expressed. An emerging idea is that the Wnt-enhanceosome also interacts with other lineage-specific TFs to integrate lineage-specific inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gammons and Bienz, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trompouki et al., 2011</xref>); yet, how these impact genomic specificity in vivo is largely untested and the idea of Tcf-independent Wnt-mediated transcription remains controversial.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the possibility that Sox17 functionally interacts with Wnt/Bcat to regulate transcription in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> endodermal GRN. In all vertebrate embryos, Sox17 is specifically expressed in the gastrula endoderm where it is required for early gut development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clements et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hudson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanai-Azuma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Viotti et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the critical role of Sox17 in endoderm development, only few of its direct transcriptional targets have been identified (e.g.: <italic>hnf1b</italic>, <italic>foxa1</italic> and <italic>dhh</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sinner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yagi et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, ectopic Sox17 is sufficient to initiate endoderm development in pluripotent blastula animal cap cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clements et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hudson et al., 1997</xref>), and co-injection of stabilized Bcat can enhance this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sinner et al., 2004</xref>). Sox17 can physically interact with Bcat in vitro and suppress the transcriptional activity of generic Tcf/Bcat reporter constructs (TOPflash) in tissue culture experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zorn et al., 1999</xref>). However, the biological relevance of these interactions and whether Sox17 and Bcat functionally interact on chromatin to regulate the endoderm GRN remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we define the genomic targets of Sox17 in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrula. In addition to promoting expression of endoderm genes, Sox17 also represses ectoderm and mesoderm gene transcription, and acts in a negative feedback loop to restrain Nodal signaling. We demonstrate that functional interactions with canonical Wnt signaling is a key feature of the Sox17-regulated GRN. Over a third of all Bcat and Sox17 genomic binding in the gastrula occur at the same CRMs. In some instances, Sox17 suppresses Bcat-Tcf mediated transcription, while in other cases, Sox17 and Bcat synergistically activates enhancers apparently independently of Tcfs, indicating a novel mode of regulation. These results provide new insight into the GRN controlling endoderm development and have implications for how Sox TFs and Bcat might interact in diverse biological contexts from development to cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sox17 regulates a genomic program controlling germ layer segregation and endoderm development</title><p>To identify the transcriptional program regulated by Sox17, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) on control and Sox17-depleted <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> embryos at multiple time points during blastula and gastrula stages (NF9-12) when the endoderm germ layer is being specified.

Differentially expressed genes include 73 TFs, including known Sox17 targets <italic>foxa2</italic> and <italic>hnf1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sinner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinner et al., 2006</xref>), and paracrine signaling components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) such as the Hedgehog pathway (<italic>dhh</italic>, <italic>hhip</italic>, <italic>gli1</italic>); a key epithelial signal in gut organogenesis. This confirms that Sox17 sits atop of the regulatory hierarchy regulating endoderm differentiation.</p><p>We next investigated how Sox17-regulated genes were spatially expressed, leveraging a previously published RNA-seq of different tissues dissected from gastrula embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blitz et al., 2017</xref>). As predicted, a majority of Sox17-dependent genes were enriched in the vegetal endoderm and dorsal mesendoderm (organizer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) including <italic>osr1, hnf1b, dhh</italic> and <italic>slc5a8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, over 30% of the genes upregulated early (NF9-10) in the Sox17-depleted embryos were normally enriched in the ectoderm or mesoderm tissue; examples include ectoderm-promoting TFs <italic>tfap2a</italic> and <italic>lhx5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Houston and Wylie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>) as well as the mesoderm TFs <italic>foxf1</italic>, <italic>tbx20</italic> and <italic>hlx</italic>. This suggests that Sox17 plays an important role in repressing ectoderm and mesoderm fate in vegetal endoderm cells. Unexpectedly Sox17 also negatively regulated ~150 genes that are normally enriched in the vegetal endoderm and dorsal mesendoderm. Some of these vegetally enriched genes encoded components of the endoderm promoting Nodal pathway including <italic>nodal1, nodal6, gdf3, gdf6, foxh1, mix1</italic> and <italic>bix1.1</italic>, all of which were upregulated in Sox17-depleted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, even <italic>sox17</italic> transcripts were modestly increased in Sox17-MO embryos even though previous work has demonstrated that Sox17 directly maintains its own transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howard et al., 2007</xref>) after initial induction by Nodal/Smad2. These data indicate that Sox17 acts as a negative feedback inhibitor that restricts excessive endoderm development by restraining Nodal activity after initial induction.</p><p>The observation that over 10% of Sox17-regulated genes are enriched in the organizer mesendoderm while Sox17 is present throughout the endoderm, suggests that Sox17 might also functionally interact with the Wnt and/or Bmp dorso-ventral patterning pathways to control spatial expression. Intriguingly, we found that Sox17 regulates the expression of several Wnt/Bcat pathway components and targets including: <italic>dkk1, dkk2, fzd5, nodal3.1, pygo1, sia1, ror1</italic>, <italic>rsop2</italic> and <italic>wnt11</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Together these data suggest that Sox17 regulates both endoderm specification and patterning while suppressing mesectoderm fate and that Sox17 participates in feedback loops with the Wnt and Nodal pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sox17 ChIP-Seq reveals direct endodermal targets and a Nodal and Wnt feedback</title><p>To identify direct Sox17 targets we generated and validated anti-Sox17 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) and performed Sox17 ChIP-seq in gastrula (NF10.5) embryos, identifying 8436 statistically significant Sox17-bound putative CRMs (IDR; p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

To test whether Sox17 and Bcat bound the same enhancers in the same cells we performed ChIP-reChIP experiments. First anti-Bcat ChIP was performed on 500 gastrulae. DNA eluted from the first ChIP was then re-precipitated with either anti-Sox17 or a negative control IgG antibody.

The observation that Bcat positively regulated most of these genes (59/84, 70%) was consistent with its known role in transcriptional activation. Sox17 positively regulated 60% of targets and repressed 40% of targets, suggesting context-dependent activity. For further analysis, we focused on the two major regulatory groups; genes/enhancers activated by both Sox17/Bcat and those activated by Bcat but repressed by Sox17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sox17 and β-catenin coordinate spatial expression domains in the embryo</title><p>It was possible that the overlap in Sox17- and Bcat-regulated genes was largely due to the Sox17-Wnt feedback loop where Bcat is required for robust <italic>sox17</italic> expression and Sox17, in turn, regulates the expression of Wnt-pathway components.

We show that in addition to acting atop a transcriptional hierarchy promoting endoderm differentiation, Sox17 has previously unappreciated roles in endoderm patterning and germ layer segregation. We demonstrate that functional interactions with the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is a major feature of the Sox17-regulated GRN. Over a third of all Bcat and Sox17 genomic binding events in the gastrula occur at the same enhancers, where they coordinately regulate spatial gene expression in the embryo. Our data suggest that Sox17 and Bcat synergistically activate a subset of endodermal enhancers apparently independent of Tcfs, whereas at other enhancers Sox17-regulated Bcat-Tcf mediated transcriptional activation (either activating or inhibiting). Together these results provide novel insights into the establishment of the endoderm GRN and suggest a new paradigm where Sox17 acts as a tissue-specific modifier of Wnt-signaling responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The Sox17-Bcat-regulated endodermal GRN</title><p>Our genomic study revealed an extensive overlap between Sox17- and Bcat-regulated genes. Together with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charney et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zorn and Wells, 2009</xref>), this suggests that Sox17 and the other core endoderm TFs interact with Wnt and Nodal in a series of positive and negative feedback loops to control germ layer segregation and modulate spatial gene expression. Temporally mesendoderm development is initiated by maternal VegT and Bcat, which together initiate Nodal signaling. We showed that in addition to its known role in activating transcription of endoderm-inducing <italic>nodal</italic> ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blythe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hyde and Old, 2000</xref>), Bcat directly promotes the expression of many endodermal genes including most of the core endoderm TFs; <italic>sox17, eomes, foxa, gata4/5, mix1</italic> and <italic>mixer</italic>. Sox17 appears to function after initial Nodal signaling in the mid-gastrula stage by promoting expression of endoderm GRN components such as <italic>foxa1</italic> and <italic>gata4,</italic> whilst negatively regulating the expression of some <italic>nodal</italic> and <italic>mix</italic>/<italic>bix</italic> genes. Thus on one hand, Sox17 promotes endodermal fate, and on the other, it restrains excessive Nodal activity. There is precedence for Sox factors influencing <italic>nodal</italic> ligand transcription. Maternal Sox3, localized in the blastula ectoderm, directly binds the <italic>nodal5/6</italic> enhancers to repress Bcat-stimulated transcription, whereas vegetally localized maternal Sox7 enhances <italic>nodal5/6</italic> expression in the vegetal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang and Klymkowsky, 2007</xref>). This suggests a potential of a dynamic handoff model where different Sox TFs might co-occupy the same enhancers with Bcat in different cells to activate or repress transcription in a context-dependent manner. In this model, we predict that in the early blastula Bcat-bound enhancers might be co-occupied by Sox3, Sox7 and/or Tcfs and it is not until the mid-gastrula that co-occupancy of Sox17 and Bcat would be observed.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that Sox17-Bcat interactions regulate spatial gene expression in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

In addition, Sox17 also has a key role in repressing alternative lineages in the vegetal cells, similar to the maternal TFs Foxh1, Vegt and Otx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paraiso et al., 2019</xref>). For example, Sox17 represses Bcat/Tcf-stimulated expression of the ectoderm specifying TF <italic>lhx5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Houston and Wylie, 2003</xref>). Sox17-Bcat interactions also impact spatial expression within the endoderm. Sox17 inhibits the Bcat-Tcf stimulation of the <italic>dkk1</italic> enhancer in the deep endoderm, but in the dorsal mesendoderm where Bcat activity is higher, Sox17 appears insufficient to suppress <italic>dkk1</italic>. The finding that <italic>six1</italic> and <italic>dkk1</italic> are under opposite regulation by Sox17 and Bcat despite having very similar expression patterns warrants future analysis of the temporal-spatial dynamics in Bcat, Tcf and Sox17 genomic occupancy in dorsal vs ventral cells over time.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DNA binding specificity of SOX TFs</title><p>An important consideration is how Sox17 selects specific target enhancers. In DNA-binding experiments, all Sox TFs bind to variants of the DNA sequence 5’-(A/T)(A/T)CAA(A/T)3’, which is similar but distinct from Tcf DNA-binding sites 5’-T(A/T)(A/T)CAAG 3’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">She and Yang, 2015</xref>). SOX TFs can act either as monomers or heterodimers with different cell-type specific cofactors, which in turn impact their DNA-binding affinity and ability to activate or repress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard and Harley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hou et al., 2017</xref>). For example, in PSCs, Oct4-Sox2 heterodimers promote pluripotency and bind to distinct sites than those bound by Oct4-Sox17 complexes that initiate mesendoderm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aksoy et al., 2013</xref>). It is, therefore, likely, that Sox17 and Bcat cooperate with other TFs to provide lineage specificity to Wnt-responsive transcription during germ layer segregation. Indeed, motif analysis and comparison to other ChIP-seq datasets revealed that Sox17-bound loci were also enriched for Tbx, Gata, Fox and homeodomain motifs suggesting that in addition to regulating each other’s expression, the core endoderm TFs act together in combinatorial manner, perhaps to establish endodermal super enhancers crucial for downstream lineage specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paraiso et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, enhancers that were negatively regulated by Sox17 were enriched for Tbx and Oct motifs whereas enhancers activated by Sox17 were enriched for homeodomain motifs. This suggests that Sox17 interactions with distinct lineage-specific TFs might modulate context-specific transcriptional responses. This is a particularly attractive hypothesis since as monomers Sox TFs bind DNA with low affinity and they are thought to gain DNA-binding specificity by interacting with other TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hou et al., 2017</xref>). In the future, it will be important to identify and integrate the genomic targets of all the core endoderm-specifying TFs and examine how combinatorial enhancer binding is integrated into a unified endodermal GRN.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sox-Bcat-Tcf interactions on chromatin</title><p>Many Sox proteins, including Sox17, can bind to recombinant Bcat and Tcfs in vitro and modulate Wnt/Bcat-stimulated transcription of synthetic reporters assays with multimerized Tcf-sites (pTOPFlash) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zorn et al., 1999</xref>). While a number of models have been proposed to explain how Sox factors might impact Bcat activity, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kormish et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">She and Yang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tan et al., 2019</xref>), in most cases the in vivo biological relevance of these interactions was unclear. Although the resolution of ChIP-reChIP assays only allow us to demonstrate that Sox17 and Bcat bind chromatin within 150 bp of each other, taken together with published in vitro data, our results suggest that Sox-Bcat or Sox-Bcat-Tcf transcriptional complexes can be assembled on enhancers in vivo.</p><p>At enhancers like <italic>six1, igf3</italic> and +7 kb <italic>osr1,</italic> where Sox17 and Bcat synergistically stimulate transcription, we postulate that Sox17 and Bcat recruit Ep300/Cbp to chromatin, analogous to Tcf-Bcat in canonical Wnt-signaling. Consistent with this, structure-function studies have found that a conserved 10 amino-acid domain (VDXXEFEQYL) in the Sox17 C-terminus is required for both Bcat-binding and transcriptional transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sinner et al., 2004</xref>). On the other hand, most Bcat and Sox17 co-occupied enhancers contain multiple Sox and Tcf sites clustered within 50 bp, suggesting that Sox17 and Tcf, together with Bcat and scaffolding proteins like Bcl9, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gammons and Bienz, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Masuda and Ishitani, 2017</xref>) might assemble higher-order multiprotein complexes facilitating Wnt-mediated transcription. Both Soxs and Tcfs are HMG-domain containing TFs, capable of binding to the minor groove of DNA and inducing DNA bending. This could further indicate that they are brought into close spatial proximity to establish the assembly of functional enhanceosomes, despite the distance between their binding sites on linear DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard and Harley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The possibility of Sox-Bcat-Tcf ternary complexes raises the question of competitive vs cooperative DNA binding that, in turn, could influence transcriptional repression versus activation. For example, Sox17 might stabilize the formation of Bcat-Tcf-Ep300 complexes or destabilize the binding of co-repressors such as Tle and Hdac to promote transcription (e.g. <italic>osr1</italic>). To negatively regulate Bcat-Tcf activity (e.g.<italic> dkk1</italic>) Sox17 might destabilize Bcat-Tcf-Ep300-DNA or stabilize Tcf-Tle complexes. This idea is supported by work in mouse cortical neuron progenitors where Sox2 binds within 4–10 bp of Tcf/Lef sites and recruits Tle/Gro corepressors to repress Tcf/Bcatmediated <italic>Ccnd1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagey and Muhr, 2014</xref>). Future biochemical studies will need to determine if and how Sox-Bcat-Tcf complexes assemble on DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Broader implications</title><p>Although a growing number of non-Tcf Bcat-binding TFs have been reported, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gammons and Bienz, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Notani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trompouki et al., 2011</xref>), how these impact the genomic specificity of Wnt-responsive transcription has not been well characterized and the idea of Tcf-independent Wnt transcription remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doumpas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuijers et al., 2014</xref>). Our data suggest that in the gastrula endoderm, Sox17 might influence Bcat recruitment to chromatin to control cell-type-specific Wnt-responsive transcription, and that in some cases, this occurs independent of Tcfs. Given that there are 20 Sox TFs encoded in the vertebrate genome with most cell types expressing at least one, it is possible that Sox factors are widespread and previously unappreciated accessory effectors of Bcat that finetune Wnt-regulated transcription across many biological contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo manipulations</title><p><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> were purchased from Nasco or the <italic>National Xenopus Resource</italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013731">SCR_013731</ext-link>) and experiments were performed according to CCHMC IACUC approved protocols.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Edward Morrisey as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below, that additional experiments may be required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper by Mukherjee et al. addresses functional interactions of Sox17 and Wnt signaling in endodermal gene regulation. The results reveal that Sox17 factors act as endoderm-specific modifiers of Wnt-signaling responses, providing strong evidence for a TCF independent role for β-catenin/Sox17 in promoting endodermal and suppressing mesodermal/ectodermal gene expression. The reviewers felt that this interesting study addresses important questions and is well-executed, but that there are instances where the conclusions seem overgeneralized, and that some additional analysis is needed before the article would be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Interpreting the Sox17 and β-catenin knock down results requires assessment of the efficiency knock downs – is occupancy at high affinity sites being decreased or only low affinity? Ideally this would be shown by ChIP following knockdown.</p><p>2) The generalized finding that &quot;Sox17 and β-catenin co-occupy a subset of enhancers to synergistically stimulate transcription in the absence of Tcfs&quot; is not fully supported by the data presented. Although a subset of enhancers lack predicted Tcf binding motifs, functional data is shown only for <italic>six1</italic>, and only by gain-of function experiments. Data showing that other enhancers behave like <italic>six1</italic>, and possibly also using a Tcf7l1-EnR fusion, are needed to support this conclusion. Absent such data, conclusions should relate only to Six1 regulation.</p><p>3) Please add discussion of the dynamics of Sox17 binding/function. Could this explain differences with reported enrichment in other studies such as Nakamura et al. and Kjolby et al.? Those differences should be discussed.</p><p>4) It might be useful to extend the analysis to look at collaborating transcription factors (e.g. Tbx, Pou, etc) by cross-referencing with published data sets (for example such as Gentsch et al.).</p><p>5) In the first section of the Results, the text should reflect the possibility that some of the observed transcriptional effects after Sox17 knockdown are caused by indirect mechanisms. Also, please avoid using the non-specific term &quot;regulates&quot;, and instead use &quot;inhibits/increases&quot;.</p><p>6) Motif frequencies in peaks cannot be compared directly between motifs or different versions of the motifs, as seems to have been done in Figure 4—figure supplement 2A because the baseline for motif occurrence (in random genomic sequences) is highly motif-specific.</p><p>7) Please indicate the application of multiple testing correction (adjusted p-value, or FDR) where applicable (Materials and methods, Results; GO analysis). Also indicate p-values for all enrichments and intersections (Figures 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 2D, Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, Figure 4A).</p><p>8) Including a summary of the temporal role of Sox17 in context of other signals and transcription factors, including Nodal/Smad2, BMP, VegT would be useful.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Sox17 and β-catenin co-occupy Wnt-responsive enhancers to govern the endoderm gene regulatory network&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Edward Morrisey (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved but there is one remaining issue that should be addressed before acceptance. This concerns the motif analysis in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. Examining background frequencies via scrambling of peak sequences while maintaining di-nucleotide frequencies has strengthened this analysis. However, ranking the motifs by hypergeometric p-value (provided by HOMER) is perhaps not most informative way to represent these data. We suggest instead plotting the 2log fold enrichment over background, in combination with a statistical test (effect size and statistical rigor). Also, it is felt that a discussion of background frequencies is needed where the co-occurring motifs are discussed and Figure 4—figure supplement 2D should be revised by calculating for background sequences.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58029.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Interpreting the Sox17 and β-catenin knock down results requires assessment of the efficiency knock downs – is occupancy at high affinity sites being decreased or only low affinity? Ideally this would be shown by ChIP following knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important point. We have now performed ChIP-qPCR experiments on control, Sox17-MO and β-catenin-MO embryos as requested. The new data added to Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-E shows a dramatic loss of ChIP-qPCR signal at all loci tested, down to negative control background levels in most cases. This data supports our immunostaining (Figure 1A-C, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A) showing a complete loss of nuclear Sox17 and β-catenin in knockdown embryos. Together from all the data we estimate that the knockdown efficiency is greater than 90%.</p><p>The issue of high-affinity versus low-affinity site is very interesting and we understand the reviewers point that, with a partial knockdown, high-affinity enhancers might still be active. Since our knockdown is very efficient, we don't expect this will play much of a role, but we cannot totally rule it out. This is difficult to test since in vivo high-affinity and low-affinity sites for Sox17 (or Tcfs) have not yet been characterized in gastrula embryos. In an attempt to identify high-affinity vs. low-affinity Sox17 binding sites, we analyzed published protein binding microarray data from the CIS-BP database where recombinant DNA-binding domains of hundreds of TFs were challenged to all possible combinations of DNA 8-mers (Badis et al., 2009; Lambert et al., 2019). Per the original criteria set out by Badis et al., we classified 8-mer sequences that had an enrichment (E)-score &gt; 0.45 for Sox17 binding as “high affinity” sequences and those with an E-score &lt; 0.2 as “low affinity” sequences. To assess if any of these sequences were present in our in vivo ChIP-seq data, we scanned Sox17 bound peaks for the presence of potential Sox binding sites. We then selected candidate enhancers for ChIP-qPCR in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D to include some that were predicted to contain only high-affinity Sox-sites (<italic>foxi2</italic> and <italic>snai2)</italic> or low-affinity Sox17 sites (<italic>nrp1</italic> and <italic>lmbx1).</italic> ChIP-qPCR shows that Sox17 occupancy dramatically decreased by several orders of magnitude at all four enhancers, after Sox17-MO knockdown. However, there was still some signal above background at <italic>foxi2</italic>. We prefer to not make any conclusions about this result, because these experiments lack the rigorous quantitative measurement of DNA-binding affinity needed for such claims, and this is not really the point of the current study. In the future we plan to systematically examine the impact of DNA-affinity which is complicated because Sox monomers bind to DNA with low sequence specificity and low affinity and are thought to gain specificity by other interaction with co-occupying transcription factors (Lefebvre et al., 2007; Hou et al., 2017). We have added this point to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The generalized finding that &quot;Sox17 and β-catenin co-occupy a subset of enhancers to synergistically stimulate transcription in the absence of Tcfs&quot; is not fully supported by the data presented. Although a subset of enhancers lack predicted Tcf binding motifs, functional data is shown only for six1, and only by gain-of function experiments. Data showing that other enhancers behave like six1, and possibly also using a Tcf7l1-EnR fusion, are needed to support this conclusion. Absent such data, conclusions should relate only to Six1 regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now extended our analysis to include two additional enhancers: 1) a +7kb <italic>osr1</italic> and 2) +3kb <italic>igf3</italic> enhancer that shared similar characteristics to <italic>six1;</italic> (they’re expressed in the endoderm, activated by Sox17 and β-catenin and have no evidence of TCF binding sites). The new Figure 6—figure supplement 1 shows that Sox17 and β-catenin cooperatively activate both enhancers, but neither was activated by Tcf7l1-VP16 (similar to <italic>six1</italic> but unlike the <italic>dkk1</italic> and <italic>lhx5</italic> enhancers which contain Tcf-sites and are activated by Tcf7l1-VP16). These new data further support our conclusion that “Sox17 and b-catenin co-occupy a subset of enhancers to synergistically stimulate transcription <italic>independently</italic> of Tcfs”. We have not tried the Tcf7l1-EnR fusion. This reagent is problematic as it is well known to dominantly block all maternal Wnt/β-catenin-targets including <italic>nodal</italic>. Thus the embryos arrest without ever initiating endoderm fate or <italic>sox17</italic> expression, precluding the analysis. Acknowledging that we don’t have a Tcf loss of function, we have now tempered our conclusions to say “apparently independent of Tcfs” in the Abstract and throughout the paper. We also point out in the paper that the majority of Sox17-β-catenin cobound enhancers do have Tcf sites (even those that are activated). In the future we plan to fully characterize the role of Tcfs at these enhancers. We emphasize the enhancers without detectable Tcf-regulation since this is the most novel aspect of the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please add discussion of the dynamics of Sox17 binding/function. Could this explain differences with reported enrichment in other studies such as Nakamura et al. and Kjolby et al.? Those differences should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added a section in the Discussion on the temporal dynamics of Sox17 binding/function. Moreover, we have added a new panel to Figure 3—figure supplement 2 comparing our motif enrichment analysis to that of Kjolby et al., 2017 and Gentsch et al., 2019. We should point out that we use the published β-catenin ChIP-seq data reported in Nakamura et al., 2016 (stage 10.5 <italic>Xenopustropicalis</italic> ChIP-seq of endogenous β-catenin). Although our processing pipeline is a little bit different than theirs, like them we find &gt;11,000 IDR peaks and our motif analysis shows Sox (2<sup>nd</sup> ranked) being more enriched than Tcfs (5<sup>th</sup> ranked). This is almost exactly what Nakamura et. al reported. Using the same pipeline and motif analysis of β-catenin bound peaks of the Gentsch et al., 2019 dataset (β-catenin ChIP-seq at stage 10+), we find a similar ranking of Sox (3<sup>rd</sup> ranked) and Tcf (6<sup>th</sup> ranked) motifs. In the case of Kjolby et al., they performed ChIP-seq on slightly later stage NF11.5 <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> using an overexpressed 3xFlag-tagged β-catenin reporting only 855 reproducible peaks. HOMER de novo motif analysis of the Kjolby data shows Lef1 as the 1<sup>st</sup> top motif and Sox as the 3<sup>rd</sup> ranked (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). So essentially there is not much difference in the motif analysis reported in these different studies. In both cases, Sox and Tcf motifs are among the top 5 enriched in β-catenin bound peaks, these other studies just did not follow up on the high rank of Sox motifs. The minor differences in motif calling between papers could be due to many things: the number of peaks in the analysis; &gt;10,000 peaks vs. 855 peaks, developmental timing; 10 vs. 11.5, species; <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> vs. <italic>X. laevis,</italic> overexpression vs. endogenous, antibody; β-catenin vs. Flag or different lab ChIP protocols. Since we have no way of knowing the source of variation, we prefer not to speculate in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It might be useful to extend the analysis to look at collaborating transcription factors (e.g. Tbx, Pou, etc) by cross-referencing with published data sets (for example such as Gentsch et al.).</p></disp-quote><p>Per the reviewers’ suggestion, we extended our analysis to all other publicly available datasets of endodermal TFs (Charney et. al, 2017, Paraiso et al., 2019, Gentsch et. al, 2019). This new analysis presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, shows that Sox17 and β-catenin co-occupied peaks were indeed enriched for binding of other endodermal TFs including Foxa4, Smad1, Smad2, Sox3 and VegT. We have described this in the Results and Discussion sections explaining how it is likely that combinatorial activity of multiple lineage-specific TFs may cooperate with Sox17/β-catenin on super enhancers to regulate the endoderm GRN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the first section of the Results, the text should reflect the possibility that some of the observed transcriptional effects after Sox17 knockdown are caused by indirect mechanisms. Also, please avoid using the non-specific term &quot;regulates&quot;, and instead use &quot;inhibits/increases&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have now updated the text as requested and explicitly indicated that changes in transcript level after Sox17-depletion could be indirect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Motif frequencies in peaks cannot be compared directly between motifs or different versions of the motifs, as seems to have been done in Figure 4—figure supplement 2A because the baseline for motif occurrence (in random genomic sequences) is highly motif-specific.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this to our attention. We agree that since the occurrence of different motifs or version of motifs in random genomic sequences is variable, making comparisons not really possible. In the revisions, we have modified our analysis to not directly compare between Sox and Tcf motif frequencies, but to ask whether the frequency of Sox or Tcf motifs in a given group or peaks is significant over random. In addition we used a library of all predicted Sox or Tcf motifs rather than a specific motif.</p><p>To assesses motif frequency in different categories of peaks we used a library of all known Sox and Tcf motifs combining HOMER and an exhaustive search of the CIS-BP database containing all experimentally defined sites from protein-DNA binding microarrays (Badis et al., 2009; Lambert et al., 2019). Combining these (all HOMER instance were also in CIS-BP) we generated a library of position weight matrices (PWMs) of all potential Sox17, Tcf7l1, Tcf7l2, Tcf7, Lef1 motifs and scanned peak scoring the number of PWMs present above a 70% threshold. A list of all the motifs from the CIS-BP database that we’ve included in our analysis is show in Author response table 1. We had not explained this properly in the original version of the paper and have now updated the Materials and methods.</p><p>Author response table 1</p><p>Then for each wild-type test peak we generated a random “shuffled” version where the wild-type peak sequences were randomly scrambled ten times maintaining dinucleotide frequencies. These represented random genomic sequences with the same GC content as the test case. For each iteration, we determine the frequency of the Sox and Tcf motifs in the “wild-type” and “shuffled” peaks. We then perform enrichment analysis using Fisher’s exact test to determine whether the frequency of Sox or Tcf motifs in a given group of “wild-type” peaks was enriched over the random “shuffled” sequences. Our results reveal Sox17 motifs are more frequently enriched in Sox17 bound and Sox17/β-catenin bound peaks over random, while Tcf motifs are not enriched over random in any of the categories of sequences. We now incorporate this new analysis in the revised results and new Figure 4—figure supplement 2. In the future we will explore the biological impact of number and frequency of motifs in enhancers, but for the current paper this is a very minor observation, from which we do not make any major conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please indicate the application of multiple testing correction (adjusted p-value, or FDR) where applicable (Materials and methods, Results; GO analysis). Also indicate p-values for all enrichments and intersections (Figures 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 2D, Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, Figure 4A).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now updated the figures, legends and Materials and methods to indicate the statistical tests used and p-values for all enrichments and intersections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Including a summary of the temporal role of Sox17 in context of other signals and transcription factors, including Nodal/Smad2, BMP, VegT would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now incorporated the requested summary in the Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved but there is one remaining issue that should be addressed before acceptance. This concerns the motif analysis in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. Examining background frequencies via scrambling of peak sequences while maintaining di-nucleotide frequencies has strengthened this analysis. However, ranking the motifs by hypergeometric p-value (provided by HOMER) is perhaps not most informative way to represent these data. We suggest instead plotting the 2log fold enrichment over background, in combination with a statistical test (effect size and statistical rigor).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we added a new panel Figure 4—figure supplement 2D plotting the log2 fold enrichment of Sox and Tcf site frequency for each class of peak compared to random shuffled sequence with a Fisher Exact test to show the enrichment and statistical significance. We agree that some readers may find this way of viewing the data easier. Other naïve test readers preferred the original display and so we kept that too.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is felt that a discussion of background frequencies is needed where the co-occurring motifs are discussed and Figure 4—figure supplement 2D should be revised by calculating for background sequences.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we modified this panel (now Figure 4—figure supplement 2E) to also show random genomic background sequence. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing the motif distribution of each group to background, showed that the “Sox17 and β-catenin” and “Sox17 Only” motif distribution was significantly different to random background. We made minor modifications to the text to reflect this.</p><p>We want to stress that the motif frequency and co-occurrence is very minor part of the paper. The only points we want to make are (1) that most peaks contain both Sox and Tcf sites while some have just Sox sites and (2) that when Sox motifs are present there are usually multiple sites. We did not make any assertions based on the statistics. In many respects we could remove Figure 4—figure supplement 2 completely and it would not change any of our conclusions. We just included these observations as the reader might be interested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
