The C-terminus of the fibrinogen α-chain (αC-region) is composed of an αC-domain and αC-connector. Two recombinant fibrinogen variants (α390 and α220) were produced to investigate the role of subregions in modulating clot stability and resistance to lysis. The α390 variant, truncated before the αC-domain, produced clots with a denser structure and thinner fibres. In contrast, the α220 variant, truncated at the start of the αC-connector, produced clots that were porous with short, stunted fibres and visible fibre ends. These clots were mechanically weak and susceptible to lysis. Our data demonstrate differential effects for the αC-subregions in fibrin polymerisation, clot mechanical strength, and fibrinolytic susceptibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the αC-subregions are key for promoting longitudinal fibre growth. Together, these findings highlight critical functions of the αC-subregions in relation to clot structure and stability, with future implications for development of novel therapeutics for thrombosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>blood coagulation</kwd><kwd>fibrinogen</kwd><kwd>bleeding</kwd><kwd>thrombosis</kwd><kwd>vascular biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG/13/3/30104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McPherson</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name><name><surname>Duval</surname><given-names>Cedric</given-names></name><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Stephen R</given-names></name><name><surname>Domingues</surname><given-names>Marco M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ridger</surname><given-names>Victoria C</given-names></name><name><surname>Connell</surname><given-names>Simon DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Philippou</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name><name><surname>Ajjan</surname><given-names>Ramzi A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ariens</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG/18/11/34036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McPherson</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name><name><surname>Duval</surname><given-names>Cedric</given-names></name><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Stephen R</given-names></name><name><surname>Ridger</surname><given-names>Victoria C</given-names></name><name><surname>Connell</surname><given-names>Simon DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Philippou</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name><name><surname>Ajjan</surname><given-names>Ramzi A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ariens</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fibrinogen, a key protein involved in blood coagulation, contains a disordered and previously poorly characterised region called αC that plays a critical role in fibrin fibre growth and clot stability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fibrinogen is a major component of the blood, normally circulating at concentrations between 1.5 and 4 mg/mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bridge et al., 2017</xref>). The fibrinogen molecule is composed of two pairs of three chains each (Aα<sub>2</sub>Bβ<sub>2</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>). The N-termini of these chains form the central E-region, with the Aα- and Bβ-chain N-termini forming the fibrinopeptides A and B (FpA and FpB), respectively. The E-region is connected to two distal D-regions by two coiled-coil regions comprising all three chains. While the C-termini of the Bβ- and γ-chains end in the D-region, the Aα-chains extend for a substantial length from the D-region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Undas and Ariëns, 2011</xref>). This extension is known as the αC-region and is composed of two main subsections, a highly flexible αC-connector (α221-α391) and a globular domain known as the αC-domain (α392-α610) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsurupa et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The majority of the fibrinogen molecule has been resolved by crystallography with the exception of the N-termini of all three chains, and the C-terminus of the Bβ- (residues 459–461) and γ-chain (residues 395–411) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weisel and Litvinov, 2017</xref>). The αC-region is the largest unresolved section, which is likely due to its intrinsically disordered nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spraggon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kollman et al., 2009</xref>). This region has previously been characterised in some detail by nuclear magnetic resonance, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veklich et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Protopopova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Protopopova et al., 2017</xref>). The αC-connector is the least structured of this region and connects the coiled-coil region to an αC-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weisel and Medved, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsurupa et al., 2002</xref>). The αC-domain forms a compact structure with two subdomains Aα392–503 and Aα504–610, with Aα392–503 containing a series of β-sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tsurupa et al., 2009</xref>). In its native structure, the αC-domain of fibrinogen has been shown to associate with the central E-region through electrostatic interactions and is released by thrombin through FpB cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veklich et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Litvinov et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Fibrinogen is converted to fibrin by thrombin to form a fibrin fibre network, which incorporates red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets to produce a clot that prevents blood loss following vascular injury. Thrombin first cleaves FpA, allowing for the formation of fibrin oligomers, and protofibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weisel and Litvinov, 2017</xref>). FpB is cleaved by thrombin at a slightly slower rate, facilitating the release of the αC-region and resulting in interactions between adjacent αC-regions to promote lateral protofibril aggregation and fibre diameter growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cilia La Corte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weisel and Litvinov, 2017</xref>). The clot is further stabilised by activated factor XIII (FXIII)-mediated cross-linking of the α- and γ-chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pisano et al., 1968</xref>).</p><p>Previous investigations into the function(s) of the αC-region have been based on recombinant fibrinogen (α251), proteolytic digestion products of fibrinogen (fragment X), and dysfibrinogenemia variants, including Marburg, Lincoln, Mahdia, Milano III, and Otago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koopman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gorkun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furlan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ridgway et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ridgway et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gorkun et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amri et al., 2017</xref>). In the case of dysfibrinogenemia, data can be challenging to interpret due to a number of factors such as patients not always being homozygous, the presence of a combination of fibrinogen species in the plasma, insertion of additional residues into the α-chain, and/or low circulating levels of fibrinogen, in addition to heterogeneity in post-translational fibrinogen modifications between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koopman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ridgway et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ridgway et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amri et al., 2017</xref>). Investigations with proteolytic fragments, dysfibrinogenemia samples, and recombinant fibrinogen have provided some insights into the possible roles of the fibrinogen αC-region. These include effects on fibrinolysis rates, lateral aggregation, and fibre thickness, in addition to effects on FXIII cross-linking and the mechanical stability of the clots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gorkun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gorkun et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tsurupa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Helms et al., 2012</xref>). However, the respective roles of each of the two sections of the αC-region (the connector and the αC-domain) are hitherto unexplored.</p><p>We hypothesise that the connector and the αC-domain have differential effects on fibrin clot network properties, and our work explores the functional role of these two key subregions of the αC-region by producing two recombinant α220 and α390 fibrinogen variants in a mammalian expression system. Fibrinogen α390 was truncated before the start of the αC-domain and therefore lacks the C-terminal domain, while α220 was truncated at the start of the α-connector, resulting in the removal of the entire αC-region. Through the use of these truncated fibrinogens, we aimed to gain a greater understanding of how each αC-subregion influences blood clot structure and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Impact of αC-subregions on clot structure</title><p>The structural differences between WT fibrinogen and the two truncated variants are shown by schematic images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The α390 variant is truncated just before the start of αC-domain, whereas the α220 variant is truncated at the start of the αC-connector and therefore lacks both subregions. The nature of the fibrinogen variants with deletions to the αC-subregions was confirmed by native PAGE and reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Both fibrinogen truncations migrated further compared to WT, with α220 electrophoresing the furthest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), in agreement with their reduced molecular weight. One band was observed for each sample, indicating homogeneous species. The WT showed no difference in migration compared with plasma-purified fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Reducing SDS-PAGE confirmed that the lower molecular weight was due to truncation of the fibrinogen α-chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), whilst both β- and γ-chains migrated to the same point as the respective chains of WT fibrinogen. The reduced molecular weight of the α-chains was 42 kDa for α390 and 25 kDa for α220, as predicted, with the calculated molecular weights for the hexameric (Aα<sub>2</sub>Bβ<sub>2</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>)-truncated fibrinogens being 290 kDa and 256 kDa, respectively.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Initial characterisation of the recombinant truncated fibrinogen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of WT, α390, and α220 highlighting the differences in structure of αC-region.

However, α220 clots were much more heterogeneous and their structure showed clumps of regions with highly branched fibres of stunted length compared to WT, leaving very large pores that were observed throughout. No difference in average fibre count was observed between WT (12.97 ± 0.35 fibre/100 µm) and α220 (14.87 ± 2.25 fibre/100 µm, p=0.3212) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but the fibre count was significantly increased for α390 clots (19.6 ± 1.79 fibre/100 µm, p=0.0041).

Fibrin was clearly present for α220 clots after APTEM, and numerous visible fibre ends were again visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). These results indicate that fibrinolysis caused α220 clots to destabilise within 1 hr of clot formation in whole blood.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our main findings are that without the C-terminal domain (α390), fibrin produces a clot consisting of thinner fibres and composed of a denser structural network with reduced mechanical stability. However, and strikingly, without the whole of the αC-region and deletion of both the C-terminal domain and connector (α220), fibrin longitudinal growth is impaired significantly. Clots produced from α220 fibrinogen have stunted fibres and abnormal network structures that show drastically reduced mechanical and fibrinolytic resistance. These findings demonstrate a far greater role for the fibrinogen αC-region than hitherto thought, with it being critically important for normal fibrin fibre formation, growth, and clot stability.</p><p>The loss of the αC-domain in α390 produced a denser clot with thinner fibres compared to WT, as observed by both SEM and LSCM. These findings are reminiscent of a shorter fibrinogen variant α251 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collet et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, the additional 139 AA residues in α390 did not seem to have affected final clot structure, which was largely similar to fibrin networks made from α251 fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gorkun et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collet et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, the lack of 31 AA residues in α220, compared with α251, seems to significantly affect fibre growth and clot stability. It thus appears that the αC-connector region, even if only partially present, rescues some of the fibre growth capabilities and the stability of α251 clots, which is greatly impaired when the full connector region is lost in α220.</p><p>The transition from longitudinal to lateral growth of protofibrils has been reported to occur at oligomer lengths of 0.6–0.8 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hantgan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chernysh et al., 2011</xref>). The AFM experiments cannot extend to time points beyond protofibrils growth to 0.6 µm since this also coincides with network gelation. This notwithstanding, at earlier time points, there was comparable growth in protofibril length for WT and α390 fibrin, while α220 had significantly shorter oligomers at every time point. Moreover, LSCM and SEM data showed that the loss of the αC-connector results in short and stunted fibres. Taken together, these results indicate that α220 fibres are unable to support normal longitudinal fibre growth, which would normally lead to a continuous network of fibres without visible fibre ends. Previous data support our conclusions as clots made from fragment X<sub>2</sub>, where the C-termini of both α-chain end at residue 219, show visible fibre ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gorkun et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, clots from fragment X<sub>2</sub> demonstrated large pores, consistent with our finding with α220 variant, although fibre thickness was different, which may be due to the use of purified bovine fibrinogen or the partial loss of the β-chain during fragment X<sub>2</sub> generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gorkun et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Previously our investigations with a recombinant fibrinogen Double-Detroit with mutations in both ‘A’ and ‘B’ knobs resulted in defective knob-hole interactions, therefore preventing protofibril formation, lateral aggregation, and polymerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duval et al., 2020</xref>). As there was no protofibril initiation and formation, the role of the αC-region in protofibril growth could not be detected. In our current αC-truncations, knob-hole interactions are unchanged, thus allowing protofibril initiation, but longitudinal growth is impaired, altogether indicating a key role for the αC-subregions in protofibril growth, but not initiation.</p><p>The change in clot structure and altered cross-linking of fibrin fibres with the α220 variant is likely to contribute to the marked reduction in fibrin network stiffness compared with WT, and the instability of the clots even in the absence of FXIII. In agreement with this, Collet et al. were unable to study permeation for α251 in the absence of FXIII due to clot weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collet et al., 2005</xref>). Fibrinogen α251 is likely to be mechanically stronger than α220 as there are still at least two glutamine (Q221 [and/or 223] and Q237) and lysine (K208 and K219) residues present that can be cross-linked by FXIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cilia La Corte et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, our clot contraction data showed a reduction in RBC and platelet retention with α220 clots, while α390 and WT were largely similar. This is consistent with previous data using α251, which demonstrated that α-α cross-linking is essential for the retention of RBC within the clot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrnes et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The connector region also demonstrated a significant effect on susceptibility of the clot to lysis, which may have been due, at least in part, to altered clot structure, but there are other potential mechanisms. The α-chain has several lysine cleavage sites involved in fibrinolysis, AαK583, AαK230, and AαK206, before lysines in the coiled-coil of all three chains are targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hudson, 2017</xref>). AαK583 is the most vulnerable and leads to partially degraded fibrinogen within circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hudson, 2017</xref>). As observed in both turbidimetric and ROTEM experiments for α220, there was a delay in the initial stages of clotting, providing opportunity for fibrinolysis to occur simultaneously with polymerisation. In addition, the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin exposes t-PA and plasminogen binding sites, namely, γ312–324 in the γ-nodule and Aα148–160 within the coiled-coil region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yakovlev et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Medved and Nieuwenhuizen, 2017</xref>). These sites are likely already exposed in α220 fibrinogen prior to their conversion to fibrin due to the lack of tethering of the αC-region to the coiled-coil and the E-region, in turn leading to early plasmin generation by t-PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veklich et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Litvinov et al., 2007</xref>). In support of this notion, α220 clots displayed rapid intrinsic lysis in whole blood when fibrinolysis was not inhibited (EXTEM) and in purified protein data, but not when lysis was inhibited in whole blood (APTEM). This observation was further confirmed by SEM of α220 clots after EXTEM experiments, showing the presence of only minimal amounts of fibrin, whereas fibrin was clearly present throughout the clots after APTEM.</p><p>Intrinsic fibrinolysis was also enhanced in clots made from α390, as shown in EXTEM experiments, but to a lesser extent compared with α220. Similarly to α220, however, the effect on fibrinolysis was inhibited in APTEM experiments for α390. To complicate matters, turbidimetric analysis of external fibrinolysis showed no overall difference in lysis of α390 clots compared with WT. This is likely due to the denser clot structure in α390 that prevents movement of plasmin through the clot, thus counterbalancing increased fibrinolysis initiation due to lack of the αC-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collet et al., 2000</xref>). The denser clot structure observed in the purified system for α390 was less apparent in whole blood, indicating that blood cells prevent the formation of a denser clot. As for the difference in clot lysis comparing α390, α251 and α220, one mechanism may be related to the absence of the α<sub>2</sub>-antiplasmin cross-linking site Lys303 in both α251 and α220, resulting in reduced incorporation of this antifibrinolytic protein. Non-covalent interactions of α<sub>2</sub>-antiplasmin have also been reported for the D-region and the C-terminal subdomain of the αC-region, which could further play a role in different lysis patterns of clots made from these two variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsurupa et al., 2010</xref>). Of note, our data also show an important mechanism for the interplay between clot mechanics and fibrinolysis, with both truncations failing to maintain clot firmness during ROTEM analysis, unlike WT. However, inhibition of fibrinolysis restored maintenance of clot firmness for both truncations, showing that in the absence of the αC-domain and/or αC-connector, fibrinolysis is an important regulator of clot mechanical stability.</p><p>Our study had a number of limitations. Due to the low expression levels of the αC-truncation variants, any methodologies that required large amounts of protein, including, for example, in vivo thrombosis studies based on injection of the recombinant variants in <italic>Fga<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, could not be performed. Limitations were also posed by the extreme weakness of the α220 variant, which could not be analysed in some of our experiments without cross-linking by FXIII. Future in vivo studies using mouse models with similar truncations may provide additional information on the role of the αC-region in physiological haemostasis and pathological thrombosis. However, as mentioned above, such models will likely be confounded by the effects of αC-truncations on both protein function and expression level.</p><p>In conclusion, our data show that the αC-domain and αC-connector play crucial and distinct roles in fibrin formation, fibre growth, clot structure, and clot stability. While the αC-domain is central to lateral aggregation, fibre thickness, and clot network density, the αC-connector, together with the αC-domain, is key for longitudinal fibre growth, continuity of fibrin fibres, and both mechanical and fibrinolytic clot stability. These novel functions of the αC-connector region enhance our understanding of the role of this fibrinogen region in clot formation, structure, and resistance to lysis. Moreover, our data have important ramifications for potential future therapies, targeting the αC-region of fibrinogen for the reduction of thrombosis risk.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

In brief, primers were designed to create stop codons in the cDNA sequence in the expression vector pMLP. Fibrinogen α390 was truncated after aspartate 390, and α220 terminated after serine 220. Truncations were confirmed by sequencing using MRC PPU DNA Sequencing and Services (University of Dundee, UK). The truncated plasmids were co-transfected into CHO cells already expressing the human fibrinogen β- and γ-chains, with a second plasmid used for selection (pMSV-his). Expression and purification of recombinant fibrinogen was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takebe et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Macrae et al., 2018</xref>). Recombinant homodimer fibrinogen γ′ was produced in CHO-αβ cells transfected with pMLP vector containing mRNA of fibrinogen γ′, expressed and purified as described above. For α390 and α220 fibrinogens, the α-chain size was reduced from 66 kDa to 42 kDa and 25 kDa, respectively. No changes were made to the β- and γ-chains in these variants. The assembled fibrinogen was reduced to 290 kDa for α390 and 256 kDa for α220, from 340 kDa for wild-type (WT). CHO expressing WT fibrinogen, expressing α- and β-chain (CHO-αβ) and β- and γ-chain (CHO-βγ) were kindly provided by Dr Susan Lord.

Clot progression was monitored on a PowerWave microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek, Swindon, UK) every 12 s at wavelength of 340 nm, for 2 hr at 37°C. After 2 hr, a lysis mix composed of Glu-plasminogen and t-PA in TBS (final concentrations of 0.24 μM and 1 nM, respectively) was added to each well and the plate was read as described above for a further 4 hr.

AFM experiments were performed on the surface of freshly cleaved mica treated with 50 µL of 2 mM NiCl<sub>2</sub> for 5 min. After 5 min, the surface was rinsed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O and dried with nitrogen gas. For initiation of fibrin polymerisation, a final concentration of 0.02 mg/mL (59 nM) fibrinogen was added to a final concentration of 0.05 U/mL thrombin and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Due to the swiftness of fibrin polymerisation, the samples were diluted so that the polymer formation could be monitored at 10, 20, and 30 min. After the desired time, polymerisation was interrupted by diluting the polymerising solution a further three times with TBS, followed immediately by the addition of 3 µL of the diluted solution to the surface of pre-treated mica for 10 s. 150 µL of deionised water was then placed onto the substrate for 10 s and removed with nitrogen gas. Imaging of polymers was done using a Nanoscope IV Dimension 3100 AFM (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) in tapping mode with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz. Measurements were performed in air using silicon cantilevers (TESPA-V2, Bruker) with a typical radius of 7 nm. Five images were taken from each sample, and 3–4 samples were used for each time point.

The samples were run on a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel at 160 V until adequate separation of the bands. Gels were stained with InstantBlue and imaged on a G:Box. The band densitometry was calculated using ImageJ, the α-chains were normalised to the β-chains, and the percentage remaining was calculated for each time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Fibrin microrheology</title><p>Fibrin clot viscoelastic properties were assessed by microrheology using magnetic tweezers as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2019</xref>). In brief, recombinant fibrin clots were made with 0.5 mg/mL (1.47 µM) fibrinogen, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> either in the presence or absence of 3.6 µg/mL of FXIII. Superparamagnetic beads, 4.5 µm in diameter, were diluted at 1:250 (v:v) (Dynabeads M-450 Epoxy, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) were added to the mixture before clotting was initiated with 0.1 U/mL thrombin and then quickly transferred to 0.5 mm diameter capillary tubes (CM Scientific, Keighley, UK). Capillary tube ends were sealed with petroleum jelly to prevent dehydration, and clots could fully form overnight at room temperature. Measurements were collected by applying a force to the paramagnetic beads using four electromagnets to produce a magnetic field gradient. The electromagnets were placed around the sample platform of an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope, which was connected to a CCD camera. Capillary tubes were mounted above the ×40 objective of the microscope. Bead displacement was collected through Labview 7.1 software (National Instruments, Newbury, UK). The displacement of 10 random, individual beads throughout the clot was measured per sample, and this was repeated at least three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Clot contraction</title><p>Clot contraction was investigated using a method modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleman et al., 2014</xref>. 1 mL micro test tubes (Alpha Laboratories, Eastleigh, UK) were coated with Sigmacote, washed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O, and left to dry overnight. The following morning, blood was collected from the inferior <italic>vena cava</italic> of <italic>Fga<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice into 10% v/v 109 mM trisodium citrate. Whole blood was diluted 1:3 in TBS and reconstituted with a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL (1.47 µM) recombinant human fibrinogen. Clotting was initiated by adding an activation mix of 1 pM tissue factor (Stago, Reading, UK) and 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Two tubes containing <italic>Fga<sup>-/-</sup></italic> blood were used as controls, one of which had the activation mix added. Subsequently, images were taken every 30 min for 2 hr, before clots were removed from the tubes and weighed. The non-activated and activated samples were collected and used to quantify the RBC and platelet incorporation into the clot. A sample of non-activated reconstituted blood was taken before activation, and the activated sample was taken after 2 hr. Clot contraction was quantified between 1 and 2 hr using ImageJ. Haemoglobin assay was used to assess RBC incorporation, non-activated and activated samples were diluted in ddH<sub>2</sub>O and incubated for 30 min to allow haemolysis, and absorbency was read at 415 nm. RBC incorporation in the clot (%) was calculated as follows: ((pre-OD<sub>415</sub>-post-OD<sub>415</sub>)/pre-OD<sub>415</sub> × 100). To quantify the incorporation of platelets into the retracted clot, equal aliquots of non-activated and activated samples were diluted 1 in 10 in modified Tyrodes buffer (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES, 0.55 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 7 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.6 mM glucose, pH 7.4) and stained with 5 µg/mL anti-CD41-AF700 (BioLegend) for 15 min. This was further diluted (1:100 in PBS), and CD41-positive events were acquired for 2.5 min at a flow rate of 10 µL/min on a CytoFLEX RUO flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and relative events/µL compared using CytExpert (2.1; Beckman Coulter). The assay was repeated three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Platelet-fibrinogen interaction</title><p>Flow cytometry was used to investigate platelet-fibrinogen interaction. An antibody staining cocktail of 60 µg/mL anti-fibrinogen FITC (Agilent Technologies, Cheadle, UK), 10 µg/mL CD62P-PE, 5 µg/mL CD63-APC, 5 µg/mL CD41-AF700 (BioLegend, London, UK) was added to 15 µg fibrinogen (WT, α390, α220, and γ′/γ′) in modified Tyrodes buffer (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES, 0.55 mM NaH2PO<sub>4</sub>, 7 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.6 mM glucose, pH 7.4). Followed by agonists, PAR4 (200 µM) or ADP (10 µM), or no agonist for basal activity. 5 µL of whole blood collected in 10% v/v 109 mM trisodium citrate from <italic>Fga<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was added and rapidly mixed. Tubes were incubated for 20 min in the dark, then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline. Control tubes were set up with fibrinogen, CD41-AF700, IgG-PE, IgG-APC, PAR4 (200 µM), and EDTA (10 mM). Samples were acquired on a two-laser four-detector CytoFLEX RUO flow cytometer (Beckman, High Wycombe, UK) and platelets were gated based on their characteristic SSC/FFC profile in combination with a CD41-positive gate, and 10,000 positive events were recorded. Analysis was performed using CytExpert (2.1) to extract MFI values and calculate percentage positive cells based on 2% gates on the background fluorescence of isotype or internal controls, and the assay was repeated three times. Fibrinogen γ′/γ′ was used as a control as it lacks the C-terminal AGDV residues, known to bind to the platelet integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farrell et al., 1992</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Rotational thromboelastometry</title><p>Whole blood clot formation and firmness were analysed using a ROTEM Delta (Werfen Limited, Warrington, UK). All investigations were performed through activation of the extrinsic pathway using the EXTEM and APTEM tests. Both tests use tissue factor as an agonist with the EXTEM test influenced by extrinsic coagulation factors, platelets, and fibrinogen. In contrast, the APTEM test allows for the investigation of fibrinolysis, which is based on the EXTEM test but with the addition of aprotinin to inhibit fibrinolytic proteins. <italic>Fga<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were bled as described for clot contraction, and the collected blood was reconstituted with recombinant fibrinogen at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL (1.47 µM). The assays were repeated three times each. The clot contents of the cups were collected afterwards and fixed overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde prepared in 0.9% NaCl (VWR International, Lutterworth, UK). The following morning, clots were washed three times with 0.05 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4), dehydrated, critical-point dried, and sputter-coated as described in the clot structure by scanning electron microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis of experimental data was performed with GraphPad Prism v7 (La Jolla, CA, USA) or OriginLab software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA), with p&lt;0.05 considered as statistically significant. In all data sets, the results were compared to the control, WT, or pre-treated sample. Data was tested for normality before statistical analysis by ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by post-hoc test of Dunnett, Dunn, or Sidak multiple comparison test. The number of experiments and the statistical tests used for each experiment are detailed in the respective figure legends.

Previously undescribed roles in a range of blood clot properties are attributed to a region of the clotting protein fibrinogen, using state-of-the-art methodology. The data support the main conclusions of the paper, open new avenues of investigation for understanding clot properties, and have clinical implications.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Fibrinogen αC-subregions critically contribute blood clot fibre growth, mechanical stability and resistance to fibrinolysis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall the reviewers were positive about the manuscript and the research work included therein.</p><p>1) Please include explanations in your rebuttal regarding the specific items addressed by the two reviewers.</p><p>2) Please fix the typographical errors as well as modify figures and legends as suggested for improved clarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study has, in my opinion, convincingly reached its aims and is an important addition to the field of study, as outlined in my public review. Below is a list of suggestions for additional discussion and minor presentation queries and corrections.</p><p>1. I recommend an additional short discussion on the limitations of the study. For example, how aspects of the key novel findings concerning the alphaC-region (fiber growth rate, susceptibility to fibrinolysis, clot strength) could be differentially influenced in an in vivo setting compared to in vitro/ex vivo assays used, and therefore warrant a future approach centered on an in vivo model.</p><p>2. The authors mention implications for development of novel therapeutics and thrombosis, targeting the alphaC-region. I recommend this is discussed with additional explanations. Both variants presented gave weakened whole blood clots and are susceptible to fibrinolysis. If the therapeutic goal is haemostasis maintenance with thrombosis prevention it is, to me, unclear how targeting alphaC could achieve this. This could be addressed in point 1 above. For example, a short discussion of whether an animal model of thrombosis would enable assessment of the therapeutic potential of alphaC targeting.</p><p>3. In Figure 4 - figure supplement 1, if possible, please include time-lapse images for WT and alpha390 lysis, as for alpha220, and include the timing. Also, I expect the images were intended to be representative rather than &quot;Reprehensive&quot; as denoted in the legend.</p><p>4. I recommend that Figure 4 - figure supplement 2 is used as Figure 4E. This and Figure 4D are complementary and compared in the text.</p><p>5. Molecular weight markers should be included in Figure 1B.</p><p>6. The gene name for the Fga mice should be used consistently throughout the paper.</p><p>7.

For the first time it is found that the alfa-C connector/domain intervenes in the longitudinal protofibril/fibre growth, mechanical and fibrinolytic stability, and the impact of this finding in terms of designing antithrombotic drugs by targeting this region. The techniques employed to investigate the different roles of these two regions were appropriate. The inclusion of fibrinogen and fibrin degradation studies of the fibrinogen variants it would have been interesting, and would confirmed the thromboelastographic, and external fibrinolysis studies, also the inclusion of a control (mouse blood with its own fibrinogen without adding recombinants) for comparative purposes that probably can be added in the Discussion section as limitations or weakness of the present study. Figure 7 should be withdrawn or improved and incorporated in the results with the respective description.</p><p>Some questions and modifications are suggested to the present work.</p><p>1. Results section, page 4: Impact of alfa C-subregions on Clot Structure, third paragraph:</p><p>Authors measure the fibrin density of the LSCM of the three clots: WT, alfa-390 and alfa-220, and report that the fibrin density of WT and alfa-220 was similar. The three pictures looked different, being the fibrin fibres in WT and alfa-390 homogeneously distributed in space, while in alfa-220 clumps of fibres are seen surrounded by big pores. I wonder if it is correct to report fibrin density values in such inhomogeneous structure, clearly WT is less dense than alfa-390. SEM corroborated the LSCM fibrin structure, and again the spatial disposition of fibrin fibres of alfa-220 was less ordered compared to WT and alfa-390, better seen at X5,000.</p><p>2. I will remove figure 7, it is not adding information or clarifying concepts, and is rather confusing, unless authors improve the figure and explicitly explain their model in the result section, especially the longitudinal grow and mechanical stabilisation draws. The premature lysis draw is self-evident.</p><p>3.

Results section, page 5: Clot Mechanics and in vitro Fibrinolysis, third paragraph:</p><p>“whereas α390 clots showed higher elastic modulus compared to WT with FXIIIa at 10 Hz (Figure 4D), likely due to increased fibre branching and clot density in this variant&quot;, but without FXIII the structure was the same but not crosslinked, something is missed in the interpretation…</p><p>5. Results section, page 5: Clot Contraction, first paragraph: the authors did not find differences between WT and alfa-390 both in the kinetics of clot retraction or clot weight, in spite of the differences in G ´values, could be this be attributed to the fact that siliconized tubes are used? It would be interesting in the future do these experiments in no siliconized test tubes.</p><p>6. Results section, page 5: Clot Contraction, second paragraph:</p><p>&quot;Comparing the supernatant (post-activation) of contracted clots to corresponding pre-activated samples…&quot;: pre-activated is here a confusing term, like a treatment is performed before activation, I would suggest non-activated samples or other that do not generate ambiguity (same correction along the manuscript, Figure 5 —figure supplement 1.

Due to the low expression levels of the αC-truncation variants, any methodologies that require large amounts of protein, including for example in vivo thrombosis studies based on injection of the recombinant variants in FGA-/- mice, could not be performed. Limitations were also posed by the extreme weakness of the α220 variant, which could not be analysed in some of our experiments without crosslinking by FXIIIa. Future in vivo studies using mouse models with similar truncations may provide additional information on the role of the αC-region in physiological haemostasis and pathological thrombosis. However, as mentioned above, such models will likely be confounded by the effects of αC-truncations on both protein function and expression level.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

For example, a short discussion of whether an animal model of thrombosis would enable assessment of the therapeutic potential of alphaC targeting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, and have now added additional discussion regarding potential therapeutic targeting of the αC-region. Overall, our work suggests that targeting the αC-domain may be safer than targeting the αC-connector region, as the impact of the latter may be too drastic, making clots too weak from both a mechanical and proteolysis resistance point of view. However, this will need testing in specific models and experiments since our approach deleted the αC-connector together with the αC-domain, and thus we cannot predict the effect of specifically targeting the αC-connector. Another approach may consist of targeting the αC-crosslinking sites for FXIIIa. A recent study from our lab suggested that this may provide a safe way to prevent thrombosis while not affecting embolism (Duval et al. PNAS 2021). Thrombosis studies in an animal model with a deletion in the αC-region may also contribute new information, but these would be complicated by the low expression levels of fibrinogen with αC-truncations. We have now added further discussion on page 9 to reflect these considerations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We have performed this experiment and found that FGA-/- supplemented with rec WT hFGN behaved similarly in EXTEM and have included it in the manuscript (figure 6 —figure supplement 1). However, there were some notable differences in the FIBTEM response (lower maximum amplitude for plasma from normal mice compared to plasma from FGA-/- mice supplemented with recombinant human fibrinogen), the reasons of which are not entirely clear to us as yet. The difference may be related to differences between human and murine fibrinogen (e.g. difference in g’ splice variation, aC-region sequence, or other modifications) or to differences in the interactions between murine or human fibrinogen with other functional murine protein partners, but we are unsure regarding the exact reason at this moment in time. Because this observation needs further investigation to establish the cause of the difference, we have decided not to include this data in the revised manuscript. Importantly, however, this does not impact on the main findings which are related to the direct comparison of human WT with aC-truncated fibrinogens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some questions and modifications are suggested to the present work.</p><p>1.
