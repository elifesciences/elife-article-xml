Color is commonly used as the only visual cue in low-dimensional scatter plots (e.g., tSNE, UMAP, etc.) or in situ spatial plots of single-cell data. We either use colormaps to represent values on a continuum or distinct colors to identify different cell groups. However, with the increasing complexity of the information being represented in these scatter plots, the ability of the readers to distinguish between the colors decreases, diminishing the interpretability of the visualizations. This problem is exacerbated for the approximately 8% of male and 0.5% of female readers who have some type of color-vision deficiency (CVD) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/hUfhnS/aNbk">Wong, 2011</ext-link>). Over the course of the last decade, we have seen a number of papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Wong, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Katsnelson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crameri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Wong, 2010</xref>) providing guidelines for the effective use of colors to create accessible visualizations. More recently, software packages have also been developed that either simulate different CVDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ou, 2021</xref>), or use colorblind-friendly color palettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bunis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Steenwyk and Rokas, 2021</xref>). However, the rules for choosing accessible color palettes may change depending on the type of CVD. For example, protanopes lack the photoreceptors of red light, whereas deuteranopes lack green photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deeb, 2005</xref>). We can overcome this problem by using strategies and software solutions that reduce the dependence of visualizations on colors by ‘redundant coding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Wong, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Color Universal Design, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Oliveira, 2013</xref>) using other visual cues such as line types, point shapes, and hatched patterns over areas.</p><p>Single-cell or spatial omics data visualizations often contain scatter plots with a mixture of varying point distributions. Although simpler strategies for redundant coding already exist, they are only suitable for specific types of scatter plots. For example, we can combine colors with point shapes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/hUfhnS/2Jym">Color Universal Design, 2008</ext-link>) in sparse scatter plots, but the point shapes are not apparent when the points are densely clustered together. On the other hand, distinct hatched patterns (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/hUfhnS/gs5P+aNbk">Wong, 2011; Oliveira, 2013</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fc and Davis, 2022</xref>) overlaid over dense regions of the scatterplot can be used as a visual cue, but this strategy is not well suited for sparsely distributed points. However, hatched patterns can be easily added to violin plots or alluvial plots using R packages such as ggpattern to improve their accessibility.</p><p>We present <italic>scatterHatch</italic>, an R package for generating easily interpretable scatter plots by redundant coding of point groups using patterns and colors. scatterHatch avoids the drawbacks of the simpler strategies discussed before and easily handles point visualizations that contain mixtures of sparse and dense point distributions. Furthermore, we generate example reduced-dimension and spatial scatterHatch plots. Using the same CVD-friendly color palettes, we simulate the perception and accessibility of our scatterHatch plots against standard scatter plots for various types of CVDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>scatterHatch adds patterns to scatter plots with mixtures of dense and sparse regions</title><p>In this paper, we present scatterHatch, a R/Bioconductor package to generate colorblind-friendly point visualizations commonly used in single-cell and spatial bioinformatics data analyses. scatterHatch greatly enhances the accessibility of low-dimensional scatter plots and in situ spatial plots of single-cell and spatial omics by using a combination of colors and patterns. A scatterHatch plot effectively represents mixtures of varying point distributions by using simple patterns which are easily plotted over dense clusters as well as sparsely distributed points.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the scatterHatch workflow. The minimum required input to scatterHatch is a data frame containing the x, y coordinates and the condition or factor to be visually represented. The output of scatterHatch is a ggplot2 object representing a scatter plot with colors and patterns assigned for each factor. Each point pertaining to a factor is classified as either belonging to a dense cluster or as an individual sparse point. scatterHatch plots coarse patterns over the dense point clusters and individually plots a matching pattern over each sparse point. Users have the option to bypass the in-built sparse point detector by providing a list of sparse points as input to scatterHatch. scatterHatch has six default patterns—horizontal, vertical, right diagonal, left diagonal, checkers and crisscross—in addition to supporting a ‘blank’ pattern or color-only mode. The choice of patterns is intentionally limited to those achievable by simple line segments which are suitable for both individual points or large regions of dense point clusters. The default color palette uses 40 high-contrast CVD-friendly colors imported from the <italic>dittoSeq</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bunis et al., 2020</xref>). To advanced users, scatterHatch extends the ability to customize patterns by specifying the type (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted, etc.), color, and thickness of the lines used in the patterns. Furthermore, users can also generate new patterns composed of one or more lines by providing a list of corresponding line angles and aesthetics as input.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>scatterHatch generates accessible scatter plots by redundant coding of point groups using colors and patterns.</title><p>For every point group, scatterHatch separates sparsely distributed points from the dense clusters. scatterHatch plots coarse patterns over the dense clusters and individually plots patterns over the sparse points.

Specifically, 10,000 cells were selected at random from single-cell data collected from a resection specimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lin et al., 2018</xref>) of Pancreatic Ductal Carcinoma (PDAC) and adjacent normal tissues. The reduced-dimension coordinates are calculated using the UMAP algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Becht et al., 2018</xref>) and the cells are classified into four groups using K-means clustering of the UMAP coordinates. A scatterHatch plot was generated where a color and pattern were assigned to each cell group. Subsequently, we used the cvdPlot function from the R package colorblindness to simulate common CVDs such as deuteranomaly (red-green colorblindness), protanomaly (blue-yellow colorblindness), and monochromacy (complete color blindness or grayscale vision).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> compares the accessibility of the UMAP scatter plot when compared to a scatterHatch plot as perceived by individuals with normal vision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), deuteranomaly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), protanomaly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and monochromacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), respectively. Each simulated visualization also includes an inset with a zoomed-in view of a region with sparse points from the distinct cell groups. As shown in the figure, the addition of the patterns makes it much easier to distinguish between factors for all types of CVD. In the zoomed-out view, we can readily distinguish between large dense clusters associated with each cell group. Similarly, the zoomed-in view demonstrates how plotting the patterns individually over sparse points enables us to distinguish them from adjacent points from other cell groups.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>scatterHatch plots are more accessible compared to scatter plots to individuals with CVD.</title><p>Simulated perception of a UMAP scatter plot compared with a scatterHatch plot by individuals with (<bold>A</bold>) normal color vision, (<bold>B</bold>) deuteranomaly, (<bold>C</bold>) protanomaly, and (<bold>D</bold>) monochromacy, with the insets showing a magnified sparse region showing patterns assigned to individual cells.

When publishing a plot with few colors, the authors can appropriately assign distinct colors to individual cell groups to avoid confusing color perceptions. As the number of colors in a scatter plot increases, however, the ability to choose distinct colors as well as to control the relative distribution of these colors in the plot is severely hampered, leading to a higher probability of color misperception.

These plots are aesthetically pleasing as well as highly accessible to a broad readership including those with color vision deficiencies. scatterHatch plots are compatible with point distributions that are sparse, dense, as well as mixtures of both. We demonstrate how scatterHatch plots have better accessibility than simple scatter plots in low dimensional embeddings (e.g., PCA, UMAP, and TSNE) as well as spatial plots of cells in the tissue with up to 82-cell groups. As the number of cell groups increases, the benefits of scatterHatch plots extend even to readers with normal vision. In future work, we will make enhancements to the algorithms and plotting functions to improve the aesthetics and accessibility of scatterHatch plots with overlapping cell groups. Additionally, the software will be extended to be compatible with single-cell and spatial data formats from commonly used bioinformatics packages such as Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Butler et al., 2018</xref>) and scanpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite the consensus on the need for bioinformatics visualizations that are accessible across the spectrum of color perception, the progress has been slow in terms of actually affecting this change in our publications. While well intentioned, recommendations for incorporating additional steps to ensure accessible visualizations are not sufficient by themselves. For example, simulating multiple CVDs and subjectively selecting the best possible color palette for their visualizations may not come naturally to a vast majority of researchers who have normal color vision. In fact, such strategies are themselves not practical for individuals with one type of CVD who wish to ensure accessibility for other types of CVD. Software packages, such as ggpattern, dittoSeq, and scatterHatch, remove this subjectivity to a large extent by using colorblind-friendly color palettes as default, and enabling the use of visualization strategies that reduce the dependence on color. Future work could include the development of a software suite that combines the functionalities of these packages into a comprehensive software solution for creating CVD-friendly visualizations. Meanwhile, there is also a need for standards and guidelines for creating accessible visualizations, which requires support at multiple levels—from funding agencies, journals, and developers of large-scale analysis software and visualization tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Speir et al., 2021</xref>). The submission review process for R or Python packages should require that the default color palettes used by the software visualizations are colorblind friendly according to well-established accessibility standards. In addition, we should develop processes for periodically incorporating the best practices for accessibility introduced in new software packages into the graphical design language standards expected from newer packages. Finally, the strategies developed by scatterHatch and other recent software only address color-vision deficiencies and not other visual impairments such as double vision or complete blindness. In such cases, we need to incorporate accessibility features such as screen reader-friendly alternate texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jung et al., 2022</xref>) which describe the graphical elements of the visualizations.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Code availability</title><p><italic><underline>scatterHatch</underline></italic> is available on Bioconductor at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scatterHatch.html">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scatterHatch.html</ext-link>.</p><p>The development version is available on Github at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/FertigLab/scatterHatch">https://github.com/FertigLab/scatterHatch</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:499543a39e36217af88e23f3a71c5a93c0a36d48;origin=https://github.com/FertigLab/scatterHatch;visit=swh:1:snp:86780af430d237a14898d90418ac2ae00a07eb16;anchor=swh:1:rev:ae8a6b69722adb123fbcde40d12e2b2317deec2e">swh:1:rev:ae8a6b69722adb123fbcde40d12e2b2317deec2e</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deshpande, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The scripts used to generate the figures in the manuscript are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/FertigLab/scatterHatch-paper">https://github.com/FertigLab/scatterHatch-paper</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deshpande, 2022</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-82128-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>'scatterHatch user guide'.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-82128-supp1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability</title><p>The current manuscript is a computational study, so no new data have been generated for this manuscript.
