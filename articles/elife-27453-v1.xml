A major challenge in understanding their assembly is the combinatorial problem of a non-random selection of a full genomic set of distinct RNAs. This process involves complex RNA-RNA and protein-RNA interactions, which are often obscured by non-specific binding at concentrations approaching in vivo assembly conditions. Here, we present direct experimental evidence of sequence-specific inter-segment interactions between rotavirus RNAs, taking place in a complex RNA- and protein-rich milieu. We show that binding of the rotavirus-encoded non-structural protein NSP2 to viral ssRNAs results in the remodeling of RNA, which is conducive to formation of stable inter-segment contacts. To identify the sites of these interactions, we have developed an RNA-RNA SELEX approach for mapping the sequences involved in inter-segment base-pairing. Our findings elucidate the molecular basis underlying inter-segment interactions in rotaviruses, paving the way for delineating similar RNA-RNA interactions that govern assembly of other segmented RNA viruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27453.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rotavirus is a highly infectious virus that affects children worldwide, causing severe diarrhoea. Despite the introduction of several highly effective vaccines, more than 200,000 children still die from rotavirus each year. There are currently no drugs that can combat this disease once a child has been infected.</p><p>Viruses carry the instructions that determine their properties and behavior in molecules of DNA or RNA. Unlike many other viruses, which typically have a single molecule of DNA or RNA, rotavirus has 11 distinct “RNA segments”. After invading a cell the virus begins to replicate itself. During replication, the RNA segments (which consist of two strands of RNA paired together) are copied many times. It is not clear how rotaviruses ‘count’ up to 11 so that each new virus acquires a single copy of each segment.</p><p>Previous biochemical and structural studies of rotavirus replication suggest that selecting 11 distinct RNA segments must involve the RNAs forming complex interactions with proteins and other RNA molecules. Using a highly sensitive fluorescence-based approach, termed fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy, Borodavka et al. now present direct experimental evidence of interactions between the RNA segments that occur via single strands of the rotavirus RNA.</p><p>These RNA-RNA interactions require the binding of a rotavirus protein NSP2 to the RNA strands, which results in the remodeling of the RNA; this remodeling is required to form stable contacts between different RNA segments. Furthermore, a new experimental approach (called RNA-RNA SELEX) developed by Borodavka et al. identified the parts of the RNA segments that may take part in these interactions.</p><p>The results presented by Borodavka et al. pave the way for identifying the RNA-RNA interactions that govern how other segmented RNA viruses can package their genetic material. Further work to uncover the entire RNA interaction network in rotaviruses would also accelerate the design of new vaccines and may help us to develop antiviral drugs to treat infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Rotavirus</kwd><kwd>RNA-RNA interactions</kwd><kwd>RNA folding</kwd><kwd>Virus assembly</kwd><kwd>Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103068/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borodavka</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ECF/019/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dykeman</surname><given-names>Eric C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schrimpf</surname><given-names>Waldemar</given-names></name><name><surname>Lamb</surname><given-names>Don C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In rotaviruses, the selective packaging of eleven distinct genomic RNA segments requires virus-encoded protein NSP2 to alter the RNA structures, facilitating their interactions with each other.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genomes of rotaviruses (RVs), and other pathogens of the <italic>Reoviridae</italic> family, comprise nine to twelve double-stranded (ds)RNA segments, co-packaged into each infectious virion. The RNA assortment process, during which a single distinct positive-sense ssRNA copy of each of the genomic segments is selected for packaging and replication, occurs within cytoplasmic inclusion bodies termed viroplasms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patton and Spencer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Trask et al., 2012</xref>). Multiple copies of viral RNAs and proteins accumulate in viroplasms, of which the non-structural ssRNA-binding proteins NSP2 &amp; NSP5 are essential components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patton and Spencer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Trask et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taraporewala and Patton, 2004</xref>). Current views of the mechanisms of segment assortment are based on the idea that selection of the correct genomic segments is governed by inter-segment RNA-RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gavazzi et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavazzi et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fajardo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McDonald et al., 2016</xref>). However, the analysis of such interactions remains a particularly challenging task due to a vast number of RNA-RNA contacts present in multiple folding intermediates of large RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Solomatin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Woodson, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Woodson, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laing and Schlick, 2011</xref>). This problem is further confounded by non-specific RNA self-association and aggregation, particularly in the presence of RNA-binding proteins, at concentrations mimicking in vivo assembly conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borodavka et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, several tools for investigating RNA-RNA interactions have been developed, based on proximity-ligation of interacting RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helwak and Tollervey, 2014</xref>) and psoralen-mediated crosslinking of RNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engreitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Aw et al., 2016</xref>). While these powerful methods are well suited for detection of RNA duplexes in cells, further experimental validation of the identified RNA-RNA contacts is often required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weidmann et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, such techniques give little insight into the dynamics and stability of the observed RNA-RNA interactions, particularly when they are involved in the assembly of macromolecular complexes.</p><p>To address these challenges, we have developed an experimental framework for interrogating RNA-RNA interactions by taking advantage of two-colour fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy combined with pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE-FCCS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Müller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schrimpf et al., 2017</xref>). Such assays offer unprecedented capacity for detection of stable, sequence-specific interactions between labeled RNAs in complex mixtures of RNAs and proteins. Using PIE-FCCS, we show that incubation of a full set of eleven genomic ssRNAs with the non-structural protein NSP2 results in de novo formation of specific inter-segment RNA-RNA contacts. By testing pairwise RNA-RNA interactions between segment 11 ssRNA (S11) and other RV ssRNAs, we demonstrate that S11 preferentially binds to a subset of genomic ssRNAs. We show that NSP2 binding to S11 RNA results in its structural reorganization, concomitant with the exposure of single-stranded areas, required for stabilization of new inter-segment interactions. The weakest detected pairwise interaction between S11 and S10 RNAs is significantly enhanced in the presence of a full set of eleven ssRNAs, suggesting formation of a complex RNA interaction network, stabilized by NSP2.</p><p>To gain further insights into specific inter-segment contacts of RV RNAs, we introduce an RNA-RNA SELEX approach for mapping the genomic sequences, mediating such interactions. Using FCCS methodology combined with RNA mutagenesis studies, we validate the sites of inter-segment RNA-RNA interactions, identified via RNA-RNA SELEX. This integrated approach provides unique insights into the stability of macromolecular complexes, containing multiple RNAs, and it can be universally applied for investigating assembly of other segmented RNA viruses and ribonucleoproteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NSP2 promotes interactions between ssRNA segment precursors</title><p>Unlike most ensemble methods previously used for detecting inter-segment interactions in segmented RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavazzi et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fajardo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fournier et al., 2012</xref>), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) allows probing of such interactions in extremely dilute solutions, effectively eliminating self-association and aggregation of RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borodavka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borodavka et al., 2016</xref>).

Typical autocorrelation functions (ACFs) for the red-labelled RNA S11 (red particles) and green-labelled RNA S5 (green particles) are shown on the right.

Dual-color Fluorescence Cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) is a powerful extension of FCS technique that detects interactions of two differently labelled molecules. A cross-correlation signal is observed when green- and red-labeled molecules are interacting, thus diffusing together through the detection volume as a single species.

Remarkably, co-incubation of NSP2 in the presence of sub-micromolar amounts of NSP5 resulted in a marked decrease of the S5:S11 CCF amplitude, compared to the NSP2 incubation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).

Collectively these data suggest that inter-segment RNA contact formation is not coupled to ATP hydrolysis and thus most likely to be dependent on the ssRNA-binding activity of NSP2.

This suggests that the identified RNA-RNA interaction sites may be sequestered by local secondary structures. To investigate this further, we performed FCCS with ATTO647-labeled S10 RNA and a Cy3-labeled ssRNA probe, representing region 84–100 of S11 RNA (complementary to the region 272–288 of S10 RNA that corresponds to the peak shown in a blue box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Here, we provide direct evidence of specific, inter-segment RNA-RNA interactions in RVs, by establishing experimental assays based on a combination of two-colour FCCS and an RNA-RNA SELEX. The FCCS-based assays allow rapid quantitative analyses of the stability of RNA-RNA and ribonucleoprotein complexes, providing additional information about the stoichiometry of the RNAs within such complexes. To delineate the sequences that mediate contacts between the RV ssRNAs, we have employed the RNA-RNA SELEX approach for identifying stable, specific inter-segment RNA-RNA interactions.</p><p>The data presented here collectively support the model in which RV ssRNAs can specifically interact with each other as a result of RNA remodeling brought about by the ssRNA-binding protein NSP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The results of RNA-RNA SELEX against S11 reveal multiple areas of the RNA undergoing conformational rearrangements upon NSP2 binding, while the most stable S11 intra-molecular helices H1-H3 remain largely inaccessible. This model is consistent with the high affinity of NSP2 for ssRNA, but not dsRNA, which may underlie the protein’s ability to alter the kinetics of RNA-RNA hybridization by accelerating the breakdown of weaker intra-molecular helices, concomitant with the stabilization of the alternative, stable inter-molecular contacts. Substitution of NSP2 with its mutant ΔC-NSP2 with significantly lower affinity for ssRNA reduces the efficiency of formation of inter-segment contacts, further supporting the proposed model of NSP2-mediated remodeling of RV (+)ssRNAs. Such a mechanism would account for NSP2-facilitated selection of thermodynamically favorable inter-segment interactions that may not always follow strict pairing rules. Because of the high affinity of NSP2 for ssRNA it is expected that NSP2 may remain associated with the oligomeric ssRNA complex prior its replication. Given that NSP2 inhibits the initiation of replication, but not the elongation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vende et al., 2003</xref>), it is possible that the inner core protein VP2 binding to the ssRNA-NSP2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guglielmi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Estrozi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patton, 1996</xref>) would result in the initial displacement of the NSP2 during the core assembly nucleation, followed by further eviction of NSP2 during the elongation. In this model, the assembly of the core is nucleated by multiple copies of the RV polymerase VP1 bound to eleven pre-selected (+)ssRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patton, 1996</xref>), arranged within the ssRNA-NSP2 complex at defined spatial locations. The highly basic N-terminal ‘arms’ of VP2 would interact with VP1 and ssRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeng et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guglielmi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Estrozi et al., 2013</xref>) within the ribonucleoprotein complex, which could also facilitate the formation of the VP2 lattice around it. The proposed model would account for incorporation of multiple assorted (+)ssRNAs, each associated with its own copy of the VP1 polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guglielmi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Periz et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, at high concentrations VP2 self-assembles into empty core-like particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crawford et al., 1994</xref>). This implies that VP2 nucleation must be tightly regulated to prevent early assembly to ensure specific packaging of eleven (+)ssRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Desselberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Viskovska et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible that nucleation of core assembly by (+)ssRNA complexes may occur at VP2 concentrations significantly lower, than those required for formation of empty cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borodavka et al., 2012</xref>). Binding of NSP2 may also contribute to the regulation of over-nucleation of VP2 on the RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Viskovska et al., 2014</xref>). Early biochemical studies of RV assembly intermediates suggest that (+)ssRNA replication may take place within the pre-core intermediates lacking a complete VP2 shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallegos and Patton, 1989</xref>).

Combining our approach with a recently established reverse genetics system for RVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanai et al., 2017</xref>) will ultimately move us one step closer to understanding segment selection and encapsidation in these important pathogens. However, currently the analysis of such interactions in vivo is unfeasible, mostly due to the low rescue efficiency of the rotavirus reverse genetics system, through which only a very limited number of mutated genomic sequences have been rescued at this point (T.Kobayashi, personal communication). In conclusion, the experimental approach reported here allows identification of RNA-RNA interactions without the need for cross-linking and intercalating agents, which may perturb dynamic RNA structures. It takes into account the kinetic effects of structure formation, e.g., when RNA binding is concomitant with structural changes due to binding of other RNAs, or proteins. The FCCS-based assays presented here provide instant quantitative validation of RNA-RNA interactions and probe their stabilities. This approach can be used for high-throughput screening of the conditions that favor stabilization of RNA-RNA contacts, thus providing an additional dimension to the panoply of techniques for detecting base-paired RNA nucleotides. The combination of FCCS and RNA-RNA SELEX-based approaches holds promise for validation and quantitative analyses of the interacting viral ssRNAs and miRNAs. We anticipate that these methods will become useful tools in the armory of instruments for gaining novel mechanistic insights into the dynamics of genomic RNA-RNA interactions in RNA viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Genome segment precursors S1-S11 (GenBank IDs are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) of bovine rotavirus strain RF (G6P6[1]) were obtained as pUC19 cDNA clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richards et al., 2013</xref>) from Dr Ulrich Desselberger and Professor Andrew Lever (University of Cambridge, UK).

Transcribed RNAs were purified using RNeasy columns (QIAGEN). All in vitro transcription reactions were carried out using the T7 RNA transcription kit (NEB), following the manufacturer’s protocol, except for the fluorescently labeled or biotinylated RNA samples. RNA transcripts were labeled by introducing 5′-aminoallyl-uridine-5′-triphosphate (5-AA-UTP, Thermo Fisher) during the in vitro transcription. Similar uridine derivatives with substituents at the fifth carbon have been previously shown to support the replication of RVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Silvestri et al., 2004</xref>). This minimally perturbing RNA labeling approach results in only few 5-AA-uridines incorporated per each transcript. Such a labeling strategy minimizes the influence of fluorescence quenching or Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between the reporter dyes on the apparent cross-correlation amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foo et al., 2012</xref>).

RNA biotinylation was carried out under similar conditions except EZLink Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin was used in lieu of NHS-esters of ATTO dyes. Further purification of biotinylated RNAs was carried out following the purification protocol used for dye-labeled RNAs (see above).

For NSP2-mediated RNA-RNA-interaction assays, labeled RNA samples (150 nM total RNA concentration) were incubated with 2.5–10 μM NSP2 (or 2.5–10 µM BSA for control reactions). Reactions were allowed to proceed at 37°C for 30 min before they were stopped by diluting RNA samples into assay buffer, as discussed above, to achieve a final concentration of labeled RNAs of 1 nM (each strand). These samples were further allowed to equilibrate at 25°C for 15 min prior to FCCS measurements. Proteinase K digestion of NSP2 was performed by adding 40 μg of proteinase K (800 U/ml) to the NSP2-RNA samples and incubating them for 30 min at 37°C, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taraporewala and Patton, 2001</xref>), prior to dilution into assay buffer as described above.

FCCS detects coincident fluctuations in both the green and red channels. The amplitude of the cross-correlation function (CCF) is proportional to the number of double-labeled complexes and inversely proportional to the average number of labeled species in each individual channel (i.e., red and green). Therefore, the fraction of double-labeled species in a sample can be extracted from the ratio of the amplitudes of the cross-correlation (CCF) to the auto-correlation functions (ACF). Conventionally, in dual-color FCCS, the signal from differently labeled molecules is divided into channels by emission (e.g., via dichroic mirrors and filters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwille et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacia and Schwille, 2007</xref>). Due to spectral crosstalk, an artificial cross-correlation signal can be observed between the two channels, even when the different species do not interact. When using pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE) in combination with the high temporal resolution of time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), the signals can be further divided by the excitation source. This removes the influence of the crosstalk and greatly enhances both the sensitivity and specificity of this technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Müller et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>FCCS measurements of ATTO647, and ATTO565 or Cy3-dye labeled RNAs were performed on a custom-built confocal microscope with time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) detection designed for pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Müller et al., 2005</xref>).

The emission of the red laser was delayed electronically by 20 ns with respect to the yellow laser to achieve pulsed interleaved excitation. A 60x, 1.27 NA objective (Plan Apo IR 60 × WI, Nikon) was used both to focus the excitation light and to collect the fluorescence. The fluorescence was focused on an 80 μm pinhole to remove out-of-focus light. Green and red emission signals were spectrally separated and focused on two single photon avalanche photodiodes (APDs).

The lower number of the unique sequences from the NSP2 +selection is due to selective enrichment of certain RNA sequences in the presence of NSP2. Each sequence from both data sets was aligned against all 10 segments (S1-10) and the single best alignment was identified using a probabilistic score (the Bernoulli score), which benchmarks the probability of a non-contiguous alignment to that of a contiguous alignment of N nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shakeel et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, a 30-nt long RNA sequence, which aligns to the genomic segment with a total of N non-contiguous matches (N ≤ 30), will have a Bernoulli score of N. The score N is equivalent to the probability that a short sequence of N nucleotides would match the sequence of the genomic segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shakeel et al., 2017</xref>). We used the alignments with the Bernoulli score of 12 or above to analyze sequences that strongly interact with S11 RNA to identify highly accessible areas in S11 RNA. Higher scores (14 or above) increase the stringency of the analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We used RNA sequences with Bernoulli scores of 12 and above (for alignments against S11 RNA target) or 14 and above (for other RNA segments) to construct histogram plots for each genomic segment S1-S10. The histogram bins are associated with individual nucleotides in each segment. Each sequence aligning to a nucleotide increments the histogram bin by one, so that the peak height corresponds to the number of sequences aligning to it. This approach allows identification of multiple RNA sequences that strongly interact with S11 RNA, including RNAs not fully matching the S1-S10 genomic sequences to account for nucleotide mismatches and possible gapped regions. We used the areas of high sequence alignments to identify regions that have a high probability of being single-stranded.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor.

Rotavirus is a member of the Reoviridae. A common feature is that these viruses encapsidate 9–12 segments of dsRNA; rotaviruses, in particular, have 11 dsRNA segments. How these viruses in the Reoviridae selectively package a correct set of RNA segments has been an unanswered question. Borodavka et al., present an interesting set of experiments to address how the 11 segments of the rotavirus RNA genome are selected for packaging into virions. The data suggest that the rotavirus non-structural protein NSP2 remodels viral ssRNA to facilitate the formation of stable inter-segment contacts. In particular, authors show that segment S11 (smallest of the segments) interacts with S10 and this association is further stabilized by the presence of other RNA segments and that S11 preferentially binds to S3, S5, and S6. Authors further show that these specific inter-segmental interactions result in the formation of an RNA oligomer which remains stable even in the absence of NSP2, thus suggesting that the role of NSP2 is to promote such specific inter-segmental contacts and facilitate the formation of an RNA oligomer presumably containing the correct set of 11 segments for subsequent packaging. Using RNA SELEX methods authors have mapped the sequences in S11 that are likely involved in the inter-segmental RNA-RNA base-pairing, which were further substantiated selective mutating the contact regions. Overall this is an elegant study, well designed, presenting novel experimental approaches. Previous studies have suggested or speculated the possibility of such interactions as a requirement of selective packaging of RNA segments, however, this is perhaps the first study to demonstrate the possibility of such inter-segmental interactions in the case of rotavirus.</p><p>Overall, this is a very nice paper demonstrating the possibility of specific inter-segmental interactions among rotavirus RNAs that is promoted by NSP2 using a clever combination of various techniques. It is unfortunate that the reverse genetics system published recently for rotaviruses is not sufficiently robust to address the functional relevance of the identified interactions. However, even in the absence of such data, the current manuscript makes a significant step towards uncovering the molecular basis of RNA packaging in rotaviruses and the presented methodologies will be useful for analysing RNA packaging mechanisms in other segmented negative strand RNA viruses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> would be considerably strengthened by showing that interactions between S5:S11mut can be recovered by compensatory mutations in S5 and, vice versa, that S5mut:S11 interactions can be recovered by compensatory mutations in S11. Similar interaction 'rescue' experiments could be carried out for the S3:S11 and S6:S11 pairs presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>One major concern of this paper is the lack of in vivo validation for the observations made, and a lack of a well-reasoned model for how the formation of the higher-order ssRNA-oligomer allows itself for replication, duplex formation, and packaging. As noted above, we understand that in vivo validation is not practical at this point. Still, there are several questions (some of which could be addressed by in vitro experiments as well) such as for example 1) given that NSP2 strongly interacts with NSP5 in the viroplasm (and perhaps with other proteins including VP1 and VP2), how do these interactions affect NSP2-RNA interactions and RNA remodeling? Can the experiments be done in the presence of both NSP2 and NSP5? Do NTPase/RTPase activities of NSP2 play a role in RNA-RNA interactions or remodeling? This can be tested perhaps by using a mutant of NSP2 that lacks NTPase/RTPase activities? Addition of NSP5 and/or elucidation of potential roles of NTPase/RTPase activities would greatly strengthen the manuscript by making the measurement and analysis more physiologically relevant.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27453.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> would be considerably strengthened by showing that interactions between S5:S11mut can be recovered by compensatory mutations in S5 and, vice versa, that S5mut:S11 interactions can be recovered by compensatory mutations in S11.

These are:</p><p>1) Can the disrupted interactions between the mutated RNA sequences be ‘rescued’ by introducing compensatory, ‘trans-complementary’ mutations?</p><p>2) How does the viroplasm-forming RNA-binding protein NSP5 affect inter-segment RNA-RNA interactions alone or in the presence of NSP2?</p><p>3) Does the enzymatic activity (NTPase/RTPase) of NSP2 have an effect on the detected RNA-RNA interactions?</p><p>Regarding point 1, we have included results obtained with mutated RNAs S5 (S5mut) and a mutant of S11 RNA (comp_mutS11) showing that stable base-pairing between S5mut and the interacting S11 RNA mutant is restored. The mutated RNA sequences strongly interact with each other, consistent with the predicted stability of the ‘rescued’ RNA-RNA contacts between the two RNAs. These results, together with extensive characterisation of the stability of the formed duplex (Tm analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and mutagenesis analysis of both identified sites in S5 and S11 RNAs) further confirm that the identified RNA contacts are important for detected RNA-RNA interactions. We plan to ultimately test these sites in vivo, using the recently developed RG system by Kanai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017. S11 RNA was chosen for mutagenesis analysis due to its small size and the availability of secondary structure probing data that could be used for introducing nucleotide substitutions whilst minimizing their impact on the secondary structure of the RNA.</p><p>Regarding point 2, we have expanded our studies to include RNA-binding protein NSP5 into RNA-RNA interaction assays. While both recombinantly expressed NSP2 and NSP5 bind ssRNAs, only NSP2 was capable of promoting the formation of RNA-RNA contacts between ssRNAs. Furthermore, addition of submicromolar amounts of NSP5 to the reaction involving ssRNAs S5 &amp; S11, co-incubated with NSP2, resulted in less efficient formation of RNA-RNA contacts. Together these results strongly suggest that formation of RNA-RNA contacts requires NSP2, while NSP5 appears to inhibit this process while having other, not fully explored functions. In any case these observations are consistent with the previously reported NSP5 binding to the RNA-binding grooves of NSP2 octamers that competes with RNA binding by NSP2. We have also noted severe aggregation of the full-length NSP5 in the presence of NSP2, previously reported by Jiang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006 which precluded further analysis of the RNA-RNA contact formation in the presence of both viroplasm-forming proteins NSP2 and NSP5.</p><p>Regarding point 3, we have included new results obtained with NSP2 in the presence of ATP. The novel data indicate that addition of ATP does not affect the ssRNA-binding activity of NSP2, nor does it affect the formation of the S5:S11 RNA-RNA complex. Furthermore, the S5:S11 RNA complex formation was significantly impaired when NSP2 was substituted with the DC-terminal NSP2 mutant that has reduced affinity for ssRNA, while still retaining its NTPase/RTPase catalytic residues. Furthermore, although not raised by the referees, we have investigated whether rotavirus group C NSP2 can facilitate the formation of RNA-RNA contacts between RNAs S5 and S11 of a group A rotavirus. Despite sharing similar tertiary and quaternary architectures and RTPase/NTPase enzymatic activities, rotavirus group C NSP2 was inefficient in stabilising the S5:S11 RNA-RNA contacts in rotavirus group A.</p><p>We feel that these additional results significantly enhance our initial conclusions and widen the appeal of the revised manuscript, and we hope that the Editor and the referees who felt the study was well designed, yet lacking in vivo validation for the observations made, are now more reassured.</p><p>Addressing these concerns and accommodating the new data generated have required us to rewrite sections throughout the manuscript (highlighted in yellow). We have also added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) presenting a proposed model of NSP2-facilitated RNA-RNA assortment process, described in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
