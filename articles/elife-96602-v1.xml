In insect sensory organs called sensilla, a transepithelial potential, known as the sensillum potential (SP), arises through active ion transport across accessory cells, sensitizing receptor neurons such as mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors. Because multiple receptor neurons are often co-housed in a sensillum and share SP, niche-prevalent overstimulation of single sensory neurons can compromise neighboring receptors by depleting SP. However, how such potential depletion is prevented to maintain sensory homeostasis remains unknown. Here, we find that the <italic>Ih-</italic>encoded hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel bolsters the activity of bitter-sensing gustatory receptor neurons (bGRNs), albeit acting in sweet-sensing GRNs (sGRNs). For this task, HCN maintains SP despite prolonged sGRN stimulation induced by the diet mimicking their sweet feeding niche, such as overripe fruit. We present evidence that <italic>Ih</italic>-dependent demarcation of sGRN excitability is implemented to throttle SP consumption, which may have facilitated adaptation to a sweetness-dominated environment. Thus, HCN expressed in sGRNs serves as a key component of a simple yet versatile peripheral coding that regulates bitterness for optimal food intake in two contrasting ways: sweet-resilient preservation of bitter aversion and the previously reported sweet-dependent suppression of bitter taste.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sensillum potential</kwd><kwd>hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated</kwd><kwd>HCN</kwd><kwd>sensory homeostasis</kwd><kwd>feeding behavior</kwd><kwd>neuronal microenvironment</kwd><kwd>sensory processing at the periphery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021R1A2B5B01002702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>KyeongJin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022M3E5E8017946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>KyeongJin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018749</institution-id><institution>Korea Brain Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23-BR-01-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>KyeongJin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018749</institution-id><institution>Korea Brain Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22-BR-03-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>KyeongJin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A hyperpolarization-activated cation channel, counteracting membrane depolarization, delimits the excitability of receptor neurons subjected to naturally prolonged stimulation to preserve the function of neighboring receptor neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gustation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glia-like support cells exhibit close physical association with sensory receptor neurons, and conduct active transcellular ion transport, which is important for the operation of sensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ray and Singhvi, 2021</xref>). In mammals, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells have a polarized distribution of ion channels and transporters. They provide an ionic environment in the extracellular space apposing photoreceptors to aid their light sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sparrrow et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, knockdown of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes encoding the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump or a K<sup>+</sup> channel in the supporting glial cells attenuates photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charlton-Perkins et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to creating an optimal micro-environment, transepithelial potential differences (TEPs) are often generated to promote the functions of sensory organs. For example, the active K<sup>+</sup> transport from the perilymph to the endolymph across support cells in the mammalian auditory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nin et al., 2008</xref>) generates high driving forces that enhance the sensitivity of hair cells by increasing K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through force-gated channels. Similar designs have been found in insect mechanosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erler and Thurm, 1981</xref>) and chemosensory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sollai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vermeulen and Rospars, 2004</xref>), providing models to study physiological principles and components of TEP function and regulation. Many insect sensory receptor neurons are housed in a cuticular sensory organ called the sensillum. Tight junctions between support cells separate the externally facing sensillar lymph from the internal body fluid known as hemolymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shanbhag et al., 2001</xref>). The active concentration of K<sup>+</sup> in the dendritic sensillar lymph produces positive sensillum potentials (SP, +30â40 mV) as TEPs, which are known to sensitize sensory reception in mechanosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">GrÃ¼nert and Gnatzy, 1987</xref>) and chemosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">GÃ¶dde and Krefting, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Syed and Leal, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Excitation of sensory neurons drains SP, accompanied by slow adaptation of the excited receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erler and Thurm, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Syed and Leal, 2008</xref>). This suggests that immoderate activation of a single sensory neuron can deplete SP, which decreases the activities of neurons that utilize the potential for excitation. Each sensillum for mechanosensation and chemosensation houses multiple receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ray and Singhvi, 2021</xref>). Therefore, overconsumption of SP by a single cell could affect the rest of the receptor neurons in the same sensillum, because the receptor neurons share the sensillum lymph. Indeed, the reduction of SP was proposed to have a negative effect on receptor neurons that are immersed in the same sensillar lymph; a dynamic lateral inhibition between olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) occurs through âephaptic interaction,â where SP consumption by activation of one neuron was proposed to result in hyperpolarization of an adjacent neuron, reducing its response to odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van der Goes van Naters, 2013</xref>). As expected with this SP-centered model, ephaptic inhibition was reported to be mutual between <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Su et al., 2012</xref>), again because the ORNs are under the influence of a common extracellular fluid, the sensillar lymph. Such reciprocal cancellation between concomitantly excited ORNs may encode olfactory valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2022</xref>) rather than lead to signal attenuation of two olfactory inputs. Furthermore, depending on neuron size, the lateral inhibition between ORNs can be asymmetric, albeit yet to be bilateral; larger ORNs are more inhibitory than smaller ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The size dependence was suggested to be due to the differential ability of ORNs to sink SP (referred to as local field potential in the study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), probably because larger cells have more membrane surface area and cell volume to move ions to or from the sensillar lymph.</p><p>Interestingly, gustatory ephaptic inhibition was recently found to be under a genetic, but not size-aided, regulation to promote sweetness-dependent suppression of bitterness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). This is accomplished by blocking one direction of ephaptic inhibition. The hyperpolarization-activated cation current in sGRNs through the <italic>Ih-</italic>encoded hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) is necessary to resist the inhibition of sGRNs laterally induced by bGRN activation. Furthermore, such unilateral ephaptic inhibition is achieved against cell size gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). Larger bGRNs are readily suppressed by the activation of smaller sGRNs, but not vice versa. Thus, HCN is implemented to inhibit bGRNs in terms of unilateral ephaptic inhibition when a bitter chemical is concomitantly presented with strong sweetness. Here, in addition to the ephaptic interaction, we find that the same HCN expressed in sGRNs promotes the activity of bGRNs as a means of homeostatic sensory adaptation, for which HCN prevents sGRNs from depleting SP even with the long-term exposure to the sweet-rich environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HCN expressed in sweet-sensing GRNs is required for normal bitter GRN responses</title><p>The hair-like gustatory sensilla in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> labellum are categorized into L-, i-, and s-type based on their relative bristle lengths. Each sensillum contains 2 (i-type) or 4 (s- and L-type) GRNs along with a mechanosensory neuron. The i- and s-type bristle sensilla contain both an sGRN and a bGRN, while each L-type bristle sensillum contains an sGRN but no bGRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishimoto and Tanimura, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanimura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>). As a model of gustatory homeostasis, we mainly examined the i-type bristles using single sensillum extracellular recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodgson et al., 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du et al., 2016</xref>) because of their simple neuronal composition. Compared to WT (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> in a Canton S background), we observed reduced spiking responses to 2 mM caffeine in two strong loss-of-function alleles of the HCN gene, <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez-Chiappe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Ih<sup>MI03196-TG4.0</sup>/+</italic> (<italic>Ih-TG4.0/+</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Note that <italic>Ih-TG4.0</italic> is homozygous lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). A copy of the <italic>Ih-</italic>containing genomic fragment {<italic>Ih</italic>} rescued the spiking defect in <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic>. The GRN responses to 50 mM sucrose were not altered in <italic>Ih</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Other bitter chemical compounds, berberine, lobeline, theophylline, and umbelliferone, also required <italic>Ih</italic> for normal bGRN responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Although we observe here that <italic>Ih</italic> pertains to bGRN excitability, <italic>Ih</italic> was previously found to be expressed in sGRNs but not bGRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). To test whether HCN expression in sGRNs is required for bGRN activity, GRN-specific RNAi knockdown of <italic>Ih</italic> was performed with either <italic>Gr64f-</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref><italic>) or Gr89a-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Ih</italic> knockdown in sGRNs (<italic>Gr64f-Gal4</italic>), but not bGRNs (<italic>Gr89a-Gal4</italic>), led to reduced bGRN responses to caffeine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that HCN acts in sGRNs for a normal bGRN response. Unlike the results in <italic>Ih</italic> mutant alleles, the spiking response of <italic>Ih</italic>-knock-downed sGRNs (<italic>Gr64f</italic> cells) to 50 mM sucrose was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To exclude the possibility that <italic>Ih</italic> is required for normal gustatory development, we temporally controlled <italic>Ih</italic> RNAi knockdown to occur only in adulthood, which produced similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The differential effects of gene disruptions and RNAi on sGRN activity will be discussed further below with additional results. Introduction of <italic>Ih-RF</italic> cDNA (FlyBase id: FBtr0290109), which previously rescued <italic>Ih</italic> deficiency in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2015</xref>), to sGRNs but not bGRNs restored the decreased spiking response to 2 mM caffeine in <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic>, corroborating that sGRNs are required to express <italic>Ih</italic> for bGRN regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, ectopic cDNA expression in bGRNs of <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> but not in sGRNs increased the spiking response to 50 mM sucrose compared to its controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), although the same misexpression failed to raise the spiking to 2 mM caffeine. These results suggest not only that <italic>Ih</italic> innately expressed in sGRNs is necessary for the activity of bGRNs, but also that <italic>Ih</italic> expression in one GRN may promote the activity of the other adjacent GRN in <italic>Ih-</italic>deficient animals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel is necessary for the normal activity of bitter-sensing GRNs (bGRNs), although expressed in sweet-sensing GRNs (sGRNs).</title><p>Representative 5 s-long traces of sensillum recording with either caffeine or sucrose at the indicated concentrations, shown along with box plots of spiking frequencies.

SP is known as a transepithelial potential between the sensillum lymph and the hemolymph, generated by active ion transport through support cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Left). To measure SP, we repurposed the Tasteprobe pre-amplifier to record potential changes in a direct current (DC) mode (see Materials and methods for details), which was originally devised to register action potentials from sensory neurons. With the new setting, the contact of the recording electrode with a labellar bristle induced a rise in potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Right). The recording was stabilized within 20 s, and a raw potential value was acquired as an average of the data between the time points, 20 and 60 s after the initial contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). After the examination of all the bristle sensilla of interest, the fly was impaled at the head to obtain the DC bias (also known as DC offset), which insects are known to exhibit in the body independent of SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MarionâPoll and van der Pers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Next, the sensillum potential was obtained by subtracting the DC bias from the raw potential value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Furthermore, silencing sGRNs (<italic>Gr5a-Gal4</italic> cells) by expressing the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baines et al., 2001</xref>), phenocopied <italic>Gr64af</italic> in response to 2 mM caffeine stimulating the i-type bristles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This increased responsiveness of bGRNs is unlikely due to positive feedback resulting from the sGRN inactivation through the neural circuitry in the brain, because the tetanus toxin light chain (TNT) expressed in sGRNs, which blocks chemical synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broadie et al., 1995</xref>), failed to raise bGRN activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Strikingly, when we combined the sGRN-hindering genotypes (<italic>Gr5a&gt;Kir2.1</italic> and <italic>Gr64af</italic>) with the <italic>Ih</italic> alleles <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> or <italic>Ih-TG4.0,</italic> we found that the sGRN inhibition-induced increase in bGRN activity in response to caffeine could be commonly relieved by the disruptions in the <italic>Ih</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>). This result suggests that HCN suppresses sGRN activation, while HCN expressed in sGRNs is required for unimpaired bGRN activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>).

Interestingly, the ectopic expression reduced bGRN activity at these high caffeine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The flattened dose dependence suggests that ectopically expressed HCN suppresses strong excitation of bGRNs. In contrast, sGRNs were upregulated by the misexpression of <italic>Ih</italic> in bGRNs with increased spiking in response to 10 and 50 mM sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), implying that <italic>Ih</italic> increases the activity of the neighboring GRN by reducing that of <italic>Ih</italic>-expressing GRNs.

These results from misexpression experiments corroborate the postulation that sGRNs are suppressed by expressing HCN.

To investigate this possibility, we fed WT and <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> flies overnight with either non-sweet sorbitol alone (200 mM) or a sweet mixture of sorbitol (200 mM)+sucrose (100 mM).

Note that sucrose was not used in CAFE, because the presence of sweet stimuli was shown to suppress bGRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). Indicative of reduced bitter sensitivity, <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> flies showed dramatically decreased caffeine avoidance, relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, when flies were removed from the cornmeal food for 20 hr, both WT and <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> showed similarly robust bitter avoidance. The defect observed in the <italic>Ih</italic> mutant on the sweet cornmeal diet could be rescued by reintroducing a genomic fragment covering the <italic>Ih</italic> locus ({<italic>Ih</italic>}). These results were recapitulated with other bitters, lobeline, and theophylline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To examine whether caffeine avoidance requires <italic>Ih</italic> expression in sGRNs, CAFE was performed with GRN-specific RNAi knockdown of <italic>Ih</italic>. For the RNAi experiments, flies were kept overnight on either the non-sweet diet with sorbitol (200 mM) or the sweet diet with additional sucrose (100 mM). <italic>Ih</italic> knockdown in sGRNs, but not bGRNs, led to a deficit in the avoidance only when the flies had been on the sweet diet, indicating that HCN expression in sGRNs is necessary for robust caffeine avoidance in a sweet environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, the sweetness of the diet can compromise the function of bGRNs co-housed with sGRNs in the same sensilla, which is mitigated by HCN expression in sGRNs. Such a role of HCN is essential for bitter avoidance of flies, considering their likely prolonged exposure to sweetness in their natural habitat of overripe fruit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results provide multiple lines of evidence that HCN suppresses HCN-expressing GRNs, thereby sustaining the activity of neighboring GRNs within the same sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We propose that this modulation occurs by restricting SP consumption through HCN-dependent neuronal suppression rather than via chemical and electrical synaptic transmission. The lack of increased bGRN activity with TNT expression in sGRNs, coupled with the increase observed with Kir2.1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>), indicates minimal involvement of synaptic vesicle-dependent transmission. The possibility of a neuropeptide-dependent mechanism is unlikely, given our ectopic gain-of-function studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To explain the misexpression results with neuropeptide pathways, both s- and bGRNs must be equipped with the same set of a neuropeptide/receptor system, which is incompatible with the inverse relationship between the two GRNs in excitability observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Furthermore, this inverse relationship argues against electrical synapses through gap junctions, which typically synchronize the excitability of pre-and postsynaptic neurons. Therefore, our findings propose an unconventional mechanism of neuronal interaction.</p><p>HCNs are encoded by four different genes in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shah, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biel et al., 2009</xref>), and are known to be present in mammalian sensory receptor cells. In cochlear hair cells, HCN1 and HCN2 were reported to form a complex with a stereociliary tip-link protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2012</xref>), while in vestibular hair cells, HCN1 is essential for normal balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horwitz et al., 2011</xref>). HCN1 was also immunostained in cone and rod photoreceptors, as well as retinal bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion neurons, with deletion of the encoding gene resulting in prolonged light responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knop et al., 2008</xref>). A subset of mouse taste cells was labeled for HCN1 and HCN4 transcripts and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stevens et al., 2001</xref>), similar to our observation of selective HCN expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> GRNs. HCN2 is expressed in small nociceptive neurons that mediate diabetic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsantoulas et al., 2017</xref>). However, the precise roles of HCNs in regulating these respective sensory physiologies remain to be elucidated.</p><p>HCN is well-known for its âfunnyâ electrophysiological characteristics, stabilizing the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shah, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biel et al., 2009</xref>). As a population of HCN channels remains open at the resting membrane potential, HCN serves to suppress neuronal excitation in two ways. First, it increases the inward current required to depolarize the membrane and trigger action potentials, owing to the low membrane input resistance resulting from the HCN-dependent passive conductance. Second, the closing of HCN induced by membrane depolarization counteracts the depolarization, since the reduction of the standing cation influx through HCN is hyperpolarizing. Conversely, HCNs also allow neurons to resist membrane hyperpolarization because the hyperpolarization activates HCNs to conduct depolarizing inward currents. Consequently, HCN channels effectively dampen fluctuations in membrane potential, whether they lead to depolarization or hyperpolarization. Our findings in this study align with the former property of HCNs, as <italic>Drosophila</italic> HCN is essential for moderating sGRN excitation to preserve SP and bGRN activity when flies inhabit in sweet environments. On the other hand, our previous study showed that HCN-dependent resilience to hyperpolarizing inhibition of sGRNs lateralizes gustatory ephaptic inhibition to dynamically repress bGRNs, when exposed to strong sweetness together with bitterness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, depending on the given feeding contexts, the electrophysiological properties of HCN in sGRNs lead to playing dual roles with opposing effects in regulating bGRNs. The stabilization of membrane potential by HCNs was reported to decrease the spontaneous activity of neurons, as evidenced by miniature postsynaptic currents suppressed by presynaptic HCNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2022</xref>). In this regard, the lower SP observed in the <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> labellar bristles than that of WT, even on the nonsweet sorbitol food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), may be attributed to the more facile fluctuations in resting membrane potential which could regulate the consumption of SP (further discussion below).</p><p>Cell-specific knockdown of <italic>Ih</italic> in sGRNs led to increased sGRN responses to 50 mM sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), although disruptions of the <italic>Ih</italic> locus did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This inconsistency may stem from differences between alleles and the RNAi knockdown in residual <italic>Ih</italic> expression or in <italic>Ih-</italic>deficient sites. The lack of <italic>Ih</italic> in sGRNs can induce two different effects in neuronal excitation: (1) easier depolarization of sGRNs due to the loss of standing HCN currents at rest as suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and (2) a decrease of receptor-mediated inward currents, expected due to SP reductions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2GâL</xref>). Assuming that some level of HCN expression may persist in RNAi knockdowns compared to mutants, these opposing effects on sGRN excitability may largely offset each other in response to 50 mM sucrose in the <italic>Ih</italic> mutants, but not in the knockdowned flies. The ectopic introduction of <italic>Ih-RF</italic> into bGRNs of <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> significantly increased the mean SP compared to the control genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>), leaving sGRNs devoid of functional <italic>Ih</italic>. This genotype allows the examination of sGRNs lacking <italic>Ih</italic>, with SP unimpaired, which is supposed to reflect the net effect of <italic>Ih</italic> on sGRN excitability excluding the influence from reduced SP. Interestingly, the ectopic rescue resulted in elevated firing responses to 50 mM sucrose compared to the cDNA rescue in sGRNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), a proper control with <italic>Ih</italic> expression and SP both unimpaired. On the other hand, the differing sites of <italic>Ih</italic> deficiency might create the inconsistency. The protein trap reporter <italic>Ih-TG4.0-Gal4</italic> previously showed widespread expression of HCN in the labellum, including non-neuronal cells, implying the possibility of unknown bGRN-regulating HCN-dependent mechanisms, potentially harbored in nonneuronal cells. Overall, our cell-specific loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies advocate that HCN suppresses HCN-expressing GRNs, which thereby increases SP to promote the activity of the neighboring GRNs.</p><p>Only the dendrites of GRNs face the sensillar lymph, separated from the hemolymph by tight junctions between support cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shanbhag et al., 2001</xref>). The inward current through the ion channels that respond to sensory reception in the dendrites is thought to be a major sink for SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Syed and Leal, 2008</xref>), consistent with the incremented SP in the <italic>Gr64af</italic> mutant lacking the sucrose-sensing molecular receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these points, it was somewhat unexpected that the membrane potential regulator HCN preserved SP, yet implying that the sensory signaling in the dendrite is likely under voltage-dependent control. In line with HCN, shifting the membrane potential toward the K<sup>+</sup> equilibrium by overexpressing Kir2.1 in sGRNs upregulated bGRN activity and SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), corroborating that the membrane potential in sGRNs is a regulator of the sensory signaling cascade in the dendrites. Note that the sensillum lymph contains high [K<sup>+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sollai et al., 2008</xref>), which would not allow strong inactivation of sGRNs and SP increases if Kir2.1 operates mostly in the dendrites. The increases in SP, coinciding with the apparent silencing of sGRNs by Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2023</xref>), propose that lowering the membrane potential in the soma and the axon suppresses the consumption of SP probably by inhibiting the gustatory signaling-associated inward currents in the dendrite.

These hair cells share the endolymph in the scala media (cochlear duct), representing a case of TEP shared by a large group of sensory receptor cells. Since HCNs were found to be unnecessary for mechanotransduction itself in the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horwitz et al., 2010</xref>), they may play a regulatory role in fine-tuning the balance between the endocochlear potential maintenance and mechanotransduction sensitivity for hearing, as in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gustatory system. Multiple mechanosensory neurons are found to be co-housed also in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mechanosensory organs such as hair plates and chordotonal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016</xref>). Given that each mechanosensory neuron is specifically tuned to detect different mechanical stimuli such as the angle, velocity, and acceleration of joint movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mamiya et al., 2018</xref>), some elements of these movements may occur more frequently and persistently than others in a specific ecological niche. Such biased stimulation would require HCN-dependent moderation to preserve the sensitivity of other mechanoreceptors sharing the sensillar lymph. We showed that ectopic expression of <italic>Ih</italic> in bGRNs also upheld SP and the activity of the neighboring sGRNs, underscoring the independent capability of HCN in SP preservation. Despite such an option available, the preference for sGRNs over bGRNs in HCN-mediated taste homeostasis implies that <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> may have ecologically adapted to the high sweetness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durkin et al., 2021</xref>) prevalent in their feeding niche, such as overripe or fermented fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate whether and how respective niches of various insect species differentiate the HCN expression pattern in sensory receptor neurons for ecological adaptation.</p><p>In this report, we introduce a peripheral coding design for feeding decisions that relies on HCN. HCN operating in sGRNs allows uninterrupted bitter avoidance, even when flies reside in sweet environments. This is achieved in parallel with an ephaptic mechanism of taste interaction by the same HCN in sGRNs, whereby bitter aversion can be dynamically attenuated in the simultaneous presence of sweetness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). Further studies are warranted to uncover similar principles of HCN-dependent adaptation in other sensory contexts. It would also be interesting to explore whether the role of HCN in the sensory adaptation consistently correlates with lateralized ephaptic inhibition between sensory receptors, given that sensory cells expressing HCN can resist both depolarization and hyperpolarization of the membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cantonized w1118</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gr64af</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr. Moon at Yonsei U.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ihf03355</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC: 85660;

Each of the i-a, i-b, and s-b type sensillum of 3â5 day-old flies were identified from the sensillum map described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>). The reference electrode was filled with HL3.1 solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2004</xref>). The recording electrode contained tastants solubilized in the electrolyte 2 (i-type) or 30 (L- and s-type) mM tricholine citrate (TCC). The concentrations of bitter chemicals were indicated in the corresponding figure legend. The spiking frequency (Hz) was calculated from the number of spikes in the first 5 s or the second 5 s as indicated, and compared between genotypes or experimental conditions. The signals picked up by the electrodes were amplified by the preamplifier Tasteprobe (Syntech) and digitized at a rate of 20 kb/s by PowerLab with Labchart software (ADInstruments). The number of experiments indicated in the figures are the number of naÃ¯ve bristles tested. The naÃ¯ve bristles were from at least three different animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Sensillum potential recordings</title><p>Media with or without sweetness were prepared as follows; the sorbitol medium consisted of 0.5% agarose and 200 mM sorbitol, while the sweet medium contained 0.5% agarose, 200 mM sorbitol, and 100 mM sucrose. Flies were kept overnight on these media before the experiment. For SP recordings, the recording electrode contained 2 mM TCC as the electrolyte, and Tasteprobe was set to record in âpass-throughâ mode with DC (in the High-Pass filter window) and 100 ms zeroing time settings. Amplified signals were digitized at a rate of 100 Hz using PowerLab/Labchart. First, differential potentials were measured between a recording electrode on a taste sensillum and a reference electrode inserted into the labellum as performed for the extracellular bristle sensillum recordings. DC bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MarionâPoll and van der Pers, 1996</xref>) was measured by impaling the recording electrode into the thorax of the same animals used for SP measurements. DC bias was subsequently subtracted from the initial readouts of the differential potential to evaluate SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The resulting SPs were averaged during a 40 s long recording 20 s after initial contact, which was subsequently used for further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Bitter avoidance assay</title><p>Twenty flies, aged 3â5 days and consisting of 10 males and 10 females, were used to assess bitter avoidance using capillary feeder assay (CAFE). To test the bitter sensitivity of each genotype of interest in feeding behavior, flies were kept on regular cornmeal food or starved on nonsweet water-soaked Kimwipes overnight, and then given a choice between water and 4 mM caffeine for 8 hr. For RNAi experiments, 200 mM sorbitol is used in nonsweet food and sweet food, the latter of which included 100 mM sucrose in addition. Avoidance indices were obtained as the net volume fraction of water consumption subtracted by the volume fraction of caffeine ingestion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical calculation was performed using Sigmaplot 14.5 (Systat Software). The sample sizes and the statistical tests are indicated in each figure or in the legend. Normal distribution and heteroskedasticity were assessed using Shapiro-Wilk and Brown-Forsythe tests, respectively, before parametric tests. When these tests were failed, non-parametric tests were performed. However, for some cases, heteroskedasticity with normality led us to perform Welchâs t-test (Sigmaplot 14) or Welchâs ANOVA. The latter was followed by the Games-Howell test as a parametric analysis using the Excel spreadsheet available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biostathandbook.com/welchanova.xls">https://www.biostathandbook.com/welchanova.xls</ext-link>.

The authors find that HCN, a hyperpolarization-activated cation channel, suppresses the activity of GRNs in which it is expressed, preventing those GRNs from depleting the sensillum potential, and thereby promotes the activity of neighboring GRNs in the same sensilla. HCN is expressed in sugar GRNs, so HCN dampens excitation of sugar GRNs and promotes excitation of bitter GRNs. Impairing HCN expression in sugar GRNs depletes the sensillum potential and decreases bitter responses, especially when flies are fed on a sugar-rich diet, and this leads to decreased bitter aversion in a feeding assay. The authors' conclusions are supported by genetic manipulations, electrophysiological recordings, and behavioral assays.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Non-synaptic interactions between neurons that share an extracellular environment (sometimes called &quot;ephaptic&quot; interactions) have not been well-studied, and certainly not in the insect taste system. A major strength of this study is the new insight it provides into how these interactions can impact sensory coding and behavior.</p><p>(2) The authors use many different types of genetic manipulations to dissect the role of HCN in GRN function, including mutants, RNAi, overexpression, ectopic expression, and neuronal silencing. Their results convincingly show that HCN impacts the sensillum potential and has both cell-autonomous and nonautonomous effects that go in opposite directions. Temporally controlled RNAi experiments suggest that the effect is not due to developmental changes. There are a couple of conflicting or counterintuitive results, but the authors discuss potential explanations.</p><p>(3) Experiments comparing flies raised on different food sources suggest an explanation for why the system may have evolved the way that it did: when flies live in a sugar-rich environment, their bitter sensitivity decreases, and HCN expression in sugar GRNs helps to counteract this decrease. New experiments in the revised paper show the timecourse of how sugar diet affects GRN responses and sensillum potential.</p><p>Weaknesses/Limitations:</p><p>(1) The RNAi Gal80ts experiment only compares responses of experimental flies housed at different temperatures without showing control flies (e.g. Gal4/+ and UAS/+ controls) to confirm that observed differences are not due to nonspecific effects of temperature. Certainly temperature cannot account for sugar and bitter GRN firing rates changing in opposite directions, but it may have some kind of effect.</p><p>(2) The experiments where flies are put on sugar vs. sorbitol food show that the diet clearly affects GRN responses and sensillum potential, even for food exposures as short as 1-4 hours, but it is not clear to what extent the GRNs in the labellum are being stimulated during those incubation periods. The flies are most likely not feeding over a 1 hour period if they were not starved beforehand, in which case it is not clear how many times the labellar GRNs would contact the food substrate.</p><p>(3) The authors mention that HCN may impact the resting potential in addition to changing the excitability of the cell through various mechanisms. It would be informative to record the resting potential and other neuronal properties, but this is very difficult for GRNs, so the current study is not able to determine exactly how HCN affects GRN activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96602.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors show that HCN loss-of-function mutation causes a decrease in spiking in bitter GRNs (bGRN) while leaving sweet GRN (sGRN) response in the same sensillum intact.

They were also able to rescue the response by exogenous expression. Ectopic expression of HCN in bitter neurons had no effect. Next, they measure the sensillum potential and find that sensillum potential is also affected by HCN channel perturbation. These findings lead them to speculate that HCN in sGRN increases sGRN spiking, which in turn affects bGRNs. To test this idea, they carried out multiple perturbations aimed at decreasing sGRN activity. They found that reducing sGRN activity by either using receptor mutant or by expressing Kir (a K+ channel) in sGRN increased bGRN responses. These responses also increase the sensillum potential.

Specifically, it remains poorly understood which receptors or channels are important for maintaining the transepithelial potential between the sensillum lymph and the hemolymph (known as the sensillum potential), and how this affects the excitability of neurons housed in the same sensilla.</p><p>Lee et al. used single-sensillum recordings (SSR) of the labellar taste sensilla to demonstrate that the HCN channel, Ih, is critical for maintaining sensillum potential in flies. Ih is expressed in sugar-sensing GRNs (sGRNs) but affects the excitability of both the sGRNs and the bitter-sensing GRNs (bGRNs) in the same sensilla. Ih mutant flies have decreased sensillum potential, and bGRNs of Ih mutant flies have a decreased response to the bitter compound caffeine. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Ih in bGRNs also increases sGRN response to sucrose, suggesting that Ih-dependent increase in sensillum potential is not specific to Ih expressed in sGRNs. The authors further demonstrated, using both SSR and behavior assays, that exposure to sugars in the food substrate is important for the Ih-dependent sensitization of bGRNs. The experiments conducted in this paper are of interest to the chemosensory field. The observation that Ih is important for the activity in bGRNs albeit expressed in sGRNs is especially fascinating and highlights the importance of non-synaptic interactions in the taste system.</p><p>Comments on the revised version:</p><p>The authors performed additional analyses/experiments to address my previous major points. I'm satisfied with most of their answers:</p><p>(1) Sensilla types are labeled in all figures. Proper GAL4 and UAS controls were added to the figures.</p><p>(2) Fig. 2A was added to illustrate the important concepts of SP. Fig. 5E was added to show a working model, which could be better but is alright.</p><p>(3) Although not in my list of major points, I appreciate the newly added Fig. 5A and 5B, which demonstrate the long-lasting effect of exposure to sugars.</p><p>(4) Post-stimulus histogram was added for Fig. 4.</p><p>(5) Regarding the expression of Ih in bGRNs and sGRNs, the authors referred to their preprint (Lee et al., 2023, Fig 5C, D, suppl movie 1 and 2). The authors stated that &quot;On the other hand, bGRNs labeled by Gr66a-LexA appeared to colocalize only partially with GFP when the confocal stacks were examined image by image.&quot; This interpretation unfortunately does not align with my viewing of the images and the movies. Just looking at the images and the movies alone, one would conclude that Ih is indeed expressed in both bGRNs and sGRNs. Notably, the Ih-TG4.0 is expressed in other non-neuronal cells in the labellum. That being said, I agree with the authors that even if Ih is indeed expressed in bGRNs, it would not affect SP (Fig. 1C, D of this paper, Fig. 5B of Lee et al., 2023 preprint), so I think the authors have addressed my major concern.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96602.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>MinHyuk</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Korea Brain Research Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Daegu</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Se Hoon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Korea Brain Research Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Daegu</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Joo</surname><given-names>Kyeung Min</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Suwon</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Jae Young</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sungkyunkwan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Suwon</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Kyung-Hoon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Suwon</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>KyeongJin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Korea Brain Research Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Daegu</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study identifies new types of interactions between <italic>Drosophila</italic> gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) and shows that these interactions influence sensory responses and behavior.

However, we respectfully disagree that the SP homeostasis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gustation we describe here pertains to ephaptic interaction. Although SP reduction was proposed as the basis of post-ephaptic hyperpolarization in Drosophila olfaction, we find that SP changes are too slow to mediate the fast action of ephaptic inhibition in gustation, reported in the ref#17. We observed a slow, sweet-dependent SP depletion (Fig. 5B, revised), which takes more than one hour. The real-time change of SP was also slow even upon contact with 200-mM sucrose; this result was set aside for another manuscript in preparation. Therefore, we believe the main findings in this paper concern the homeostatic preservation of SP for the maintenance of gustatory function, not ephaptic interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors use many different types of genetic manipulations to dissect the role of HCN in GRN function, including mutants, RNAi, overexpression, ectopic expression, and neuronal silencing.

There are a couple of conflicting or counterintuitive results, but the authors discuss potential explanations.</p><p>(3) Experiments comparing flies raised on different food sources suggest an explanation for why the system may have evolved the way that it did: when flies live in a sugar-rich environment, their bitter sensitivity decreases, and HCN expression in sugar GRNs helps to counteract this decrease.</p><p>Weaknesses/Limitations:</p><p>(1) The genetic manipulations were constitutive (e.g. Ih mutations, RNAi, or misexpression), and depleting Ih from birth could lead to compensatory effects that change the function of the neurons or sensillum.

The result is now included as Fig. 1-figure supplement 2. At 29C, a non-permissive temperature for GAL80ts which allows GAL4-dependent expression Ih-RNAi, we observed that bGRN responses were decreased and sGRN responses were increased compared to the control maintained at 18Â°C, and this is in parallel with the result in Fig. 1C,D. For this experiment, we inserted âTo exclude the possibility that Ih is required for normal gustatory development, we temporally controlled Ih RNAi knockdown to occur only in adulthood, which produced similar results (Fig. 1-figure supplement 2).â (~line 113).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The behavioral experiment shows a striking loss of bitter sensitivity, but it was only conducted for one bitter compound at one concentration.

Since some of the measurements in control flies seem to vary (e.g., spiking rate), it is important to compare the experimental flies to both controls to ensure that any observed effects are in fact due to the transgene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers for raising this point. Indeed, there was a small logical flaw with the controls. We have now included all the necessary controls for Fig. 1C-F, Fig. 2I,J, Fig. 4E, and Fig. 5D, as reviewers suggested. These experiments remained statistically significant after including the new control groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I was surprised that manipulations of sugar GRNs (e.g. Ih knockdown, Gr64a-f deletion, or Kir silencing) can impact the sensillum potential and bitter GRN responses even in experiments where no sugar was presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We are afraid there is a misunderstanding on the early part of the paper. We suspected that the manipulations impacted bGRNs and SP due to the sweetness in the regular cornmeal food, as stated in lines 214-220 âTypically, we performed extracellular recordings on flies 4-5 days after eclosion, during which they were kept in a vial with fresh regular cornmeal food containing ~400 mM D-glucose. The presence of sweetness in the food would impose long-term stimulation of sGRNs, potentially requiring the delimitation of sGRN excitability for the homeostatic maintenance of gustatory functions. To investigate this possibility, we fed WT and Ihf03355 flies overnight with either non-sweet sorbitol alone (200 mM) or a sweet mixture of sorbitol (200 mM) + sucrose (100 mM).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I believe the authors are suggesting that the effects of sugar GRN activity (e.g., from consuming sugar in the fly food prior to the experiment) can have long-lasting effects, but it wasn't entirely clear if this is their primary explanation or on what timescale those long-lasting effects would occur. How much / how long of a sugar exposure do the flies need for these effects to be triggered, and how long do those effects last once sugar is removed?</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to address this point with additional experiments (Fig. 5A,B). The reduction of SP could be observed in WT and HCN-deficient mutants with similar degrees 1 hr after the flies were transferred from nonsweet sorbitol-containing vials to sweet sucrose-containing ones. Moreover, the mutants, but not WT, showed further depression of SP when the sweetness persisted in the media for 4 hrs and overnight. This long-term exposure to sweetness longer than 1 hr may simulates the feeding on the regular sweet cornmeal food. The recovery of SP was also tested by removing flies from the sweet media after overnight-long sweet exposure and placing them in sorbitol food. SPs of WT and the mutants were recovered to the similar levels 1 hr after separating the animals from sweetness, although the HCN-lacking mutants showed much lower SP right after overnight sweetness exposure. The unimpaired recovery of the mutants suggests that HCN is independent of generating transepithelial potential itself. Therefore, regardless of HCN, SP changes are not fast even in the presence of strong sweetness, and SP is much better guarded when sGRNs express HCN in a sweet environment.</p><p>We inserted the following at ~line 260 to describe the newly added recovery experiment: âFollowing overnight sweet exposure, SPs of WT and Ihf03355 were recovered to similar levels after 1-hr incubation with sorbitol only food. However, it was after 4 hrs on the sorbitol food that the two lines exhibited SP levels similar to those achieved by overnight incubation with sorbitol only food (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that SP depletion by sweetness is a slow process, and that the dysregulated reduction and recovery of SPs in Ihf03355 manifest only after long-term conditioning with and without sweetness, respectively.â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors mention that HCN may impact the resting potential in addition to changing the excitability of the cell through various mechanisms. It would be informative to record the resting potential and other neuronal properties, but this is very difficult for GRNs, so the current study is not able to determine exactly how HCN affects GRN activity.</p></disp-quote><p>On this point, we cannot but rely on previous studies of biophysical and electrophysiological characterization on mammalian HCN channels and a heterologous expression study that revealed a robust hyperpolarization-activated cation current from <italic>Drosophila</italic> HCN channels (PMID: 15804582).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors start by showing that HCN loss-of-function mutation causes a decrease in spiking in bitter GRNs (bGRN) while leaving sweet GRN (sGRN) response in the same sensillum intact. They show that a perturbation of HCN channels in sweet-sensing neurons causes a similar decrease while increasing the response of sugar neurons. They were also able to rescue the response by exogenous expression. Ectopic expression of HCN in bitter neurons had no effect. Next, they measure the sensillum potential and find that sensillum potential is also affected by HCN channel perturbation. These findings lead them to speculate that HCN in sGRN increases sGRN spiking which in turn affects bGRNs. To test this idea that carried out multiple perturbations aimed at decreasing sGRN activity. They found that decreasing sGRN activity by either using receptor mutant or by expressing Kir (a K+ channel) in sGRN increased bGRN responses. These responses also increase the sensillum potential. Finally, they show that these changes are behaviorally relevant as conditions that increase sGRN activity decrease avoidance of bitter substances.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>There is solid evidence that perturbation of sweet GRNs affects bitter GRN in the same sensillum. The measurement of transsynaptic potential and how it changes is also interesting and supports the authors' conclusion.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The ionic basis of how perturbation in GRN affects the transepithelial potential which in turn affects the second neuron is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We speculate that HCN-dependent membrane potential regulation, rather than ionic composition change, is responsible for the observed SP preservation, as further discussed as an author response in the section of âRecommendations for the authorsâ. The transepithelial potential can be dissipated by increased conductance through receptor-linked ion channels following gustatory receptor activation in GRNs. The volume of the sensillum lymph is very small according to electron micrographs of horizontally sliced bristles (PMID: 11456419). Therefore, robust excitation of a gustatory neuron may easily deplete the extracellular potential built as a form of polarized ion concentrations across the tight junction. When the consumption is too strong and extended, the neighboring neuron, which share TEP with the activated GRN, can be negatively affected. We propose that HCN suppresses overexcitation of sGRNs by means of membrane potential stabilization. This stabilization prevents sGRNs from excessively reducing the TEP, thereby protecting the activity of neighboring bGRNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Ephaptic inhibition between neurons housed in the same sensilla has been long discovered in flies, but the molecular basis underlying this inhibition is underexplored.

Ephaptic inhibition is expected to be instantaneous, whereas we find that SP reduction in gustation is very slow. Therefore, we would like to indicate that the findings we report in this manuscript are not directly related to ephaptic inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lee et al. used single-sensillum recordings (SSR) of the labellar taste sensilla to demonstrate that the HCN channel, Ih, is critical for maintaining sensillum potential in flies. Ih is expressed in sugar-sensing GRNs (sGRNs) but affects the excitability of both the sGRNs and the bitter-sensing GRNs (bGRNs) in the same sensilla. Ih mutant flies have decreased sensillum potential, and bGRNs of Ih mutant flies have a decreased response to the bitter compound caffeine. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Ih in bGRNs also increases sGRN response to sucrose, suggesting that Ih-dependent increase in sensillum potential is not specific to Ih expressed in sGRNs. The authors further demonstrated, using both SSR and behavior assays, that exposure to sugars in the food substrate is important for the Ih-dependent sensitization of bGRNs. The experiments conducted in this paper are of interest to the chemosensory field. The observation that Ih is important for the activity in bGRNs albeit expressed in sGRNs is especially fascinating and highlights the importance of non-synaptic interactions in the taste system.</p><p>Despite the interesting results, this paper is not written in a clear and easily understandable manner. It uses poorly defined terms without much elaboration, contains sentences that are borderline unreadable even for those in the narrower chemosensory field, and many figures can clearly benefit from more labeling and explanation. It certainly needs a bit of work.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to revise the language aspect of the manuscript after finalizing the scientific revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Below are the major points:</p><p>(1) Throughout the paper, it is assumed that Ih channels are expressed in sugar-sensing GRNs but not bitter-sensing GRNs. However, both this paper and citation #17, another paper from the same lab, contain only circumstantial evidence for the expression of Ih channels in sGRNs. A simple co-expression analysis, using the Ih-T2A-GAL4 line and Gr5a-LexA/Gr66a-LexA line, all of which are available, could easily demonstrate the co-expression. Including such a figure would significantly strengthen the conclusion of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We did conduct confocal imaging with Ih-T2A-Gal4 in combination with GRN Gal4s (ref#17 version2). The expression is very broad, including both neurons and non-neuronal cells. We observed much stronger sGRN expression than bGRN expression. But the promiscuous expression of the reporter in many cells hindered us from clearly demonstrating the void of the reporter in bGRNs. However, the functional and physiological examination of Ih-T2A-Gal4 with the neuronal modifiers such as TRPA1 and Kir2.1 in ref#17 indicates the strong and little expression of Ih in sGRNs and bGRNs, respectively. Furthermore, the RNAi kd results present another line of evidence that HCN expressed in sGRNs regulates SP and bGRN activity (Fig. 1C,D, Fig. 1-figure supplement 2). Ih-RNAi expression in bGRNs did not result in any statistically significant changes in the activities of sGRNs and bGRNs compared to controls (Fig. 1C,D, revised), advocating that Ih acts in sGRNs for the functional homeostasis of SP and GRNs, as we claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Throughout this paper, it is often unclear which class of labellar taste sensilla is being recorded. S-a, S-b, I-a, and I-b sensilla all have different sensitivities to bitters and sugars. Each figure should clearly indicate which sensilla is being recorded. Justification should be provided if recordings from different classes of sensilla are being pooled together for statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>We mainly performed SSR (single sensillum recording) on i-type bristles as they have the simplest composition of GRNs compared to s- and L-type bristles. As single s-types also contain each of s- and bGRN, we measured SP also for s-types (Figs. 2, 3F and 4D). In case of Fig.3-figure supplement 1, L-types were tested for the relationship between water cell activity and SP.

They reside in the same sensilla as sugar neurons, so are they also increased affected by Ih mutation or RNAi in sugar neurons?

Spiking responses in water GRNs were evoked by hypo-osmolarity of electrolyte (0.1 mM tricholine citrate-TCC).

These cDNA rescue and genetic interaction experiments were conducted using flies fed on fresh cornmeal food with strong sweetness, suggesting that the sweetness in the media is the likely key factor producing the genetic interaction and necessitating HCN, consistent with other results in the manuscript.

But if one compares WT in Figure 1A to Gr64a-IhRNAi in 1C, we can come to the conclusion that there is no change. In other words, the control in Figure 1C (grey) has a much higher response than WT. Similar conclusions can be made for other experiments. Is the WT response stable enough to make the conclusions made here?</p></disp-quote><p>The genetic background of each genotype may influence GRN activity to some extent. RNAi knockdown experiments are well-known for their hypomorphic nature, and their effects should be evaluated by comparison with their parental controls such as Gal4 and UAS lines. As all reviewers pointed out, we added the results from UAS control. This effort confirms that Gr89a&gt;Ih RNAi is statistically indifferent to UAS control as well as Gr64f-Gal4 control in bGRN spiking evoked by 2-mM caffeine, while Gr64f&gt;Ih RNAi showed reduced bGRN responses to 2 mM caffeine compared to all the controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 3: Why is bGRN spiking not plotted against sensillum potential to observe the dependence more directly?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting suggestion. We are not, however, equipped to measure spiking and sensillum potential simultaneously. Therefore, they are independent experiments, and we treated them accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 4: Why bGRN response is only affected at high caffeine concentrations is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We were also surprised by the differences in the dose dependence results of b- and sGRNs, genetically manipulated to mis-express and over-express HCN in Fig. 4A and 4E, respectively. Each gustatory neuron likely has distinct sets of players and parameters that set its own membrane potential and excitability.</p><p>We can think of a possibility that there might be a range of membrane potentials within which HCN does not engage. In bGRNs, the resting membrane potential may lie low within this range, so that some degrees of membrane depolarization by low concentrations of caffeine do not significantly close HCN channels, thus preventing their hyperpolarizing effects. On the other hand, the membrane potential of sGRNs may be high within this range, showing suppressive effects at all tested sucrose concentrations. However, we find this explanation is too speculative to include in the main text, while we stated in the original manuscript, âimplying a complex cell-specific regulation of GRN excitability.â (line 210).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Minor:</p><p>L98 - there is a small typo</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L274: &quot;funny&quot; !?</p></disp-quote><p>âFunnyâ currents, denoted If, were initially observed by electrophysiologists and later attributed to HCN channels, now indicated by Ih (thus the gene name Ih in <italic>Drosophila</italic>). These currents were termed &quot;funny&quot; due to their unusual properties compared to other currents.

Neuropeptides, which are chemical neurotransmitters along with small neurotransmitters, were mentioned following the discussion on synaptic transmission to suggest alternative pathways for excitability regulation. This inclusion is meant to provide a comprehensive overview of potential mechanisms influencing GRN activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Congratulations on your fascinating research! The results are certainly of interest to the chemosensory field. However, I suggest using academic editing services to enhance the clarity of your text and ensure that the terminology and jargon align with standard usage in the field. The current choice of words may not be consistent with commonly used terms. As it is now, the writing might not fully showcase the compelling story and the effort behind your study, and is underselling your interesting results. Proper refinement could make sure your valuable findings are appropriately recognized.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your comments and apologize for any difficulties reviewers faced during the review process. We are currently prioritizing the review of scientific content and plan to address language issues in a subsequent revision. It would be very helpful for future revisions if the problematic sentences or expressions could be indicated in detail after this revision. This will allow us to ensure that our terminology and expression align with standard usage in the field, and that our findings are clearly and effectively communicated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) Line 110: what is Ih-RF?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that we relied on a reference in describing the cDNA. The following clause was inserted with additional reference and the Flybase id: â(Flybase id: FBtr0290109), which previously rescued Ih deficiency in other contexts17,26 ,â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 158: Gr64af mutant flies still have Gr5a and a residual response to fructose and sucrose (Slone, Amrein 2007).</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the line to âis severely impaired in sucrose and glucose sensingâ, since there is a substantial loss of sucrose and glucose sensing in both Gr64af from Kim et al 2018 and DGr64 from Slone et al 2007, when they were examined by the proboscis extension reflex assay. This was also confirmed in the study by Jiao et al 2009. We also deleted âsugar-ageusicâ and instead describe the mutant âimpaired in sucrose and glucose sensingâ in Fig. 3 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 264-273 seem unnecessary. This paper is not about the function of HCN in mammals, and these discussions seem largely irrelevant.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that it is important to position our results within a broader context by discussing the potential implications of our findings for sensory systems of other animals. As we stated, HCN channels have been localized in mammalian sensory systems, but their roles are often not well understood. By including this discussion, we aim to highlight the relevance of our findings beyond the model organism used in our study and suggest possible areas for future research in mammalian systems.</p></body></sub-article></article>
