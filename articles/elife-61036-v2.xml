one-trial learning dependent on basolateral amygdala projection neurons (BLApn). Its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. RNAseq from BLApn identified changes in multiple candidate learning-related transcripts including the expected immediate early gene <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Stk11</italic>, a master kinase of the AMP-related kinase pathway with important roles in growth, metabolism and development, but not previously implicated in learning. Deletion of <italic>Stk11</italic> in BLApn blocked memory prior to training, but not following it and increased neuronal excitability. Conversely, BLApn had reduced excitability following CTA. BLApn knockout of a second learning-related gene, <italic>Fos</italic>, also increased excitability and impaired learning. Independently increasing BLApn excitability chemogenetically during CTA also impaired memory. STK11 and C-FOS activation were independent of one another. These data suggest key roles for <italic>Stk11</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> in CTA long-term memory formation, dependent at least partly through convergent action on BLApn intrinsic excitability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Stk11</kwd><kwd>fos</kwd><kwd>excitability</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>basolateral amygdala</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC006666</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>Donald B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS109916</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Sacha B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Stk11</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> expression plays an important role in CTA long-term memory formation by modulating the intrinsic excitability of BLApn.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is a form of long-lasting aversive memory induced by a single pairing of exposure to an initially palatable taste with gastric malaise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bures et al., 1998</xref>). Although multiple brain regions, including the brainstem, amygdala and the cortex, participate in various aspects of taste behavior (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carleton et al., 2010</xref>), prior work suggests that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a critical role in CTA memory. Disrupting neuronal activity within the BLA blocks the formation and retrieval of CTA memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yasoshima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferreira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia-Delatorre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Molero-Chamizo and Rivera-Urbina, 2017</xref>). This may reflect the fact that BLA projection neurons (BLApn) provide the principal output pathway from the amygdala to forebrain structures including the gustatory cortex and the central amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duvarci and Pare, 2014</xref>) enabling it to distribute taste valance information to these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Piette et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Samuelsen et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this view, BLA neurons change their activity and their functional connectivity with their down-stream targets during CTA learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grossman et al., 2008</xref>). However, whether the BLA is a site of cellular and molecular plasticity during CTA learning, as opposed to merely gating plasticity in other structures, is not known.</p><p>Stages of memory formation are typically distinguished on the basis of duration and molecular mechanism. Short-term memory, lasting minutes to hours, requires only post-translational modification of preexisting proteins, whereas long-term memory, lasting days or longer, requires gene transcription and RNA translation, typically occurring in the hours following memory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matthies, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gal-Ben-Ari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kandel, 2001</xref>). Production of new proteins is required to produce lasting changes in the efficacy of synaptic connections and in the intrinsic excitability of neurons, which are thought to be the cellular correlates of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang and Linden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mozzachiodi and Byrne, 2010</xref>). The cellular correlates of CTA learning are less completely understood than those of some other forms of learning, but the involvement of both synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2016</xref>) and intrinsic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yasoshima and Yamamoto, 1998</xref>) have been demonstrated. CTA is known to require protein synthesis in the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Josselyn et al., 2004</xref>) and to increase the expression of the activity-dependent transcription factor C-FOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Uematsu et al., 2015</xref>). In other behavioral paradigms, neurons increasing C-FOS protein undergo changes in synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yassin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>) and are thought to be essential parts of the neuronal network underlying long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tonegawa et al., 2015</xref>). However, the role of neurons expressing C-FOS in the BLA during CTA is unclear. Also unknown is whether CTA learning requires new transcription, and if so, the identities of the required transcripts and cellular processes they promote are not known.</p><p>In this study, we found that new transcription in the BLA is required for CTA learning. Using RNA-seq from sorted neurons, we found that CTA changed the expression of many genes. In addition to the expected activation of <italic>Fos</italic>, expression of the kinase <italic>Stk11</italic>, also known as <italic>Lkb1</italic>, is altered following learning in BLA projection neurons (BLApn), but not in excitatory or inhibitory neurons within the GC. STK11 is known to act as a master regulator of growth, metabolism, survival and polarity by phosphorylating 13 down-stream members of the AMP-related kinase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lizcano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</xref>). Recent work also suggests roles for STK11 in the nervous system, where it controls axonal specification and dynamics during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shelly et al., 2007</xref>) and synaptic remodeling during old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Samuel et al., 2014</xref>). STK11 can also regulate synaptic transmission in forebrain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwon et al., 2016</xref>), but it has not previously been studied in the context of learning and memory or in the regulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability.</p><p>We find that <italic>Stk11</italic> is required for CTA since conditional knockout from BLApn prior to training impairs learning. However, the same deletion performed 2 days after training—that is, at a time when long-term memories have already been formed and stabilized—has no effect on subsequent memory retrieval. Deletion of <italic>Stk11</italic> also increased the excitability of BLApn, but did not alter the ability of the BLA-GC circuit to become transcriptionally activated by training or to encode the palatability of gustatory stimuli. CTA training is associated with an opposing decrease in intrinsic excitability in BLA projection neurons expressing C-FOS following learning. BLApn knockout of <italic>Fos</italic> also increased excitability and impaired learning, and expression of C-FOS and STK11 did not depend on each other. Thus, two independent genetic manipulations that affect learning also increase excitability. Using chemogenetics to independently increase BLApn excitability during CTA training without knocking out either gene also impaired CTA memory. Together, these data identify key roles for <italic>Stk11</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> in CTA long-term memory formation and suggest they may act by convergently modulating the intrinsic excitability of BLApn.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CTA long-term memory requires BLA transcription</title><p>In order to determine whether CTA requires new RNA transcription within the BLA, we inhibited transcription by injecting Actinomycin-D (1 µl, 50 ng, bilaterally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), a widely used RNA polymerase two inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberini, 2009</xref>), into the BLA 20 min prior to CTA training, and tested memory 48 hr later. As a control, a separate group of mice received vehicle injection (1 µl of PBS, bilaterally). CTA training consisted of 30 min of access to 0.5% saccharin followed by an intraperitoneal injection of 0.15M LiCl, 2% body weight; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A two-way mixed ANOVA comparing vehicle and actinomycin-D injected mice before and after training revealed a significant effect of treatment and a significant interaction between treatment and training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Post-hoc analysis revealed significant reduction in the consumption of saccharin (CTA vs. Test) only for the vehicle group, indicating impairment of learning in the actinomycin-D treated mice. As a convergent measure, we also assessed the strength of CTA memory by calculating the relative consumption of saccharin during the test day to that consumed on the training day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Neseliler et al., 2011</xref>). The differences between the groups (23% in the vehicle group vs. 80% for the actinomycin D group) were significant. Meanwhile, actinomycin-treated mice were neither impaired in their ability to detect the palatability of saccharin, nor in their drinking behavior—consumption of saccharin during CTA training was similar for the two groups, as was consumption of water 8 hr after the test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that these nonspecific effects cannot account for the memory impairment. Thus, BLA transcription is essential for CTA memory formation. These results extend prior work showing the importance of BLA protein synthesis for CTA memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Josselyn et al., 2004</xref>) and together show that training induces both transcription and translation important for CTA in the BLA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibiting BLA transcription impairs CTA Learning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Protocol for injection (1 µl per hemisphere) of Actinomycin-D (50 ng) or vehicle (PBS with 0.02% DMSO).

It is clear that Stk11 deletion left much of the machinery of taste processing and learning intact, however. Activation of Fos by training in the BLA was not impaired after Stk11 deletion, implying that at least the initial stages of transcriptional activation associated with learning are intact. Also left intact was the ability of the BLA to convey palatability information to the GC. Prior studies have shown that silencing of BLA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Piette et al., 2012</xref>) impair palatability coding during the late phase of GC gustatory responses.

Decreased excitability of Fos-activated neurons was also found using an earlier reporter of Fos promoter activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yassin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Although both <italic>Stk11</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> expression influence BLApn intrinsic excitability, several observations argue this reflects convergence of two at least partially separate signaling pathways in the BLApn neurons. First, deletion of <italic>Stk11</italic> did not block the ability of training to elicit C-FOS expression, and deletion of <italic>Fos</italic> did not block STK11 expression. Additionally, <italic>Stk11</italic> deletion in BLApn had a stronger effect on CTA memory and on intrinsic excitability then deletion of <italic>Fos</italic>. However, our data do not exclude the possibility for synergy between the STK11 and C-FOS signaling pathways. Each signaling pathway could influence excitability by modulating different ion-channels. Alternatively, both signaling pathways may converge on the same ion-channels but influence complementary processes such as expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kourrich, 2005</xref>), post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vernon and Irvine, 2016</xref>) or trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steele et al., 2007</xref>). If future studies identify the specific ion channels targeted by STK11 and C-FOS related signaling, these questions of synergy and convergence can be more precisely addressed. Our data do not exclude the possibility that the neurons expressing <italic>Fos</italic> represent a sub-population BLApn expressing <italic>Stk11</italic>. Future studies will be aimed to determine with a much finer resolution the distribution of these genes among the population of BLApn.</p><p>In conclusion, our data suggest the following model of CTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Training induces the activation of STK11 and C-FOS by increasing their protein levels in BLApn. STK11 activation results in downstream activation (through phosphorylation) of AMP-related kinases, most likely MARK2/3, BRSK2, SIK3, which are abundant in BLApn. C-FOS, an activity dependent transcription factor, induces the transcription of effector genes such as <italic>Nptx2</italic> which is increased following CTA training. NPTX2 may modulate intrinsic excitability through its ability to bind ion-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duzhyy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2010</xref>). The two pathways jointly reduce the intrinsic excitability of BLApn, which plays a key role in gating the formation of CTA memory.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>An integrated model for the formation of CTA memory.</title><p>CTA training mice associate consumption of palatable saccharin with gastric malaise (induced by systemic injection of lithium chloride). Memory formation: CTA training increases the activity STK11 and C-FOS in BLA projection neurons (BLApn) via initially separate signaling pathways. CTA increases STK11 protein but reduces its mRNA, possibly through feedback control. STK11 activation results in downstream phosphorylation and activation of AMP related kinases, likely including Mark2/3, Brsk2, and Sik3, which are abundant in BLApn. C-FOS, an activity dependent transcription factor, induces the transcription of effector genes such as <italic>Nptx2</italic> which increases following CTA training and is known to bind not only ligand-gated receptors, but also voltage-gated ion channels. The two pathways reduce BLApn intrinsic excitability through unknown mechanism(s).

Action potential (AP) threshold, amplitude, afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and full width at half-height were averaged from the 5th-10th APs in trials with 10 to 20 Hz firing rates. AP threshold is the membrane potential at which the slope first exceeds 10 V/s, and AP amplitude was measured relative to threshold. Sag ratio is defined as the fraction by which the membrane potential depolarized at steady-state from its maximum hyperpolarization during a −100 pA current step.

molecular mechanisms of long-lasting taste aversive memory are not well elucidated. This manuscript tackles this issue by using a multi-level approach combining large scale gene expression profiling, gene knockouts, physiology, and manipulation of neuronal activity with a behavioral model of conditioned taste aversion. This study demonstrates that specific molecules involved in neuronal activity, in basolateral amygdala neurons that send axons to other brain regions, are important for the long-term memory of taste aversion.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Deletion of Stk11 and Fos BLA projection neurons alters intrinsic excitability and impairs formation of aversive memory&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: A.J. Robison (Reviewer #1); Shauna L Parkes (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>There was agreement that the results would be of interest for the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>, but the major concerns noted by the reviewers require additional work that is beyond the scope of the time scale for revision for <italic>eLife</italic>. Given the enthusiasm for the study, if you are able to address each of the reviewers' concerns, we would be willing to reconsider your manuscript as a new submission. The major concerns regarded the lack of a cohesive story and a clear model, and the statistical analyses. These are detailed in the reviews below. In their discussion, the reviewers noted suggestions for the revision that could help to provide a clear model. It was suggested to examine whether the KO of one gene changes expression of the other gene to determine if c-Fos or Stk11 is the upstream molecule. A further suggestion was to perform a double knockout study to determine if this is additive for or occludes excitability. Overall, additional work would be needed to cohesively convey the message that learning requires gene expression and that this gene expression is involved in regulating BLA neuron excitability.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;Deletion of Stk11 and Fos BLA projection neurons alters intrinsic excitability and impairs formation of aversive memory&quot; uses a combination of mouse behavior, molecular biology, pharmacology, genetic manipulation, and electrophysiology to uncover a novel role for the kinase Stk11 in the function of BLA projection neurons and their role in aversive learning. The experimental approach is strong and well thought out, and the findings are mostly robust and consistent. The lack of an overall model and incomplete interpretation is a major concern, and there are a few minor concerns with terminology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a logical disconnect between the gene expression findings and the electrophysiological findings. After learning, c-Fos and Stk11 are oppositely regulated in the BLA: cFos is increased and Stk11 is decreased (Figure 2). However, knocking out either gene increases the excitability of the neurons (Figure 6 and Figure 7). Since the authors attempt to connect excitability directly to learning (Figure 7E), this is difficult to parse. If learning decreases excitability, that fits with the induction of cFos, but not with the decrease in Stk11. The authors should attempt to address this apparent discrepancy in the Discussion and propose a model that takes all of these data into account.</p><p>2) The potential conflicting expression data for cFos and Stk11 bring up another issue: are these changes in gene expression occurring in the same cells? One possible explanation for the apparent contradiction in point 1 above is that cFos is induced in a separate population of BLA cells from those in which Stk11 is decreased. Is it possible to determine whether this cell population is the same?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript reports on the role of Fos and Stk11 in conditioned taste aversion learning (CTA). The study focuses on projection neurons in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLApn), which is known to contribute to CTA learning. Using RNA-seq the authors identify a number of genes that are upregulated or downregulated following CTA. They choose to focus on Fos, previously shown to increase in BLA following CTA, and Stk11, a kinase that contributes to a variety of cellular functions but has not been studies in the context of learning. CTA increases Fos expression in BLA projection neurons (as previously shown) and decreases Stk11 mRNA levels. However, the level of expression of Stk11 protein is increased following CTA indicating complexity in the signaling underlying this form of aversive learning. Using a loss of function approach, the authors show that loss of Fos has a minimal effect on CTA, while loss of Slk11 impairs learning. Additional experiments examine the effect of loss of function on BLApn excitability and examine palatability coding in the gustatory cortex (GC), which receives a prominent projection from BLA and is involved in CTA learning. While the results are interesting, the study suffers from lack of clarity and several inconsistencies in the approach and results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Abstract, Introduction and Results section lack consistency. The Abstract seems to indicate that the target of the study is Stk11 and its signaling and that CTA learning is a model of learning to investigate the molecule. Differently, the Introduction seems to indicate that CTA is the main subject and that the authors aim to investigate the cellular mechanisms for CTA. Finally, in the Results section the initial setup is to show that CTA requires protein synthesis and RNA-seq is used to identify potential targets. Across all sections the choice to focus on Stk11 is never justified, leaving the reader wondering why this molecule and not another one of the &gt;30 identified by RNA-seq.</p><p>2) The authors interpret the impaired CTA in loss of Stk11 function experiments as indicative of an increase in the expression of the gene during CTA training. However, their results indicate that Stk11 mRNA levels decrease following CTA, therefore a loss of Stk11 would be expected to induce CTA, not prevent it. On the other hand, Stk11 protein levels increase following CTA, suggesting that it is protein synthesis, not gene expression that contributes to CTA.</p><p>3) The Fos loss of function experiment also shows some inconsistency across results. Fos increases following CTA, thus one may expect that preventing this increase would prevent CTA if Fos expression is necessary for learning. However, the results reported here show only a minor effect on CTA magnitude, suggesting that the increase in Fos expression plays a minor effect in this form of aversive learning.</p><p>4) The connection between CTA, gene expression and neuronal excitability is rather weak and indirect. If the increase in Fos is prevented neurons become more excitable, which is in contrast with the idea that Fos is induced by neuronal activation. As CTA is still induced in these conditions, the relationship between Fos, learning and neuronal excitability is unclear. In the case of Stk1, loss of function also increases excitability, but in this case there is no CTA.</p><p>5) The palatability data from GC in the Stk11 KO model are also hard to interpret. Previous data by the Katz lab showed that spiking activity of GC neurons is altered following CTA. As a loss of function in BLA Stk11 mimics the effect of CTA, one would expect that the Stk11-KO alone would alter GC activity in the palatability epoch. However, the data show otherwise, suggesting that Stk11 signaling may not be sufficient for altering palatability coding in GC. While from the signaling perspective this is an interesting finding, it is hard to reconcile with the other components of this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Levitan and colleagues explore the role of the kinase Stk11 in aversive learning. I enjoyed reading this manuscript. The authors have made a considerable effort to carefully control their experiments, provide some specificity to the effect of Stk11 deletion as well as provide a potential mechanism (intrinsic BLApn excitability) for their findings. Briefly, the authors report that new transcription in the BLA is required for CTA learning and such learning causes changes in the expression of the kinase Stk11 in BLA projection neurons. Conditional Stk11 knockout in BLApn during (but not after) taste-LiCl pairings blocks learning and also increases the excitability of BLA projection neurons. This change in excitability did not appear to alter the ability of the BLA-GC circuit to respond to gustatory stimuli. These data are particularly exciting as Stk11 has not previously been implicated in learning. I believe that this manuscript is worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic> but have a few concerns that should be addressed.</p><p>1) Figure caption 3: Could the authors please clarify the statistics reported for panel C. The authors state N=8 per group (and two groups: GFP and CRE) so a total of 16 mice. However, the df for the genotype main effect (GFP vs CRE) is reported as (1,28). I don't understand how 28 is calculated for 16 animals and 2 between-subjects groups. In addition, in subsection “Fos and Stk11 expression in BLA projection neurons are necessary for memory formation”, it is stated that &quot;Post hoc analysis (Bonferroni) revealed that both GFP (n=8) and Cre (N=8) group reductions following CTA (test vs. train) were significant but differences between other groups were not.&quot; What are these other groups? Were there initially other groups involved in this experiment? If so, I'm wondering if that might also explain the somewhat surprising significant interaction reported in (C). Finally, on Figure 3C, N=8 is labeled for each column giving the impression that the &quot;train&quot; and &quot;test&quot; conditions were not the same animals. I imagine that the N should only be reported on the &quot;train&quot; column, as in Figure 4A and 4D.</p><p>2) Subsection “Stk11 deletion does not impact basal aspects of taste behavior” – It wasn't immediately clear to me what &quot;behavior&quot; referred to in this experiment. It seems that &quot;behavior&quot; is the GC neurons responses rather than the behavior of the mice, is that correct? Indeed, if I understood correctly, in this manuscript, there was no behavioral measurement of palatability (e.g., licking microstructure, number of licks etc). However, if this is the case, to what does &quot;the behaviorally-determined palatability ranking&quot; refer? Does it refer to another data set that was previously reported (Levitan et al., 2019), as stated? If so, can the authors please justify the use of behavioral data from another set of mice (perhaps already published) to calculate the correlations (between firing rates and behaviorally measured palatability) reported in Figure 5.</p><p>3) Could the authors please provide a brief justification for using only the taste only control (and not the LiCl control) in the majority of experiments?</p><p>4) Introduction: &quot;Not known to play a role in learning or the regulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability&quot; It is unclear from this sentence if the authors mean that the role of Stk11 in learning/neuronal excitability has not previously been studied or if it has been studied and no evidence was found for an involvement in these processes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61036.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We find that <italic>Stk11</italic> KO animals can still upregulate C-FOS expression to a similar degree and that STK11 expression is unaltered in the <italic>Fos</italic> KO animals (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We conclude, that at least at the level of <italic>Stk11</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> themselves, the genes are not upstream or downstream of one another and separately feed into mechanisms of neuronal excitability and learning. We have not ruled out possible interactions of downstream portions of the signaling cascade and make this clear in the manuscript.</p><p>We have not performed the double knockout study for several reasons. First, we calculated that it would require close to a year of additional breeding since it would require mice that carry 5 alleles (two of each knockout, plus the cre-dependent reporter) and such mice are impossible to achieve in one generation and are more likely to require 3 or 4 generations or more. Second, and perhaps more importantly, we are not convinced it would be informative. Since the blockade of learning in the case of the <italic>Stk11</italic> knockout is essentially complete, it would be very difficult to quantitatively distinguish between additive and occlusive phenotypes. The <italic>Fos</italic> KO produces a less complete blockade of learning, but in either an additive (independent pathways) or occlusive (same pathway) model, the observed effect of the double KO would be increased relative to the <italic>Fos</italic> KO and unchanged relative to the <italic>Stk11</italic> KO.</p><p>Finally, we have revised the statistical approach as suggested.</p><p>Specific replies to all of the issues raised by each of the reviewers are given below.</p><p>In a nutshell, the new data and model address the reviewer’s concerns and comments specifically regarding:</p><p>1) Potential interactions between <italic>Stk11</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic>.

The question of terminology is addressed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a logical disconnect between the gene expression findings and the electrophysiological findings. After learning, c-Fos and Stk11 are oppositely regulated in the BLA: cFos is increased and Stk11 is decreased (Figure 2). However, knocking out either gene increases the excitability of the neurons (Figure 6 and Figure 7). Since the authors attempt to connect excitability directly to learning (Figure 7E), this is difficult to parse. If learning decreases excitability, that fits with the induction of cFos, but not with the decrease in Stk11. The authors should attempt to address this apparent discrepancy in the Discussion and propose a model that takes all of these data into account.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct that levels of <italic>Stk11</italic> transcript decline at the time point measured, however we also found that levels of protein were increased at the same time point. We appreciate the suggestion of presenting a model of how this might occur and have tried to do so both in the discussion and schematically in Figure 9. Although <italic>Stk11</italic> mRNA decreases following CTA training (Figure 2B and C) protein levels increase (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Although discrepancies between measurement of RNA and protein expression are unusual, they do occur. Such discrepancies would be expected if activation of Stk11 led to feedback inhibition of subsequent transcription or to enhanced mRNA degradation. These types of negative feedback have been described for other genes, a point we now discuss subsection “BLA projection neurons undergo transcription important for CTA learning”. We are actively pursuing the question of whether and how this feedback occurs, but this is likely to require a significant body of new experiments which we feel are better left for a follow up paper.</p><p>The finding that protein levels of STK11 increase are consistent with the fact that <italic>Stk11</italic> deletion before CTA training impairs CTA memory (Figure 4). The finding that <italic>Stk11</italic> deletion increases BLApn intrinsic excitability (Figure 6) is consistent with the reduction in intrinsic excitability evident after CTA training (Figure 7) and with the fact that increasing excitability using <italic>hM3Dq</italic> DREADD impairs CTA memory (Figure 8). This logic is now discussed in the text (subsection “BLA projection neurons undergo transcription important for CTA learning”) and diagrammed in Figure 9. Subsection “<italic>Stk11</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> deletion increase the intrinsic excitability of BLApn, while CTA decreases excitability”; subsection “Intrinsic excitability of BLApn as a candidate mechanism for Fos and Stk11’s effects on CTA memory.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The potential conflicting expression data for cFos and Stk11 bring up another issue: are these changes in gene expression occurring in the same cells? One possible explanation for the apparent contradiction in point 1 above is that cFos is induced in a separate population of BLA cells from those in which Stk11 is decreased. Is it possible to determine whether this cell population is the same?</p></disp-quote><p>The issue brought up by the reviewer is interesting and important, however a complete cellular map of changes in the expression of <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Stk11</italic> transcript and protein is beyond the scope of this manuscript. <italic>Stk11</italic> is ubiquitously expressed both in humans and in mice (see e.g. https://www.tau.ac.il/~elieis/HKG/HK_genes.txt and in situ hybridization for this gene in the Allen Brain Atlas). Hence it is likely that cells activating <italic>Fos</italic> represent a subset of the cells activating <italic>Stk11</italic>. Future studies will aim to determine with a much finer resolution the distribution of these genes among the population of BLApn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript reports on the role of Fos and Stk11 in conditioned taste aversion learning (CTA). The study focuses on projection neurons in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLApn), which is known to contribute to CTA learning. Using RNA-seq the authors identify a number of genes that are upregulated or downregulated following CTA. They choose to focus on Fos, previously shown to increase in BLA following CTA, and Stk11, a kinase that contributes to a variety of cellular functions but has not been studies in the context of learning. CTA increases Fos expression in BLA projection neurons (as previously shown) and decreases Stk11 mRNA levels. However, the level of expression of Stk11 protein is increased following CTA indicating complexity in the signaling underlying this form of aversive learning. Using a loss of function approach, the authors show that loss of Fos has a minimal effect on CTA, while loss of Slk11 impairs learning. Additional experiments examine the effect of loss of function on BLApn excitability and examine palatability coding in the gustatory cortex (GC), which receives a prominent projection from BLA and is involved in CTA learning. While the results are interesting, the study suffers from lack of clarity and several inconsistencies in the approach and results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Abstract, Introduction and Results section lack consistency. The Abstract seems to indicate that the target of the study is Stk11 and its signaling and that CTA learning is a model of learning to investigate the molecule. Differently, the Introduction seems to indicate that CTA is the main subject and that the authors aim to investigate the cellular mechanisms for CTA.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that our argument was not as clearly presented as it should have been. We have rewritten portions of the Abstract, Introduction and Results section to attempt to clarify the essential argument made succinctly in our title. The molecular and cellular mechanisms of CTA within the BLA are our primary interest. The focus on <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Stk11</italic> and the way the two sets of results are balanced reflect the following important considerations:</p><p>1) <italic>Fos</italic> is known to be activated during learning and to be important for CTA specifically, hence the fact that <italic>Fos</italic> changes in expression is an important positive control but is not in and of itself of immediate general interest.</p><p>2) <italic>Stk11</italic> and the AMP-related kinase signaling pathway are highly studied (2755 and 18,635 pubmed entries respectively) and have broad significance outside of neuroscience but have not previously been implicated in learning. Demonstration that the master kinase in this pathway is important for CTA learning is an important new result and hence is emphasized.</p><p>3) Uniquely, among the genes identified, <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Stk11</italic> have existing conditional alleles that allow local, conditional knockout specifically within BLA projection neurons. This is a far more powerful approach for investigating gene function in learning than other more partial or more global approaches.</p><p>4) Surprisingly, both genes appear to have similar effects on BLApn excitability, leading us to focus on this cellular context for their molecular actions, and strengthening the importance of considering both genes in the paper. We have now added results that show that manipulating excitability of these neurons independently of either gene also blocks learning and have shown that the two genes independently converge on excitability since knocking out one does not affect expression of the other.</p><p>We feel that although it is more complex to include manipulations of two genes and cellular and behavioral analyses in the paper, the story is greatly enriched by this inclusion. We have tried to make the essential logic clearer with changes to the Abstract, Introduction, Results section, Discussion section and a new figure diagramming our model, but we welcome additional suggestions as to how we could further clarify the choice of genes to investigate, or other aspects of our argument.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, in the results section the initial setup is to show that CTA requires protein synthesis and RNA-seq is used to identify potential targets. Across all sections the choice to focus on Stk11 is never justified, leaving the reader wondering why this molecule and not another one of the &gt;30 identified by RNA-seq.</p><p>2) The authors interpret the impaired CTA in loss of Stk11 function experiments as indicative of an increase in the expression of the gene during CTA training. However, their results indicate that Stk11 mRNA levels decrease following CTA, therefore a loss of Stk11 would be expected to induce CTA, not prevent it. On the other hand, Stk11 protein levels increase following CTA, suggesting that it is protein synthesis, not gene expression that contributes to CTA.</p></disp-quote><p>The initial portion of the results demonstrate that new transcription, and not only new protein synthesis are required. That new protein synthesis is required for CTA was previously known, but here we show for the first time that CTA also requires new transcription.</p><p>For a gene to affect learning it must both be transcribed and translated. We do not know that new transcription of <italic>Stk11</italic> is required for learning and the discussion makes note of this fact (subsection “BLA projection neurons undergo transcription important for CTA learning”). We were indeed surprised to find that the transcript and protein levels of <italic>Stk11</italic> are discordant at the time point measured. We have added this point to our discussion and included it in our model. We are actively investigating the biological basis of this unusual regulation. Nevertheless, the increased levels of protein are quite consistent with the fact that loss of the gene blocks learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Fos loss of function experiment also shows some inconsistency across results. Fos increases following CTA, thus one may expect that preventing this increase would prevent CTA if Fos expression is necessary for learning. However, the results reported here show only a minor effect on CTA magnitude, suggesting that the increase in Fos expression plays a minor effect in this form of aversive learning.</p><p>4) The connection between CTA, gene expression and neuronal excitability is rather weak and indirect. If the increase in Fos is prevented neurons become more excitable, which is in contrast with the idea that Fos is induced by neuronal activation. As CTA is still induced in these conditions, the relationship between Fos, learning and neuronal excitability is unclear. In the case of Stk1, loss of function also increases excitability, but in this case there is no CTA.</p></disp-quote><p>Genes differ in their degree of penetrance with respect to many phenotypes, including complex phenotypes like learning. The effect of <italic>Fo</italic>s knockout on learning is smaller in amplitude than that observed for <italic>Stk11</italic>, but the results are robust (2-fold increase in the fraction of Saccharin consumed vs. a 2.4 fold increase for <italic>Stk11</italic>) and reproducible (significant interaction between genotype and training). We do not see differences in penetrance as a concern but suggest that <italic>Stk11</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> effect BLApn intrinsic excitability (and thus memory) by different signaling pathways and mechanisms. This is further reinforced by new results showing that <italic>Fos</italic> cKO does not effect STK11 expression and that <italic>Stk11</italic> cKO does not affect C-FOS expression (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). This is presented and discussed in: Subsection “<italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Stk11</italic> expression in BLA projection neurons are necessary for memory formation”, subsection “Intrinsic excitability of BLApn as a candidate mechanism for Fos and Stk11’s effects on CTA memory”.</p><p>Additionally, we do not claim to have ruled out the possibility that one or both genes also affect behavior through additional mechanisms that do not depend on changes in excitability (subsection “Necessity of Stk11 implicates the AMP-related kinase pathway in learning”).</p><p>Finally, we have directly tested the relationship between learning and neuronal excitability using chemogenetic manipulation of excitability independently of manipulating either signaling pathway. These results (Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1) make a stronger argument for causal involvement in learning of changes in excitability. Subsection “<italic>Stk11</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> deletion increase the intrinsic excitability of BLApn, while CTA decreases excitability”; subsection “Necessity of Stk11 implicates the AMP-related kinase pathway in learning”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The palatability data from GC in the Stk11 KO model are also hard to interpret. Previous data by the Katz lab showed that spiking activity of GC neurons is altered following CTA. As a loss of function in BLA Stk11 mimics the effect of CTA, one would expect that the Stk11-KO alone would alter GC activity in the palatability epoch. However, the data show otherwise, suggesting that Stk11 signaling may not be sufficient for altering palatability coding in GC. While from the signaling perspective this is an interesting finding, it is hard to reconcile with the other components of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that if KO of <italic>Stk11</italic> produced the identical effects to those of learning, a change in GC activity in the palatability epoch would be expected. However, we do not suggest that KO of <italic>Stk11</italic> mimics learning. For example, the two have opposite effects on BLApn intrinsic excitability: learning decreases, while <italic>Stk11</italic> KO increases excitability. We were worried that <italic>Stk11</italic> KO might have other baseline effects on sensory processing or on the ability of BLApn to respond to training by transcriptionally activating C-FOS. If either the baseline coding or ability to become activated during training were impaired, this might explain the learning phenotype. Instead, our results show that cKO of <italic>Stk11</italic> does not affect GC coding of taste palatability at baseline (Figure 5) and that KO neurons in the BLA can still respond to training by activating C-FOS (Figure 5-figure supplement 1). Together, these results argue that <italic>Stk11</italic> is important for CTA memory formation, rather than for the initial ability of the system to respond to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. This idea is also supported by the fact that <italic>Stk11</italic> KO does not influence CTA retrieval (Figure 4D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Levitan and colleagues explore the role of the kinase Stk11 in aversive learning. I enjoyed reading this manuscript. The authors have made a considerable effort to carefully control their experiments, provide some specificity to the effect of Stk11 deletion as well as provide a potential mechanism (intrinsic BLApn excitability) for their findings. Briefly, the authors report that new transcription in the BLA is required for CTA learning and such learning causes changes in the expression of the kinase Stk11 in BLA projection neurons. Conditional Stk11 knockout in BLApn during (but not after) taste-LiCl pairings blocks learning and also increases the excitability of BLA projection neurons. This change in excitability did not appear to alter the ability of the BLA-GC circuit to respond to gustatory stimuli. These data are particularly exciting as Stk11 has not previously been implicated in learning. I believe that this manuscript is worthy of publication in eLife but have a few concerns that should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for appreciating the positive aspects of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Figure caption 3: Could the authors please clarify the statistics reported for panel C. The authors state N=8 per group (and two groups: GFP and CRE) so a total of 16 mice. However, the df for the genotype main effect (GFP vs CRE) is reported as (1,28). I don't understand how 28 is calculated for 16 animals and 2 between-subjects groups. In addition, in subsection “Fos and Stk11 expression in BLA projection neurons are necessary for memory formation”, it is stated that &quot;Post hoc analysis (Bonferroni) revealed that both GFP (n=8) and Cre (N=8) group reductions following CTA (test vs. train) were significant but differences between other groups were not.&quot; What are these other groups? Were there initially other groups involved in this experiment? If so, I'm wondering if that might also explain the somewhat surprising significant interaction reported in (C). Finally, on Figure 3C, N=8 is labeled for each column giving the impression that the &quot;train&quot; and &quot;test&quot; conditions were not the same animals. I imagine that the N should only be reported on the &quot;train&quot; column, as in Figure 4A and 4D.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised all statistical analysis in the manuscript including Figure 3. For example, for Figure 3 we now report F(1,14). The degrees of freedom is 14 reflecting the 16 animals in two groups. The reviewer is correct that there are no other groups and that we were incorrect and unclear in referring to other conditions as if they were groups. This is corrected in the figure, legend and corresponding text. The interaction reported in C is expected since although both genotypes (control GFP and Cre knockout) have a reduction following training, the reduction is larger in the control animals than in the knockout, hence there is an interaction between training and genotype. We have clarified the labeling of N in Figure 3 as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Stk11 deletion does not impact basal aspects of taste behavior” – It wasn't immediately clear to me what &quot;behavior&quot; referred to in this experiment. It seems that &quot;behavior&quot; is the GC neurons responses rather than the behavior of the mice, is that correct? Indeed, if I understood correctly, in this manuscript, there was no behavioral measurement of palatability (e.g., licking microstructure, number of licks etc).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. We have corrected this misstatement by changing the sentence to:</p><p>“<italic>Stk11</italic> deletion in BLApn does not impact taste palatability coding in the GC” subsection “<italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Stk11</italic> expression in BLA projection neurons are necessary for memory formation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, if this is the case, to what does &quot;the behaviorally-determined palatability ranking&quot; refer? Does it refer to another data set that was previously reported (Levitan et al., 2019), as stated? If so, can the authors please justify the use of behavioral data from another set of mice (perhaps already published) to calculate the correlations (between firing rates and behaviorally measured palatability) reported in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. We used the palatability rankings of four taste stimuli (sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid and quinine) previously determined by us in a recent study in mice (Levitan et al., 2019). This ranking is highly robust and has been repeated in other studies in mice (Fletcher et al., 2017; Lavi et al., 2018) and rats (Katz et al., 2001; Piette et al., 2002). The use of a nonparametric rank correlation ensures that the results are robust despite variations in absolute firing rates or preferences across animals. We refined this point in the methods section and in the Figure legend. subsection “<italic>Stk11</italic> deletion in BLApn does not impact taste palatability coding in the GC”, subsection “<italic>In-vivo recording of GC taste responses”</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Could the authors please provide a brief justification for using only the taste only control (and not the LiCl control) in the majority of experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>A single control condition consisting of the taste stimulus without the unconditioned stimulus was used in the screening experiments of Figure 1 and Figure 2 (and associated supplements) since our principle aim was to identify target genes that could then be tested for causal roles in learning in subsequent behavioral experiments. A prior study from the Rosenblum lab (Rappaport et al., 2015) used a microarray screen following CTA to show that LiCl treatment (compared to taste control treatment) induced more than half of the same genes induced by CTA treatment (compared to taste control treatment). We have now made this point clear in the text. subsection “Transcripts regulated in BLA projection neurons following CTA”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Introduction: &quot;Not known to play a role in learning or the regulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability&quot; It is unclear from this sentence if the authors mean that the role of Stk11 in learning/neuronal excitability has not previously been studied or if it has been studied and no evidence was found for an involvement in these processes.</p></disp-quote><p>We meant the former. We have clarified this by changing the wording to: “it has not previously been studied in the context of learning and memory or in the regulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
