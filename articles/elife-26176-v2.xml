(γH2AX) and open DNA ends, it has been suggested that post-meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (PM-DSBs) enable chromatin remodeling during animal spermiogenesis. However, the existence of PM-DSBs is unconfirmed, and the mechanism responsible for their formation is unclear. Here, we report the first direct observation of programmed PM-DSBs via the electrophoretic separation of DSB-generated DNA fragments in the ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>. These PM-DSBs are accompanied by switching from a heterochromatic to euchromatic chromatin structure in the haploid pronucleus. Both a topoisomerase II paralog with exclusive pronuclear expression and Spo11 are prerequisites for PM-DSB induction. Reduced PM-DSB induction blocks euchromatin formation, characterized by histone H3K56 acetylation, leading to a failure in gametic nuclei production. We propose that PM-DSBs are responsible for histone replacement during the reprogramming of generative to undifferentiated progeny nuclei.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26176.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26176.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>Chromatin remodeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>609431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akematsu</surname><given-names>Takahiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15K18475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukuda</surname><given-names>Yasuhiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP13347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearlman</surname><given-names>Ronald E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P27313-B20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loidl</surname><given-names>Josef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>539509</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearlman</surname><given-names>Ronald E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first genetic compelling evidence for post-meiotic DNA double-strand breaks and its relation to chromatin remodeling in haploid pronuclei is shown.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent one of the greatest threats to genome integrity. Nevertheless, deliberate DSB induction is necessary for reshuffling genes or DNA sequences. The most common example in eukaryotes is the induction of meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>), and others include the somatic recombination of immunoglobulin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stavnezer et al., 2008</xref>), mating-type switching in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haber, 2012</xref>), and inducing antigenic variation in <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McCulloch et al., 2015</xref>). Post-meiotic DSBs (PM-DSBs) are a novel type of programmed DSBs that are claimed to occur during spermiogenesis in animals, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marcon and Boissonneault, 2004</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rathke et al., 2007</xref>). Markers of DNA lesions such as phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX) foci and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive signals are found in the nuclei of elongating spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marcon and Boissonneault, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meyer-Ficca et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leduc et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, both poly ADP-ribose (PAR) formation, a known DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meyer-Ficca et al., 2005</xref>) and DNA polymerase activity, characteristic of DNA repair synthesis, have been detected in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leduc et al., 2008</xref>). PM-DSBs have been implicated in eliminating free DNA supercoils formed during canonical histone withdrawal to ensure protamine deposition onto untangled DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marcon and Boissonneault, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laberge and Boissonneault, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rathke et al., 2014</xref>). However, the nature of these lesions (whether DSBs or single-strand nicks) and the mechanism by which they are formed have not been fully elucidated.</p><p>As the TUNEL signal is greatly diminished in rabbit spermatids in the presence of the type II topoisomerase (Top2) inhibitor, etoposide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laberge and Boissonneault, 2005</xref>), which forms a ternary complex with DNA and Top2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pommier et al., 2010</xref>), the catalytic activities of Top2-related proteins have been considered responsible for inducing post-meiotic DNA lesions. Vertebrates encode two closely related <italic>TOP2</italic> genes termed <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic>, which are differentially regulated during cell growth and cannot substitute for each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roca, 2009</xref>). Top2α is only expressed in proliferating cells, where it is involved in mitosis-related events such as DNA replication, chromosome condensation and decondensation, and sister chromatid segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Woessner et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grue et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast, Top2β is mainly expressed in terminally differentiated cells and is therefore thought to have a non-mitotic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Austin and Marsh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Linka et al., 2007</xref>). In cultured human cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ju et al. (2006)</xref> uncovered a role for Top2β in catalyzing site-specific DSB formation within some gene promoters, leading to local changes in chromatin architecture and transcriptional activation. In mouse spermiogenesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leduc et al. (2008)</xref> demonstrated that Top2β was exclusively expressed in elongating spermatids, where it colocalized with γH2AX foci. Moreover, these authors showed that tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (Tdp1), known to dissociate the covalent bonds between Top2 and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nitiss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Murai et al., 2012</xref>), was expressed in the same cells. These findings strongly suggest that Top2β produces transient DSBs in haploid chromosomes to support chromatin remodeling.</p><p>In addition to Top2β, Spo11, the predominant meiotic DSB inducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keeney, 2008</xref>), has recently been implicated in PM-DSB formation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gouraud et al. (2013)</xref> reported that the elongating spermatids of mice express much higher levels of <italic>SPO11</italic> transcripts compared with <italic>TOP2β</italic> transcripts. Since Spo11 has a similar structure to prokaryotic Top2 (also called Top6) and produces DSBs in the same manner as Top2 by forming phosphotyrosine linkages to 5′ strand termini on both sides of a DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Neale et al., 2005</xref>), Spo11 may also be involved in inducing PM-DSBs.</p><p>Using the unicellular ciliated protist <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>) as a model biological system, we demonstrate that PM-DSBs are formed in non-metazoan organisms and report the first compelling genetic evidence for the mechanism of PM-DSB induction. The availability of gene manipulation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chalker, 2012</xref>), sequenced genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hamilton et al., 2016</xref>), and gene expression data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miao et al., 2009</xref>) make <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> an ideal model for studying fundamental cellular and molecular processes. A remarkable and virtually unique feature of ciliates (including <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>) is that they stably maintain spatially and functionally differentiated germline and somatic nuclear genomes within a single cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Orias et al., 2011</xref>). The transcriptionally inert diploid germline genome, housed within the micronucleus (MIC), stores the genetic information for sexual progeny, while the polyploid somatic genome, housed within the macronucleus (MAC), is involved in active transcription. Both types of nuclei derive from a single zygotic nucleus during sexual reproduction. The MAC anlagen then undergo large-scale genome rearrangement and amplification processes that remove the internal eliminated sequences, representing about 40% of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mochizuki, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Noto et al., 2015</xref>). The MAC genotype governs the phenotypes of both the MAC and MIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Orias et al., 2011</xref>). Owing to its nuclear dualism, <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> is an ideal tool to address questions about genes that have important post-meiotic functions but are not manipulable in other model systems because they are essential for germline cell homeostasis.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the functions of <italic>Tetrahymena TOP2β</italic> and <italic>SPO11</italic> orthologs in haploid MICs (pronuclei) after completing meiosis and show their involvement in PM-DSB formation. We also provide evidence that DNA repair is concomitant with the incorporation of newly synthesized histone H3 into pronuclei. Our data suggest that <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> undergoes a spermiogenesis-like post-meiotic stage, in which Top2-related proteins induce transient DSBs followed by a dynamic change in the chromatin structure of gametic nuclei prior to fertilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Novel γH2AX localization in pronuclei</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the process of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cell mating (known as conjugation; described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cole and Sugai, 2012</xref>). Mating is initiated by the interaction of cells of different mating types, followed by meiotic prophase in both mating partners, during which MICs stretch out to form bivalent chromosomes without synaptonemal complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Loidl et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, two consecutive meiotic divisions (anaphase I and II) take place to form four identical haploid pronuclei: one of these (the selected pronucleus) undergoes an additional mitosis event (gametogenic mitosis) to produce gametic nuclei, whereas the other three (unselected) pronuclei eventually undergo autophagic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu and Yao, 2012</xref>). After they are reciprocally exchanged between mating partners, each gametic nucleus forms a zygotic nucleus by karyogamy, corresponding to fertilization in metazoa. Soon thereafter, the zygotic nucleus undergoes two consecutive mitotic divisions (post-zygotic mitoses) to produce four identical anlagen. Two of these are distributed to the anterior region of the cytoplasm, whereby they differentiate into the progeny MACs; the remaining two posterior anlagen become progeny MICs. Once the progeny MACs begin to develop, the parental MAC (pMAC) becomes transcriptionally inactive and is selectively eliminated from the cytoplasm via autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akematsu et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akematsu et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2014</xref>). Mating is terminated once the progeny MACs develop. One of the progeny MICs is resorbed, while the remaining MIC undergoes replication prior to the first cell division. The progeny MACs are then distributed to the daughter cells. Finally, four progeny cells are produced from a mating cell pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26176.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nuclear events during wild-type <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> mating.</title><p>When starved cells of different mating types are mixed, they start mating and meiosis, and produce sexual progeny.

PFGE showed that in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> the size of PM-DSB-dependent DNA fragments ranges from ~1.0 to 4.6 Mb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). If we assume an average fragment size of 2.2 Mb, we estimate that ~140 DSBs are distributed across the two 157 Mb genomes of haploid pronuclei in G<sub>2</sub>. If the influence of PM-DSB on chromatin remodeling is has a similar range in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> as in humans, then histone H3 should be removed from only ∼1 Mb of the entire genome. However, it is possible that PM-DSBs trigger global euchromatin formation via as yet unidentified chromatin remodelers. Alternatively, local histone replacement may be sufficient to proceed to gametogenic mitosis.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garg et al.

Our experiments showed that the selected pronucleus also undergoes acetylation at sites other than at H3K56; for example, H3K18ac and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>) are strongly enriched in euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tie et al., 2009</xref>).

Together, these findings suggest that repair of programmed PM-DSBs in the haploid germline allows changes in the epigenetic landscape required to produce mature gametes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26176.022</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Model of post-meiotic events in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>.</title><p>After completion of meiosis, PM-DSBs induced in pronuclei haploid chromosomes by Top2G and Spo11 trigger H2AX phosphorylation.

The first is chromatin remodeling, which facilitates sperm packaging by substituting the histone-based nucleosome structure with a protamine-based structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rathke et al., 2014</xref>). This process is believed to be DSB dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marcon and Boissonneault, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rathke et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2014</xref>). The second is histone replacement of protamines upon fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rousseaux et al., 2008</xref>). The third is erasure of parental epigenome marks in the zygote. During this process, methylated cytosines are replaced by unmodified cytosines via base excision repair (BER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu and Zhang, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, when BER is compromised, γH2AX foci are formed, suggesting that DSBs are induced, which are repaired after G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wossidlo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ladstätter and Tachibana-Konwalski, 2016</xref>). Thus, while mammals require karyogamy to induce the epigenetic modifications necessary for embryonic developmental programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou and Dean, 2015</xref>), <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> gametic nuclei can differentiate into MACs and MICs without karyogamy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukuda et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, chromatin remodeling in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> pronuclei might resemble zygote reprogramming rather than mammalian male pronuclear chromatin remodeling, in that the differentiated germline pronucleus is re-set to a dedifferentiated progenitor of new somatic and germline nuclei. Since dedifferentiated human cells such as cancer and embryonic stem cells display more H3K56ac compared with differentiated somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Das et al., 2009</xref>), it is possible that enhanced histone acetylation in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> similarly promotes nuclear dedifferentiation via a similar mechanism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culture methods and the induction of cell mating (conjugation)</title><p>Wild-type <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> strains CU428.2 (mating type VII, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/TSC_SD00178">TSC_SD00178</ext-link>), B2086 (mating type II, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/TSC_SD01627">TSC_SD01627</ext-link>), and SB210 (mating type VI, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/TSC_SD00703">TSC_SD00703</ext-link>) were obtained from the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Stock Center, Cornell University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tetrahymena.vet.cornell.edu/">https://tetrahymena.vet.cornell.edu/</ext-link>). <italic>ΔSPO11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mochizuki et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>SPO11i</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Howard-Till et al., 2013</xref>), and Asf1-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garg et al., 2013</xref>) strains were constructed previously.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reviewing Editor Kathleen Collins and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kazufumi Mochizuki (Reviewer #1); Elcin Unal (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Akematsu et al. provide compelling evidence that post-meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. They further demonstrate that the formation of the post-meiotic DSBs requires a germline-specific topoisomerase 2 (Top2G) as well as a meiotic endonuclease Spo11 and that the repair of these breaks facilitates chromatin remodeling and functional gamete formation. These are important observations because 1) post-meiotic DSB are suggested to occur in other eukaryotes including mammals and 2) no previous studies demonstrated the function of post-meiotic DSBs. A limited amount of additional work would improve the manuscript to be suitable for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The imaging data can greatly benefit from quantitative analysis. It's unclear what percentage of the post-meiotic pronuclei display signs of DSBs and how this changes in <italic>spo11</italic> and <italic>top2G</italic> mutants. Similar analysis for Asf1-GFP and H3K56Ac will be helpful.</p><p>2) The mechanism of post-meiotic DSB repair is unknown, but correlates with H3K56ac. If possible, it would be informative to check markers specific for HR and/or NHEJ-directed repair such as Rad51, Ku, Mre11. This analysis will at least indicate whether these pathways are on during the time of post-meiotic DSB induction/repair.</p><p>3) The authors suggest that Top2G might be the B subunit for Spo11 in forming post-meiotic DSBs. I think it will be helpful if they determine whether Spo11 and Top2G interact with one another in a stage specific manner (i.e. in post-meiotic cells but not during meiotic prophase). Since they generated epitope-tagged alleles for both of these genes and since there is good time resolution between the occurrence of meiotic and post-meiotic breaks, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment in two different stages can be performed to address this question. Otherwise the speculation that Top2g could be an as-yet-undiscovered B-subunit for Spo11 seems ungrounded: Spo11 is a member of the TopVI family (heterotetramers) whereas one would assume Top2g (like other eukaryotic TOP2) is, a homodimer; it seems very hard to imagine that <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Spo11 functions biochemically as a heterodimer with Top2g.</p><p>4) Have the authors checked whether the decline in γH2AX and the accompanying increase in H3K56ac occur in the unselected pronuclei in <italic>∆ATG8</italic> mutants? This could help distinguish whether there is a specific signal that directs DSB repair and chromatin remodeling to the selected pronuclei or whether the lack of nuclear elimination per se is sufficient for DSB repair to occur in the unselected pronuclei.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>/B – it would help to emphasize that the γH2Ax staining is <italic>specific</italic> to the pronuclei, and not observed in the MAC.</p><p>Observations of H2AX-GFP shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> says nothing about the specificity of the anti-gH2AX antibody. If I am wrong, the authors need to add some more explanation for why they think this experiment demonstrates the specificity. Otherwise, the authors may simply remove the figure.</p><p>5) Is it technically feasible to deplete Spo11 and/or Top2 activity only in the post-meiotic stage? This would directly test the requirement of Spo11/Top2 in PM-DSB formation independently of any role they may have in meiotic DSB formation (that indirectly influences PM-DSB formation).</p><p>6) It is stated that the spo11i strain has a defect in γH2Ax staining in the pronuclei (40-70%). However, the signal on the Southern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> that is ascribed to PM-DSBs is actually greater in the spo11i mutant than the WT control. This doesn't seem to be consistent with the author's statements/hypotheses that such PM-DSBs are Spo11-dependent. Are they able to explain/clarify? The same concerns are present for Fig8E right-hand panel, which appears to show robust &quot;PM-DSB&quot; signal in the spo11i strain (equivalent to WT) – even though one assumes this DSB signal is arising from only a subpopulation of cells.</p><p>Is the PM-DSB signal observed in the Spo11i experiments dependent on Top2g? (i.e. is it possible to do a double mutant/knockdown at the same time?)</p><p>7) The model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> gives me the impression that the deposition of H3 occurs only at close proximity to DSB sites, which the authors estimated to occur at only ~140 sites per 2xhaploid micronuclei genome. If this is true, it is rather very local remodeling event and it is difficult to imagine how DSBs promote gametogenesis, which probably requires more global chromatin remodeling. Because, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, it seems H3K56ac are distributed homogeneously in the micronucleus, I believe it is more reasonable to consider that although the number of DSBs is limited, they induce global chromatin remodeling (may be irrespective of distances from DSBs). The authors may consider this point and tune their discussions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26176.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The imaging data can greatly benefit from quantitative analysis.

As we showed that <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> pronuclei are in G<sub>2</sub> (Supplementary file 1), it is conceivable that Rad51-dependent recombinational repair is mediated by the sister chromatid in the selected pronucleus. It is therefore possible that both NHEJ and recombinational repair contribute to PM-DSB repair.</p><p><italic>3) The authors suggest that Top2G might be the B subunit for Spo11 in forming post-meiotic DSBs.

Otherwise the speculation that Top2g could be an as-yet-undiscovered B-subunit for Spo11 seems ungrounded: Spo11 is a member of the TopVI family (heterotetramers) whereas one would assume Top2g (like other eukaryotic TOP2) is, a homodimer; it seems very hard to imagine that Tetrahymena Spo11 functions biochemically as a heterodimer with Top2g.</italic> </p><p>As recommended, we carried out a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiment in extracts from mating cells expressing Top2G-GFP and Spo11-FZZ, from two different stages: meiotic prophase (3 h) and post-meiotic stage (6 h;as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 1</xref>). Spo11-FZZ was pulled down with anti-Flag antibody; however, Top2G-GFP did not co-IP with Spo11-FZZ. To account for the possibility that the in the native complex the C-terminal FZZ tag of Spo11-FZZ is hidden so that only free (i.e. unbound) Spo11-FZZ is pulled down, we carried out a reciprocal co-IP experiment using GFP-Trap. Western blotting detected Top2G-GFP in the IP fraction of post-meiotic cell lysate; however, Spo11-FZZ was not detected in the IP fractions of both the co-IP and control experiments (i.e. using lysates from cells not expressing Top2G-GFP). GFP-Trap consists of an anti-GFP single-domain antibody derived from alpaca and an affinity resin bead. Thus, Spo11-FZZ interacted non-specifically with components of GFP-Trap, and this could not be prevented by replacing the mild homogenization buffer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 1</xref> figure legend) with the more stringent RIPA buffer (140 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). It therefore remains unclear whether Top2g and Spo11 can interact. It is possible that epitope tagging of both Top2G and Spo11 prevents their interaction. It is also possible that the potential PM-DSB inducer requires other protein(s) to mediate the interaction between Top2G and Spo11 only at the post-meiotic stage.</p><p>For these technical reasons, the co-IP experiment was uninformative and has not been included in the manuscript. To circumvent these technical difficulties, an affinity purification mass spectrometry experiment is required to more fully elucidate the mechanism of PM-DSB induction. We are currently developing a protocol for proteomic analysis as, well as for ChIP-sequence analysis, of Top2G and Spo11 but these experiments are beyond the scope of this manuscript.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26176.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Co-Ip analysis of Top2G-GFP and Spo11-FZZ.</title><p>Mating Top2G-GFP and Spo11-FZZ expressing cells (10<sup>7</sup> cells) at meiotic prophase (3 h) and the post-meiotic stage (6 h) were collected by centrifugation following pretreatment with 0.5 mM PMSF (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) for 30 min at 30°C.

This could help distinguish whether there is a specific signal that directs DSB repair and chromatin remodeling to the selected pronuclei or whether the lack of nuclear elimination per se is sufficient for DSB repair to occur in the unselected pronuclei.</italic> </p><p>We immunostained γH2AX and H3K56ac in the <italic>ΔATG8-2</italic> mutant, and these new data have been included in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>. The selected pronucleus in the mutant crosses became H3K56 acetylated accompanied with H2AX dephosphorylation, as seen in the wild-type crosses. In addition, some persisting unselected pronuclei showed reduced γH2AX staining after the post-meiotic stage. Nevertheless, these pronuclei underwent neither H3K56 acetylation nor gametogenic mitosis, indicating that DNA repair and histone H3 transfer take place as a consequence of pronuclear selection.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>/B – it would help to emphasize that the γH2Ax staining is specific to the pronuclei, and not observed in the MAC.</italic> </p><p>We think that the reviewers meant to say <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>/B, since γH2AX staining is first shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. As suggested, we added the statement that “γH2AX foci […] do not appear in parental MACs throughout mating” in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> legend to emphasize the specific localization of γH2AX in MIC-derived nuclei, including pronuclei.</p><p><italic>Observations of H2AX-GFP shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> says nothing about the specificity of the anti-gH2AX antibody.

Otherwise, the authors may simply remove the figure.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> did not demonstrate the specificity of the anti-γH2AX antibody. Therefore, these images and the related text have been removed from the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and main text, respectively. On the other hand, our observations with H2AX-GFP may be useful evidence that the sole <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> histone H2AX encoded by TTHERM_00790790 is indeed expressed in the pronuclei as well as in the meiotic prophase MIC. These data have therefore been moved to the revised<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> to support the conclusion of this section, namely that γH2AX immunostaining in the pronuclei is not due to cross-reaction of the antibody.</p><p><italic>5) Is it technically feasible to deplete Spo11 and/or Top2 activity only in the post-meiotic stage? This would directly test the requirement of Spo11/Top2 in PM-DSB formation independently of any role they may have in meiotic DSB formation (that indirectly influences PM-DSB formation).</italic> </p><p>Although it is unclear whether all aspects of meiosis are normal in <italic>TOP2gi</italic> crosses, Southern blotting indicated that Top2G (at least) is not involved in meiotic DSB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8E</xref>). Moreover, 40–70% of the <italic>SPO11i</italic> crosses, in which Spo11 is re-expressed after meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), formed PM-DSBs despite the absence of meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8E</xref>). These results strongly suggest that PM-DSB formation is independent of meiotic DSBs. In addition, the mating process is unlikely to proceed to the post-meiosis stage if Top2G and Spo11 are required for meiotic DSB repair, as <italic>RAD51</italic> and <italic>MRE11</italic> mutants arrest at meiotic prophase (Lukaszewicz et al., 2010; Howard-Till et al., 2011). Of course, the best experiment to convince the reviewer would be to specifically deplete Top2G and Spo11 activities at the post-meiotic stage. However, it is technically difficult in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> to restrict gene knockdown to a specific mating stage. So far, we have not succeeded in triggering RNAi specifically at post-meiosis using a variety of promoters (such as <italic>TWI1, PDD1</italic>, and <italic>MTT2</italic>).</p><p><italic>6) It is stated that the spo11i strain has a defect in γH2Ax staining in the pronuclei (40-70%). However, the signal on the Southern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> that is ascribed to PM-DSBs is actually greater in the spo11i mutant than the WT control. This doesn't seem to be consistent with the author's statements/hypotheses that such PM-DSBs are Spo11-dependent. Are they able to explain/clarify? The same concerns are present for Fig8E right-hand panel, which appears to show robust &quot;PM-DSB&quot; signal in the spo11i strain (equivalent to WT) – even though one assumes this DSB signal is arising from only a subpopulation of cells.</italic> </p><p><italic>Is the PM-DSB signal observed in the Spo11i experiments dependent on Top2g? (i.e. is it possible to do a double mutant/knockdown at the same time?)</italic> </p><p>It is true that in the <italic>spo11i</italic> cells, in which RNAi is attenuated at late stages by 40–70% (as judged by the percentage of pronuclei showing γH2AX staining), the PM-DSB signal would be expected to be only about half the strength of the wild-type PM-DSB signal. However, RNAi attenuation varied greatly between experiments, and signal quantification and comparison between gels is difficult. (Note that the rDNA loading control on the <italic>SPO11i</italic> gel indicates that more DNA was loaded or transferred, which may [partially] explain the somewhat stronger than expected PM-DSB signal in <italic>SPO11i</italic> cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the <italic>SPO11i::ΔATG8-2</italic> mutant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), the reduction compared with <italic>SPO11</italic> + <italic>ΔATG8-2</italic> is more evident. As suggested by the reviewers, generation of a triple <italic>TOP2gi::SPO11i::ΔATG8-2</italic>mutant showed that the remaining PM-DSBs in <italic>SPO11i</italic> are dependent on <italic>TOP2g</italic>.</p><p><italic>7) The model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> gives me the impression that the deposition of H3 occurs only at close proximity to DSB sites, which the authors estimated to occur at only ~140 sites per 2xhaploid micronuclei genome. If this is true, it is rather very local remodeling event and it is difficult to imagine how DSBs promote gametogenesis, which probably requires more global chromatin remodeling. Because, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, it seems H3K56ac are distributed homogeneously in the micronucleus, I believe it is more reasonable to consider that although the number of DSBs is limited, they induce global chromatin remodeling (may be irrespective of distances from DSBs). The authors may consider this point and tune their discussions.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are correct. The sparse PM-DSBs would not be sufficient for global histone replacement if this replacement occurred only in the vicinity (up to 7 kb as is the case in humans) (Goldstein et al., 2013; Li and Tyler, 2016) of DSBs. Therefore, either PM-DSB repair triggers histone replacement at distant sites by an as yet unknown mechanism, or nuclear dedifferentiation in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> requires only local histone replacement events. We have added a discussion of these possibilities to the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
