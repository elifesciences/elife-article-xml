A common finding in ASD is reduced corpus callosum integrity and interhemispheric functional connectivity, the latter of which correlates with autistic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O’Reilly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yao et al., 2021</xref>). The corpus callosum connects bilateral hemispheres and functions to synchronize cortical circuits necessary for sensory-motor processing, attention, perception and higher cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schulte and Müller-Oehring, 2010</xref>). Little is known of how autism-risk genes regulate development of callosal connectivity and the cellular or synaptic basis of reduced functional connectivity in ASD.</p><p>To provide insight into these questions, we have studied the role of the Fragile X Mental Retardation gene (<italic>Fmr1</italic>) in development of callosal synaptic connections in mice. Loss-of-function mutations in <italic>FMR1</italic> in humans cause Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and leading monogenic cause of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niu et al., 2017</xref>). Children, age 6–24 months, with FXS have reduced structural integrity of white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swanson et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mice, an animal model for FXS, have a similar reduction in white matter tract integrity as well as decreased functional coherence among different cortical regions as measured with functional MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haberl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zerbi et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, neural networks involved in sensory processing show severe functional underconnectivity, including both intra- and inter-hemispheric cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zerbi et al., 2018</xref>). The cellular or synaptic basis for decreased inter-region functional coherence in FXS is unknown, and whether this is due to direct or indirect roles for <italic>Fmr1</italic> in cortical neurons is unclear.</p><p>In addition to reduced long-range connectivity, there are reports of increased connectivity and hyperexcitability of local cortical circuits in humans with ASD and FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciarrusta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Courchesne and Pierce, 2005</xref>). In the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse, there is strong evidence for hyperexcitable local cortical circuits , including in visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Contractor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonçalves et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hays et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Osterweil et al., 2013</xref>). Hyperactive cortical circuits are also observed in humans with FXS, and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice as an increase in resting state gamma power in the resting state EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jonak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lovelace et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Multiple cellular and synaptic alterations likely contribute to hyperexcitability of local circuits including synaptically hyperconnected pyramidal neurons, reduced inhibitory neuron activity and changes in intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Layer (L) 2/3 and L5 cortical pyramidal neurons receive and integrate excitatory synaptic inputs from homotopic contralateral hemisphere (callosal) as well as other long-range inputs from ipsilateral cortical regions and local cortical circuits. Little is known if or how the development of local and long-range synaptic inputs is balanced or if this balance is regulated by ASD-risk genes.</p><p><italic>Fmr1</italic> encodes Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that interacts with many mRNAs including those encoding pre- and post-synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). It is perhaps through this diversity of mRNA targets that FMRP regulates multiple properties of synapses, including maturation, pruning and acute forms of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfeiffer and Huber, 2009</xref>). Regarding excitatory cortical synapses in somatosensory cortex, <italic>Fmr1</italic> regulates maturation of thalamocortical inputs to L4 neurons as well as between local cortical circuits. A common finding is a delayed maturation of excitatory synapses on <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons, as observed by the delayed presence of NMDA receptor-only, or ‘silent’, synapses and acquisition of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission at thalamocortical synapses onto L4 neurons and between locally connected L5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Contractor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, L4 to L2/3 synaptic inputs are weak and delayed in their developmental strengthening, and dendritic spines on cortical pyramidal neurons are thin and filopodial-like, resembling immature spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cruz-Martín et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nimchinsky et al., 2001</xref>). L5 local synaptic connections ultimately mature and appear normal during the 4th postnatal week but then fail to prune, which results in hyperconnectivity of L5 neurons at 4–5 weeks of age as compared to wild-type cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the delayed development and hyperconnectivity of L5 circuits are due to a cell autonomous, postsynaptic role for FMRP in L5 neurons, suggesting a direct role of FMRP in coordinating multiple synapse development processes. The cellular locus of FMRP function in development of L4 to L2/3 inputs or whether postsynaptic FMRP similarly regulates development of long-range synaptic connections is unknown.</p><p>Using viral mediated expression of Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) in callosal projecting cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>), we observe weak callosal synaptic inputs onto L2/3 and L5 <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons that are mediated by a cell autonomous, postsynaptic, and postnatal role of FMRP. Callosal inputs have a selective deficit in AMPA receptor (R), but not NMDAR-, mediated synaptic transmission, indicative of synapse maturation deficit in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons. Sensory deprivation by whisker trimming normalized callosal input strength suggesting that sensory experience-driven activity of postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons weakens callosal synapses. Surprisingly, local excitatory inputs were normal on L2/3 neurons with postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> deletion, revealing differential regulation of local and callosal synaptic connections by FMRP. These results reveal a cellular and synaptic substrate for reduced interhemispheric connectivity in FXS as well as imbalanced activity with local circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optogenetic activation of callosal axons shows weak excitatory synaptic inputs onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons in barrel cortex of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title><p>To measure callosal synaptic function and connectivity between hemispheres, mCherry-tagged Channelrhodpsin-2 (ChR2) was expressed in callosal projecting cortical neurons by injecting AAV9 into in one hemisphere of primary somatosensory cortex of postnatal day (P) one pups. At P18-25, acute coronal slices containing barrel cortex contralateral to the AAV injected side were prepared and whole cell patch clamp recordings of L2/3 pyramidal neurons were performed in the region innervated by fluorescently labeled callosal axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were elicited by stimulating ChR2 expressing callosal axons with brief (2 ms) blue LED light pulses in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rajkovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The blue LED was delivered through a 40 X lens centered around the soma of approximately 350 µm diameter in size and thus the amplitude of LED-evoked EPSCs likely reflects the overall strength of callosal synaptic inputs onto the recorded neuron. The amplitude of LED-evoked EPSCs in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons was reduced by ~40 % compared to WT. Similarly, reduced EPSC amplitudes were observed by comparing raw values or when normalized to LED power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To determine if weak callosal synaptic inputs were localized to a subcellular region on recorded L2/3 neurons (e.g. apical vs. distal dendrites), we utilized a method termed subcellular Channelrhodopsin2-assisted circuit mapping (sCRACM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>). A blue laser was flashed across an array of locations, relative to the soma of the recorded neuron, in a pseudorandom order to elicit glutamate release from ChR2-expressing callosal axon terminals and EPSCs at localized dendritic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). The mean amplitude of EPSCs at each site was converted into a color map for each recorded neuron and these maps were then aligned by the position of soma and averaged within genotype. The resulting average map depicts the subcellular distribution of callosal synaptic input strengths onto WT or <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Results reveal that callosal synaptic inputs onto WT L2/3 neurons are strongest at the proximal apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>) and there is an interaction of <italic>Fmr1</italic> and vertical position (*p &lt; 0.05, F(15, 849) = 1.723; mixed-effects ANOVA).

In the same animals, AAV.ChR2-mCherry was injected into the right barrel cortex to label callosal axons as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This experimental design allowed us to measure the cell autonomous effect of postsynaptic FMRP deletion in L2/3 neurons in a primarily WT cortex on synapses from WT callosal axons. At P18-30, acute cortical slices were prepared and simultaneous whole cell recordings were performed on pairs of neighboring L2/3 pyramidal neurons in left barrel cortex with one being a GFP (-), or WT neuron, and the other a GFP (+), or <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Monosynaptic EPSCs from callosal axons were elicited with either bulk LED stimulation or blue laser, to perform sCRACM, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). Interestingly, at the earliest age for recording (P18-20), overall callosal synaptic input strengths were not different between WT and postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, at P23-30, postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons had a 40 % reduction in callosal synaptic input strength compared to neighboring WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A two-way ANOVA indicates a significant interaction between genotype and age (<italic>Fmr1</italic> x Age ***p &lt; 0.001, F(1, 32) = 13.87)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, we observed a strong trend of callosal input strength to increase with developmental age in WT, but not <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO, neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Whisker trimming began at P15 to reduce effects of sensory deprivation on the early growth and branching of callosal projection axons and continued until the day before slice recordings.

Sensory deprivation of postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons prevented weakening of callosal synaptic inputs suggesting that experience-driven patterned activity of postsynaptic L2/3 neurons without FMRP is necessary for synaptic weakening and/or prevents maturation. In conclusion, our results reveal a postsynaptic mechanism by which <italic>Fmr1</italic> regulates callosal connectivity that likely contributes to the reduced interhemispheric structural and functional connectivity in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice and humans with FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haberl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swanson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zerbi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A synaptic basis for reduced functional long-range connectivity in FXS</title><p>Functional MRI studies show that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice have reduced corticocortical long-range connectivity, especially among the sensory and motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haberl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zerbi et al., 2018</xref>) as well as reduced corpus callosum structural integrity.

This result suggests that reduced functional coherence between bilateral barrel cortices in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice could be due to a disrupted communication between the cortices through the weakened monosynaptic transmission. Interhemispheric functional connectivity is thought to shape perceptual integration including those involved in speech comprehension and global form processing, domains that are impaired in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth and Happé, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friederici et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Happé and Frith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peiker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Preisig et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simon and Wallace, 2016</xref>).

Our observation of weaker callosal synaptic inputs onto cell autonomous <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO L2/3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) confirms results in <italic>Fmr1</italic> global KO mice and further reveals an essential role of postsynaptic FMRP in promoting callosal synapses development. With postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO we observe weak callosal synapses at P23-30, but not at P18-20. To determine if a similar developmental profile is observed in the global <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO, we analyzed a subgroup of data collected at P18-20 and observe weak callosal synaptic strength in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO at this early time point (WT = 181 ± 22 pA, n = 15; KO = 106.1 ± 17.77 pA, n = 7, *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, unpaired t-test). The later developmental onset of weak callosal synaptic transmission with postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> deletion may be due to later postnatal deletion of <italic>Fmr1</italic> using P1 AAV-Cre-GFP injection which we estimate to occur about P7-P9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rajkovich et al., 2017</xref>). However, we cannot rule out a role for FMRP in presynaptic, callosal projecting neurons, or other cell types, such as oligodendrocytes, within the first postnatal weeks to establish callosal synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doll et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanson and Madison, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that callosal synapses do not mature or are not maintained without FMRP in postsynaptic L2/3 neurons. In support of a role in maturation, callosal synaptic strength tends to increase from P18-20 to P23-30 in WT neurons but not in postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, we observe a selective weakening of AMPAR, but not NMDAR-, mediated synaptic transmission at callosal inputs onto <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This result, together with a decreased frequency of evoked quantal events in Sr<sup>2+</sup> and increased coefficient of variation, suggests a reduced number of mature synapses with functional AMPARs. As synapses mature, they acquire NMDARs prior to AMPARs and NMDAR-only, immature synapses are often termed ‘silent’ synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashby and Isaac, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hanse et al., 2013</xref>). Although we did not measure ‘silent’ callosal synapses here, our findings would predict more ‘silent’ and immature callosal synapses in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO L2/3 neurons. In support of this idea, thalamocortical inputs to L4, another ‘long-range’ synaptic pathway, are delayed in their development in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO, as measured by acquisition of AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harlow et al., 2010</xref>). Another possible explanation for our results is the optogenetic stimulation paradigm we used to evoke glutamate release from callosal axons saturates synaptic NMDARs, but not AMPARs, due to the higher affinity of glutamate for NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patneau and Mayer, 1990</xref>). Additional experiments and/or methods are needed to confirm a selective decrease in AMPARs at <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO callosal synapses. The observations of reduced corpus callosum structural integrity and interhemispheric coherence with fMRI in adult <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO suggest weak callosal connectivity in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haberl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zerbi et al., 2018</xref>). Weak callosal synapses persist in adults with postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> deletion, suggesting a deficit in maturation or AMPAR insertion/stability, as opposed to developmental delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). Reduced callosal axon diameter is observed in adult <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO which may be a consequence of weak or immature callosal synapses and contribute to reduced interhemispheric coherence in FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haberl et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Postsynaptic FMRP differentially regulates synaptic inputs from local and long-range cortical circuits</title><p>Neocortical pyramidal neurons integrate excitatory synaptic inputs from local and long-range circuits, including ipsilateral and contralateral cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldmeyer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerfen et al., 2018</xref>). An imbalance in local and long-range connectivity has been hypothesized to contribute to ASD in humans; specifically, hyperconnectivity of local circuits and underconnectivity of long-range circuits or between brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belmonte et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Courchesne and Pierce, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O’Reilly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rane et al., 2015</xref>). If or how ASD genes regulate the balance of local and long-range synaptic connectivity is unknown. Here we demonstrate that postsynaptic FMRP differentially regulates development and/or maintenance of synaptic inputs from local and long-range cortical sources. L2/3 neurons with postsynaptic deletion of <italic>Fmr1</italic> have weak and immature callosal synaptic inputs but normal synaptic inputs from L4, adjacent L2/3 and L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Bureau et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bureau et al., 2008</xref>) and we (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) find that L4 to L2/3 synapses are weak in the global <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO, but we do not observe this with embryonic or postnatal cell autonomous deletion of <italic>Fmr1</italic> in L2/3 neurons. Together these results suggest a role for FMRP in presynaptic L4 neurons in synapse development onto L2/3 neurons, which is consistent with the reported deficits in L4 axon morphology in the global <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bureau et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Results in L5 also indicate differential regulation of local and long-range cortical connectivity by postsynaptic FMRP. Our previous work using multiple simultaneous recordings of locally connected L5A neurons, revealed hyperconnectivity of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO L5 neurons with their immediate neighbors ( &lt; 40 µm apart) in S1 at 4 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). Hyperconnectivity of L5 local subnetworks resulted from deficient developmental pruning between <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO L5 neurons and was observed in both the global <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and with postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> deletion. Prefrontal L5 cortical neurons in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice are similarly hyperconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Testa-Silva et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to local hyperconnectivity, here we find that postsynaptic deletion of <italic>Fmr1</italic> in L5 neurons results in weak callosal synaptic inputs. Thus, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO L5 pyramidal neurons are hyperconnected locally and under-connected to contralateral cortex; an effect that is mediated by cell-autonomous and postsynaptic deletion of FMRP. Such an effect may promote the reported imbalances in local and long-range functional connectivity observed in ASD individuals. Postsynaptic deletion of FMRP in L2/3 neurons did not affect synaptic inputs from other layers or between columns within L2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggesting that FMRP may selectively promote pruning of local connections in L5 neurons. Alternatively, FMRP may prune synaptic connections within very local cortical subnetworks (within 40 µm) in both L2/3 and L5, but not connections between layers and columns.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms by which postsynaptic FMRP differentially regulates L4 and callosal inputs to L2/3 neurons is unclear. L4 neurons synapse primarily on basal dendrites of L2/3 neurons, whereas callosal inputs are primarily on apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Therefore, localized expression and translational regulation of specific dendritic mRNAs by FMRP at either basal or apical dendritic compartments could differentially affect L4 and callosal inputs. Alternatively, FMRP translational regulation of postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules, such as neuroligins, could differentially impact specific presynaptic inputs based on their expression of binding partners such as neurexin splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Südhof, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Bidirectional regulation of callosal synaptic function by MEF2C and FMRP</title><p>Differential regulation of local and long-range cortical synaptic connectivity is observed with another ASD-risk gene, Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 C (<italic>Mef2c</italic>).

The differential regulation of local and callosal synaptic connections by postsynaptic MEF2C and FMRP, albeit in different directions, suggest that imbalances in local and long-range synaptic connectivity may contribute to different genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders. Our results also implicate roles for transcription and translational control in the input-specific development of cortical circuits. Bidirectional regulation of local and long-range connectivity by <italic>Mef2c</italic> in L2/3 or by <italic>Fmr1</italic> in L5 could be an effect of homeostasis or competition between local and long-range synaptic connections to maintain optimal cortical circuit function. For example, weakening of callosal synaptic input in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons may be compensatory and an attempt to normalize hyperconnected or hyperexcitable local circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Interaction of sensory experience and ASD-risk genes in regulation of long-range cortical circuits</title><p>The regulation of local or callosal connectivity by FMRP and MEF2C requires normal sensory experience suggesting that both of these genes function in experience and activity-regulated pathways necessary for cortical circuit development.

Specifically, trimming whiskers contralateral to L2/3 neurons with postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> deletion (postsynaptic deprivation) prevented callosal synaptic weakening. In contrast, ‘presynaptic deprivation’ or trimming whiskers contralateral to ChR2-expressing, callosal projecting neurons, had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This result suggests that sensory-driven patterned activity of postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO L2/3 neurons weakens callosal synapses.

Traces of Fast Green FCF dye (Sigma) were added to facilitate visualization of virus spreading. Neonatal mouse pups (P1) were first anesthetized by hypothermia, then fixed on a customized mold and placed on a stereotaxic frame. AAV9.eGFP-Cre (420–560 nL) was delivered to left ventricle at a depth of approximately 1.1 mm underneath skull through a beveled glass pipette using Nanoject II injector (Drummond Scientific, Inc). AAV9.ChR2-mCherry (400 nL) was delivered to superficial layers (0.5 mm underneath skull) of somatosensory cortex in right hemisphere at a speed of 1.2 µL/min using syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Inc).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Acute slice preparation</title><p>Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Ketamine/Xylazine mixture and decapitated upon irresponsiveness to toe-pinch. Acute coronal slices (300 µm thickness) containing somatosensory barrel cortex were prepared using vibrating microtome (Leica VT1200S). During sectioning, tissue blocks were submerged in ice-cold dissection buffer containing (in mM): 110 choline chloride, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 dextrose, 11.6 ascorbic acid, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3.1 Na-pyruvate, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, continuously aerated with 95%CO<sub>2</sub>/5%O<sub>2</sub>. For mice older than P23, transcardial perfusion of ice-cold dissection buffer was performed prior to decapitation to increase slice quality. Slices were then transferred to artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) solution containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 dextrose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (aerated with 95%CO<sub>2</sub>/5%O2) and recovered at 34 °C for 30 min followed by 30 min at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>After recovery, slices were transferred to a recording chamber at room temperature and perfused with ACSF aerated with 95%CO<sub>2</sub>/5%O<sub>2</sub>. Slices were visualized by infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) optics (Olympus BX51W1). Whole cell recordings of L2/3 and L5 pyramidal neurons were obtained using borosilicate pipettes (4–7 MΩ) and a Multiclamp 700 A amplifier (Molecular Devices). Internal solution contained (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 6 KCl, 3 NaCl, 0.2 EGTA, 14 phosphocreatine-tris, 4 Mg-ATP and 0.4 Na-GTP. All recordings were conducted in voltage clamp, holding at –70 mV unless otherwise specified, and data were collected and analyzed using custom Labview programs (Labview 8.6, National Instruments Inc). Spiking patterns upon current injection were used as criteria to identify excitatory neurons. For experiments where spiking was blocked by TTX, rise time to hyperpolarizing current ( &gt; 50 ms) and kinetics of mPSC (width at half height &gt;2 ms) were used as criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Povysheva et al., 2006</xref>). Excitatory neurons with resting membrane potential &lt; –50 mV and a series resistance &lt;35 MΩ were included in analysis. Voltages were not corrected for junction potential. For simultaneous patch clamp recordings, the distance between the pair of cells (center-to-center) is 10–40 µm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optogenetic bulk stimulation of callosal axons</title><p>Mice with either cortical injection of AAV9.ChR2-mCherry or unilateral ventricular injection of AAV9.eGFP-Cre and contralateral cortical injection of AAV9.ChR2-mCherry were used for this experiment. Fluorescence of GFP-positive soma and mCherry-labeled axons were visualized using a fluorescent mercury lamp (Excelitas Technologies Corp.). Slices containing clearly labeled mCherry+ axons from contralateral barrel cortex were used for recording. Slices with somatic infection of ChR2-mCherry due to virus leaked from contralateral hemisphere were discarded to avoid contamination from local inputs. The infection rate of recorded Cre-GFP+ neurons in barrel cortex was 3–5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Only neurons residing in an area with densely labeled callosal axons were subject to recording to achieve a reliable magnitude and reduced variability of light-induced responses. For all LED experiments, responses were evoked by a 2 ms flash from a digitally controlled blue LED (final beam diameter: 350 µm; power: 0.1–4.6 mW; wavelength: 470 nm; M470L4-C1, Thorlabs Inc) through a 40 X water-immersed objective. The LED flash was centered on soma and proximal apical dendrites of recorded neurons.</p><p>To measure LED-evoked EPSCs, each cell (or cell pair) was stimulated 3–10 times with 20–30 s intervals. LED power was adjusted to obtain an EPSC amplitude of 100–1000 pA in WT neurons (for cell pairs). The external solution for both LED and sCRACM experiments contained ACSF with 1 µM TTX, 100 µM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), 10 µM (±)–3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) and 100 µM picrotoxin to isolate monosynaptic AMPAR-mediated excitatory inputs. Callosal input strength was measured as the peak amplitude of an average EPSC of 3–10 evoked EPSCs for each neuron.</p><p>To measure Sr<sup>2+</sup> evoked quantal events, each cell pair was stimulated with an LED flash every 30 s, 12–30 times in ACSF containing 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM SrCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 µM CPP and 100 µM picrotoxin. Events occurring within a 1 s window prior to the LED were defined as spontaneous events and those occurring 50–350 ms post-LED were defined LED-evoked events. The frequency and amplitude of events were analyzed using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft).</p><p>NMDAR-mediated EPSCs from callosal inputs were pharmacologically isolated in ACSF containing: 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 µM DNQX, 20 µM glycine, 100 µM picrotoxin, 1 µM TTX, 100 µM 4-AP. An LED flash was delivered every 30 s, 9 times. Evoked EPSCs were averaged and peak amplitude was measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Subcellular channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping (sCRACM) and action potential dependent activation of ChR2</title><p>After collection of LED-evoked responses, the objective was switched to 4 X to visualize a broader area. ChR2 expressing axons were then stimulated by a blue laser (1 ms; wavelength: 473 nm; power range: 0.7–16 mW; final beam diameter: 25 µm; CrystaLaser) scanning through a 12 × 12 grid (50 µm spacing) in a pseudorandom order to avoid repeated activation of neighboring locations. The grid was aligned along the pia and centered in the medial-lateral position on the recorded somas. The grid was repeatedly scanned 2–4 times at 40 s intervals. Laser-evoked EPSCs were collected from each grid spot. Most neuron pairs ( &gt; 90%) were homogeneously distributed between 150 and 300 µm from pia surface.</p><p>For action potential-dependent callosal synaptic strength measurements, an independent cohort of mice was used. The recording ACSF was similar to sCRACM experiments, except TTX and 4-AP were omitted, and divalent cations were increased (4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and CPP was added to reduce polysynaptic activation of local circuits. For L2/3 neurons, an 8 × 8 grid with 75 × 100 µm x-y spacing was used. For L5 neurons, an 8 × 8 grid with 75 × 125 µm x-y spacing was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of blue laser evoked EPSCs</title><p>For sCRACM, EPSCs evoked from two to four laser-stimulation at each grid spot from an individual neuron were averaged. The peak amplitude of the average EPSC (between 5–80 ms after laser onset) was determined as the input strength for that spot. A spatial map of input strengths was then generated for each individual neuron. The spatial maps for all neurons of each genotype were then aligned to soma location, oriented with respect to the pial surface, and averaged to generate an average spatial map of input strengths for each genotype aligned to the soma. A color representation of the average spatial map for each genotype were generated for the figures. Pixel size for the genotype-averaged color maps was halved through pixel interpolation (25 × 25 µm) to provide better spatial resolution for soma alignment. Vertical profiling of input strength was achieved by averaging inputs from each horizontal row and plotting against the vertical distance from soma. Input strength from a specific area was calculated by averaging input strengths within an area for each neuron and averaging according to genotype.</p><p>For action-potential-dependent ChR2 activation and circuit mapping, analysis was performed as for sCRACM, except EPSC amplitudes were averaged during 2–30 ms after laser onset to exclude contamination from polysynaptic responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) with glutamate uncaging</title><p>LSPS experiments were performed similar to that described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rajkovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shepherd et al., 2003</xref>). For all experiments, only brain slices with L2/3 apical dendrites parallel to the slice surface were used to ensure preservation of the planar barrel cortical geometry of cross-layer synaptic pathways spanning at least 3 barrel columns. Usually 2–4 brain slices per animal met such criteria. ACSF included 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and CPP (10 μM) to reduced polysynaptic local circuit activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rajkovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shepherd et al., 2003</xref>), and 4-Methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-caged-L-glutamate, MNI glutamate (MNI, 0.3 mM, either Tocris-1490 or HelloBio-HB0423). A 1 ms UV laser flash (wavelength: 355 nm; power range: 30–40 mW; final beam diameter: 20 µm; DPSS Lasers Inc) was delivered at individual points within a 16 × 16 grid (50 × 60 µm x-y spacing) in a pseudorandom order. The grid was aligned along the pia surface and centered medial-laterally on the soma location. The entire grid was repeatedly scanned 2–4 times at 40 s intervals. Two to four maps were acquired for each neuron included in all datasets.</p><p>For each neuron, a single average map was calculated from acquired LSPS maps, where at each stimulation point the averaged light evoked EPSC area was calculated within a time window of 5–80 ms following the laser pulse. If a response was observed within 5 ms of LSPS and displayed kinetics visibly faster than the longer-latency EPSC then it was considered to be a non-synaptic, ‘direct’ response to uncaging of glutamate on the recorded neuron. Direct responses were removed from the map and not included in analysis. For responses with a major component of monosynaptic transmission and minor contamination from ‘direct’ activation, ‘direct’ response component was subtracted from the whole response by fitting a double-exponential decay equation. An IR-DIC image of the slice with patch pipettes in place and stimulation grid was acquired prior to LSPS for marking soma location and anatomical features of the slice (i.e. barrels, etc.). Finally, a color map for each neuron was created. All individual color maps within genotype were then overlaid upon spatial alignment with respect to the center of the ‘home’ barrel directly beneath recorded L2/3 neurons. Superimposition of the average maps was achieved by (1) transposing each map such that the home barrel center was located at the origin of alignment grid, (2) preserving the medial-lateral orientation of the brain slice, and (3) stretching the home barrel in x and y dimensions to normalize barrel size. Pixel size for the genotype-averaged color maps was halved through pixel interpolation (25 × 30 µm) to provide better spatial resolution for soma alignment. Black pixels within an averaged color map in the figures indicate deleted direct responses or pixels that did not meet the minimum sampling threshold (minimum of n = 8 neurons per stimulation point).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Whisker trimming</title><p>Unilateral whisker trimming was performed daily on mice starting at P15 until the day before experiment (P23-30) using a miniature electric shaver. All whiskers from the trimmed pad were maintained at a length &lt;1 mm. For a litter of mice, half of the mice would be trimmed on the right whisker pad, ipsilateral to the AAV9.ChR2-mCherry injection (postsynaptic deprivation), while the other half would be trimmed on the left whisker pad, contralateral to the AAV9.ChR2-mCherry injection (presynaptic deprivation).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>All the statistical tests and graphs were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software Inc).

All statistical tests are two-sided. Only datasets tested to be normally distributed by both tests were subject to parametric statistics – unpaired or paired t-test. Otherwise, Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon matched pairs test were used as indicated in the figure legends. For data collected from double-patch experiments, paired statistics were used as each pair of neurons would be considered correlated. For comparing more than two groups of data, two-way ANOVA or mixed effect analysis with multiple comparisons was used. Repeated measures ANOVA was used for vertical profile maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Methodology, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Software, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The authors find that long-range interhemispheric synapses are selectively weakened following loss of function of the gene mediating fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited form of intellectual disability. Using clever genetic and physiological approaches in mice, the authors show that the effect is cell autonomous and occurs postnatally by impeding the normal developmental strengthening of these synapses. The results convincingly enhance our understanding of the complex pathophysiology of neurological dysfunction in this developmental disorder.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;FMRP regulates experience-dependent maturation of callosal synaptic connections and bilateral cortical synchrony&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sacha B Nelson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Lu Chen as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewers were concerned about the interpretation of the sparse conditional knockout experiments because of ambiguities in which cells and synapses were affected. Specifically, reviewer 2 felt, &quot;the approach they used induces Fmr1 KO in the population of neurons in one hemisphere without control over the brain areas/layers/cell types within it. Thus, interpretation of data from experiments that involves the local circuit is difficult (i.e., local circuit connectivity/sensory deprivation), because Fmr1 KO is not restricted to post (L2/3) but also pre (e.g., L4) and potentially beyond (e.g. ipsilateral thalamus)&quot; and reviewer 3 agreed with this concern. Both reviewers felt the concern could be addressed by demonstrating the sparseness of the labeling in a supplementary figure or additional panel.</p><p>2) All three reviewers felt that the EEG data were not compelling. This could be addressed either by removing these data or through additional experiments using the conditional KO and using the same cortical region studied in the rest of the manuscript.</p><p>3) The reviewers also felt that additional experiments were needed to address the question of whether the callosal deficits are lasting or represent a transient developmental defect that normalizes by adulthood, as was observed earlier in development with other synaptic deficits.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have several suggestions for improvement that could be addressed either through additional experiments or through textual changes to acknowledge alternative interpretations.</p><p>1. The strontium and NMDA only experiments in figure 5 are suggestive but fall short of demonstrating a retention of silent synapses. The most direct way to demonstrate this would be to use minimal electrical or optogenetic stimulation and directly demonstrate the existence of silent synapses. However, there are aspects of this interpretation that do not make sense. With sparse deletion, callosal synaptic input was normal at P18-20 and synaptic loss occurred later (P23-30) but the silent synapse interpretation would require that a large number of callosal synapses remain silent until 3 weeks of age and then are strengthened by &quot;AMPAfication.&quot; this is much later than silent synapses are thought to be lost in the neocortex, so this would be quite surprising. The experiments of figure 5 do not seem conclusive first because the effect on frequency (C) are quite modest relative to the large change in overall synaptic drive seen in prior experiments. A potential limitation of the NMDA only experiments is that these receptors may saturate masking presynaptic changes. Also, one would want to fully map the spatial profile of the response as with the AMPA responses. I think it would be fine to simply acknowledge the limitations of the evidence for this model in the discussion and admit that other factors might also contribute.</p><p>2. I was surprised that the discussion does not use the term &quot;competition.&quot; The results seem most consistent with the idea that local and long range synapses normally compete and that biasing this competition with deprivation can normalize the bias introduced by the knockout if applied to the correct set of synapses. This is of course only a suggestion that the authors are free to use or not as they see fit. Another, more minor suggestion along these lines is to refer to old ultrastructural and anatomical studies (e.g. Czeiger and White 1993 and references therein) that callosal synapses are quite similar to other long-range intracortical synapses. This would help make the argument that although the callosal connection is useful to study physiologically or in vivo, the pathology likely extends to many other long range connections.</p><p>Discussion between the reviewers revealed that the other reviewers did not find this explanation likely because of the lack of increase in 4-&gt;2/3 synapses following manipulations that reduce callosal input. I think there may be a ceiling effect because the 2/3-&gt;4 projection is one of the strongest in the cortex, but wanted you to be aware that this view was not shared by the 3 reviewers.</p><p>3. Given the supplementary results confirming the effects seen by Bureau et al., but only in the germ-line knockout, it would seem important to acknowledge in the discussion that the in vivo synchrony results could reflect changes in local circuits and not only altered callosal function.</p><p>4. Finally, one small clarification would be helpful. The age ranges in Figures1 and 2 overlap. If the data in Figure 1 are analyzed by age, do they show the same effect as Figure 2? This needn't be the case, but it would be helpful to note the results and your thinking about this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Use of AAV9:</p><p>AAV9 has a retrograde property (e.g. Haery et al., 2019), which could reduce the specificity of input sources. Some estimates of the retrograde transfection rate will clarify the impact of non-callosal inputs on the data.</p><p>LED stimulation method:</p><p>It is unclear photostimulation via 40x objective covers all the dendritic arbor of recorded neurons. Based on the information from Figure 1G scale bar, 200 μm LED spot size will only cover proximal dendrites, especially for deep L2/3 neurons.</p><p>Subdividing the age range for callosal input analysis in Figure 2:</p><p>This seems arbitrarily chosen. An explanation of why this is done is helpful.</p><p>The extent of neuronal labeling achieved by ventricular injection of AAV9.GFP-Cre at P1:</p><p>This needs to be clarified as Kim et al. (2013) cited used different AAV serotype/promoters (and age). The low mag image(s) showing the labeling pattern in the affected hemisphere (at least one covering all layers in S1) is helpful. Please clarify how 'infection rate… &lt;10%' (line 495) is quantified.</p><p>Reporting distribution of recorded L2/3 neurons:</p><p>This information helps interpret the averaged sCRACM data. The length of apical dendrites varies with depth, with some L2 neurons having no clear/oblique apical dendrite. Including those into the average map (said to be aligned to the soma) will generate strong inputs at basal than distal. Please also clarify how dendritic morphology was verified to be intact (no cut) after the recording. How does the data look when maps are aligned at pia?</p><p>On sCRACM data:</p><p>It seems the sCRACM data do not significantly add much to the LED data or the conclusion. The authors could consider moving those to supplemental figures to make the presentation simple.</p><p>Reporting the distance between the pair of recorded neurons:</p><p>This clarifies their proximity and no edge effect affecting the data (which is a potential concern as the callosal axon occupies a narrow homotopic column (~200 μm based on Figure 1B)).</p><p>Inconsistency in the information:</p><p>The LED spot size is said to be 200 μm in the text but it is said to be 350 μm in the method.</p><p>Use of different dissection methods for a different age:</p><p>This raises the concern that the age-dependent effect could be due to slice quality.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It is indeed surprising that different excitatory synapses can show different phenotypes in the FMR1 KO resulting in both local hyperconnectivity (in L5) or delayed maturation but then ultimately normal function (at L4 to L2/3) – but then reduced function at callosal inputs. This recovery of function suggests that the maturation of callosal inputs might be delayed but ultimately normal in this model, and experiments to examine these inputs in older animals are required to interpret this result.</p><p>2. The deprivation studies are difficult to interpret. What is the mechanism behind this effect?</p><p>3. Interneuron function is altered in the FMR1 KO (Goel et al., 2018; Gibson et al., 2014). Unless the only (or primary) thing that is impaired in the KO is the strength of the callosal input, it will be hard to attribute the lack of coherence in gamma to this connection at a single timepoint. What if local inhibitory circuits are altered in the KO? Or, callosal inputs to interneurons?</p><p>4. Why look at callosal effects on synchronization in auditory function, when all measurements are done in S1/whisker deprivation?</p><p>5. Gamma coherence was tested at a different age. It is reasonable that the synaptic deficits observed at the single timepoint examined might be rectified at later ages, or they could possibly be exacerbated. These synaptic deficits might be some primary phenotype of FMR1 KO, but the correlated reduction in gamma coherence may be secondary to this; for example, reduced synaptic strength could drives elimination of callosal axons over time (especially since there are white matter deficits in autism patients), resulting in reduced coherence. I actually think it might be better to suggest that the reduction in callosal afferent strength could influence interhemispheric communication without presenting the last figure, that is not well-controlled and is less integrated with the data in the rest of the manuscript.</p><p>6. Example EEG traces that show this effect would greatly add to the interpretability of this analysis. Is overall EEG power different within a hemisphere? Is it altered equally in both sensory and motor areas?</p><p>7. There is no discussion of the molecular mechanisms of FMR1, or how it might differentially influence one type of synapse but not another. In addition, the overall hypothesis that they are testing appears to be that FMR1 suppresses long-range connections but enhances or does not influence local connections. To these ends, it would be useful to look at long-range connections that are not callosal – for example, from M1 or S2. Is there something special about callosal inputs or is it the timing of their maturation, for example?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71555.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewers were concerned about the interpretation of the sparse conditional knockout experiments because of ambiguities in which cells and synapses were affected.

We now include a new supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) showing representative low-and high magnification epifluorescence GFP images taken under experimental settings. The low-mag image shows the representative sparseness of Cre-GFP expression across all layers of barrel cortex and part of the striatum underneath cortex, which is consistent with the low amount of virus we applied (~5 x 10<sup>8</sup> GC total per animal). We also include some representative high-mag images from L2/3, L4 and L5 in the same figure. Based on our experience, for a 0.05 mm<sup>2</sup> field of view (FoV) at a specific focus under 40x objective, we find 0-3 transfected cells. As a simple estimation of the transfection rate, we counted the number of transfected cells and total number of neurons identified by IR-DIC for each FoV across 4 injected mice and calculated 3-5% of cells are virally transfected with Cre-GFP. Given the sparseness of Fmr1 deletion, deletion in presynaptic L4 neurons or other brain regions should be minimal and equally affect inputs to postsynaptic Fmr1 KO neurons and their WT neighbors. Therefore, with this sparse deletion paradigm our observations should reflect the function of postsynaptic Fmr1/FMRP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) All three reviewers felt that the EEG data were not compelling.

Similar to that observed in younger mice, we observe weak callosal input mediated EPSCs in postsynaptic Fmr1 KO L2/3 neurons as compared to WT neighbors. This result suggests that weak callosal synaptic inputs persist into young adulthood in the Fmr1 KO. These data are now included in the revised manuscript in Figure 2F-G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have several suggestions for improvement that could be addressed either through additional experiments or through textual changes to acknowledge alternative interpretations.</p><p>1.

We have revised our conclusions and discussion of these results to indicate that more experiments must be done to conclusively demonstrate silent synapses.</p><p>With regard to the time course of callosal synapse development, results in Figure 2E indicate that callosal synapses continue to strengthen between P18 and P30 in WT neurons, suggesting there may be ongoing “AMPAfication” at callosal synapses during the 3rd postnatal week. To our knowledge, there is not published work measuring developmental progress of silent synapses at callosal inputs. We also did not measure the developmental changes in NMDAR mediated callosal synaptic strength so we cannot conclusively determine if the strengthening is due to AMPAfication, additional synapses or other presynaptic mechanisms. We discuss this point briefly in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiments of figure 5 do not seem conclusive first because the effect on frequency (C) are quite modest relative to the large change in overall synaptic drive seen in prior experiments.

To further test the synaptic locus of change, we measured the coefficient of variance (C.V.) of LED-evoked callosal EPSCs onto WT and Fmr1 KO neurons (from experiments in Figs, 2D (P23-30) and Figure 5B<sub>1</sub>). C.V. is inversely proportional to release probability and synapse number (Manabe et al., 1993). We observed a significant (~20%) increase in CV in Fmr1 KO in comparison to neighboring WT neurons (p&lt;0.05; Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This finding is consistent with the decrease in frequency of evoked events in Sr<sup>2+</sup>. While changes in CV and frequency are modest, together they indicate that the weakening of callosal mediated EPSCs in Fmr1 KO is in part a result of decreased synapse number and/or presynaptic release probability.</p><p>Thank you for pointing out the possibility of NMDAR saturation. We revised the discussion to acknowledge the limitations in interpretation of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This would help make the argument that although the callosal connection is useful to study physiologically or in vivo, the pathology likely extends to many other long range connections.</p><p>Discussion between the reviewers revealed that the other reviewers did not find this explanation likely because of the lack of increase in 4-&gt;2/3 synapses following manipulations that reduce callosal input. I think there may be a ceiling effect because the 2/3-&gt;4 projection is one of the strongest in the cortex, but wanted you to be aware that this view was not shared by the 3 reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment and we agree that local and long-range synapses may compete for connectivity. In the original manuscript, we discussed this in terms of a homeostasis between local and long-range inputs, but we have revised our discussion to include the possibility of a competition-based mechanism. Our results in L5 support this view. Postsynaptic deletion of Fmr1 KO in L5 neurons results in hyperconnectivity between local L5 neurons (Patel et al., 2014) but reduced callosal input strengths (Figure 4C,D). Less is known in L2/3. Postsynaptic deletion of Fmr1 KO in L2/3 neurons has no effect on L4 input strengths, but we don’t know if there is hyperconnectivity with L2/3 neighbors as there is in L5. Unfortunately, the very local, within L2/3 connectivity, is masked by direct responses in the LSPS maps and therefore labor-intensive quadruple simultaneous recordings of L2/3 pairs are required to get at this question as we performed previously in L5 and believe is beyond the scope of this current manuscript. It is possible that all “local” synapses may not be equal in their homeostasis or competition with long-range inputs. Interlayer local synapses (L4→L2/3) may be more resistant or stable, whereas within layer (L5→L5 or L2/3→L2/3) may be more plastic or susceptible to competition/homeostasis. These interesting possibilities are future directions of this work.</p><p>Thank you for informing us of the Czeiger and White work. We agree that Fmr1 may also promote other long-range cortico-cortical inputs and added this to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Given the supplementary results confirming the effects seen by Bureau et al., but only in the germ-line knockout, it would seem important to acknowledge in the discussion that the in vivo synchrony results could reflect changes in local circuits and not only altered callosal function.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the EEG data from the manuscript, so we also removed the discussion text of the mechanisms related to the in vivo synchrony.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Finally, one small clarification would be helpful. The age ranges in Figures 1 and 2 overlap. If the data in Figure 1 are analyzed by age, do they show the same effect as Figure 2?

At P18-20 in the global Fmr1 KO, we observe significant weakening of callosal synaptic inputs in the Fmr1 KO in comparison to WT (p&lt; 0.05; WT; n=15; KO; n=7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This contrasts with the postsynaptic cell autonomous deletion (Figure 2D, E), where we did not observe callosal synaptic weakening until after P23. In the discussion, we suggest that the discrepancy between global and postsynaptic Fmr1 KO may be due to the later, postnatal, AAV-Cre mediated, deletion of Fmr1 in the postsynaptic KO condition, likely about P7-P9 (Rajkovich et al., 2017). This may delay the onset of callosal synaptic weakening with postsynaptic Fmr1 KO, as compared to global germline deletion of Fmr1. Alternatively, there may be role for FMRP in presynaptic, callosal projecting neurons, or other cell types, such as oligodendrocytes within the first postnatal weeks to establish callosal synaptic connections.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Young (P18-20) global <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice have weak callosal synaptic connections.</title><p>Left: Raw LED-induced EPSC amplitudes in WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO animals (WT = 181.2 ± 22.18 pA, n = 15; KO = 106.1 ± 17.77 pA, n = 7, *p &lt; 0.05, unpaired t-test); Right: LED-induced EPSC amplitude normalized to LED power and log transformed (WT = 2.216 ± 0.125, n = 15; KO = 1.718 ± 0.118, n = 7, *p &lt; 0.05, unpaired t-test).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71555-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Use of AAV9:</p><p>AAV9 has a retrograde property (e.g. Haery et al., 2019), which could reduce the specificity of input sources.

Furthermore, for the &gt;200 neuron recordings (majority in L2/3 and the rest in L5) we performed with blue light stimulation, we only observed a delayed synaptic current (latency ~2-5 msec) and never encountered a neuron with a fast onset (&lt; 2 msec) blue-light induced current due to direct ChR2 activation. In addition, retrograde transport of AAV9 happens with high vector doses (~10<sup>10</sup> GC per injection site), which is much higher than the amount of virus we applied (~10<sup>8</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> GC total per animal). Also, based on literature, it mostly happens across bilateral hippocampi and among subcortical regions while is much less prominent across bilateral cortices (Cearley and Wolfe, 2006; Haery et al., 2019; Masamizu et al., 2011). This suggests with our virus injection conditions, we are getting expression in the injected hemisphere with little to no leak or retrograde transport of AAV9 ChR2-mCherry into the recorded hemisphere.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>LED stimulation method:</p><p>It is unclear photostimulation via 40x objective covers all the dendritic arbor of recorded neurons.

We agree that by averaging all maps including the ones in upper L2 may bias the averaged map to have more representation of peri-soma locations. However, even with the maps with ‘distal’ responses, the major difference was still seen in peri-soma/proximal dendritic locations because the ‘distal’ responses are usually small and thus harder to detect a difference. Aligning the sCRACM maps to pia instead of neuron soma, we still observe weak callosal input maps in Fmr1 KO neurons in general, and the averaged maps show decreasing gradient from the central ‘hotspot’ of response to the periphery.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Left: sCRACM maps from WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> global KO (Figure 1) aligned to pia surface; Right: sCRACM maps from WT and postsynaptic <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neuron pairs (Figure 2 – figure supplement 2) aligned to pia surface.</title><p>Cyan dots represent the location of soma.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71555-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We didn’t perform neuron filling or reconstruction with our experiments for post-verification of dendritic morphology. Previously, by sparsely transfecting AAV-mCherry in cortex and following the primary dendrite of L5 and L2/3 pyramidal neurons in slice, we find that when the tissue block is perpendicular to the platform during cutting, the primary dendrites in barrel cortex will be largely parallel to the cutting surface of slice, i.e. there will be minimal cut-off for the primary dendrite. Also, for our experiment, we usually record at a depth around 50 μm below the cutting surface and visually follow and verify intact dendrites using IR-DIC of recorded neurons.

Second, with the simultaneous recording paradigm we used, slice quality should have equal contribution to the WT and Fmr1 KO neurons. Then the only possibility would be that perfusion itself unmask the postsynaptic Fmr1 dependent effect.

It is indeed surprising that different excitatory synapses can show different phenotypes in the FMR1 KO resulting in both local hyperconnectivity (in L5) or delayed maturation but then ultimately normal function (at L4 to L2/3) – but then reduced function at callosal inputs. This recovery of function suggests that the maturation of callosal inputs might be delayed but ultimately normal in this model, and experiments to examine these inputs in older animals are required to interpret this result.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer, we performed additional experiments that are presented in Figure 2F and described in “Essential Revisions” point #3.

The deprivation studies are difficult to interpret. What is the mechanism behind this effect?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that sensory deprivation has multiple effects on brain development that make the specific mechanisms behind this effect difficult to interpret. FMRP function is regulated by neuronal activity and glutamate activation of synapses and we wanted to know if manipulating neuronal activity in the neocortex, using sensory deprivation, would affect or interact with Fmr1-dependent regulation of callosal synaptic inputs. Our sensory deprivation experiments suggest that the postsynaptic L2/3 Fmr1 KO neuron must be active for callosal synaptic weakening to occur. We do not know the mechanisms by which Fmr1 and sensory-driven activity interact but suggest that this could be due to enhanced activity-induced long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in Fmr1 KO neurons (in normal experience) or alternatively a homeostatic upscaling of callosal synaptic strengths in the sensory deprivation condition. Future experiments will investigate these possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Interneuron function is altered in the FMR1 KO (Goel et al., 2018; Gibson et al., 2014). Unless the only (or primary) thing that is impaired in the KO is the strength of the callosal input, it will be hard to attribute the lack of coherence in gamma to this connection at a single timepoint. What if local inhibitory circuits are altered in the KO? Or, callosal inputs to interneurons?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we cannot conclude that reduced interhemispheric gamma coherence in the Fmr1 KO is only due to reduced callosal synaptic strength, especially given the other known changes in Fmr1 KO circuitry. However, based on results from callosal cutting experiments, reduced coherence in gamma and beta would be a predicted if callosal synaptic connectivity was weak. Callosal inputs to inhibitory neurons may also be changed in the Fmr1 KO and this is something we are interested in exploring in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Why look at callosal effects on synchronization in auditory function, when all measurements are done in S1/whisker deprivation?</p><p>5. Gamma coherence was tested at a different age. It is reasonable that the synaptic deficits observed at the single timepoint examined might be rectified at later ages, or they could possibly be exacerbated. These synaptic deficits might be some primary phenotype of FMR1 KO, but the correlated reduction in gamma coherence may be secondary to this; for example, reduced synaptic strength.</p></disp-quote><p>The ISPC EEG data was in hand of our collaborators at UC Riverside and was consistent with our S1 results.

There is no discussion of the molecular mechanisms of FMR1, or how it might differentially influence one type of synapse but not another. In addition, the overall hypothesis that they are testing appears to be that FMR1 suppresses long-range connections but enhances or does not influence local connections. To these ends, it would be useful to look at long-range connections that are not callosal – for example, from M1 or S2. Is there something special about callosal inputs or is it the timing of their maturation, for example?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a brief discussion of potential molecular mechanisms by which FMRP may differentially regulate synaptic inputs (lines 376-383). This could be due to localized expression of dendritic mRNAs within basal or apical dendritic compartments in that are translationally regulated by FMRP to affect either L4 or callosal inputs, respectively. Alternatively, FMRP is known to translationally control some transsynaptic cell adhesion or scaffolding molecules that can recognize presynaptic inputs from a specific origin. We have not examined other long-range input pathways but would predict that these would be similarly weak in the Fmr1 KO. This is based on the reduced fMRI coherence of other long-range ipsilateral pathways (such as). Future experiments will explore these possibilities.</p><p>References:</p><p>Cearley, C.N., and Wolfe, J.H. (2006).
