Other organs in the body achieve this via a system called the lymphatic system. A network of lymphatic vessels extends throughout the body in a pattern similar to that of blood vessels. Waste products from cells, plus bacteria, viruses and excess fluids drain out of the body’s tissues into lymphatic vessels, which transfer them to the bloodstream. Blood vessels then carry the waste products to the kidneys, which filter them out for excretion. Lymphatic vessels are also a highway for circulation of white blood cells, which fight infections, and are therefore an important part of the immune system.</p><p>Unlike other organs, the brain does not contain lymphatic vessels. So how does it remove waste? Some of the brain’s waste products enter the fluid that bathes and protects the brain – the cerebrospinal fluid – before being disposed of via the bloodstream. However, recent studies in rodents have also shown the presence of lymphatic vessels inside the outer membrane surrounding the brain, the dura mater.</p><p>Absinta, Ha et al. now show that the dura mater of people and marmoset monkeys contains lymphatic vessels too. Spotting lymphatic vessels is challenging because they resemble blood vessels, which are much more numerous. In addition, Absinta, Ha et al. found a way to visualize the lymphatic vessels in the dura mater using brain magnetic resonance imaging, and could confirm that lymphatic vessels are present in autopsy tissue using special staining methods.</p><p>For magnetic resonance imaging, monkeys and human volunteers received an injection of a dye-like substance called gadolinium, which travels via the bloodstream to the brain. In the dura mater, gadolinium leaks out of blood vessels and collects inside lymphatic vessels, which show up as bright white areas on brain scans. To confirm that the white areas were lymphatic vessels, the experiment was repeated using a different dye that does not leak out of blood vessels. As expected, the signals observed in the previous brain scans did not appear.</p><p>By visualizing the lymphatic system, this technique makes it possible to study how the brain removes waste products and circulates white blood cells, and to examine whether this process is impaired in aging or disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>marmoset monkey</kwd><kwd>lymphatics</kwd><kwd>MRI</kwd><kwd>meninges</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Absinta</surname><given-names>Martina</given-names></name><name><surname>Ha</surname><given-names>Seung-Kwon</given-names></name><name><surname>Nair</surname><given-names>Govind</given-names></name><name><surname>Sati</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name><name><surname>Luciano</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name><name><surname>Zaghloul</surname><given-names>Kareem A</given-names></name><name><surname>Reich</surname><given-names>Daniel S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Absinta</surname><given-names>Martina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000910</institution-id><institution>Conrad N.

The dural lymphatic vessels display typical immunohistochemical markers that identify lymphatic vessels elsewhere in the body. They provide an alternate conduit for drainage of immune cells and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain, beyond previously described pathways of flow: via arachnoid granulations into the dural venous sinuses, and via the cribriform plate into the ethmoid region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Weller et al., 2009</xref>). Although early reports, based on injections of India ink into the cisterna magna of the rat, suggested that the dural pathway accounts for only a minority of the drainage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kida et al., 1993</xref>), the more recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aspelund et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Louveau et al., 2015b</xref>), which are based on injections of fluorescent tracers and in vivo microscopy, indicate that the dural system may be substantially more important for drainage of macromolecules and immune cells than previously realized.</p><p>Whether a similar network of dural lymphatics is present in primates remains unknown. Moreover, noninvasive visualization of the dural lymphatics – a necessary first step to understanding their normal physiology and potential aberrations in neurological diseases – has not been reported. We therefore verified pathologically the existence of a dural lymphatic network in human and nonhuman primates (common marmoset monkeys) and evaluated two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques that might enable its visualization in vivo. First, the T2-weighted fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) pulse sequence, which is the clinical standard for detecting lesions within the brain parenchyma, is highly sensitive to the presence of gadolinium-based contrast agents in the CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mamourian et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mathews et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Absinta et al., 2015</xref>). Second, ‘black-blood’ imaging sequences, which are typically used for measurement of vascular wall thickness or detection of atherosclerotic plaque, are tuned to darken the contents of blood vessels (even when they contain a gadolinium-based contrast agent), but in the process the images may highlight vessels with other contents and flow properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mandell et al., 2017</xref>). For comparison, we also acquired a postcontrast T1-weighted Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition of Gradient Echoes (MPRAGE) MRI sequence, which is widely implemented for structural brain imaging and depicts avid enhancement of dura mater and blood vessels, but which would not be expected to discriminate lymphatic vessels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Cerebral blood vessels have a highly regulated blood-brain barrier, protecting the neuropil from many contents of the circulating blood. Under physiological conditions, the blood-brain barrier prevents gadolinium-based chelates in standard clinical use from passing into the Virchow-Robin perivascular spaces and parenchyma, so that these structures do not enhance on MRI. On the other hand, dural blood vessels lack a blood-meningeal barrier, enabling leakage of circulating fluids and small substances, including gadolinium-based compounds. This explains the thin, though often incomplete, dural enhancement that is seen on conventional T1-weighted MRI scans under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), as well as its abnormal diffuse or localized thickening in a variety of pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Smirniotopoulos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antony et al., 2015</xref>). Using high-resolution (in-plane resolution 270 × 270 μm or finer) T2-FLAIR and T1-weighted black-blood MRI images, obtained after the intravenous injection of standard FDA-approved contrast material (gadobutrol), we were able to visualize the collection of interstitial gadolinium within dural lymphatic vessels (maximum apparent diameter ~1 mm) in 5/5 human healthy volunteers and 3/3 common marmoset monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our results suggest that in the dura, similar to many other organs throughout the body, small intravascular molecules extravasate into the interstitium and then, under a hydrostatic pressure gradient, collect into lymphatic capillaries through a loose lymphatic endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29738.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MRI-visualization of dural lymphatic vessels in human and nonhuman primates.</title><p>In both species, conventional post-gadobutrol coronal T1-weighted MRI is unable to discriminate lymphatic vessels due to diffuse physiological enhancement of the dura (arrows) and blood vessels, including the superior sagittal sinus and straight sinus (arrows).

Gadofosveset binds reversibly to serum albumin, increasing its molecular weight from 0.9 to 67 kDa. Under physiological conditions, albumin has a low transcapillary exchange rate into the interstitial compartment, estimated to be on the order of 5% per hour, which explains the propensity of gadofosveset to remain within blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Richardson et al., 2015</xref>). In both species, gadofosveset did not reveal dural lymphatics, especially on T1-black blood images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, on T1-weighted MPRAGE images, gadofosveset provided superior intravascular enhancement, in both meningeal and parenchymal blood vessels, compared to gadobutrol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29738.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Gadobutrol vs. gadofosveset in MRI-visualization of dural lymphatic vessels.</title><p>Coronal T1-weighted black-blood images were acquired after intravenous injection of two different gadolinium-based contrast agents (31 min after gadobutrol and 42 min after gadofosveset), during two MRI sessions separated by one week.

A branched network of lymphatics was clearly seen within the dura mater. On D2-40 podoplanin/CD31 double staining, we identified a total of 93 human dural lymphatics; most were collapsed, explaining the large range of maximum transverse diameters (range = 7–842 μm, mean = 125 μm, standard deviation = 161 μm). The density of dural lymphatics was higher around the venous sinuses than in more lateral areas of the dura, and higher within the meningeal layer than the periosteal layer of the dura. As expected, red blood cells were not seen within lymphatics. In marmosets, direct comparison between in vivo MRI and histopathology was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absinta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Guy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luciano et al., 2016</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, the three dural vessels detected on coronal postcontrast T2-FLAIR and on subtraction images colocalize with three clusters of dural cells expressing the full panel of lymphatic endothelial markers (LYVE-1, D2-40 podoplanin, PROX1, COUP-TFII) and CCL21, a chemokine implicated in lymphatic transmigration.</p><p>In the ongoing debate about the precise localization of lymphatics within the meninges (either completely within the dura or ‘shared’ between the dura and the arachnoid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kipnis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raper et al., 2016</xref>), our pathological data clearly show that at least some lymphatics are contained entirely within the dura (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). On limited evaluation, we were unable to visualize lymphatics within the leptomeninges, but additional dedicated studies, ideally with nonconventional tissue-preparation methods, are warranted to fully explore this possibility. A comprehensive map of the meningeal lymphatic network would have implications for unraveling the ways in which the meningeal lymphatics participate in waste clearance and in immune cell trafficking within the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Louveau et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kipnis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raper et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In inflammatory pathological conditions, cellular migration toward the dural lymphatics might be profoundly enhanced by specific signaling and lymphatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alitalo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stacker et al., 2014</xref>). Noteworthy in this context are clusters of extravascular CD3+ lymphocytes and CD68+ phagocytic meningeal macrophages that we observed in the dura of several multiple sclerosis autopsies (not shown), confirming intense immune cell trafficking and communication. Indeed, without proper normative comparison, we cannot rule out that the extensive presence of small lymphatics observed in multiple sclerosis dura samples is the result of inflammation-mediated lymphoangiogenesis. On the other hand, lymphatic dysfunction might impair waste clearance in neurodegenerative diseases and aging, in line with the recently captured deposition of β-amyloid in human dura in elderly people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kovacs et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Differently from experiments implementing injections of tracers within brain structures, here we aimed primarily to image dural lymphatic vessels in human and nonhuman primates, but we could not prove whether dural lymphatic vessels drain immune cells, CSF, or other substances from the brain to deep cervical lymph nodes, nor could we assess any link with the glymphatic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Iliff et al., 2013</xref>). Such an analysis would probably require injection of specific MRI-detectable tracers and acquisition of MRI time-series (not thoroughly explored in the current work), an important future research direction for the nonhuman primate work.</p><p>Overall, our data clearly and consistently demonstrate the existence of lymphatic vessels within the dura mater of human and nonhuman primates. Together with recent studies in rodents, our results show that the meningeal lymphatic system is evolutionarily conserved in mammals and confirm, after exactly two centuries, what the Italian anatomist Paolo Mascagni speculated were lymphatic vessels at the surface of human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mascagni and Bellini, 1816</xref>). The ability to image the meningeal lymphatics noninvasively immediately suggests the possibility of studying potential abnormalities in human neurological disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Approvals</title><p>We carried out human studies under a protocol (<underline>NCT02504840</underline>) approved by NIH Institutional Review Board.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David Van Essen as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This report is a follow-up on the recent publications on the meningeal lymphatic vessels in rodents. They study image human and nonhuman primates using T2-FLAIR and T1-weighted imaging in combination with systemic administration of contrast agents. The analysis shows that the meningeal lymphatic vessels in human and nonhuman primate meninges are very similar to those described in rodents.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In this study, and in the previous work on the glymphatic system, there is little or no mention of the well-known Virchow-Robin perivascular spaces, easily observable using high resolution MRI (e.g. Thomas et al., MRM 2004). Because these features of brain anatomy are well known, having been studied for over a century, and they are also observable with MRI, it is quite surprising that they were not mentioned in the present manuscript. Were they not observed at all? If indeed they comprise a part of the lymphatic circulation, one would expect them to appear with significant contrast in the gadobutrol labelled images. The authors could provide additional visualisation.</p><p>2) Lymphatic flow. One of the criticisms of the 'glymphatic system' concept concerns the shortage of evidence that the lymph has a directional flow within it. A study of the kind described in this manuscript could help to rectify this lack – if a time series of images were obtained, displaying successive enhancement of lymphatic channels in the order predicted by the theory. The authors might want to comment on this possibility.</p><p>3) The MRI imaging is based on the use of two gadolinium-based tracers, one (gadofosveset) which is confined to the blood by binding to serum albumin, and one (gadobutrol) which can exit through blood vessel walls and pass into the lymph vessels. The latter showed accumulation in (putative) lymph vessels in the dura, while the former did not. This is encouraging but there are the following problems:</p><p>a) The putative lymphatics are barely visible, especially in the subtraction images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The authors should increase the intensity and the contrast of the images (taking care to specify what manipulations have been done in the figure legend) – for example, pasting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>'s subtraction images into Powerpoint and increasing both the intensity and contrast by 40% leads to much more easily visible lymphatics. A similar process should be applied to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for the subtraction images, if the authors wish to convince the reader that there are no lymphatics visible with gadofosveset.</p><p>b) The videos show the extent of the lymphatics far more impressively than do the coronal sections in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and 2. Panels should be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> showing sagittal sections or simply a picture of the 3D rendering in the videos. The contrast should also be increased in the videos.</p><p>4) Ultimately the MRI data need validating by immunocytochemistry with lymphatic specific markers, and this is attempted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and 4. Again there are problems:</p><p>a) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is very poorly presented for readers not familiar with the detailed anatomy. I cannot understand what <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows; add some explanatory labels. For panels D-E we need some clue as to exactly where in the brain the tissue is located – show a picture like that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, with rectangles to approximately locate the images presented in D-E. No scale bar size is stated for panels D and E and K.</p><p>b) In humans, Prox 1 or podoplanin (brown) are used as a lymphatic marker and CD31 (blue) as an endothelial marker. Unfortunately the images in panels 3D-E are so faint that colors are not visible (in contrast the immunofluorescence in panels J-K is much clearer). In the magnified panels colors are visible but the background labeling is high. Any dark brown label is attributed to the presence of lymphatics (e.g. there are 5 structures annotated LV in panel F) yet it is unclear how these vessels relate to those seen in the MRI pictures, where there are 3 lymph vessels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Were the IHC and the MRI done on the same brains? If so, is it not possible to state whether the number of lymph vessels found by MRI is the same as is found by IHC? The fact that the IHC finds more vessels (below the resolution of MRI?) at least needs to be discussed. Also, the fact that podoplanin is in cells other than lymph vessels should be mentioned (e.g. kidney podocytes and possibly capillary pericytes, which could confound the interpretation: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25908104).</p><p>c) For the marmoset data, the text states that the number of lymphatics seen with MRI was the same as with IHC, yet the number of lymphatics seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> could be 2 or 3 (enhance the intensity and contrast, and label them with red arrows), while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> It is unclear exactly which brownish structures are being defined as lymphatics – they need explaining better, e.g. by drawing a dashed red line round them.</p><p>d) For both human and marmoset tissue, it is essential to show the (hopefully absent) labeling when the primary antibody for PROX1 or D2-40 is omitted from the IHC. Ideally this should be in brain, but skin would be an acceptable substitute if brain is unfeasible.</p><p>e) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and its associated text is fairly peripheral to the main point of this paper – it might be better in a separate paper combined with more rigorous data showing lymphatic trafficking of immune cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29738.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In this study, and in the previous work on the glymphatic system, there is little or no mention of the well-known Virchow-Robin perivascular spaces, easily observable using high resolution MRI (e.g. Thomas et al., MRM 2004).

We were able to image the meningeal lymphatic vessels because there is no blood-meningeal barrier in the dura mater; hence, gadolinium contrast can quickly extravasate into the connective tissue, from where it collects into the lymphatic vessels. On the other hand, the Virchow-Robin perivascular spaces in the brain parenchyma, which (as the reviewer correctly points out) are commonly seen on conventional clinical MRI scans, are known not to enhance after intravenously injected gadolinium contrast. This is most likely related to the presence of an intact blood-brain barrier which, under physiological conditions, is not permeable to contrast agents. In this context, we note that our approach does not address the recently described “glymphatic” system, which may comprise the Virchow-Robin spaces, the noninvasive imaging of which would require an altogether different approach from what we have presented in this paper. These points have been better clarified in the manuscript (1<sup>st</sup> paragraph of the Results/Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Lymphatic flow.

As mentioned in the reply to point 1, imaging the glymphatic system would require a different approach from the one we have presented. Indeed, even though we collected time series images throughout the first hour after injection of contrast agent (an example of which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we did not observe clear dynamic changes (e.g. flow) in the imaging characteristics of the meningeal vessels. More subtle dynamic changes might have been observed had we done more frequent temporal sampling, however the requirement for extremely high spatial resolution to visualize the meningeal lymphatic vessels made this impossible. We have now included a comment in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The MRI imaging is based on the use of two gadolinium-based tracers, one (gadofosveset) which is confined to the blood by binding to serum albumin, and one (gadobutrol) which can exit through blood vessel walls and pass into the lymph vessels.

The suggested reference has been now added to the manuscript.</p><p>For the humans, the imaging and histopathology have been performed, of necessity, in different people (please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> for human tissue sampling), as described in the Materials and methods section. On the animal side, we studied a total of 5 marmosets for this study: 2 of which were used exclusively for MRI-histopathological correlations (please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), 2 for gabobutrol vs. gadofosvet MRI in vivo experiments, and 1 for both the gabobutrol vs. gadofosvet MRI in vivo experiments and the histopathological characterization.</p><p>The relevant figure and legends have been modified according to the request of the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) For the marmoset data, the text states that the number of lymphatics seen with MRI was the same as with IHC, yet the number of lymphatics seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> could be 2 or 3 (enhance the intensity and contrast, and label them with red arrows), while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> It is unclear exactly which brownish structures are being defined as lymphatics – they need explaining better, e.g. by drawing a dashed red line round them.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion. For the marmoset data, we stated in the text that the 3 areas enhancing on MRI correspond to clusters of cells positive for lymphatic markers (4<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the Results/Discussion section). Unfortunately, it was not always straightforward to recognize the vessel-like structures, likely due to the fragility of the dura mater after preparation and immunohistochemical processing.
