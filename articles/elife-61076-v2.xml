Atlantic and adjacent waters and is one of the most abundant vertebrates on earth. This species is well suited to explore genetic adaptation due to minute genetic differentiation at selectively neutral loci. Here, we report hundreds of loci underlying ecological adaptation to different geographic areas and spawning conditions. Four of these represent megabase inversions confirmed by long read sequencing. The genetic architecture underlying ecological adaptation in herring deviates from expectation under a classical infinitesimal model for complex traits because of large shifts in allele frequencies at hundreds of loci under selection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Atlantic herring</kwd><kwd>genetic adaptation</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>inversion</kwd><kwd>genotype</kwd><kwd>ecology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAW scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Leif</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>VetenskapsrÃ¥det</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior professor</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Leif</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Research Council of Norway</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GENSINC, project 254774</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berg</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name><name><surname>Folkvord</surname><given-names>Arild</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Leif</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008396</institution-id><institution>Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>33113-B-19-154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bekkevold</surname><given-names>Dorte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Fisheries Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>33113-B-19-154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bekkevold</surname><given-names>Dorte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hundreds of loci underlying ecological adaptation to different environmental conditions show striking differences in allele frequencies between ecotypes of Atlantic herring.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atlantic herring (<italic>Clupea harengus</italic>) constitutes the basis for one of the worldâs most important commercial fisheries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Statistics Division, 2013</xref>) and has been a valuable food resource throughout human history in North Europe. It is one of the most abundant vertebrates on earth with a total estimated breeding stock of one trillion individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2017</xref>). Its short-term (&lt;10,000 years) effective population size is enormous whereas the long-term effective population size is much more restricted most likely due to the impact of periods of glaciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinez Barrio et al., 2016</xref>). It is likely that genetic draft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walsh and Lynch, 2018</xref>) thatÂ is purging of neutral genetic variation linked to polymorphisms under positive or negative selection, also contributes to restricting nucleotide diversity in the herring. As a consequence, the nucleotide diversity is moderate (~0.3%)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinez Barrio et al., 2016</xref>), only three-fold higher than in human although the census population size is at least two orders of magnitude higher in herring at present and until recently (&gt;1,000 years ago) many orders of magnitude higher.</p><p>Detailed population genomic studies of Atlantic herring are justified for two reasons. Firstly, a better understanding of the population structure and development of diagnostic markers have the potential to revolutionize the procedures of stock assessments of herring that has been in operation for more than hundred years, which will add key scientific knowledge to safeguard a sustainable fishery. Secondly, the Atlantic herring can be used as a model to study the genetic architecture underlying phenotypic diversity and ecological adaptation. The herring has adapted to different marine environments including the brackish Baltic Sea, where salinity drops to 2â3 PSU and water temperature shows a much larger variation among seasons than in the Atlantic Ocean with typically 34â35 PSU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, herring spawn during different periods of the year, which involves photoperiodic regulation of reproduction. There is minute genetic differentiation at selectively neutral loci among herring populations from different geographic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamichhaney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinez Barrio et al., 2016</xref>) and the distribution of per locus <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values deviates significantly from the one expected for selectively neutral loci with an excessive number of outlier loci demonstrating signatures of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamichhaney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Limborg et al., 2012</xref>). These properties make the Atlantic herring a powerful model to explore how natural selection shapes the genome in a species where genetic drift plays a minor role in genome-wide population divergence.</p><p>Understanding the genetic basis for complex traits and disorders is of central importance in current biology and human medicine. The aim of the present study was to explore the genetic architecture underlying ecological adaptation in herring by a comprehensive analysis of whole-genome sequence data from 53 population samples spread across the entire species distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome sequencing</title><p>We performed pooled whole-genome sequencing using 28 population samples of Atlantic herring. These were analyzed together with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamichhaney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinez Barrio et al., 2016</xref>), making a total number of 53 population samples. The current study has added populations around Ireland and Britain, from Norwegian fjords and from the southern Baltic Sea. Together the 53 population samples cover the entire species distribution and include spring, autumn, winter and summer spawning populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A previously sequenced population of Pacific herring (<italic>Clupea pallasii</italic>) was used as a closely related outgroup in the bioinformatic analysis. We pooled genomic DNA from 35 to 110 individuals per population, and conducted whole-genome resequencing to a minimum of 30Â ÃÂ coverage per population. In order to generate individual genotype data, we sequenced 12 fish from four localities toÂ ~10Â Ã coverage per individual. Together with data from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamichhaney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamichhaney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinez Barrio et al., 2016</xref>), we used a total of 55 individually sequenced herring in the analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). All sequence reads were aligned to the recently released chromosome-level assembly for Atlantic herring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pettersson et al., 2019</xref>), and sequence variants were called and filtered with a stringent pipeline (Methods). In total, we identifiedÂ ~11.5 million polymorphic biallelic sites among the 53 population samples andÂ ~15.9 million sites when including Pacific herring.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Geographic distribution of sampled pools of Atlantic herring.</title><p>Color code of each population refers to the spawning season that a given pool was sampled.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61076-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Variation in sea water temperatures among seasons.</title><p>Seasonal sea water temperature profiles across the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea.

This clustering, in general, fits with their geographical origin, but the branch lengths separating some subpopulations are very short, forÂ example autumn- and spring-spawning populations from the North Atlantic Ocean. Pairwise <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values among all populations are in the range 0.013 to 0.061 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To explore the contribution of strongly differentiated loci to the observed population structure, we separated SNPs showing no significant genetic differentiation between populations from those showing strong genetic differentiation based on their standard deviation of allele frequencies across Atlantic and Baltic populations (Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We carried out Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on these two sets of markers independently. The PCA using 169,394 undifferentiated markers separated some of the major groups but three distinct groups (Atlantic Ocean spring and autumn-spawners, and populations around Ireland and Britain) were merged into one tight cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In fact, the populations within this very tight cluster constituteÂ ~90% of the world population of Atlantic herring (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), all spawning in full marine environment (salinityÂ ~35 PSU). The first two principal components in this analysis explained onlyÂ ~11% of the variance. This is in line with the conclusion that the majority of the genome shows minute genetic differentiation across the entire species distribution of Atlantic herring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuentes-Pardo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamichhaney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamichhaney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinez Barrio et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the PCA based on only 794 markers showing the most striking genetic differentiation separated the populations into the seven main clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), consistent with the genetic distance tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The first principal component explained 43% of the variance. These two patterns observed for the two sets of markers suggest that the observed population structure in herring can be accounted for by a small fraction of genetic markers associated with loci underlying ecological adaptation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Principal component analysis (PCA) of herring populations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) PCA based on 169,934 genetically undifferentiated markers.

Two population samples (#24 and 25) both from Landvikvannet in southern Norway clustered more closely with populations from the transition zone than with local fjord populations from western Norway. Landvikvannet is a unique brackish lake created in 1877 by opening a canal between the ocean and a freshwater lake, now harboring a local population of herring adapted to this brackish environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eggers et al., 2014</xref>). The populations around Ireland and Britain showed a relatively high degree of diversity, despite their geographical proximity. Populations within this cluster do not show such distinct sub-clusters according to spawning season as they do for instance in the Baltic Sea. One of the populations from Schlei (#21), collected as autumn-spawning, clustered with spring-spawning populations. Interestingly, examinations of the otoliths from fish in this sample, using the method by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clausen et al., 2007</xref>, showed that they hatched in spring!

We grouped 10 populations from this region as one superpool, and compared its genome-wide allele frequency with another superpool, which consisted of 4 neighboring populations from the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Following the definition of independent loci (see Methods), we found only 12 independent loci showing significant genetic differentiation in this contrast. Several of these are the loci also detected in the contrast between spring- vs autumn-spawning herring (<italic>TSHR, HERPUD2</italic>, etc.), as expected due to the difference in proportion of autumn-spawners (40% vs. 0%). However, four of the major loci on Chr6, 12, 17, and 23 span exceptionally large regions on four different chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Unlike a typical selective sweep where divergence of the markers forms a bell shape, the zoom-in profile of the significant SNPs at each locus formed a block-like pattern, where a sharp change of divergence was observed at borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4bâe</xref>). The block-like patterns, suggesting suppressed recombination, are consistent with the presence of inversions or other structural rearrangements. The very sharp borders of these regions are expected for inversions maintained as balanced polymorphisms, because recombination over thousands of generations will randomize the association between the inversion haplotypes and flanking markers.

This individual was not informative for the previously documented inversion on Chr12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pettersson et al., 2019</xref>) because it was homozygous for the S haplotype present in the reference assembly. PacBio sequencing provided conclusive evidence for the presence of inversions on Chr6 and 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). On Chr6, the distal breakpoint is at 24,868,581 bp and the proximal breakpoint lies between 22,280,036 bp and 22,290,000 bp. Its exact position is difficult to deduce due to complexity of the region and because the reference assembly is not complete at the proximal breakpoint. A representative PacBio read spanning the proximal breakpoint on Chr6 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> where the read starts within the inversion in the orientation toward the distal breakpoint, continues across the proximal breakpoint, and ends outside the inversion. This pattern is supported by 34 reads. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> illustrates the Chr17 inversion where a PacBio read maps before the proximal breakpoint and continues to the sequence proximal to the distal breakpoint in the reference assembly. There are 36 reads supporting this pattern with 25,805,445 bp as the proximal breakpoint and 27,568,511 bp as the distal breakpoint. The inserted dotplot shows the presence of a 5 kb duplicated sequence in the reference N haplotype, located with an opposite orientation at the two breakpoints. This 5 kb sequence is present as a single copy in the S haplotype of the PacBio individual, implying that the N haplotype is most likely the derived state, and that the inversion and duplication occurred during the same meiotic event. This interpretation is consistent with the higher nucleotide diversity among S haplotypes (0.31% vs. 0.24%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4c</xref>). There is a total of 44 and 66 genes present within the inverted regions of Chr6 and 17, respectively. The inversion breakpoints do not disrupt any coding sequence, but the proximal breakpoint of the Chr6 inversion is located very close to exon 1 of the methyl transferase 3 (<italic>PRMT3</italic>) gene suggesting that the inversion might affect its expression pattern.

Subsequent studies using microsatellites and small number of SNPs largely confirmed this observation but with occasional genetic markers showing genetic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Limborg et al., 2012</xref>). Whole-genome sequencing has completely changed the picture, we now find striking genetic differentiation but at a limited number of loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamichhaney et al., 2017</xref>) revealing a striking difference between the observed distribution of <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values and the one expected under neutrality implies that essentially all loci highlighted as highly differentiated in the present study are due to adaptation. Our data are consistent with a model where the Atlantic herring has a genomic âtool boxâ of a few hundred major loci associated with ecological adaptation to local climate conditions such as water temperature, salinity, light conditions, and preferred spawning time. We propose that this genetic adaptation is related to life history parameters such as migratory behavior, timing of spawning, and ecological conditions during larval development. The Atlantic herring has a high fecundity where a female can release tens of thousands of eggs at spawning. A perfect match between genotype and environmental conditions gives potential for a highly successful reproduction.</p><p>An important practical implication of the current study is that sequence variants associated with ecological adaptation best reveal the population structure of the Atlantic herring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), whereas neutral markers are less useful for population identification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). A PCA analysis based on only about 800 SNPs out of the more than 10 million SNPs detected in the study distinguish all major groups of Atlantic herring and reveal allele frequency differences between subpopulations within major groups. For instance, the Ser346Thr mutation in <italic>AHR</italic> alone can efficiently distinguish the North Atlantic Ocean groups from all other groups of herring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). The current study has established the diagnostic SNP markers that may be used to improve the collation of data for fisheries stock assessment. This is necessary in order to identify and address the mismatches between biological populations and management units or stocks, which can hamper the development and implementation of effective management of this important natural resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cope and Punt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hintzen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The genetic architecture underlying multifactorial traits and disorders has been intensively studied in recent years, in particular based on human genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and the general finding is that most traits are highly polygenic with large number of loci each explaining a tiny fraction of the genetic variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goddard et al., 2016</xref>). This is usually referred to as consistent with a quasi-infinitesimal model, because the data largely conform with the predictions of Fisherâs classical infinitesimal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fisher, 1919</xref>) which constituted the foundation for quantitative genetics theory. A prime example of a trait consistent with the quasi-infinitesimal model is stature in human. A study based onÂ ~700,000 individuals revealed more than 3000 variants affecting this trait but these did not explain more thanÂ ~25% of the variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yengo et al., 2018</xref>), implying that it must be thousands of segregating sites affecting stature in humans. The genetic architecture underlying ecological adaptation in Atlantic herring is strikingly different. It is polygenic but the number of loci showing strong genetic differentiation is in the hundreds and not in the thousands. However, it is possible that we only see the tip of the iceberg and there may be a large number of loci with tiny effects that also affect ecological adaptation. The herring data nevertheless deviates from the expected pattern under a strict infinitesimal model because this theory predicts that a response to natural selection should only cause minor changes in allele frequencies. This is because each individual locus only explains a tiny fraction of the genetic variance and should not result in major shifts in allele frequencies, such as those reported here. Allele frequencies may in fact shift substantially under the infinitesimal model but due to genetic drift, mutation or migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barton et al., 2017</xref>) which cannot explain the pattern we see here as the effect is restricted to a small portion of the genome. An important difference between the genetic architecture underlying variation in human stature and ecological adaptation in herring, is that the signatures of selection in herring reflect evolutionary processes that may have happened over many generations. For instance, the herring has adapted to the brackish Baltic Sea after it was formed about 10,000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">AndrÃ©n et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the human GWAS data reflect standing genetic variation, which includes many slightly deleterious variants, the majority of these will never contribute to a selection response for a fitness trait. This interpretation is supported by the report that negative (or purifying) selection is common for genetic variants associated with human complex traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>) The genetic architecture underlying ecological adaptation in herring is in fact similar to the genetic architecture underlying skin color in humans, a trait affected by strong natural selection, for which four major loci were estimated to explain 35% of the total variance in an admixed population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beleza et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The genetic architecture underlying ecological adaptation detected here makes perfect sense in light of the ecological challenges involved. The most dramatic differences in biotic and abiotic factors occur between the marine Atlantic Ocean and the brackish Baltic Sea which differ in regard to salinity, variation in water temperature over the year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill et al., 2019</xref>), plankton production and presence of predators. In this contrast, we document hundreds of loci showing significant genetic differentiation. In other contrasts between geographically distinct ecoregions, the numbers of detected loci are much fewer, in the range 10â30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).</p><p>It has been exceedingly challenging to move from GWAS peaks to the identification of causal variants in human and other species, despite enormous efforts. The reason is that strong linkage disequilibrium among multiple sequence variants showing an equally strong association with phenotype makes it difficult or impossible to provide genetic evidence for causality. In contrast, the genome-wide screens in Atlantic herring immediately reveal strong suggestive evidence of causality at some loci. A striking example concerns <italic>rhodopsin</italic> (<italic>RHO</italic>), showing strong genetic differentiation between Atlantic and Baltic herring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). A missense mutation in this gene (Phe261Tyr) has a critical role for adaptation to the red-shifted light conditions in the Baltic Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, about one third of all fish adapted to red-shifted light conditions in freshwater and brackish water carry Tyr261 like the Baltic herring, an amazing example of convergent evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill et al., 2019</xref>). The present study revealed at least two additional examples of outstanding candidates for being causal mutations, the non-coding single-base change upstream of <italic>SOX11B</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2b</xref>) and the Ser346Thr missense mutation at <italic>AHR2B2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). These are candidate causal mutations based on far stronger statistical support than any other sequence variant in the corresponding regions. How can genomic regions showing signals of selection in these cases be so narrow? There are three possible explanations, either it is because (i) there is an extremely high rate of recombination in the region, (ii) these are âoldâ polymorphisms that have segregated for such a long time that linkage disequilibrium to flanking markers has eroded leaving the causal variant in splendid isolation, or (iii) the same causal variant has occurred by mutation multiple times on different haplotypes. We can exclude option (i) because neither meiotic recombination or LDhat data indicate an exceptionally high recombination rate in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pettersson et al., 2019</xref>). Although the mutation rate in the Atlantic herring is exceptionally low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2017</xref>), in each generation every nucleotide site in the herring genome is hit by many mutations due to the enormous population size. Thus, herring is not a species where evolution is restricted by lack of genetic variation and therefore has to rely on standing genetic variation. The observation of sequence variants with outstanding strength of associations, implying substantial functional effects, is a deviation from the infinitesimal model.</p><p>A unique observation in this study is the Ser346Thr missense mutation in the <italic>aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2B2</italic> (<italic>AHR2B2</italic>) gene. Thr346 must be the derived allele since all tested Pacific herring were homozygous Ser346. Furthermore, residue 346 is located in the highly conserved PAS-B domain and Ser346 is highly conserved among vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1b</xref>), suggesting a functional significance of Ser346Thr. AHR2B2 belongs to the basic helix-loop-PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors. AHR is cytosolic signal sensor that binds planar aromatic hydrocarbons and is then translocated to the nucleus where it forms a heterodimer with the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) and affect transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tischkau, 2020</xref>). The endogenous ligands of AHR include tryptophan-derived metabolites and dietary indoles, while the most well-known exogenous high-affinity ligand is dioxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulte et al., 2017</xref>). In human medicine, AHR function is of relevance for toxicity response, inflammation, autoimmune disorders, cancer, circadian clock and for sensing bacterial virulence and thereby activate antibacterial responses and control sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tischkau, 2020</xref>). It has recently been reported that a population of killifish has been able to colonize highly polluted waters due to the presence of a deletion knocking out AHR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oziolor et al., 2019</xref>). In herring, the derived Thr346 allele occurs at a high frequency in the least polluted waters in the North Atlantic Ocean, forÂ example around Greenland and Iceland, suggesting that it is unlikely that this adaptation is related to the presence of exogenous metabolites. A serine to threonine change is a conservative amino acid substitution since they are both polar, neutral amino acids with a hydroxyl or methyl side chain, respectively. This suggests that this missense mutation fine-tunes rather than disrupts AHR function. Billions of herring in the North Atlantic Ocean are homozygous for Thr346 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). Genetic adaptation in a poikilotherm organism exposed to a wide range of water temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) must involve mutations affecting protein function in a temperature-dependent manner. Interestingly, residue 346 occurs in the ligand-binding PAS-B domain and Ser346Thr may contribute to cold adaptation by affecting ligand-binding as it dominates in populations exposed to the coldest waters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>The importance of inversions underlying phenotypic variation and ecological adaptation is a hot topic in evolutionary genomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wellenreuther and Bernatchez, 2018</xref>). Inversions suppress recombination facilitating the evolution of âsupergenesâ composed of a cluster of co-adapted alleles. Characterization of inversions using short read sequence data is challenging because inversion breakpoints are often embedded in repeat regions. Here we have successfully used PacBio long reads and generated conclusive evidence for inversions on Chr6 and 17 in herring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and suggestive evidence for a third one on Chr23. Furthermore, the individual used for PacBio sequencing was homozygous for the reference allele at the inversion on Chr12 documented in our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pettersson et al., 2019</xref>). The characteristic features of these four inversion polymorphisms are that (i) the inversion breakpoints do not disrupt coding sequence (conclusive evidence only for Chr6 and 17 so far), (ii) no allele is lethal in the homozygous condition, (iii) the inversions suppress recombination but not completely, as we find evidence for recombinant haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>), and (iv) none of the inversions is of recent origin as indicated by substantial nucleotide diversity within each haplotype group, in the range 0.11â0.31% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). The strong genetic differentiation among populations for each of the four inversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>) implies that these are supergenes important for environmental adaptation. It is tempting to speculate that several of these, if not all, are directly or indirectly related to the water temperature at spawning due to the relatively strong correlation between water temperatures and haplotype frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The higher nucleotide diversity for the Southern haplotype groups at each locus suggests that these may represent the ancestral state and that the derived alleles provided a selective advantage during an expansion of Atlantic herring into colder waters.</p><p>In conclusion, ecological adaptation in the Atlantic herring is associated with large shifts in allele frequencies at loci under selection. The underlying cause is both (i) sequence variants of major importance, like Phe261Tyr in <italic>rhodopsin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill et al., 2019</xref>), and (ii) haplotypes of major importance carrying multiple sequence changes. The most extreme form of the latter is megabase inversions/supergenes such as those reported here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample collection and genome resequencing</title><p>The study is based on sequence data generated in this study as well as those reported in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>).

We summarized the independent loci in each contrast, and intersected individual SNPs, in order to identify replicated signals between the two contrasts of adaptation to salinity and spawning season, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Population genetic analysis of putative structural variants</title><p>Diagnostic markers at the four putative structural variants on Chr6, 12, 17, and 23 were selected for investigating haplotype frequencies across populations in pooled and individual sequencing data. Independent neighbor-joining trees were constructed based on all SNPs from each of the putative structural variants using PLINK v1.90b4.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Purcell et al., 2007</xref>) and neighbor from the PHYLIP package v3.696 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felsenstein, 1995</xref>). We estimated nucleotide diversity of each haplotype at the SVs using vcftools v0.1.16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>PacBio long read sequencing for characterization of inversion breakpoints</title><p>A male Atlantic herring was captured in November 25, 2019 in the Celtic Sea (N51.6, W6.5) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. High molecular weight DNA was extracted from testis using the Circulomics Nanobind Tissue Big DNA Kit (NB-900-701-001). Size selection for molecules over 40 kb using BluePippin (SageScience), and libraries for PacBio sequencing was made using the manufacturerâs protocol. Sequencing was carried out on one PacBio Sequel II 8M SMRT Cell for 15 hr to generate 125 Gb CLR sequence data. Subreads were aligned to the herring reference assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pettersson et al., 2019</xref>) using Minimap2 aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li, 2018</xref>). Only reads with mapping quality greater than 20 were used for further analysis. Average genome coverage was measured using Samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and was found to be 110x. Structural variants were called with Sniffles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sedlazeck et al., 2018</xref>). The alignment was viewed using IGV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>) and Ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nattestad et al., 2016</xref>) for the inversion signal. Mummer was used to build the dotplot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delcher et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Erik Enbody for insightful comments on the manuscript and the WESTHER project, the Irish Marine Institute, Marine Scotland Science, the Northern Ireland Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, H Ojaveer and Thomas GrÃ¶hsler (ThÃ¼nen Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries, Rostock, Germany) for sample collections.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genetic architecture underlying ecological adaptation in Atlantic herring is not consistent with the infinitesimal model&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Title: We suggest changing the title to avoid raising expectations about dismissing an infinitesimal model. For example: The genetic architecture underlying ecological adaptation in Atlantic herring.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports population sampling and a scan for selection in Atlantic herring. The importance of the work derives from the application of genetic results for assessing herring stock, and hence help safeguard sustainable fishing, from better understanding of the genetic changes associated with different marine environments (herring have adapted to brackish sea water) and with the herring's photoperiodic regulation of reproduction. The paper reports analysis of whole genome sequence data from 53 population samples, selected from the entire species distribution, and identifies multiple loci underlying ecological adaptation to different geographic areas and spawning conditions.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) Calibrating the test statistics. The P-values for selection are not well-calibrated. The null hypothesis is that the allele frequencies are identical between subgroups, which is inappropriate because even under neutrality they will vary because of drift and shared ancestry between populations. The selection test needs to be corrected for this population structure. There are a number of approaches that could be used, e.g. post-hoc (e.g. genomic control), or model-based (e.g. a mixed model or including PCs as covariates).</p><p>2) The paper does not make a convincing case that the findings are &quot;in conflict with the infinitesimal model for complex traits&quot;. Overall the arguments presented are over-simplistic and fail to take into account the following:</p><p>i) An important question about adaption is the distribution of selection coefficients across mutations, for example whether adaptation is driven by new beneficial mutations of large effects that are selected to fixation or if adaptation is polygenic (e.g. Prichard et al., 2010, Current Biology). If the latter, then does it matter how âpolyâ polygenic is? In any case, even though the authors report a number of loci with large allele frequency shifts, can they actually reject an adaptation model with some loci with large effect sizes and many others with tiny effect sizes?</p><p>ii) The &quot;pure&quot; infinitesimal model is something of a straw man, since we know that there are a finite number of causal variants, with substantial variation in effect size and that we expect the change in allele frequency of any variant to depend on effect size. Instead, the results from the herring analyses seem consistent with the observations made in many systems (e.g body size in dogs or skin pigmentation in humans) that strong selection can lead to rapid differentiation driven by large-effect variants, even if the within-population architecture remains relatively infinitesimal.</p><p>iii) There is a distinction between the within-population variance (which may still be infinitesimal), and the between-population variation, which may be driven by a small number of large-effect and highly differentiated variants. Imagine you had two populations with exactly the same infinitesimal genetic architecture, but that differed by a single fixed variant with large effect. Would you say that was &quot;in conflict&quot; with the infinitesimal model?</p><p>3) It's possible that most, if not all, of the observed differentiation is due to adaptation. If Ne is very large, then natural selection and adaptation are efficient in eliminating deleterious alleles and fixing beneficial alleles. Do the authors have a model that is consistent with the observed presumed âneutralâ variation? For example, the pairwise Fst values (0.01 to 0.06) are not small â are they consistent with the âlong-term effective population sizeâ that the authors hypothesise to be determined by periods of glaciation? Also, if short-term Ne is huge then why are the alleles under selection not swept to fixation? For a very large number of breeding individuals, Ne may be more limited by linkage than by demographic factors, a phenomenon that has been termed âgenetic draftâ (Walsh and Lynch, 2018, page 76).</p><p>4) The authors' interpretation of the PCA results is open to question. The authors first estimate frequency differentiation on all polymorphisms, then select the least and most differentiated loci and perform PCA plots on the ascertained sets of loci (Figure 2). The authors contrast the variance explained by the first PCs and the resulting structure from the two sets of loci and claim that the set of highly differentiated loci reflect ecological niche adaptation, whereas the less differentiated loci reflect location. While it's reasonable to identify the highly differentiated variants as Ancestry Informative Markers, the comparison of the variance explained likely does not mean that much. In any dataset, if you select highly differentiated variables, you will explain more of the variance with the first PC just by construction. For almost any genomic dataset, you would be able to select a small number of SNPs such that you could cluster populations based on PCA of those SNPs, but it does not necessarily follow that those highly differentiated SNPs are actually under selection â that needs to be shown. A related question is whether the extra clusters that appear with the differentiated markers are actually visible in the higher PC of the undifferentiated markers. It would be helpful to show maybe PC 3,4 etcâ¦ for those data.</p><p>5) The block-like structures in the selection scan are interpreted as inversions or structural rearrangements that are under selection. Inversions suppress recombination in the inversion, but not in the flanking regions, so if the inversion were under selection, you expect to see the normal decay of signal around the fringes of the inversion. Or is it just that the scale is different so you can't see the decay on the plots? Is it possible that the high differentiation in these regions is due to mapping errors in the rearranged regions? For example, a duplication would lead to apparently highly differentiated allele frequencies.</p><p>6) A related concern to the first point is whether there are technical batch effects due to i) combination of data sequenced in different experiments (i.e. previously published) and ii) combination of pooled and individual sequencing data. It would be helpful to make sure that these do not further inflate the test statistics.</p><p>7) Pooling errors. The authors use pools for sequencing and use a Neff allele count correction for read depth to minimise technical bias. They then use the estimated allele count in 2x2 tables to contrast allele frequencies between (super) pools, using an arbitrary p-value threshold of 1e-10. Not observing the actual allele count in the sample can lead to an increased variance and therefore a biased test for association.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) P-value calibration. The selection scan uses an inappropriate null distribution and therefore all the P-values are poorly calibrated and thus uninterpretable. Whichever approach is chosen to calibrate P-values, please assess its performance and include QQ plots in the paper. Without this it's impossible to know how many of the selection hits are actually significant.</p><p>2) Either remove the claim that the results are in conflict with the infinitesimal model ( our recommendation) or provide a more convincing case to support the claim.</p><p>3) Please explain the extent to which the observed differentiation could be due to adaptation, dealing with the points we raised in point 3.</p><p>4) Please respond to our criticism of your interpretation of the PCA results.</p><p>5) Please defend your interpretation of the block-like structures in the selection scan, in response to our point 5.</p><p>6) Include batch in the model and check that none of the PCs are predicting batch or data type. Make sure that these do not further inflate the test statistics.</p><p>7) Provide data on how pooling errors might have affected your results. Please show Q-Q plots for their statistical test and estimate the sensitivity of your conclusions with respect to the chosen P-value threshold.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61076.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Title: We suggest changing the title to avoid raising expectations about dismissing an infinitesimal model.

We have now added citation to one paper supporting the view that many variants affecting complex trait in humans are affected by negative selection. Such variants contribute to standing genetic variation for complex traits but is unlikely to contribute to ecological adaptation. We also cite a paper on human skin pigmentation, a trait under selection and for which the underlying genetic architecture is similar to one for ecological adaptation in herring.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) There is a distinction between the within-population variance (which may still be infinitesimal), and the between-population variation, which may be driven by a small number of large-effect and highly differentiated variants.

Would you say that was &quot;in conflict&quot; with the infinitesimal model?</p></disp-quote><p>In conclusion, we think we are essentially in agreement with the reviewers and editors concerning the interpretation of the genetic architecture underlying standing variation for complex traits versus ecological adaptation due to an evolutionary process. We still think it is important to highlight the difference between the two since you often come across papers where the authors assume that the genetic architecture underlying adaptation is expected to be highly complex with reference to human GWAS data. Furthermore, if there is one species where one could expect a good agreement with an infinitesimal model also for ecological adaptation, it should be the Atlantic herring. The census population size the last 10,000 years after the last glaciation has probably been of the order of 10e12, as it is now, which means that each site in the genome is mutated thousands of times each generation. Furthermore, if there are thousands of genes affecting body size in humans and body size is only one of many traits that show phenotypic differences between Atlantic and Baltic herring there was a possibility that genetic differentiation between these two populations would appear as small shifts in allele frequencies at a huge number of sites where causal alleles forms extreme haplotype diversity, but that is not at all the case and we think it is worthwhile to highlight this finding but we acknowledge the criticism and has softened the language.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It's possible that most, if not all, of the observed differentiation is due to adaptation.

We have added a sentence pointing out that with reference to Bruce and Walsh. We have addressed the question whether most, if not all, differentiation is caused by adaptation in a previous study where we were compare the observed distribution of Fst values with the one expected under neutrality established by simulation (Lamichanney et al., 2017). The conclusion is that essentially all loci showing strong genetic differentiation are due to adaptation. There is certainly a grey zone of loci showing modest genetic differentiation whether this is due to drift or selection, but we feel confident that the 100+ loci highlighted in the present study as highly differentiated are under selection. We have cited this previous study in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors' interpretation of the PCA results is open to question.

Our writing is based on our previous analysis showing that the distribution of Fst values in Atlantic herring are strikingly different from the one expected under neutrality (cited in the Introduction, Lamichanney et al., 2017). However, to avoid any misunderstanding of this we have modified the title of this subsection to âDetection of population structureâ and ends with the conclusion that a modest number of strongly differentiated markers provides a much better resolution of population structure than a large number of neutral genetic markers. This is in fact an important conclusion for future monitoring of stock development. In fact, the tight cluster of populations named as Atlantic Ocean in Figure 2A contains the most numerous stocks of Atlantic herring (about 90% of the world population) and these are separated into three distinct clusters when we use strongly genetically differentiated markers: spring-spawning herring from Atlantic Ocean, autumn-spawning populations from the Atlantic Ocean and populations from the water around Ireland and Britain. We highlight this observation in the revised text.</p><p>PC:s 3 and 4 do not resolve any further groupings, in our view they mostly represent technical noise (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>; sample numbers are as in Figure 2).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61076-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The block-like structures in the selection scan are interpreted as inversions or structural rearrangements that are under selection.

The reason is that these are not recent selective sweeps but polymorphisms maintained over long periods of time which allow recombination to randomize the association between the inversion haplotypes and flanking SNPs. We have added text to explain this and cite our previous paper on a 4 MYR old inversion underlying alternative male mating strategies in the ruff that shows exactly the same pattern (Lamichhaney et al., 2016). We can exclude the possibility of a biased estimate of genetic divergence due to presence of duplications within the inverted regions based on normal sequence coverage and based on our PacBio data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A related concern to the first point is whether there are technical batch effects due to i) combination of data sequenced in different experiments (i.e. previously published) and ii) combination of pooled and individual sequencing data.
