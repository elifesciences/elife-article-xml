The Lis1 protein is conserved from fungi to mammals and is a key regulator of cytoplasmic dynein-1, the major minus-end-directed microtubule motor in many eukaryotes. Lis1 is the only dynein regulator known to bind directly to dynein’s motor domain, and by doing so alters dynein’s mechanochemistry. Lis1 is required for the formation of fully active dynein complexes, which also contain essential cofactors: dynactin and an activating adaptor. Here, we report the first high-resolution structure of the yeast dynein–Lis1 complex. Our 3.1 Å structure reveals, in molecular detail, the major contacts between dynein and Lis1 and between Lis1’s ß-propellers. Structure-guided mutations in Lis1 and dynein show that these contacts are required for Lis1’s ability to form fully active human dynein complexes and to regulate yeast dynein’s mechanochemistry and in vivo function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>Lis1</kwd><kwd>BicD2</kwd><kwd>dynactin</kwd><kwd>hook3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reck-Peterson</surname><given-names>Samara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM141825</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reck-Peterson</surname><given-names>Samara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM107214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leschziner</surname><given-names>Andres E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2370-19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reimer</surname><given-names>Janice M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillies</surname><given-names>John P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karasmanis</surname><given-names>Eva P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A 3.1 Å structure of cytoplasmic dynein-1 in complex with its regulator Lis1 reveals the interfaces between dynein and Lis1, all of which are important for dynein function in vitro and in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) is a minus-end-directed microtubule motor that is conserved in many eukaryotes. Mutations in dynein or its regulators cause a range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lipka et al., 2013</xref>). In metazoans and some fungi, dynein transports organelles, RNAs, and protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>). Dynein also positions nuclei and centrosomes and has a role in organizing the mitotic spindle and in the spindle assembly checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raaijmakers and Medema, 2014</xref>). Given the essential nature of dynein in many organisms, the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has been an important model system for studying dynein’s mechanism and function as dynein and its regulators are conserved, but nonessential in this organism. In yeast, deletion of dynein or dynein’s regulators results in defects in positioning the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eshel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kormanec et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muhua et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Both dynein and its regulation are complex. Cytoplasmic dynein is a dimer of two motor-containing AAA+ (<bold>A</bold>TPase <bold>a</bold>ssociated with various cellular <bold>a</bold>ctivities) subunits, with additional subunits all present in two copies. In the absence of regulatory factors, dynein exists largely in an autoinhibited ‘Phi’ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torisawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Active moving dynein complexes contain the dynactin complex and a coiled-coil-containing activating adaptor. We will refer to these complexes here as ‘active dynein’ or ‘dynein–dynactin–activating adaptor complexes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trokter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Some of these activated dynein complexes contain two dynein dimers, and they move at a faster velocity than complexes containing a single dynein dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elshenawy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grotjahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>).

Genetically, Lis1 is a positive regulator of dynein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geiser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xiang et al., 1995</xref>) and is required for most, if not all, dynein functions in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Markus et al., 2020</xref>). In humans, mutations in both Lis1 (<italic>PAFAH1B1;</italic> hereafter called Lis1) and the dynein heavy chain (<italic>DYNC1H1</italic>) cause the neurodevelopmental disease lissencephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parrini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reiner et al., 1993</xref>). Structurally, Lis1 is a dimer of two ß-propellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tarricone et al., 2004</xref>), and Lis1 dimerization is required for its function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn and Morris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Lis1 is also the only known dynein regulator that binds directly to dynein’s motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toropova et al., 2014</xref>). Structures of yeast dynein–Lis1 complexes, while not of high enough resolution to build molecular models, show that Lis1 binds to dynein at two sites: dynein’s AAA+ ring at AAA3/AAA4 (site<sub>ring</sub>) and dynein’s stalk (site<sub>stalk</sub>), which emerges from AAA4 and leads to dynein’s microtubule binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toropova et al., 2014</xref>). Lis1 binding to dynein at these two sites is conserved in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>How does Lis1 act as a positive regulator of dynein motility at a mechanistic level? Recently, Lis1 was shown to play a role in forming active dynein complexes, most likely by disrupting dynein’s autoinhibited Phi conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elshenawy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>). Human dynein–dynactin–activating adaptor complexes formed in the presence of Lis1 are more likely to contain two dynein dimers and move at a faster velocity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elshenawy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with a previous study showing that Lis1 increases both the frequency and velocity of motile dynein–dynactin–BICD2 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumbach et al., 2017</xref>). Studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and the filamentous fungus <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> suggest that this role for Lis1 in forming active complexes is conserved and required for in vivo function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Prior to this series of discoveries, we and others had described other effects that Lis1 has on dynein’s mechanochemistry in vitro. It is likely that these in vitro readouts provide mechanistic insights into different intermediates during dynein activation by Lis1. One common theme in these studies was that the presence of Lis1 causes dynein to bind microtubules more tightly under some nucleotide conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>), which in the context of a moving molecule correlates with decreased velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>) or an increased ability of dynein to remain bound to microtubules under load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>). In yeast, the nucleotide state of dynein’s AAA3 domain seems to regulate this as Lis1 (called Pac1 in yeast, referred to as ‘Lis1’ here) induces a weak microtubule binding state in dynein when the nucleotide bound at AAA3 is ATP or an ATP mimic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>). These different modes of dynein regulation by yeast Lis1 correlate with the number of Lis1 ß-propellers observed interacting with dynein by cryo-EM, with a single ß-propeller bound to dynein at site<sub>ring</sub> in the absence of nucleotide at AAA3, and two ß-propellers bound to dynein at site<sub>ring</sub> and site<sub>stalk</sub> when the nucleotide at AAA3 is ATP or an ATP mimic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>). Genetically, mutations that link nucleotide hydrolysis at AAA3 to Lis1 have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qiu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Willins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhuang et al., 2007</xref>). While it remains to be determined how the readouts described above or other in vitro readouts of Lis1 regulation of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumbach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gutierrez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) relate to Lis1’s in vivo function, they serve as powerful tools to test structure/ function predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toropova et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite this progress, a full understanding of how Lis1 regulates dynein has been hampered by the lack of high-resolution structures of dynein–Lis1 complexes. Here, we report a 3.1 Å structure of yeast dynein bound to two Lis1 ß-propellers. This is the first high-resolution structure of the dynein–Lis1 complex and reveals in molecular detail the contacts between yeast dynein and Lis1 at both site<sub>ring</sub> and site<sub>stalk</sub> and the interface between two Lis1 ß-propellers. We use this structure to interrogate the dynein–Lis1 interaction both in vitro and in vivo, showing that these contacts are important for yeast Lis1’s role in nuclear positioning in vivo. Finally, we show that mutating site<sub>ring</sub> and site<sub>stalk</sub> in human dynein impacts Lis1’s ability to promote the formation of activated human dynein complexes, demonstrating that the Lis1 binding sites on dynein that are required for in vivo function in yeast are the same sites that are important for human dynein–dynactin–activating adaptor complex formation.

Although those structures allowed us to dock homology models of Lis1 into the map and determine their general orientation, their limited resolutions prevented us from building molecular models into the density or rotationally aligning Lis1’s ß-propellers. To address these limitations and to understand the molecular features of the interactions between dynein and Lis1, we aimed to improve the overall resolution of this complex. To enrich our sample for complexes containing two Lis1 ß-propellers bound to dynein, we used a construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) of the yeast dynein motor domain containing a Walker B mutation in AAA3 (E2488Q; herein referred to as dynein<sup>E2488Q</sup>) that prevents the hydrolysis of ATP as our previous work showed that this state results in Lis1 binding at both site<sub>ring</sub> and site<sub>stalk</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>). As with our previous structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toropova et al., 2014</xref>), we used monomers of the yeast dynein motor domain and yeast Lis1 dimers, referred to as dynein<sup>E2488Q</sup>–(Lis1)<sub>2</sub> here. We also added ATP and vanadate to our samples as this is converted to ADP-vanadate, referred to here as ADP-V<sub>i</sub>, which mimics a post-hydrolysis state for dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>). Our initial attempts at obtaining a higher resolution structure were limited by dynein’s strong preferred orientation in open-hole cryo-EM grids. To overcome this, we randomly and sparsely biotinylated dynein and applied the sample to streptavidin affinity grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lahiri et al., 2019</xref>); this tethering results in randomly oriented complexes that are prevented from reaching and interacting with the air–water interface.</p><p>This approach allowed us to determine the structure of yeast dynein<sup>E2448Q</sup> bound to wild-type yeast Lis1 in the presence of ATP vanadate to a nominal resolution of 3.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In our structure, dynein<sup>E2488Q</sup>’s AAA ring is ‘closed,’ which is seen when dynein’s microtubule binding domain is in its low-affinity state, the linker is bent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhabha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>), and when two Lis1 ß-propellers interact with dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>). It is likely that the two ß-propellers come from the same homodimer as we did not detect density for additional ß-propellers during data processing. This new high-resolution map allowed us to build an atomic model of the entire yeast dynein<sup>E2488Q</sup>–(Lis1)<sub>2</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Lis1 binds to dynein at site<sub>stalk</sub> using its side and makes interactions with coiled-coil 1 (CC1) of dynein’s stalk, as well as a previously unknown contact with a loop in AAA4 (residues 2935–2942) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A, B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

While the AAA ring domain of dynein reached the highest resolution in our structure, the linker and stalk helices are at significantly lower resolutions, most likely due to conformational heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We used 3D variability analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Punjani and Fleet, 2021</xref>) in cryoSPARC to generate variability components that capture continuous movements within the complex; the first two components describe the major movements.

Here, we set out to determine if the additional contact we observed at site<sub>ring</sub> involving AAA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) also contributes to dynein regulation by Lis1. To disrupt this electrostatic interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we either mutated Lis1’s Glu253 and His254 to Ala or deleted dynein’s Asn3475 and Arg3476, which are both present in a short loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We began by measuring the apparent binding affinity between a Lis1 dimer and a monomeric dynein motor domain. For these experiments, purified SNAP-tagged yeast Lis1 was covalently coupled to magnetic beads, mixed with purified yeast dynein motor domains in the presence of ADP, and the percentage of dynein bound to the beads was quantified. We found that mutations at the Lis1–AAA5 interface, either on Lis1 (Lis1<sup>E253A, H254A</sup>) or on dynein (dynein<sup>ΔN3475, ΔR3476</sup>), led to an ~1.75-fold decrease in the affinity of Lis1 for dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Next, we looked at Lis1’s effect on dynein’s interaction with microtubules. Previously, we showed that tight microtubule binding by dynein in the presence of ATP is mediated by site<sub>ring</sub>, whereas Lis1-induced weak microtubule binding in the presence of ATP-V<sub>i</sub> requires both site<sub>ring</sub> and site<sub>stalk</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>). For these experiments, we used purified yeast Lis1 dimers and truncated and GST-dimerized yeast dynein motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). These GST-dynein dimers have been well characterized and behave similarly to full-length yeast dynein in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gennerich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). As expected for a mutation that would disrupt Lis1’s interaction at site<sub>ring</sub>, we found that Lis1<sup>E253A, H254A</sup> decreased Lis1’s ability to enhance the binding of dynein to microtubules in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, Lis1<sup>E253A, H254A</sup> did not affect Lis1’s ability to lower dynein’s affinity for microtubules in the presence of ATP-V<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we measured the effect of disrupting the Lis1–AAA5 interaction on the velocity of dynein using a single-molecule motility assay. Unlike mammalian dynein, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> dynein moves processively in vitro in the absence of any other dynein subunits or cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). We previously showed that addition of Lis1 to in vitro motility assays slows yeast dynein in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we found that in the absence of Lis1, dynein<sup>ΔN3475, ΔR3476</sup> had a similar velocity to wild-type dynein, indicating that the mutation does not affect the motile properties of the motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In contrast, Lis1 was less effective at slowing the velocity of dynein<sup>ΔN3475, ΔR3476</sup> compared to wild-type dynein. We observed a similar effect with Lis1<sup>E253A, H254A</sup>, which targets the same site<sub>ring</sub> interface, but from the Lis1 side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

To understand what other roles Lis1 may have in vivo, we made a Phi-disrupting dynein mutant (dynein<sup>D2868K</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marzo et al., 2020</xref>) in the endogenous copy of yeast dynein and compared its phenotype to wild-type cells, cells bearing a Lis1<sup>E253A, H254A</sup> mutation (which disrupts Lis1 binding at site<sub>ring</sub>), and cells with both the dynein<sup>D2868K</sup> and Lis1<sup>E253A, H254A</sup> mutations. We chose to perform this analysis with the site<sub>ring</sub> Lis1 mutation because this site regulates tight microtubule binding in vitro. First, we examined the in vivo phenotype of these strains by performing nuclear segregation assays. As reported above, Lis1<sup>E253A, H254A</sup> increases the percentage of binucleate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). However, introducing the dynein Phi-disrupting mutation (dynein<sup>D2868K</sup>) into this background rescues the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Does Lis1 have any additional roles in regulating yeast dynein in vivo beyond relieving its autoinhibited state? To address this, we examined dynein’s localization in live yeast cells bearing the dynein<sup>D2868K</sup> or Lis1<sup>E253A, H254A</sup> mutations, or both, and quantified the number of dynein cortical foci per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marzo et al., 2020</xref>), we found that the Phi-disrupting dynein mutation, dynein<sup>D2868K</sup>, results in a significant increase in dynein foci at the cell cortex. In contrast, when dynein<sup>D2868K</sup> was combined with Lis1<sup>E253A, H254A</sup> we found that the number of dynein cortical foci per cell was decreased relative to dynein<sup>D2868K</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). This suggests that binding of Lis1 to dynein at site<sub>ring</sub> has an additional role in regulating dynein that is downstream of relieving dynein autoinhibition.

Here, we report the first high-resolution structure of yeast cytoplasmic dynein-1<sup>E2488Q</sup> bound to Lis1, which allowed us to build an atomic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The structure revealed the details of the interactions between the Lis1 ß-propellers and its two binding sites on dynein, as well as how the two ß-propellers interact with each other. Our earlier work had identified the main binding sites on yeast dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>), but not their molecular details or their counterparts on Lis1. Our previous work with wild-type human dynein and Lis1 showed that Lis1 binds to dynein at similar sites in both systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>). The much higher resolution of our current structure also revealed additional contacts between Lis1 and dynein that were not apparent in previous cryo-EM maps; these involve interactions at site<sub>ring</sub> between Lis1 and a loop in dynein’s AAA5 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and at site<sub>stalk</sub> between Lis1 and a loop in dynein’s AAA4 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Finally, being able to visualize the interface between the two Lis1 ß-propellers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) allowed us to test its role in the regulation of dynein by Lis1. Critical to achieving high resolution was the use of specialized streptavidin affinity grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lahiri et al., 2019</xref>), which helped overcome the preferred orientation of the sample, a major resolution-limiting factor in cryo-EM.</p><p>We used our new structure to guide mutagenesis of both yeast and human proteins to determine if the new contact sites we identified were important for dynein regulation by Lis1 in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of these sites at the endogenous alleles of yeast dynein and Lis1 revealed that they are all important for dynein and Lis1’s in vivo function in mitotic spindle positioning, which ultimately leads to nuclear segregation following mitosis. We also found that Lis1 binding to dynein at site<sub>ring</sub> and site<sub>stalk</sub>, and the Lis1–Lis1 interface were required for dynein to reach the cell cortex, the site where active yeast dynein–dynactin complexes interact with the candidate activating adaptor, Num1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heil-Chapdelaine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lammers and Markus, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for Lis1 regulation of yeast dynein.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of dynein regulation by Lis1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, dynein arrives at microtubule plus ends either via transport by kinesin in a complex that contains Lis1 or by recruitment from the cytoplasm. Dynein that is recruited from the cytoplasm is most likely in a Phi conformation. Lis1 binding to dynein, either in the kinesin transport complex or at microtubule plus ends, would favor an open conformation of dynein. (<bold>B</bold>) Our mutant analysis suggests that Lis1 has an additional role in dynein regulation after it disrupts Phi autoinhibition by binding to dynein at site<sub>ring</sub>. Ultimately, dynein interacts with the candidate activating adaptor, Num1, on the cortex and Lis1 is released. We have opted to draw only a single dynein dimer in this complex as it is not known if these complexes contain one or two dynein dimers in yeast.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71229-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our work also shows that the interaction of dynein and Lis1 at both site<sub>ring</sub> and site<sub>stalk</sub> is important for the formation of active human dynein–dynactin–activating adaptor complexes containing either the Hook3 or BicD2-activating adaptors. Previously, we and others found that Lis1 was also important for the formation of activated dynein complexes containing the activating adaptors Ninl and BicDL1 (also called BicDR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elshenawy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>). More recent work by us and others showed that the activating adaptors TRAK2 and Hook2 are almost completely reliant on Lis1 for complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenton et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is likely that this role for Lis1 in complex assembly, and Lis1 binding to dynein at site<sub>ring</sub> and site<sub>stalk</sub>, will be required for dynein complex formation driven by other activating adaptors. The importance of site<sub>ring</sub> and site<sub>stalk</sub> in both human and yeast dynein activation supports a conserved mode of Lis1 regulation of dynein.</p><p>How does Lis1 promote dynein–dynactin–activating adaptor complex assembly? Our structure of a dynein<sup>E2488Q</sup>–(Lis1)<sub>2</sub> complex shows that binding of Lis1 to dynein at site<sub>ring</sub> is sterically incompatible with formation of the autoinhibited Phi conformation of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Based on our lower resolution structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>), we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canty and Yildiz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elshenawy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Markus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xiang and Qiu, 2020</xref>) had proposed that Lis1 binding to dynein at site<sub>ring</sub> may shift the equilibrium from the Phi to an open conformation of dynein, ultimately allowing dynein complexes to assemble with dynactin and an activating adaptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In yeast, dynein can be recruited to microtubule plus ends either via transport by a kinesin, Kip2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carvalho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caudron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Markus et al., 2009</xref>), or by recruitment from the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caudron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Markus et al., 2009</xref>). We propose that cytosolic dynein is in a Phi conformation, while dynein in the kinesin transport complex or at microtubule plus ends is no longer in its autoinhibited state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The kinesin transport complex contains Lis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>), and Lis1 is also required for dynein’s plus end localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Does Lis1 play additional roles in dynein complex assembly beyond disrupting dynein’s autoinhibited conformation? In our nuclear segregation assays, Phi disrupting mutants in yeast dynein completely rescued the nuclear segregation defects seen with a site<sub>ring</sub> Lis1 mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, in more sensitive in vivo assays in both <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and yeast, Phi disrupting dynein mutants did not completely rescue Lis1 mutations or deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, we showed previously that the presence of Lis1 increased the percentage of dynein–dynactin–activating adaptor complexes that contained two dynein dimers using human proteins in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>). Using a Phi-disrupting dynein mutant in these assays with human proteins decreased, but did not completely abolish the requirement for Lis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these experiments suggest that Lis1 may have additional roles in dynein complex assembly beyond disrupting dynein’s autoinhibited Phi conformation. In support of this, we showed here that a Phi-disrupting mutation in dynein was less efficient in reaching the cell cortex (where dynein is active) when Lis1 mutated at site<sub>ring</sub> was present in the same genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that the contact between dynein and Lis1 at site<sub>ring</sub> has an additional role in regulating dynein downstream of autoinhibition relief (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This additional role of Lis1 could be promoting further conformational changes in dynein. Our data suggest that there could be a role for Lis1’s modulation of dynein’s microtubule binding affinity in this process as mutations at site<sub>ring</sub> (which normally promotes tight microtubule binding) lead to less Phi-disrupted dynein reaching the cortex. While dynein’s microtubule binding domain is not required to reach the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lammers and Markus, 2015</xref>), our data suggest some role for microtubule binding in this process. Assembling active dynein–dynactin–activating adaptor complexes likely involves multiple steps, and the many in vitro phenotypes described for Lis1’s regulation of dynein, such as the nucleotide-specific affects at AAA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSantis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qiu et al., 2021</xref>), may be providing mechanistic hints about these steps. This will be an important area to investigate in the future.</p><p>Overall, this work and that of others suggests that the field is coalescing around a unified model for dynein regulation of Lis1 across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canty and Yildiz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elshenawy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Markus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xiang and Qiu, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strain construction</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Grids were vitrified using a Vitrobot (FEI) set to 20°C and 100% humidity. Vitrobot tweezers were kept cold on ice between samples. The sample was first manually wicked inside the Vitrobot using a Whatman No. 1 filter paper, followed by the addition of 1.5 μL of sample buffer before standard blotting and vitrification proceeded (blot time: 4 s; blot force: 20).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image collection and processing</title><p>Vitrified grids were imaged on a Titan Krios (FEI) operated at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV, and the images were recorded with a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan Inc). We collected 2378 movies in super-resolution mode (0.655 Å/super-resolution pixel at the object level) dose-fractionated into 200 ms frames for a total exposure of 10 s with a dose rate of 10 electrons/pixel/s for a total fluence of 58.3 electrons/Å<sup>2</sup>. The defocus of the images varied within a range of –2.0 μm to –2.7 μm. Automated data collection was executed by SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Video frames were aligned using the dose-weighted frame alignment option in UCSF MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) as employed in Relion 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). At this stage, the individual frames were corrected for the anisotropic magnification distortion inherent to the electron microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). The signal from the streptavidin lattice was removed from aligned micrographs using Fourier filtering as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2012</xref>). Micrographs were manually inspected for defects including suboptimal ice thickness and incomplete removal of the SA lattice signal, and 46 micrographs were removed leaving 2332 micrographs for further processing. CTF estimation was carried out on the non-dose-weighted micrographs using GCTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang, 2016</xref>) using the local CTF estimation option as implemented in Appion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lander et al., 2009</xref>). Images with CTF fits having 0.5 confidence resolution worse than 5 Å were excluded from further processing. Particles were picked using crYOLO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wagner et al., 2019</xref>) using a training model generated from manually picked particles. The particles were extracted with a downsampled pixel size of 3.93 Å/pixel, and a single round of two-dimensional (2D) classification was carried out in Relion 3.0 to identify bad particles. Particles belonging to good 2D class averages were recentered and extracted (1.31 Å/pixel), and further processed in cryoSPARC. Ab initio models were generated with the majority of particles going into one good class displaying the characteristic features of the dynein motor domain and the WD40 rings of Lis1. Those particles were refined using the non-uniform refinement routine of cryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Punjani et al., 2020</xref>), against the best ab initio model. This resulted in a 3.2 Å map containing 233,476 particles. We performed per-particle CTF refinement and beam tilt refinement in Relion 3.0 followed by a single round of three-dimensional (3D) classification without alignment. The particles contributing to one of the classes lead to a high-resolution reconstruction of the dynein–Lis1 complex, and those particles were further refined in Relion 3.0 to generate the final 3.1 Å map (based on the 0.143 cutoff of the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation [FSC] curve) of the dynein<sup>E2488Q</sup>-Lis1 complex. For visualization purposes, the map was sharpened with an automatically estimated negative B-factor of 33 (as determined from the ‘PostProcess’ routine of Relion 3.0). The local resolution of the map was estimated using the ‘local resolution’ routine of Relion 3.0, and the map was low-pass filtered according to the local resolution prior to analysis. The 3-D FSC was calculated by 3dfsc version 2.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan et al., 2017</xref>) using the half-maps and the mask used for the PostProcess routine in Relion 3.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Model building</title><p>The yeast dynein<sup>E2488Q</sup>-Lis1 map was segmented using Seggar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pintilie et al., 2010</xref>) as implemented in UCSF chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>), and the atomic models of the different components were initially built to account for their respective segmented maps.

This high-resolution structure allows the authors to reveal new details of interaction interfaces, specifically the LIS1-binding site on AAA5, the LIS1-binding site on the stalk as well as the contact site between the two LIS1 propellers (one binds the ring and the other binds stalk). The authors made specific mutations (in LIS1 or dynein) to investigate the significance of these interactions. The functional study was done by using both in vitro (binding curve and effect on in vitro velocity) and in vivo assays (nuclear positioning and dynein localization in yeast). Finally, they also made mutations in human dynein that affect LIS1 binding to the same sites (ring and stalk) and investigated the functional significance of the involved amino acids in cargo-adapter- and dynactin-mediated dynein activation/motility assay. Their results suggest that these sites are important for the formation of active human dynein complexes. Overall, the authors have done a very impressive and beautiful series of experiments. The potential impact of such a high-resolution structure is obvious and their functional analysis has also generated great insights. The data are in general of high quality and nicely presented, and the paper is very well written. However, their model is problematic. It is mainly based on the idea that LIS1 enhances the dynein-microtubule interaction to keep dynein at the microtubule plus end (they think that this tight microtubule binding at the plus end would in turn enhance the formation of the active complex containing dynein, dynactin and cargo adapters). This idea is not consistent with published data (see my point #1 below). Thus, the model figure as well as some discussion points will need to be revised or replaced accordingly. In addition, in vitro assays were done to test whether the mutations affect Pac1/LIS1's ability to induce a tight dynein-microtubule binding or an inhibition of dynein motility, while Marzo, et al., 2020 NCB showed co-migration of dynein and Pac1/LIS1 as well as Pac1/LIS1's ability in enhancing dynein processivity if salt concentration is increased for the in vitro motility assay. I wonder if the authors could try to use higher salt concentrations in the in vitro motility assay, which seems worthwhile because the enhancement of dynein processivity has been linked to the ability of LIS1 in promoting the open state of dynein (the current LIS1-mechanism model that the authors also emphasized in the Discussion). Below I provide more detailed comments for the authors to consider during the revision.</p><p>1. Currently, the model emphasized the idea that the LIS1-enhanced dynein-microtubule interaction enhances the microtubule-plus-end accumulation of dynein, which in turn promotes active complex formation. This is inconsistent with experimental findings: In the budding yeast, the microtubule-binding domain is not required for the plus-end accumulation of dynein (Lammers and Markus 2015). In mammalian cells (as well as filamentous fungi), dynactin is needed for the plus-end accumulation of dynein (Xiang et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2003, 2008, Lenz et al., 2006; Egan et al., 2012, Splinter et al., 2012., Yao et al., 2012) and this is also true in vitro in reconstituted systems (Duellburg et al., 2014; Baumbach et al., 2017; Jha et al., 2017). Would it be better to have a model figure summarizing the current findings on the separation-of-function mutants?</p><p>2. It would be better to mention in the Introduction section that LIS1 has recently been implicated in preventing dynein from adopting the autoinhibited phi structure when you mentioned its role in complex formation.</p><p>3. Data were presented to argue for an inconsistency with a &quot;tethering&quot; model in which LIS1 tethers dynein to microtubules non-specifically. This was done to argue against the idea proposed by Marzo et al., 2020 that the Pac1/LIS1-caused speed reduction of dynein is due to the non-specific binding of Pac1/LIS1 to microtubules. However, Marzo et al. showed that Pac1/LIS1 does not need to bind dynein to cause a speed reduction, since dynein complexed with Pac1 or not complexed with Pac1 gets the same kind of speed reduction. This point will need to be considered. In addition, since the LIS15A mutant binds to neither dynein nor microtubules, do you have any previous data suggesting that the mutant protein is folded properly or at least expressed well in vivo? This would help strengthen the argument that these amino acids bind microtubules directly. Also, the dimeric LIS1 (LIS1 WT) does seem to lower the velocity more dramatically (Figure 3C), and this also needs to be considered because the argument that dynein-binding and microtubule-binding cannot possibly use the same site of LIS1 only works when a monomer is considered. Given these problems, and the fact that there is no good model explaining how LIS1 affects the mechanochemistry of dynein (aside from phi opening), it may be easier not to put too much effort into this argument but just focus on the new structural data.</p><p>4. The interaction between the two LIS1 propellers is important, which is a significant result. Since Htet et al., 2020 NCB showed that LIS1 monomer is effective in promoting active complex formation in vitro, it seems that monomers at a high concentration can still lead to propeller interaction, and you may want to mention this point in this context. Also, it would be nice to cite an early Aspergillus paper showing that LIS1 dimerization is important in vivo (Ahn and Morris 2001 JBC).</p><p>5. In Figure 2 G and other figures where you checked LIS1's ability to lower dynein's affinity for microtubules in the presence of ATP-Vi, did you use wild type or the wB-AAA3 mutant?</p><p>6. Figure 6, it is unclear where the cortical dynein dots are. It would be better to show a merge with the bright-field images to show cortical dynein or at least use arrows or circles to mark the positions of the signals in all images. Also, would it be better to show representative images of the new mutants rather than just lis1∆?</p><p>7. It would be better to at least briefly mention in the main text how you quantify dynein for the binding curves.</p><p>8. The dynein mutant defective in binding AAA5 does show a little lowered level, and the authors can state something like &quot;a slightly reduced expression level was observed&quot;. Please include a simple sequence alignment figure to show the positions of the mutated amino acids or those in the contacting sites in human dynein and yeast dynein heavy chains.</p><p>9. Lis1S248Q and Lis1F185D, I189D, R494A are capable of inducing tight microtubule binding in the presence of ATP but mutants carrying these mutations show a clear nuclear-positioning phenotype in yeast. This at least argues against the tight MT-binding being the only key effect of LIS1 in vivo. What would be the other key effects? &quot;The weakening of dynein's interactions with microtubules when AAA3 is bound to ATP&quot; does not seem to agree with the genetic data from Aspergillus that the wB-AAA3 mutation allows the LIS1 function to be bypassed. It seems more likely that LIS1's effect on promoting the open dynein state is relevant in vivo as this was shown in both yeast and Aspergillus. For these two mutants, I wonder if the open dynein (phi mutant) would suppress their nuclear-positioning defect. If so, that would be very interesting. Although I don't think these experiments are absolutely needed for the publication of this work, it would indeed be better to at least discuss these individual mutants in light of this current model of LIS1 action (i.e. overcoming the phi state and promoting the open state).</p><p>10. LIS1 seems to be requited for both the plus-end accumulation and the cortical interaction of dynein, but the beauty of the Lis1S248Q mutation is that it seems to only affect the dynein-dynactin-Num1 complex formation. You should discuss this. Could the nuclear-positioning defect of this mutant be suppressed by the phi mutation or by the AAA3 Walker B mutation? Would this mutation prevent dynein from leaving the microtubule plus end when the Num1 CC domains are overexpressed (Lammers and Markus 2015)? These experiments were doable in Aspergillus only because LIS1 is not required for the plus-end dynein accumulation, but now you have gotten this wonderful function-separating mutant that can be used in yeast for various future assays!</p><p>11. &quot;….reach the cell cortex, the site where active yeast dynein-dynactin complexes interact with the candidate activating adaptor, Num1 (Figure 8A, panel iii) (Heil-Chapdelaine et al., 2000; Lammers and Markus, 2015; Lee et al., 2003; Sheeman et al..)&quot;. It is better to add Tang et al. 2012 JCB after this statement because this paper dissected the dynein-cortex interaction in detail. Also, it's better not to call the dynein-dynactin complexes &quot;active&quot; because it is only active after Num1 binding (Lammers and Markus 2015).</p><p>12. The structure was solved using the yeast dynein motor domain containing a Walker B mutation in AAA3 (E2488Q). Given the recent genetic data from Aspergillus that the wB-AAA3 mutation bypasses the requirement of LIS1 (Qiu et al., 2021, bioRxiv), some people may think that the newly identified interactions are not important in other systems. Thus, it would be better to mention that the human dynein used for structural work (Htet et al., 2020 NCB) is a wild type with linkers bent, but LIS1 binding at the stalk was still revealed, suggesting that these interactions sites play roles in multiple dynein states.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It was difficult to keep track of dynein and LIS1 constructs used in the study. It might be better to use PAC1 for experiments with the yeast protein and LIS1 in experiments with human protein. Also, the simple term &quot;dynein&quot; should probably be reserved for the holoenzyme and descriptors used to indicate when other forms of dynein are used (monomeric, mutant etc).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>We enjoyed reading this manuscript, which was very well written and presented. We have a few comments below that we ask the authors to address.</p><p>1) We had a hard time figuring out what dynein construct was used for the cryo EM structure. Could the authors make this clear in the methods/table please?</p><p>2) As the authors note, nucleotide density is somewhat ambiguous. We noted that this may be the case for AAA4 as well. If it was not attempted already, we suggest signal subtraction, re-centering and local refinement perhaps focused on AAA2-3-4, AAA5-6-1L, AAA6-1-2 and around the two Lis1 binding sites. The resolution of this structure is already very impressive and the field would benefit from the highest resolution dynein-Lis1 structure possible; signal subtraction / local refinement may provide additional resolution which could allow to unambiguously assign nucleotide density and some parts of the interface.</p><p>3) Line 262 – the authors mention that &quot;Arg 494 was also mutated to Ala to remove the only hydrogen bond donor/acceptor in the interface&quot;. However, it seems that D183 and K178 may form a salt bridge between the two Lis1 b-propellers and contribute to the interface?</p><p>4) It seems that R3476 (dynein) and E253 (Lis1) could interact if the E253 rotamer was changed, and indeed these residues were chosen to mutate. Since there is not density defining this rotamer, do the authors think that switching the rotamer to facilitate salt bridging would make sense? Currently R3476 looks like it interacts with D3487, so it's possible it can switch between these two interactions.</p><p>5) In the structure statistics table (Supplementary file 2) please include: cc values, sphericity value from 3D FSC</p><p>6) Great use of the streptavidin affinity grids for a really tough sample!</p><p>7) Throughout the manuscript, it may be useful to name the Lis1 chains in some way so it is easy to follow which b-propeller if being referenced at each instance</p><p>8) Figure 6: We found the microscopy assay a bit hard to follow, and would appreciate if it were made a bit more clear. A few things we were unsure of:</p><p>– Are the measurements being made in the 20% of cells that are the aberrant binucleate cells?</p><p>– Was this all done by live cell imaging? Or were cells fixed and analysed?</p><p>– Because of the background, the images in Figure 6C are hard to follow. We were wondering if zooming in further may help. A cortical marker or + end marker would also be helpful but may not be necessary. Maybe the authors could draw an outline of the cells to help the readers to see better, which would be an easy fix.</p><p>9) Figure 1E-H is a bit hard to follow with the density and the models. We suggest to highlight interactions using just the models, and show the map quality in the supplement.</p><p>10) Figure 2E – do the authors find it surprising that the affinity is not changed more? We would have expected to see more of a change in binding affinities.</p><p>11) For the mutants that were made, is it clear that they all fold properly/are stable?</p><p>12) Could the authors include statistical analysis for Figure 2C,D, Figure 4B and 5B, to test significance as they have done for other assays?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71229.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers agreed that your model for the role of Lis1 in controlling affinity for microtubules and determining plus end localization needs more discussion of other papers in the field.

Our data indicates that this role precedes cortical localization of dynein. Our data does not allow us to determine whether this additional role involves the stabilization of tight microtubule binding by Lis1.</p><p>Specifically, we made mutations that disrupt dynein’s Phi conformation (Marzo et al. 2020) and compared the phenotype of this mutant with a mutant that is compromised for Lis1 binding to dynein at site<sub>ring</sub> (where Lis1 induces tight microtubule binding in vitro), and to a double mutant containing both the Phi disrupting mutation and the Lis1 site<sub>ring</sub> dynein binding site mutation. We then quantified dynein localization to the yeast cell cortex, where complex assembly of dynein and dynactin with the putative activating adaptor Num1 occurs. Our analysis shows that (1) the Phi disrupting dynein mutant causes more dynein to reach the cortex compared to WT dynein and (2) combining this mutant with the Lis1 site<sub>ring</sub> dynein binding mutant leads to a decrease in dynein reaching the cortex relative to the Phi disrupting mutant alone. This decrease in cortical dynein relative to the Phi disrupting dynein mutant suggests an additional role for Lis1 in localizing dynein to the cortex beyond disrupting dynein’s autoinhibited conformation. In our discussion we consider possible roles, including promoting additional conformation changes in dynein. This experiment, combined with other experiments in the field, have prompted us to revise and simplify our model figure (new Figure 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) If possible the reviewers ask you to conduct some experiments at high salt under conditions where Lis1 is reported to affect yeast dynein processivity. Please see reviewer 1 for details.</p></disp-quote><p>Our main goal with the in vitro assays using yeast proteins was to test and validate the new interactions we identified in our structure of a dynein-Lis1 complex (Figure 1). We wanted well established assays with clear readouts for defects in the interaction between dynein and Lis1. Two of these readouts are the Lis1-dependent changes in dynein velocity and microtubule binding in vitro. Importantly, we were not using these assays to test how disrupting interactions based on our structure affected the physiological function of Lis1 (we used the in vivo assays for that); rather, we were using the assays as tools to test the structure. Given that, we felt that repeating the experiments using different salt conditions would not add to our structural insights and decided against expanding the experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers had some difficulty following the species of LIS1 and dynein, the specific constructs, and the mutations used for each experiment (and also to some extent in the discussion) – can you try to standardize names of constructs and proteins.

This high-resolution structure allows the authors to reveal new details of interaction interfaces, specifically the LIS1-binding site on AAA5, the LIS1-binding site on the stalk as well as the contact site between the two LIS1 propellers (one binds the ring and the other binds stalk). The authors made specific mutations (in LIS1 or dynein) to investigate the significance of these interactions. The functional study was done by using both in vitro (binding curve and effect on in vitro velocity) and in vivo assays (nuclear positioning and dynein localization in yeast). Finally, they also made mutations in human dynein that affect LIS1 binding to the same sites (ring and stalk) and investigated the functional significance of the involved amino acids in cargo-adapter- and dynactin-mediated dynein activation/motility assay. Their results suggest that these sites are important for the formation of active human dynein complexes. Overall, the authors have done a very impressive and beautiful series of experiments. The potential impact of such a high-resolution structure is obvious and their functional analysis has also generated great insights. The data are in general of high quality and nicely presented, and the paper is very well written. However, their model is problematic. It is mainly based on the idea that LIS1 enhances the dynein-microtubule interaction to keep dynein at the microtubule plus end (they think that this tight microtubule binding at the plus end would in turn enhance the formation of the active complex containing dynein, dynactin and cargo adapters). This idea is not consistent with published data (see my point #1 below). Thus, the model figure as well as some discussion points will need to be revised or replaced accordingly. In addition, in vitro assays were done to test whether the mutations affect Pac1/LIS1's ability to induce a tight dynein-microtubule binding or an inhibition of dynein motility, while Marzo, et al., 2020 NCB showed co-migration of dynein and Pac1/LIS1 as well as Pac1/LIS1's ability in enhancing dynein processivity if salt concentration is increased for the in vitro motility assay. I wonder if the authors could try to use higher salt concentrations in the in vitro motility assay, which seems worthwhile because the enhancement of dynein processivity has been linked to the ability of LIS1 in promoting the open state of dynein (the current LIS1-mechanism model that the authors also emphasized in the Discussion). Below I provide more detailed comments for the authors to consider during the revision.</p><p>1. Currently, the model emphasized the idea that the LIS1-enhanced dynein-microtubule interaction enhances the microtubule-plus-end accumulation of dynein, which in turn promotes active complex formation. This is inconsistent with experimental findings: In the budding yeast, the microtubule-binding domain is not required for the plus-end accumulation of dynein (Lammers and Markus 2015). In mammalian cells (as well as filamentous fungi), dynactin is needed for the plus-end accumulation of dynein (Xiang et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2003, 2008, Lenz et al., 2006; Egan et al., 2012, Splinter et al., 2012., Yao et al., 2012) and this is also true in vitro in reconstituted systems (Duellburg et al., 2014; Baumbach et al., 2017; Jha et al., 2017). Would it be better to have a model figure summarizing the current findings on the separation-of-function mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential revision #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would it be better to have a model figure summarizing the current findings on the separation-of-function mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>We now emphasize that this is a separation-of-function mutation in Lis1 in the results with the following sentence:</p><p>“We note that the site<sub>stalk</sub> mutant is the only Lis1 mutant with no defect in dynein’s localization to microtubule plus ends, thus this separation-of-function mutant could be a useful tool to further understand the mechanism of dynein regulation by Lis1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It would be better to mention in the Introduction section that LIS1 has recently been implicated in preventing dynein from adopting the autoinhibited phi structure when you mentioned its role in complex formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have revised our introduction accordingly to say:</p><p>“Recently, Lis1 was shown to play a role in forming active dynein complexes, most likely by disrupting dynein’s autoinhibited Phi conformation (Elshenawy et al., 2020; Htet et al., 2020; Marzo et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Data were presented to argue for an inconsistency with a &quot;tethering&quot; model in which LIS1 tethers dynein to microtubules non-specifically. This was done to argue against the idea proposed by Marzo et al., 2020 that the Pac1/LIS1-caused speed reduction of dynein is due to the non-specific binding of Pac1/LIS1 to microtubules. However, Marzo et al. showed that Pac1/LIS1 does not need to bind dynein to cause a speed reduction, since dynein complexed with Pac1 or not complexed with Pac1 gets the same kind of speed reduction. This point will need to be considered. In addition, since the LIS15A mutant binds to neither dynein nor microtubules, do you have any previous data suggesting that the mutant protein is folded properly or at least expressed well in vivo? This would help strengthen the argument that these amino acids bind microtubules directly. Also, the dimeric LIS1 (LIS1 WT) does seem to lower the velocity more dramatically (Figure 3C), and this also needs to be considered because the argument that dynein-binding and microtubule-binding cannot possibly use the same site of LIS1 only works when a monomer is considered. Given these problems, and the fact that there is no good model explaining how LIS1 affects the mechanochemistry of dynein (aside from phi opening), it may be easier not to put too much effort into this argument but just focus on the new structural data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have decided to remove our experiments on microtubule binding from the manuscript as we feel that they distracted from the main message of our paper and that additional experiments are warranted that go beyond the scope of the current study. However, we still address each point brought up by the reviewer below.</p><p>The data you are referring to comes from Marzo et al. Figure 5D. In this experiment, the authors examine full length dynein velocity and run length at a single concentration of Pac1/Lis1 (25 nM) in 150 mM KCl.</p><p>From our work, the apparent Kd for the dynein/Pac1 interaction in 50 mM KAcetate is greater than 100 nM. Thus, at 25 nM Pac1 (1/4 x Kd) the occupancy of Pac1 on dynein should be less than 30%. This is likely to be even lower at the 150 mM KCl used in the Marzo et al. work. Given this, we would expect Pac1 to be coming on and off dynein, with a small fraction of complexes formed at any given time.</p><p>We have found that Pac1 decreases dynein velocity in a dose-dependent manner (Huang and Roberts et al., 2012). Our current hypothesis is that Pac1/Lis1’s major function is to relieve the inhibition of dynein when it is in a Phi conformation, something that may happen at low (catalytic) concentrations of Pac1 (at least in vitro, the Phi conformation tends not to reform once it has been disrupted). Once dynein has assumed a parallel active conformation, any binding of Pac1 to dynein at site<sub>ring</sub> would decrease dynein’s velocity by biasing dynein towards a tight microtubule binding conformation (the “open” ring state). This function, however, requires stoichiometric binding of Pac1 to dynein. Therefore, we suspect that Marzo and colleagues might have observed a reduction in dynein velocity if a range of Pac1 concentrations had been tried in their assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The interaction between the two LIS1 propellers is important, which is a significant result. Since Htet et al., 2020 NCB showed that LIS1 monomer is effective in promoting active complex formation in vitro, it seems that monomers at a high concentration can still lead to propeller interaction, and you may want to mention this point in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to point 3 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it would be nice to cite an early Aspergillus paper showing that LIS1 dimerization is important in vivo (Ahn and Morris 2001 JBC).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have added the following to the introduction:</p><p>“Structurally, Lis1 is a dimer of two ß-propellers (Kim et al., 2004; Tarricone et al., 2004), and in vivo Lis1 dimerization is required for its function (Ahn and Morris, 2001; Huang et al., 2012).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 2 G and other figures where you checked LIS1's ability to lower dynein's affinity for microtubules in the presence of ATP-Vi, did you use wild type or the wB-AAA3 mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>We used wild type dynein. We have revised the figure legends to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 6, it is unclear where the cortical dynein dots are. It would be better to show a merge with the bright-field images to show cortical dynein or at least use arrows or circles to mark the positions of the signals in all images. Also, would it be better to show representative images of the new mutants rather than just lis1∆?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the cell outlines in Figure 6C and created a new Figure 6—figure supplement 1, which contains a gallery of the mutants. We added outlines to new Figure 7 as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It would be better to at least briefly mention in the main text how you quantify dynein for the binding curves.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The dynein mutant defective in binding AAA5 does show a little lowered level, and the authors can state something like &quot;a slightly reduced expression level was observed&quot;.

Lis1S248Q and Lis1F185D, I189D, R494A are capable of inducing tight microtubule binding in the presence of ATP but mutants carrying these mutations show a clear nuclear-positioning phenotype in yeast. This at least argues against the tight MT-binding being the only key effect of LIS1 in vivo. What would be the other key effects? &quot;The weakening of dynein's interactions with microtubules when AAA3 is bound to ATP&quot; does not seem to agree with the genetic data from Aspergillus that the wB-AAA3 mutation allows the LIS1 function to be bypassed. It seems more likely that LIS1's effect on promoting the open dynein state is relevant in vivo as this was shown in both yeast and Aspergillus. For these two mutants, I wonder if the open dynein (phi mutant) would suppress their nuclear-positioning defect. If so, that would be very interesting. Although I don't think these experiments are absolutely needed for the publication of this work, it would indeed be better to at least discuss these individual mutants in light of this current model of LIS1 action (i.e. overcoming the phi state and promoting the open state).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential revisions point #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. LIS1 seems to be requited for both the plus-end accumulation and the cortical interaction of dynein, but the beauty of the Lis1S248Q mutation is that it seems to only affect the dynein-dynactin-Num1 complex formation. You should discuss this. Could the nuclear-positioning defect of this mutant be suppressed by the phi mutation or by the AAA3 Walker B mutation? Would this mutation prevent dynein from leaving the microtubule plus end when the Num1 CC domains are overexpressed (Lammers and Markus 2015)? These experiments were doable in Aspergillus only because LIS1 is not required for the plus-end dynein accumulation, but now you have gotten this wonderful function-separating mutant that can be used in yeast for various future assays!</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these are interesting questions and exciting new directions that we would love to follow up on in the future. We have highlighted in the manuscript that this is a function separating mutation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. &quot;….reach the cell cortex, the site where active yeast dynein-dynactin complexes interact with the candidate activating adaptor, Num1 (Figure 8A, panel iii) (Heil-Chapdelaine et al., 2000; Lammers and Markus, 2015; Lee et al., 2003; Sheeman et al..)&quot;. It is better to add Tang et al. 2012 JCB after this statement because this paper dissected the dynein-cortex interaction in detail. Also, it's better not to call the dynein-dynactin complexes &quot;active&quot; because it is only active after Num1 binding (Lammers and Markus 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified these parts of the paper extensively.</p><p>We intended to only call dynein-dynactin-activating adaptor complexes “active”. When we use the term “activated dynein-dynactin complexes” to us this is synonymous with saying dyneindynactin-activating adaptor complexes. We have explicitly stated this in the text now to prevent any confusion:</p><p>“Active moving dynein complexes contain the dynactin complex and a coiled-coil-containing activating adaptor, referred to here as “active dynein–dynactin” or “dynein–dynactin–activating adaptor complexes” (Mckenney et al., 2014; Schlager et al., 2014; Trokter et al., 2012) (Figure 1A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The structure was solved using the yeast dynein motor domain containing a Walker B mutation in AAA3 (E2488Q). Given the recent genetic data from Aspergillus that the wB-AAA3 mutation bypasses the requirement of LIS1 (Qiu et al., 2021, bioRxiv), some people may think that the newly identified interactions are not important in other systems. Thus, it would be better to mention that the human dynein used for structural work (Htet et al., 2020 NCB) is a wild type with linkers bent, but LIS1 binding at the stalk was still revealed, suggesting that these interactions sites play roles in multiple dynein states.</p></disp-quote><p>We have pointed out our 3D class averages of the human dynein plus Lis1 used wild type protein (Htet et al., 2020) in the Discussion:</p><p>“Our previous work with wild type human dynein and Lis1 showed that Lis1 binds to dynein at similar sites.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It was difficult to keep track of dynein and LIS1 constructs used in the study. It might be better to use PAC1 for experiments with the yeast protein and LIS1 in experiments with human protein. Also, the simple term &quot;dynein&quot; should probably be reserved for the holoenzyme and descriptors used to indicate when other forms of dynein are used (monomeric, mutant etc).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we needed to improve our nomenclature throughout.

We noted that this may be the case for AAA4 as well. If it was not attempted already, we suggest signal subtraction, re-centering and local refinement perhaps focused on AAA2-3-4, AAA5-6-1L, AAA6-1-2 and around the two Lis1 binding sites. The resolution of this structure is already very impressive and the field would benefit from the highest resolution dynein-Lis1 structure possible; signal subtraction / local refinement may provide additional resolution which could allow to unambiguously assign nucleotide density and some parts of the interface.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

This contact only accounts for ~20% of the buried surface area between the two proteins (as estimated using PDBePISA), with the rest of the contact being made between Lis1 and AAA4.
