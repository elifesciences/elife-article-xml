However, it is difficult to link cellular signals at will. Here, we describe signal-connectors<italic>—</italic>a series of RNA devices<italic>—</italic>that connect one signal to another signal at the translational level. We use them to either repress or enhance the translation of target genes in response to signals. Application of these devices allows us to construct various logic gates and to incorporate feedback loops into gene networks. They have also been used to rewire a native signaling pathway and even to create novel pathways. Furthermore, logical AND gates based on these devices and integration of multiple signals have been used successfully for identification and redirection of the state of cancer cells. Eventually, the malignant phenotypes of cancers have been reversed by rewiring the oncogenic signaling from promoting to suppressing tumorigenesis. We provide a novel platform for redirecting cellular information.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31936.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells respond to signals from their surrounding environment. External signals activate a sequence of events inside the cell that can change how it behaves. These events are often called signaling pathways and they typically change the cell’s behavior by changing the activity of its genes.</p><p>A major objective of the field of genetic engineering is to customize or artificially create new signaling pathways to make cells behave in certain ways. The ability to control a cell’s behavior is likely to have a major impact on human health and medicine. For instance, it may be possible to reprogram signaling events in cancer cells so that they die rather than grow rapidly.</p><p>Researchers are developing artificial genetic devices to manipulate signaling pathways. Molecules of ribonucleic acid (or RNA) are widely used to design such devices. In nature, RNA molecules are highly versatile: messenger RNA molecules carry genetic information in a form that can be translated into protein, while other RNA molecules fine-tune gene expression and perform a host of other roles. RNA is apt for artificial devices because it can be tailored to detect signals and convert this information into a predictable outcome, such as turning specific genes on or off.</p><p>In 2016, researchers constructed an RNA device to control the expression of genes in response to particular signals. However, this device was too large to deliver efficiently inside cells. Now, Liu, Li, Chen et al. – including some of the researchers involved the 2016 study – design smaller RNA devices to overcome this limitation. Each new device consists of two RNA components: one that recognizes the signal, and another that recognizes the messenger RNA of a target gene. Together the two components trigger the desired change in gene expression in response to a specific signal.</p><p>The devices were shown to have multiple uses such as making new connections in a signaling pathway and creating new signaling networks. Furthermore, Liu, Li, Chen et al. engineered one device such that it was able to specifically turn off genes in a particular signaling pathway that allows human bladder cancer cells to divide. By silencing these genes, the cancer cells were less able to grow.</p><p>These newly developed RNA devices should allow other researchers to customize cellular information and may have future therapeutic applications as well.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cancer biology</kwd><kwd>signaling networks</kwd><kwd>genetic switch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81773257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yuchen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81402103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yuchen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014CB745201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Zhiming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Special Support Funds of Shenzhen for Introduced High-Level Medical Team</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Zhiming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel RNA-based trans-regulatory system that control gene expression in mammalian cells has been developed and they can be coupled to endogenous signals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A basic ability of living cells is to sense extracellular signals by translating them into changes in regulation of cell signaling genes. They use the natural signaling network to execute complex physiological functions, such as cell survival, behavior and identity. As an interdisciplinary branch of biology, genetic engineering has developed rapidly during recent years with the objective of reconstituting the signaling network of the cell for therapeutic and biotechnological applications. Genetic devices have been used to construct novel signaling circuits such as genetic switches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gardner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Green et al., 2014</xref>), digital logic circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ausländer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Siuti et al., 2013</xref>), rewired signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kiel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flock et al., 2014</xref>) and feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stricker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prindle et al., 2014</xref>). It proved easy to construct networks between synthetic genes using standardized building blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang and Jiang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schreiber et al., 2016</xref>). By controlling the gene expression, there are both positive and negative gene connections. The key difference between them is that in positive connection, the regulated gene is activated for expression, while in negative connection, the regulated gene is silenced.</p><p>The native intracellular communication can be rewired using genetic devices that block or redirect signals, but connecting native input-output signals at will remains a challenge. For example, the previously developed trans-acting ligand-responsive RNA regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayer and Smolke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Win and Smolke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ausländer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beisel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2012</xref>) can be used to engineer novel connections by inhibiting native gene expression in response to extracellular molecules. The conversion of signals into specific cellular events has been accomplished via inducible or repressible antisense RNAs or miRNAs. However, they can only build negative gene connections and the antisense or RNAi-based regulation often exhibits relative low efficiency. Our group has developed a newly-engineered class of genetically encoded devices–‘CRISPR signal conductors' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2016</xref>)–that can sense and respond to cellular signals of interest and in turn activate/repress transcription of specific endogenous genes through a CRISPR interference or activation mechanism. The advantage of these devices is to construct both negative and positive connections between various selected biomolecules and it is only limited by the availability of functional RNA aptamers. However, they require an additional transgene encoding a large protein (dCas9) which further increases the complexity of the system. From an application point of view, the use of a compact RNA-based device is likely to be much more compatible with the limitations of transgene delivery technology than the use of a rather large protein-coding construct. Regretfully, except for miRNAs and siRNAs, no other RNA-based mechanism has been adapted as a wide-spread tool for controlling native gene expression.</p><p>In this work, we describe the multiple uses of ‘RNA-based signal connectors’ in mammalian cells to modulate translation of mRNAs transcribed from the native genome and from provided plasmids. This new technology acts at the translational stage, apparently promoting or suppressing recruitment of ribosomes to the target mRNA. Without the requirement for an exogenous protein, these small artificial RNAs can establish both negative and positive linkages between input and output signals at will. The work described here is an improvement on the past design of ‘signal conductors’ and shows that they can be used in multiple different applications.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and construction of RNA-based signal-connectors</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that insertion of an RNA aptamer into the 5ʹ untranslated region (5ʹ-UTR) of the messenger RNA (mRNA) can reduce the rate of translation initiation through blocking ribosome scanning in the presence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Werstuck and Green, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blount and Breaker, 2006</xref>). We hypothesized that a designed external complementary sequence can be used to hybridize to the target mRNA and to guide RNA aptamers for trans-regulation of cellular mRNA translation when a specific signal is present. To test this, we engineered RNA devices which use the antisense domain (a 20 nt antisense RNA) to recognize the mRNA of interest and the previously developed aptamer domain to control translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used the signal-connector to tether a translational activation domain to enhance translation, or the aptamer domain alone to repress the translation. In principle, these modular devices which we called ‘signal-connectors’, can be designed to control the translation of any target mRNA in response to a signal-molecule of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and thus link desired endogenous signals (input) to specific cellular signals (output) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31936.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and construction of the signal-connectors for constructing linkages between signaling nodes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain composition of a signal-connector.

Each of these signal-connectors contained two segments: a 20 nt antisense RNA sequence designed to be complementary to the targeted mRNA sequence and two theophylline aptamer copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jenison et al., 1994</xref>). Of these 12 constructs, 11 induced significant decreases in Renilla luciferase expression in the presence of 1000 µM theophylline when they were stably transfected into HEK293 cells expressing Renilla luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We then observed that addition of theophylline inhibited luciferase activity in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We speculated that the effects of the signal-connectors should also be affected by the valency of ligands recruited to each mRNA target. To test this possibility, we then introduced one or three theophylline aptamers to the 3ʹ end of signal connectors, constructed stably transfected HEK293 cells, detected the luciferase expression level and compared their effects with those of the 2 × signal connectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

As expected, these devices (R13 ~R15 and R17 ~R20) showed efficient silencing effects only in the presence of 100 µM tetracycline. Relative levels of VEGF mRNA did not change obviously between cells harboring the signal-connectors grown in the absence or presence of tetracycline, indicating that the signal-connectors function through translational inhibition rather than by affecting mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>These results demonstrated that the signal-connectors could be used as gene switches to down-regulate the expression of a target gene.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Signal-connectors effectively activate target gene expression</title><p>Using the RNA aptamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miyakawa et al., 2006</xref>) for eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), we then determined whether signal-connectors could also enhance translation of a target gene by promoting the formation of initiation factor complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). eIF4G recruits the ribosome 40S subunit and activates mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moore, 2005</xref>). We chose the Renilla luciferase gene as the target gene and the results of luciferase reporter assay indicated that the specific signal-connector with two eIF4G aptamers induced a 15-fold increase in activity of luciferase protein relative to controls when they were stably transfected into HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Elimination of one aptamer copy from the construct dramatically decreased the induced activation efficiency, whereas the fold change value increased minimally with the addition of another copy of aptamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation analysis also showed that this construct mainly located in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Theophylline or tetracycline binding stabilizes the aptamer and leads to a conformational change that allows the antisense domain to interfere with the mRNA of the target gene. The results of the luciferase reporter assay on HEK293 cells stably expressing these devices indicated that addition of theophylline or tetracycline increased activity of luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).

The excellent gene regulatory ability of the signal-connectors inspired us to construct various logic gates that produced output signals in response to multiple input signals through stably transfecting these devices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We built all the basic types of two-input Boolean logic gates in HEK293 cells stably expressing the 5’ capped or uncapped Renilla luciferase mRNA construct by using the aptamer recognizing exogenous theophylline or tetracycline signal.

We used two devices (R1 and R13) that maximally suppressed translation of 5ʹ capped Renilla luciferase mRNA in the presence of 1000 µM theophylline or 100 µM tetracycline to build these gates.

We used two signal-connectors (R25 and R29) that minimally activated translation of 5ʹ uncapped Renilla luciferase mRNA in the presence of ligand to build this gate. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, although introduction of each individual signal (1000 µM theophylline or 100 µM tetracycline) did not significantly stimulate expression of the target luciferase gene, the two devices acted synergistically to induce robust translational activation in the presence of both the input signals.</p><p>We also constructed a NAND gate that exhibited high output if any of the inputs were low.

We used two devices (R1 and R13) that maximally inhibited translation of 5ʹ capped Renilla luciferase mRNA in the presence of ligand to build this gate. Since introduction of individual signal significantly suppressed expression of the target gene, the luciferase could be produced only when both of the two signals (1000 µM theophylline and 100 µM tetracycline) were absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>We also constructed an XOR gate that exhibited high output if either, but not both, of its two inputs were high. We designed signal-connectors (R22 and R27) to target two different regions of the 5ʹ uncapped Renilla luciferase mRNA, which were complementary in their RNA sequence. The results showed that each one of the devices strongly activated expression of luciferase in the presence of corresponding ligand. In contrast, introduction of both devices did not significantly activate expression of the target luciferase gene due to the specific base pairing between their antisense domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we constructed an XNOR gate that exhibited a low output if either, but not both, of its two inputs were high.

In the absence of β-catenin signal, the antisense domain was sequestered by the stem of the β-catenin aptamer. In the presence of β-catenin signal, this signal-connector could interact with the target Renilla luciferase mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).

We engineered a feedback loop using the signal-connectors in which osteopontin (OPN) and VEGF were each other’s activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). OPN and VEGF are secreted proteins with cytokine properties and regulate cell motility and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ferrara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lyle et al., 2014</xref>) and their RNA aptamers were reported in previous literatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mi et al., 2009</xref>). We inserted two copies of eIF4G aptamer into the 3’end of OPN or VEGF riboswitch to construct signal-connector recognizing VEGF or OPN. The results of our over-expression experiments revealed that OPN and VEGF were mutually independently operated in bladder cancer T24 cells stably transfected with the negative control device.

We also investigated whether the signal-connectors could be used to construct negative feedback loops between OPN and VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), which could make the system more stable. Because OPN could induce the expression of VEGF via the signal-connector, we only needed to prove that VEGF could also inhibit the expression of OPN through a similar approach. We inserted two copies of VEGF aptamer into the 3’end of antisense RNA recognizing OPN to construct the signal-connector. Using T24 cells stably expressing this constructed signal-connector, we showed that transient expression of VEGF could decrease the concentration of OPN and that knockdown of VEGF increased the level of OPN again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>These results demonstrated that the signal-connectors were effective tools for constructing regulatory loops and gene–gene networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Signal-connectors specifically silence survival gene expression and inhibit cancer cell growth</title><p>To examine whether these devices could be used to identify cell state and to reprogram cellular behavior, we used the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter to drive the expression of ribozyme-flanked signal-connectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao and Zhao, 2014</xref>) that silence survival genes, and chose bladder cancer cells as the target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The results of western blotting showed that the signal-connectors stably transfected in T24 cells could simultaneously enhanced the protein expression levels of Bax and p21 and decreased Bcl2 and c-myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, we determined whether the signal-connectors could simultaneously inhibit tumor growth in vivo, since T24 cells stably transfected with these devices showed a slower in vitro growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The cells were then inoculated into male nude mice. Twenty days after injection, we found that the tumors formed in the signal-connectors group were dramatically smaller than those in the negative control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). In addition, the average tumor weight was markedly lower in the signal-connectors group compared to the negative control group at the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These results indicate that signal-connectors could inhibit tumor growth in vivo by redirecting oncogenic signaling pathways.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31936.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The signal-connector induces simultaneous activation and repression of cellular genes in response to oncogenic signal and redirects the oncogenic signaling to an anti-oncogenic pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The oncogenic signal NF-kB was redirected to activate two tumor suppressors, Bax and p21, and to suppress two oncogenes, BCL2 and c-Myc, by the signal-connector in the cancer cells.

Although it has been reported that an aptamer inserted in the 5ʹ-UTR-mRNA can effectively repress translation of a synthetic gene (expressed in an exogenous vector) through the road-block mechanism, this is the first work to propose that aptamers could also repress endogenous genes of interest in a trans manner by linking with the antisense RNAs. It should also be noted that some natural non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Loh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mellin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Price et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) were found to inhibit their target gene through a similar mechanism, which suggests that the method used in this study is a universal approach for cellular RNAs to interact with genes of interest. More importantly, we showed that the aptamer tethering translation initiation factor could be used to enhance endogenous gene translation. In a similar case, this new mechanism was also proposed by one previous work which reported that the uchl1 gene lncRNA enhances the translation of its target mRNA via base-pairing and by recruiting additional ribosomes via the functional element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrieri et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, this approach allows simultaneous activation and repression of different target genes, thus enabling robust reprogramming of cellular networks.</p><p>It is interesting that the signal-connectors mainly located in the cytoplasm. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the device binds the mRNA in the nucleus and remains bound to the mRNA during and after export. This observation is consistent with an earlier study which indicated that nuclear-localized sgRNA targeting mRNA can also be exported to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nelles et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the applications of this methodology, we used two signal connectors targeting luciferase gene, but containing aptamers to different ligands, to construct circuits which are somewhat similar to computer logic gates. We also applied this methodology to couple unrelated signaling pathways and to connect oncogenic signals with an antioncogenic pathway. The signal connectors may provide an alternative approach to traditional cancer gene therapy which usually targets only one single gene.</p><p>In the construction of activator devices (with eIF4G), some basic thermodynamic/kinetics parameters, such as binding affinity and kinetics behaviors, still require quantitative studies in future works. The potential impact of the secondary structures in the targeted region of mRNA may also not be ignored. It seems that other small RNA regulators that are enzymatically amplified (such as shRNAs and miRNAs) exhibit much lower efficiencies than what we report here when expressed from the U6 promoter. We will compare efficacy of this new approach with that of the existing, simpler treatment method in future works.</p><p>Although conceptually simple, these devices may be included in the biology toolbox that allows for construction of novel signaling circuits and regulatory loops with predetermined properties and may enable development of strategies for treating disease networks. With regard to research applications of this methodology, one clear limitation is the fact that functional aptamers still usually need to be selected from random libraries. With the discovery and development of more and more aptamers, any signal not associated with gene regulation can be directed to inhibit/enhance translation of the targeted gene through the designed signal-connector which is very important to the signal transmission of parts of the gene circuits. Our results showed that these devices could be used to create genetic switches, logic gates, novel signaling and feedback loops, which led to practical applications such as detection of cancer cell state and inhibition of cancer cell survival. Signal-connectors that rewire multiple oncogenic signaling networks may provide an effective network-based strategy to increase the efficiency of current cancer treatment. In addition, mammalian cells harboring digital logic gates can function as living bio-computers and open new avenues for artificial control of future gene- or cell-based therapies in a specific condition-dependent manner. Our novel technique will provide a useful platform for editing the common network structures and their signaling processes and will bring many applications in biology and medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Designing principle of RNA-based signal-connectors</title><p>We first analyzed the sequences of well-known RNA aptamers in mammalian cells, such as theophylline aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jenison et al., 1994</xref>), tetracycline aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Müller et al., 2006</xref>), eIF4G aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miyakawa et al., 2006</xref>), β-catenin aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Culler et al., 2010</xref>), VEGF aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ng et al., 2006</xref>), OPN aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mi et al., 2009</xref>) and NF-kB (p65) aptamer (urster et al., 2008).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Synthesizing artificial devices that redirect cellular information at will&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The article describes a novel RNA-based trans-regulatory system to control gene expression in mammalian cells. The regulators exhibit good dynamic range and they can be coupled to endogenous signals. Complex regulation patterns corresponding to various 2-input logic combinations were also shown. Overall the study describes a novel, well-performing and potentially useful framework for combinatorial control of gene expression using RNA regulators in trans.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The bulk of expression is reported based on luciferase assay. Moreover, only one luciferase has been knocked in without internal reference. The signal seems to have been measured following cell lysis. Was the number of cells controlled for by cell counting? It is very possible that the difference in signal resulted from difference in cell numbers between wells, for example due to difference in cell growth rate. The authors should explicitly state in much more detail how the luciferase-based data were obtained.</p><p>2) The measurements are always shown relative to control. It would be helpful to see the different data in absolute units, e.g. expression per cell.</p><p>3) The authors should describe in much more detail the rationale for their short RNA regulator design. Were the reported sequences selected from a large library or rationally designed and worked as expected in the first trial?</p><p>4) The cells used in the experiment are all stable cell lines. This is a welcome approach, however the selection of clones is unclear. Were uniform criteria applied to all clones? Were the different clones screened functionally prior to reporting? How robust is the effect across clones? What is the integration copy number? In summary, as much detail as possible should be provided regarding the clones, including data sheets for each clone and their characterisation such as GFP expression (as FACS plot) and baseline luciferase activity in absolute units per cell. Ideally, genotyping would also be helpful.</p><p>5) The tumor in vivo experiments are not entirely convincing. It seems as if the cells modified with the NFkB sensor had slower growth. These cells should be characterized in vitro for cell growth rates, as the reviewers suspect that the differential tumor progression simply reflects the different growth rate in vitro. The reviewers do not underestimate the success of slowing down cell growth, but the data need to be shown for completeness.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31936.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The bulk of expression is reported based on luciferase assay.

The reported RNA sequences have been rationally designed based on the reported RNA aptamers. Most of these RNA devices worked as expected in the first trial. We have included a new paragraph in the Materials and methods section to further introduce the design principle of RNA-based signal-connectors: “We first analyzed the sequences of well-known RNA aptamers in mammalian cells, such as theophylline aptamer (Jenison et al., 1994), tetracycline aptamer (Muller et al., 2006), eIF4G aptamer (Miyakawa et al., 2006), β-catenin aptamer (Culler et al., 2010),VEGF aptamer (Ng et al., 2006), OPN aptamer (Mi et al., 2009) and NF-κB (p65) aptamer (urster et al., 2008). […] The RNAs which showed exposed antisense domains and maintained the natural secondary structures of aptamers were selected and used in this study”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The cells used in the experiment are all stable cell lines. This is a welcome approach, however the selection of clones is unclear. Were uniform criteria applied to all clones? Were the different clones screened functionally prior to reporting? How robust is the effect across clones? What is the integration copy number? In summary, as much detail as possible should be provided regarding the clones, including data sheets for each clone and their characterisation such as GFP expression (as FACS plot) and baseline luciferase activity in absolute units per cell. Ideally, genotyping would also be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your valuable comments. We are sorry for not clearly showing the details of the selection of stable cell lines. We used multiclonal cell lines (without isolation of specific clones) in this study. Because stable integration is often accompanied by the inactivation of an endogenous gene from the host, the use of mixed stable cell lines in experiments can help to obtain more accurate data.</p><p>The details of the selection of stable cell lines have been included in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“HEK-293 cells stably expressing <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase were obtained by transfecting cells with pcDNA3/Rluc/Neo and selecting positive clones with G418. […] An inverted fluorescence microscope was used for direct observation of fluorescent cells in the culture plate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The tumor in vivo experiments are not entirely convincing. It seems as if the cells modified with the NFkB sensor had slower growth.

The reviewers do not underestimate the success of slowing down cell growth, but the data need to be shown for completeness.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your valuable comments. We do agree with the view of the reviewers. In fact, we have calculated the in vitro growth rates of these cells in our preliminary results. We found that T24 cells stably transfected with these devices showed a slower in vitro growth rate. We have added these data into the manuscript (Figure. 6—figure supplement 2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
