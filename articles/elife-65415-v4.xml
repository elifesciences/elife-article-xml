Mechanical cues are known to regulate keratinocyte re-epithelialization and wound healing; however, the underlying molecular transducers and biophysical mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show through molecular, cellular, and organismal studies that the mechanically activated ion channel PIEZO1 regulates keratinocyte migration and wound healing. Epidermal-specific <italic>Piezo1</italic> knockout mice exhibited faster wound closure while gain-of-function mice displayed slower wound closure compared to littermate controls. By imaging the spatiotemporal localization dynamics of endogenous PIEZO1 channels, we find that channel enrichment at some regions of the wound edge induces a localized cellular retraction that slows keratinocyte collective migration. In migrating single keratinocytes, PIEZO1 is enriched at the rear of the cell, where maximal retraction occurs, and we find that chemical activation of PIEZO1 enhances retraction during single as well as collective migration. Our findings uncover novel molecular mechanisms underlying single and collective keratinocyte migration that may suggest a potential pharmacological target for wound treatment. More broadly, we show that nanoscale spatiotemporal dynamics of Piezo1 channels can control tissue-scale events, a finding with implications beyond wound healing to processes as diverse as development, homeostasis, disease, and repair.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The skin is the largest organ of the body. It enables touch sensation and protects against external insults. Wounding of the skin exposes the body to an increased risk of infection, disease and scar formation. During wound healing, the cells in the topmost layer of the skin, called keratinocytes, move in from the edges of the wound to close the gap. This helps to restore the skin barrier.</p><p>Previous research has shown that the mechanical forces experienced by keratinocytes play a role in wound closure. Several proteins, called mechanosensors, perceive these forces and instruct the cells what to do. Until now, it was unclear what kind of mechanosensors control wound healing.</p><p>To find out more, Holt et al. studied a recently discovered mechanosensor (for which co-author Ardem Pataputian received the Nobel Prize in 2021), called Piezo1, using genetically engineered mice. The experiments revealed that skin wounds in mice without Piezo1 in their keratinocytes healed faster than mice with normal levels of Piezo1. In contrast, skin wounds of mice with increased levels of Piezo1 in their keratinocytes healed slower than mice with normal levels of Piezo1. The same pattern held true for keratinocytes grown in the laboratory that had been treated with chemicals to increase the activity of Piezo1.</p><p>To better understand how Piezo1 slows wound healing, Holt et al. tracked its location inside the keratinocytes. This revealed that the position of Piezo1 changes over time. It builds up near the edge of the wound in some places, and at those regions makes the cells move backwards rather than forwards. In extreme cases, an increased activity of Piezo1 can cause an opening of the wound instead of closing it.</p><p>These findings have the potential to guide research into new wound treatments. But first, scientists must confirm that blocking Piezo1 would not cause side effects, like reducing the sensation of touch. Moreover, it would be interesting to see if Piezo1 also plays a role in other important processes, such as development or certain diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group

barrier against a myriad of external insults while also performing important sensory and homeostatic functions. Cutaneous wounds interfere with all these functions and expose the body to an increased risk of infection, disease, and scar formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2013</xref>). During the repair of wounded skin, the migration of keratinocytes from the wound edge into the wound bed plays an essential step in re-establishing the epithelial barrier and restoring its protective functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirfel and Herzog, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gantwerker and Hom, 2011</xref>). Accumulating evidence has shown that mechanical cues and cell-generated traction forces in keratinocytes play an important role in regulating the healing process and wound closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosińczuk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brugués, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hiroyasu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ladoux and Mège, 2017</xref>). However, the molecular identity of keratinocyte mechanotransducers that control re-epithelialization remains unknown.</p><p>Cells are able to sense and detect mechanical forces, converting them into biochemical signals through the process of mechanotransduction. One class of mechanosensors utilized by cells are mechanically activated ion channels which offer the unique ability for cells to rapidly detect and transduce mechanical forces into electrochemical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nourse and Pathak, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>). The Piezo1 ion channel has been shown to play an important role in a variety of cell types, and it regulates several key biological processes including vascular and lymphatic development, red blood cell volume regulation, stem cell fate, the baroreceptor response, cardiovascular homeostasis, cartilage mechanics, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pathak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rocio Servin-Vences et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nonomura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rode et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies in MDCK cells and in zebrafish larvae have demonstrated the importance of the channel in homeostatic regulation of epithelial cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gudipaty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eisenhoffer et al., 2012</xref>). As yet, the role of Piezo1 in skin wound healing, an important epithelial function, has not been investigated. We asked whether PIEZO1 may function as a mechanosensor regulating keratinocyte re-epithelialization during the wound healing process. Here, we show that PIEZO1 activity increases cellular retraction, reducing the efficiency of keratinocyte migration and wound healing, and that inhibition of PIEZO1 results in faster wound healing in vitro and in vivo. The channel exhibits dynamic changes in its subcellular localization, concentrating at areas of the wound edge and causing local retraction at these regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reduced PIEZO1 accelerates wound healing</title><p>Analysis of <italic>Piezo</italic> channel mRNA expression in mouse tissues has previously shown that <italic>Piezo1</italic> is highly expressed in skin, while <italic>Piezo2</italic> is less abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coste et al., 2010</xref>).

Conversely, scratch closure in monolayers of <italic>Piezo1</italic>-GoF keratinocytes was significantly slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, middle). Correspondingly, when the PIEZO1 agonist Yoda1 was added to healing Control<sub>cKO</sub> monolayers at concentrations greater than 2 μM, scratch wound closure was also significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), further supporting PIEZO1 involvement in re-epithelialization.

To assess directional persistence, we performed direction autocorrelation analysis, a robust measure of migration directionality that, unlike the more commonly used directionality ratio analysis, is not confounded by differences in migration speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gorelik and Gautreau, 2014</xref>). The direction autocorrelation function for trajectories from <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO keratinocytes decayed slower than for littermate Control<sub>cKO</sub> cells, indicative of fewer turns and a straighter trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The average instantaneous speed calculated by DiPer analysis was higher for <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO cells relative to littermate Control<sub>cKO</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO keratinocytes migrate significantly faster and straighter.

To systematically assess the relationship between PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment and wound edge dynamics, we used kymographs to graphically represent PIEZO1-tdTomato position over the imaging period from regions that displayed PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment at the wound edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>) and compared them to control fields of view that showed no such channel enrichment throughout the videos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>). PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment events at the wound edge appeared as linear streaks in the kymographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, left panel) which could be objectively identified by Kymobutler, a deep-learning-based kymograph analysis software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jakobs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, middle and right panels). For the kymographs from control fields of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>), Kymobutler did not detect any tracks and we did not observe retraction of the wound edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In fields of view that exhibited PIEZO1-tdTomato puncta enrichment at the wound edge, this channel enrichment was followed by a localized retraction of the wound edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). Kymobutler analysis of PIEZO1-tdTomato tracks overlaid on the DIC kymographs allowed examination of the migration dynamics of the wound edge in relation to Piezo1 enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>); 72% of these PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment tracks displayed a negative slope corresponding to cell edge retraction and aligned with retraction events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In some fields of view, PIEZO1 enrichment and the accompanying retraction lasted for shorter periods of time, and the periods without channel enrichment were accompanied by wound edge protrusion. In other cases, channel enrichment was maintained for several hours and was accompanied by a sustained and overt retraction of the wound edge throughout that period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>). Thus, enrichment of PIEZO1-tdTomato puncta resulted in wound edge retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Importantly, the rear end of single migrating cells, where PIEZO1 is found to localize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), is also the site of cellular retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petrie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yam, 2007</xref>), suggesting a general relationship between PIEZO1 localization and retraction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PIEZO1 activation causes cellular retraction</title><p>To examine the relationship between PIEZO1 activity and cellular retraction, we examined the effect of chemical activation of PIEZO1 by Yoda1. We first focused on cellular dynamics of single, migrating Control<sub>cKO</sub> keratinocytes by imaging at a high spatiotemporal resolution. Using DIC imaging, we monitored migrating keratinocytes at 5 second intervals under control conditions and after Yoda1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). Kymographs were used to visualize changes in the cell edge position over time. We observed that under control conditions, the cell edge displayed cycles of protrusion and retraction which was expected since cell migration is known to progress by iterative cycles of protrusion and retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giannone et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giannone et al., 2007</xref>). PIEZO1 activation by 4 μM Yoda1 greatly affected these cycles and resulted in an extremely dynamic cell edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>).

To more objectively investigate the effect that PIEZO1 activation has on cell morphodynamics, cells were segmented for each frame of a DIC time-lapse series for the following conditions: Control<sub>cKO</sub> cells before and after Yoda1 addition, <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO cells, Control<sub>GoF</sub> cells, and <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). By comparing segmented outlines between frames, we could obtain the velocity of the cell edge at every position along the detected boundaries for protrusion events (positive velocities) and retraction events (negative velocities). Yoda1 treatment resulted in a significant increase in edge velocities compared to DMSO-treated Control<sub>cKO</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Yoda1, which is expected to globally activate PIEZO1 channels, resulted in an increase of cell edge velocity during both protrusion and retraction events, though the increase in retraction velocity was greater. In contrast, <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO keratinocytes showed a reduction in edge velocities relative to littermate Control<sub>cKO</sub> cells. Heatmaps of cell edge velocity illustrate the robustness of this response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Consistent with our observations of Yoda1 treatment, <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF keratinocytes also showed a significant increase in edge velocities relative to littermate Control<sub>GoF</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, there was a clear increase in the proportion of retracting positions relative to protruding positions in GoF keratinocytes. These results reveal that PIEZO1 activity regulates cell edge dynamics and further support our observations that PIEZO1 activity increases cellular retraction.</p><p>We then asked whether PIEZO1-mediated retraction events observed in single cells are relevant in the context of a wounded cell monolayer. We generated scratch wounds in keratinocyte monolayers and performed DIC time-lapse imaging of the healing monolayer in the presence and absence of 4 μM Yoda1. Monolayers of control keratinocytes advanced forward into the cell-free space under DMSO-treated control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video5">Figure 5—video 5</xref>), while the presence of 4 μM Yoda1 increased retraction events which prevented the monolayer from advancing far into the wound bed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video5">Figure 5—video 5</xref>). Remarkably, in 35% of fields of view monitored in scratch assays we observed that Yoda1 treatment resulted in an increase in scratch area instead of wound closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). In <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO monolayers we observed cells protrude forward into the cell-free space to close scratch wounds to a greater extent than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video6">Figure 5—video 6</xref>), while GoF monolayers did so to a lower extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video7">Figure 5—video 7</xref>). Additionally, no effect of Yoda1 addition was seen on the rate of advancement in kymographs taken at the wound edge of <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Collectively, our results show that PIEZO1 activity increases cellular retraction in keratinocytes, both in single cells and monolayers, which has a net effect on cell migration.</p><p>Taken together, our results demonstrate that PIEZO1 induces cellular retraction to slow single and collective cell migration and thus causes delayed wound healing. We propose that dynamic enrichment of the channel protein serves to locally amplify channel activity and the downstream retraction events. In wound healing monolayers of keratinocytes, PIEZO1 enrichment and the subsequent wound edge retraction provide a molecular mechanism for how PIEZO1 slows wound healing, while absence of the channel accelerates wound healing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that epidermal-specific <italic>Piezo1</italic> knockout resulted in faster wound healing in mice, and conversely a <italic>Piezo1</italic>-GoF mutation slowed wound healing. We recapitulate this observation in vitro, and show through a combination of orthogonal assays in single cells and in monolayers that PIEZO1 activity modulated by dynamic spatial reorganization of the channel protein slows keratinocyte cell migration during re-epithelialization. These findings provide physiological evidence for the role of a mechanically activated ion channel in wound healing and suggest potential therapeutics through a targeted inhibition of PIEZO1, perhaps applied topically, that could help speed wound healing, potentially reducing risk of infection. However, further in-depth analysis regarding the quality of wound healing following PIEZO1 inhibition is required. Given that speedy wound healing affords an evolutionary advantage and that PIEZO1 activity slows wound healing, a puzzling question arises regarding the role of PIEZO1 expression in keratinocytes. Perhaps, there is an advantage to slower healing in the presence of PIEZO1, or the channel is important for other functions in keratinocytes. Consistent with the latter idea, a recent study by Moehring et al. reports that keratinocyte PIEZO1 is critical for sensory afferent firing and behavioral responses to innocuous and noxious mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moehring et al., 2020</xref>). As such, it would also be important to determine that inhibiting Piezo1 to speed wound healing does not have detrimental effects on normal mechanosensation.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals control many aspects of cell migration, including lamellipodial dynamics, traction force generation, rear retraction, focal adhesion turnover, and migration directionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canales et al., 2019</xref>). While mechanically activated ion channels were proposed to contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in single cell migration in vitro as early as 20 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doyle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsai and Meyer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patkunarajah et al., 2020</xref>), many important questions have remained unanswered, including those related to channel identity, functional effects in collective cell migration, and physiological contribution during wound healing. Using chemical activation as well as genetic modulation of PIEZO1, we provide evidence for its involvement in regulating cellular retraction events in single cells as well as in collective cell migration during keratinocyte re-epithelialization.</p><p>Notably, the effects we observed on scratch wound closure and cell edge retraction speeds following Yoda1 activation of PIEZO1 were consistently larger than the effects of <italic>Piezo1</italic>-GoF mutation. This is not surprising as the GoF mutation increases ion flux through PIEZO1 channels, without significantly affecting channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glogowska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, channel activation in GoF keratinocytes is expected to occur based on subcellular localization of PIEZO1 and of the cellular forces that activate them. In contrast, Yoda1 treatment would globally activate PIEZO1 channels in the plasma membrane, leading to a larger effect.</p><p>One of the most surprising findings to emerge from our studies is the highly dynamic nature of the spatial localization of PIEZO1 channels in migrating cells. Based on this finding, we propose a novel mechanism regulating cell migration wherein spatiotemporal enrichment of PIEZO1 channels serves to localize and amplify channel activity, and regulate contractile forces, to spatially control cellular retraction events. Piezo1 has been implicated in cell migration in different cell types in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maneshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McHugh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chubinskiy-Nadezhdin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2020</xref>); however, reports of the effect of the channel on migration have varied in the literature, with channel activity supporting migration in some cell types and inhibiting migration in others. Perhaps, a determining factor of the channel’s impact on cell migration is how spatiotemporal localization of the channel is regulated in a given cell type.</p><p>Our observations spark several new questions regarding the regulation and functional impacts of PIEZO1’s localization and clustering dynamics. Interestingly, molecular dynamics simulations of PIEZO1 suggest that interactions between neighboring PIEZO1 channels may enable cooperative gating between channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). Clustering of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL has also been reported, but computational simulations predict these clusters in fact decrease channel open probability, providing a defence against unwanted channel gating that may cause osmotic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paraschiv et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grage et al., 2011</xref>). Experimental evidence for functional interaction between PIEZO1 channels remains pending and two recent patch clamp studies examining this question come to divergent conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewis and Grandl, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wijerathne et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that retraction during cell migration occurs due to force generated by myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cramer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ridley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>), and we previously showed that myosin II-mediated cellular traction forces elicit localized Piezo1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> flickers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellefsen et al., 2019</xref>). Since myosin II activation is enhanced by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Somlyo and Somlyo, 2003</xref>), we speculate that Piezo1 may induce cellular retraction through a feedforward loop between Piezo1 and myosin II: traction force generation by myosin II cause Piezo1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which in turn may increase myosin II phosphorylation and force generation through the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated Myosin Light Chain Kinase. Enrichment of Piezo1 in subcellular regions would amplify this effect and result in a localized retraction. Supporting this model, Piezo1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were recently found to elicit retraction of developing endothelial tip cells during vascular pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Efficient migration requires protrusion of the cell lamellipodia which is stabilized via the formation of focal adhesions. Without stabilization, lamellipodia protrusions retract backward causing membrane ruffling and reducing migration speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borm et al., 2005</xref>). We observe an increase in cell edge velocity in keratinocytes with increased PIEZO1 activity (in both <italic>Piezo1</italic>-GoF and Yoda1-treated cells) indicating that PIEZO1-mediated effects on cell edge velocity may be the predominant mechanism contributing to inefficient migration. An intriguing paradox observed in our data is that both <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO and <italic>Piezo1</italic>-GoF keratinocytes exhibit straighter migration trajectories. We also observe that PIEZO1 localization and increased activity appears linked to cell polarization; thus one possible explanation that warrants further study is that the GoF mutation stabilizes PIEZO1 clusters so that once the channels localize to the rear of the cell, the cell retains its polarization and migration directionality.</p><p>Cell migration involves a complex orchestration of events, including sub-cellular dynamics in which cytoskeletal processes in different compartments of the cell need to be implemented in a precise spatiotemporal order. How this is achieved remains an open question. Our findings suggest that spatiotemporal enrichment dynamics of Piezo1 play a role in this coordination. More broadly, our findings provide a mechanism by which nanoscale spatial dynamics of Piezo1 channels can control tissue-scale events, a finding with implications beyond wound healing to processes as diverse as development, homeostasis, disease, and repair.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The main findings are that loss of the Piezo1 protein in keratinocytes accelerates migration and wound healing, while genetic and pharmacological manipulations known to increase currents carried by Piezo1 slow migration and wound healing. The channels are shown to accumulate and cluster at the trailing edge of single migrating cells and at the wound margin during in vitro studies of wound healing. These findings demonstrate that Piezo1 mechanosensitive channels function as essential regulators of the speed of both migration and would healing. Furthermore, the findings suggest that increased flux through Piezo1 channels slows migration and wound healing. These channels are found to cluster in migrating cells and at wound margins. The conclusions are well-supported by the data and the authors' composition does an outstanding job of recognizing the limits of what has been learned and what remains uncertain.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Spatiotemporal dynamics of PIEZO1 localization controls keratinocyte migration during wound healing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The controls used in Figure 1E and H appear to be different from each other which, makes it difficult to interpret the overall effect of the <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO or <italic>Piezo1</italic>-GoF genotypes. For example, the <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF keratinocytes in 1H do not appear to be very different from the WT control keratinocytes in 1E. This is also true of the <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO cells in 1E compared to the WT control cells in 1H. Why are these control groups so different? The reviewers are concerned that it may be difficult to draw conclusions about the deletion or enhancement of PIEZO1 in a set of animals, when the control variability is so great. Perhaps the background strain or something else about the animal contributes to the significant differences reported. Please comment on this.</p><p>2. There are some inconsistencies with the cohorts and controls used in certain experiments. In Figure 1J the authors utilize both the <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO and <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF cells for their in vivo experiments but when switching to an in vitro model they only test the <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO keratinocytes. It is not clear why the <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF cells are not included in Figure 1L to better correspond with the in vivo data. There is no rational given for why the authors instead utilized Yoda1. Additionally, it is unclear why there are so few keratinocytes in the Yoda1 experiment. In Figure 3D and E, it is unclear why the authors have not utilized the <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO keratinocytes as controls. The reviewers agree that the GoF mutants (ideally) or Yoda treatments with the appropriate controls should be added to many experiments, including Figure 1L, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4.</p><p>3. Related to the point above, the authors utilize 4 μM yoda1 throughout the manuscript however the rationale for this specific concentration is unclear. A Yoda1 concentration response experiment with WT and <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO keratinocytes would be beneficial in at least the first sets of Yoda1 experiments in order to determine if the observed effects are dependent on the level of PIEZO1 activation and to control for Yoda1 specificity.</p><p>4. The data shown in Figure 3 appear robust; however, it would be appropriate if authors quantify, compile, and compare the slope of the descending white lines denoting the velocity of retraction of independent experiments, for example. One suggestion is to plot the paired data (before and after addition of Yoda1) to demonstrate that indeed this increase in velocity happens most of the time in the wild-type but not in the cKO.</p><p>5. The experiment shown on Figure 4 appears to lack experimental control(s), especially because the results from it are used to derive the conclusion &quot;PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment and activity induces cellular retraction&quot;. Experiments could include inhibition of PIEZO1 and/or enhancement (chemically or genetically). Alternatively, the authors could monitor another excitatory cation channel, for instance, demonstrating that, unlike Piezo1, its function or localization does not correlate with cellular retraction.</p><p>6. The specific statistical tests and post hoc comparisons used in each data panel should be indicated for every figure in the figure legend. The authors should consider estimation statistics to evaluate the effect size along with conventional significance measures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65415.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

In the revised manuscript we have included additional data as requested:</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>– We have included data from Piezo1-GoF keratinocytes and corresponding littermate Controls for in vitro wound healing experiments. Consistent with our in vivo results, we observe that monolayers of <italic>Piezo1</italic>-GoF keratinocytes close scratches significantly slower compared to those made in littermate control cells. These results have been included in revised Figure 1L (<italic>middle</italic>) and the Results section (lines 136-137) has been updated to include “Conversely, scratch closure in monolayers of <italic>Piezo1</italic>-GoF keratinocytes was significantly slower (Figure 1L, <italic>middle</italic>).”</p><p>– We have increased the number of keratinocyte scratch assays treated with Yoda1 and these results can be found in updated Figure 1L (<italic>right</italic>).</p><p>– We have also included experiments utilizing <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO keratinocytes as controls for Yoda1 treatment (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B) and included this sentence in the revised manuscript (lines 140-142): “No effect on wound closure was observed when <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO monolayers were treated with Yoda1 indicating that inhibition of scratch closure is the result of PIEZO1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B).”</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>– We have included data from the <italic>Piezo1</italic>-GoF keratinocytes for the single cell tracking assay. We observed that <italic>Piezo1</italic>-GoF cells migrated slower than littermate controls. They also migrate straighter than littermate controls, resulting in no marked difference in the MSD. These results can be found in updated Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplements 2 and 3, and Figure 2—Video 2. We revised the Results section to include these new results (lines 185-190):</p><p>“Similarly, we performed the same experiments and extracted cell migration trajectories from single keratinocytes harvested from <italic>Piezo1</italic>-GoF and littermate Control<sub>GoF</sub> mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—Video 2). We observed no difference in the MSD plots of <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF keratinocytes and littermate control cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). However, separating the data into directionality and speed, <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF cells moved straighter (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) and slower (Figure 2E).”</p><p>Figure 3 (Figure 5 in the revised manuscript):</p><p>– We have included results from <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF keratinocytes to visualize edge dynamics and changes in cell position over time. This has been included for both single cell migration (Figure 5C-D, Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Figure 5—Video 4) as well as for wound-healing monolayers (Figure 5—figure supplement 3 and Figure 5—Video 7). We have revised the manuscript text with:</p><p>For data from single GoF keratinocytes (lines 343-345):</p><p>“Additionally, kymographs of <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF keratinocytes also showed an increase in cell edge dynamics compared to littermate Control<sub>GoF</sub> cells further supporting PIEZO1’s role in retraction (Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Figure 5—Video 4).”</p><p>For data from GoF keratinocyte monolayers (lines 371-374):</p><p>“In <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO monolayers we observed cells protrude forward into the cell-free space to close scratch wounds to a greater extent than controls (Figure 5H, Figure 5—Video 6), while GoF monolayers did so to a lower extent (Figure 5—figure supplement 3, Figure 5—Video 7).”</p><p>– We have also included the <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO wound-healing monolayers as controls in our updated manuscript, without (Figure 5H) and with Yoda1 (Figure 5—figure supplement 4, Figure 5-Video 3). We observed that the cKO monolayers migrate into the wound area faster than controls and Yoda1 has no effect on this. We have updated the Results section (lines 371-376) by stating:</p><p>“In <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO monolayers we observed cells protrude forward into the cell-free space to close scratch wounds to a greater extent than controls (Figure 5H, Figure 5—Video 6), while GoF monolayers did so to a lower extent (Figure 5—figure supplement 3, Figure 5—Video 7). Additionally, no effect of Yoda1 addition was seen on the rate of advancement in kymographs taken at the wound edge of <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO monolayers (Figure 5—figure supplement 4).”</p><p>Figure 4 (split between Figures 3 and 4 in the revised manuscript)</p><p>– Our results demonstrating PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment at the rear of single migrating cells suggest that PIEZO1 may underlie cell polarization during migration. In the revised manuscript we have investigated this possibly by using unbiased cellular morphometrics. Based on the observed localization pattern of PIEZO1-tdTomato, we hypothesized that <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO and <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF keratinocytes would display different cell shapes compared to littermate controls. We find that knocking out PIEZO1 reduced cell polarization while the GoF PIEZO1 increased the occurrence of highly polarized shapes. These results are now included in Figure 3, and the revised manuscript includes this description (lines 201-217):</p><p>“This observation of PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment at the rear of single migrating cells suggest that PIEZO1 may underlie cell polarization during migration.</p><p>To determine whether PIEZO1 may be responsible for generating the polarized shape, we performed cellular morphometrics on the single cell images obtained from the above time-lapse imaging of single cell migration. We used visually-aided morpho-phenotyping recognition (VAMPIRE) (Phillip et al., 2021), a high-throughput machine-learning algorithm that analyzes the morphology of individual cells in a population by quantifying shape modes of segmented cells and showing the level of correlation between the shape modes through a dendrogram (Figure 3 B, C). VAMPIRE classification of the <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO and littermate Control<sub>cKO</sub> keratinocytes into 20 shape modes revealed that <italic>Piezo1</italic>-cKO reduced the proportion of highly polarized shapes and increased the proportion of weakly polarized shapes relative to littermate Control<sub>cKO</sub> keratinocytes (Figure 3D, E). On the other hand, the GoF mutation increased the frequency of polarized and highly polarized shapes at the expense of unpolarized or weakly polarized cell shapes (Figure 3F, G). Taken together, these results indicate that PIEZO1 activity promotes cell polarization. Based on imaging the localization of endogenous PIEZO1 channels in migrating cells, it appears that this may be mediated by regulation of the channel’s subcellular localization.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Related to the point above, the authors utilize 4 μM yoda1 throughout the manuscript however the rationale for this specific concentration is unclear. A Yoda1 concentration response experiment with WT and <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO keratinocytes would be beneficial in at least the first sets of Yoda1 experiments in order to determine if the observed effects are dependent on the level of PIEZO1 activation and to control for Yoda1 specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we performed a Yoda1 concentration curve using Control<sub>cKO</sub> and <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO keratinocytes and have included the results in new Figure 1—figure supplement 3. We observe that Yoda1 has an effect on inhibiting wound closure at concentrations greater than 2 μM and we have stated this in the updated Results section. We also confirmed the specificity of Yoda1 by treating <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO monolayers with the highest concentration we tested, 4μM.</p><p>The Results section of the manuscript (lines 137-142) has been updated with these results by adding that:</p><p>“Correspondingly, when the PIEZO1 agonist Yoda1 was added to healing Control<sub>cKO</sub> monolayers at concentrations greater than 2 μM, scratch wound closure was also significantly impaired (Figure 1L, right, Figure 1—figure supplement 3A), further supporting PIEZO1 involvement in re-epithelialization. No effect on wound closure was observed when <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO monolayers were treated with Yoda1 indicating that inhibition of scratch closure is the result of PIEZO1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The data shown in Figure 3 appear robust; however, it would be appropriate if authors quantify, compile, and compare the slope of the descending white lines denoting the velocity of retraction of independent experiments, for example. One suggestion is to plot the paired data (before and after addition of Yoda1) to demonstrate that indeed this increase in velocity happens most of the time in the wild-type but not in the cKO.</p></disp-quote><p>(Figure 3 from the previous version is now Figure 5 in the revised manuscript)</p><p>As the reviewers suggested, we quantified and compared the slope of the descending white lines denoting the velocity of retraction in the shown kymographs. This quantification can be found in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C. Since this quantification only represents behavior of one point along a single cell for each condition, we performed additional analyses to more objectively and rigorously quantify PIEZO1’s effect on cellular retraction. For this, we segmented migrating keratinocytes from the DIC timelapse videos. Using these segmented images we then used the open source software ADAPT to quantify cellular morphodynamics before and after Yoda1 addition in Control<sub>cKO</sub>, and in <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO, Control<sub>GoF</sub> and <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF cells. This method allows for a robust and unbiased approach as it quantifies the velocity at every point along the detected cell boundary at every time point of a time lapse series. This quantification supports and greatly strengthens our initial observation linking PIEZO1 activity to cell edge velocity and retraction rates.</p><p>We have included these results in new Figure 5C-E and the Results section (lines 346-362) has been updated with the addition of:</p><p>“Kymograph quantitation is limited to one point along the cell edge. To more objectively investigate the effect that PIEZO1 activation has on cell morphodynamics, cells were segmented for each frame of DIC time-lapse series for the following conditions: Control<sub>cKO</sub> cells before and after Yoda1 addition, <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO cells, Control<sub>GoF</sub> cells and <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF keratinocytes (Figure 5C). By comparing segmented outlines between frames we could obtain the velocity of the cell edge at every position along the detected boundaries for protrusion events (positive velocities) and retraction events (negative velocities). Yoda1 treatment resulted in a significant increase in edge velocities relative to DMSO-treated Control<sub>cKO</sub> cells (Figure 5D). In contrast, <italic>Piezo1-</italic>cKO keratinocytes showed a reduction in edge velocities relative to litter-mate Control<sub>cKO</sub> cells. Yoda1, which is expected to globally activate PIEZO1 channels, resulted in an increase of cell edge velocity during both protrusion and retraction events, though the increase in retraction velocity was greater. Heatmaps of cell edge velocity illustrate the robustness of this response (Figure 5E). Consistent with our observations of Yoda1 treatment, <italic>Piezo1-</italic>GoF keratinocytes also showed a significant increase in edge velocities relative to littermate Control<sub>GoF</sub> (Figure 5D, Figure 5—figure supplement 2). In addition, there was a clear increase in the proportion of retracting positions relative to protruding positions in GoF keratinocytes. These results reveal that PIEZO1 activity regulates cell edge dynamics and further support our observations that PIEZO1 activity increases cellular retraction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Alternatively, the authors could monitor another excitatory cation channel, for instance, demonstrating that, unlike Piezo1, its function or localization does not correlate with cellular retraction.</p></disp-quote><p><underline><italic>– The experiment shown on Figure 4 appears to lack experimental control(s):</italic></underline> We realize that our description of this section may have been unclear. For these measurements, we ask: do regions displaying PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment migrate differently from regions without enrichment? Thus, the regions without PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment serve as Controls for regions displaying PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment. By comparing monolayer edge advancement in the Control and enriched regions, we can directly examine the relationship between channel enrichment and monolayer edge retraction. We have now revised the text in the Results section (lines 274-280) to be clearer:</p><p>“We asked whether regions displaying PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment migrate differently from regions without enrichment. To systematically assess the relationship between PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment and wound edge dynamics, we used kymographs to graphically represent PIEZO1-tdTomato position over the imaging period from regions that displayed PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment at the wound edge (Figure 4 C, 4E,Figure 4—Video 1) and compared them to control regions that showed no such channel enrichment throughout the videos (Figure 4B, 4D, Figure 4—Video 2).”</p><p><underline><italic>– Authors could monitor another excitatory cation channel, for instance, demonstrating that, unlike Piezo1, its function or localization does not correlate with cellular retraction:</italic></underline> The experiments visualizing PIEZO1 localization were made possible by the existence of the PIEZO1-tdTomato mouse (Ranade et al., PNAS 2014), wherein the endogenous PIEZO1 channel is fused to a tdTomato reporter protein. Performing an analogous experiment for other cation channels would require first investigating the expression of candidate channels in keratinocytes, and then obtaining or making an engineered mouse, harvesting keratinocytes, and imaging channel localization over several hours. These are challenging studies that we believe are beyond the scope of this study. Additionally, the fact that PIEZO1 localization correlates with cellular retraction does not necessarily preclude the contributions of other channels.</p><p><italic><underline>– Experiments could include inhibition of Piezo1 and/or enhancement (chemically or genetically):</underline></italic> We would have really liked to image PIEZO1-tdTomato dynamics in healing monolayers in the presence of Yoda1 or GsMTx-4 as suggested by the reviewers. However, determining whether enrichment events are increased or decreased in drug-treated healing monolayers would be extremely difficult to interpret due to the stochastic nature of enrichment dynamics and the long imaging times. Appropriate interpretation of the data would require quantitation of channel localization dynamics through a custom-built image analysis pipeline, which would have been a major feat outside of the scope of this study.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that our results from Figure 4 alone do not support the conclusion &quot;PIEZO1-tdTomato enrichment and activity induces cellular retraction&quot;. To more precisely summarize the insights from revised Figures 4 and 5 we have replaced the sentence with (lines 379-382):</p><p>“Taken together, our results demonstrate that PIEZO1 induces cellular retraction to slow single and collective cell migration and thus causes delayed wound healing. We propose that dynamic enrichment of the channel protein serves to locally amplify channel activity and the downstream retraction events.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Following the recommendation of the reviewers, we have transitioned to using estimation statistics and Cumming plots to represent our data and visualize the effect size of our results. We generated these plots using the freely available software on https://www.estimationstats.com/#/ based on the publication from Ho et al., 2019 (DOI: 10.1038/s41592-019-0470-3). These plots show both groups plotted on the upper raw data axes. The raw data is aligned vertically with a forest plot allowing for the visual and statistical comparison of the Cohen’s d for each condition. We have also stated the exact Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> value and <italic>p</italic> values in each legend description.</p><p>We have revised the Statistical Analysis subsection of the Methods section (lines 829-839) to describe these changes:</p><p>“Statistical Analysis</p><p>Sample sizes are indicated in corresponding figures. Cumming estimation plots were generated and Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> in all plots (except Figure 5D) was calculated using an online estimation stats tool (https://www.estimationstats.com). Estimation plots show the raw data plotted on the upper axes with bars beside each group denoting the sample mean ± s.d.; the mean difference and Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> effect size is plotted on the lower axes. On the lower plot, the mean difference is depicted as a dot; the 95% confidence interval is indicated by the ends of the bold vertical error bar. OriginPro 2020 (OriginLab Corporation) was used for calculating <italic>p</italic> values (for all figures except for Figure 5D) and generating plots used in Figure 1B, 2B-D, 3D-G, 4G, 5D, Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 2—figure supplements 1-3. All plots generated in OriginLab are presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical tests used to calculate <italic>p</italic> values are indicated in figure legends. For Figure 5D, a Python script was used for calculating Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> and <italic>p</italic> values.”</p><p>In view of the extensive new results included in our resubmitted manuscript we have also revised the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
