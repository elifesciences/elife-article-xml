Cervical cancer disproportionally affects regions with limited access to preventive measures. PAVE aims to assess a novel screening-triage-treatment strategy integrating self-sampled HPV testing, deep-learning-based automated visual evaluation (AVE), and targeted therapies.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Phase 1 efficacy involves screening up to 100,000 women aged 25–49 across nine countries, using self-collected vaginal samples for hierarchical HPV evaluation: HPV16, else HPV18/45, else HPV31/33/35/52/58, else HPV39/51/56/59/68 else negative. HPV-positive individuals undergo further evaluation, including pelvic exams, cervical imaging, and biopsies. AVE algorithms analyze images, assigning risk scores for precancer, validated against histologic high-grade precancer. Phase 1, however, does not integrate AVE results into patient management, contrasting them with local standard care.</p><p>Phase 2 effectiveness focuses on deploying AVE software and HPV genotype data in real-time clinical decision-making, evaluating feasibility, acceptability, cost-effectiveness, and health communication of the PAVE strategy in practice.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Currently, sites have commenced fieldwork, and conclusive results are pending.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The study aspires to validate a screen-triage-treat protocol utilizing innovative biomarkers to deliver an accurate, feasible, and cost-effective strategy for cervical cancer prevention in resource-limited areas. Should the study validate PAVE, its broader implementation could be recommended, potentially expanding cervical cancer prevention worldwide.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>The consortial sites are responsible for their own study costs.

Globally, cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection with one of ~13 carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schiffman et al., 2007</xref>). Cervical cancer rates vary greatly worldwide due to uneven access to effective preventive measures; nearly 85% of cervical cancer cases and almost 90% of cervical cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">IARC, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferlay et al., 2020</xref>). The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for the global elimination of cervical cancer, based on an advanced understanding of the natural history of the causal carcinogenic types of cervical HPV infection and the existence of effective preventive technologies, including prophylactic HPV vaccination and cervical screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schiffman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">World Health Organization, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">WHO, 2020</xref>). However, translation of the HPV-based prevention methods has not yet occurred in many LMICs.</p><p>While prophylactic vaccination will eventually decrease cervical cancer rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lei et al., 2020</xref>) if high uptake can be achieved in LMIC, the maximum potential health benefits of vaccinating adolescents today will not be achieved for 40 years. However, the rapid implementation of a broad, effective cervical screening campaign for adult women in the highest-burden areas will advance cancer control by 20 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The U.S. Cancer Moonshot initiative for Accelerated Control of Cervical Cancer has supported development of the new screening methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perkins et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Timing and deaths averted with one-time prevention campaigns: vaccination only, screening only, or both.</title><p>Projection of the relative timing of health benefits, measured as deaths averted, accrued by vaccination and/or screening applied through one-time campaigns. Three scenarios were examined: (1) a one-time screening campaign providing effective management for approximately 25% of 30- to 49-year-old women in 2027 (i.e. 20 birth cohorts) (green line); (2) vaccinating 90% of 9- to 14-year-old girls in 2027 (i.e. six birth cohorts) with a bivalent HPV16/18 vaccination (orange line); and (3) both a screening campaign and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for respective birth cohorts in 2027 (blue line). We considered cervical cancer deaths averted over the lifetime of cohorts subject to the intervention, and conservatively assumed that deaths averted due to screening would only occur after age 50, to account for prevalent cancers. Projections were developed for the ~65 low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) with age-standardized cervical cancer incidence greater than 10 per 100,000 women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perkins et al., 2023</xref>). For each country, we assumed that, in the absence of any intervention, the number of cervical cancer deaths for each 5 year age group would apply each year for the lifetime of the selected birth cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perkins et al., 2023</xref>). We conservatively and crudely assumed that screening and management would avert 25% of cervical cancer deaths (equivalent to screening uptake of 40% of eligible women, with 62.5% of screen-positive women receiving appropriate management) beginning at age 50 years. For vaccination cohorts, we assumed that a bivalent HPV16/18 vaccine (i.e. against the genotypes responsible for 70% of cervical cancers) with 90% uptake would avert 63% of cervical cancer deaths. While data on the costs of implementing novel screening strategies and single-dose HPV vaccination for female adolescents are forthcoming from the HPV-automated visual evaluation (PAVE) consortium and single-dose vaccination studies, we crudely assumed a single vaccine dose cost US$4.50<sup>31</sup> with an average financial delivery cost per dose (i.e. per fully immunized girl) of US$7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akumbom et al., 2022</xref>). We assumed a bundled financial cost per woman screened of US$15, including a low-cost rapid HPV genotyping assay with triage and treatment of screen-positive women. According to our projections, the number of interventions needed to avert one cervical cancer death was similar for HPV vaccination and screening (i.e. 278 for HPV vaccination; 293 for screening). A one-time screening campaign for women aged 30–49 years in the selected countries yielded a financial cost of ~US$2.5 billion to avert ~570,000 deaths, or US$4,400 per death averted. On a similar order of magnitude, a one-time single-dose bivalent HPV vaccination campaign of girls aged 9–14 years in the same countries would cost ~US$2.0 billion and avert ~640,000 deaths, or US$3,200 per death averted. Of note, these ballpark estimates are undiscounted and do not account for cancer treatment cost offsets. We also did not consider demographic changes over the lifetime of intervention cohorts, nor did we consider the indirect benefits of vaccination or prevention of other HPV-related cancers.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91469-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Screening using HPV testing</title><p>The detection of carcinogenic cervical/vaginal HPV DNA is currently the most sensitive screening method to distinguish those with an appreciable risk of precancer or cancer from those at low risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demarco et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castle et al., 2012</xref>). The WHO currently recommends using either screen-treat or screen-triage-treat strategies. HPV testing is preferred to using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) as the primary screening method where resources permit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">World Health Organization, 2021</xref>). There is a growing consensus that to achieve broad screening coverage, HPV testing of self-collected cervicovaginal specimens would be optimal for many populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">IARC, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">World Health Organization, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perkins et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arbyn et al., 2018</xref>). The results from meta-analyses comparing the performance of self-collected to clinician-collected samples, using PCR-based HPV detection, showed similar sensitivity and specificity for the detection of cervical precancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arbyn et al., 2018</xref>). As of 2022, seven LMICs were recommending HPV self-collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Serrano et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>There is broad scientific agreement that HPV testing is the preferred screening method due to its high negative predictive value and reproducibility. Treatment of all HPV-positive women with thermal ablation (i.e. screen-treat strategy) is an option under current WHO guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">World Health Organization, 2021</xref>); however, this may substantially overtreat infections, only the minority of which would progress to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Demarco et al., 2020</xref>). To make the best use of limited resources and concentrate on those at the highest risk, triage strategies are critical to determine which HPV-positive women are at higher risk of cervical cancer. Triage with cytology or dual stain, as used in high-resource settings, is unlikely to be a feasible solution in the majority of low-resource settings. Cervical visual examination using visual techniques, including VIA, are often used as triage methods. However, these techniques are subject to human error, have low accuracy for precancer, and require continuous training and quality control measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Catarino et al., 2018</xref>). HPV genotyping is a newer, more accurate method of triage, as genotype carcinogenicity varies predictably across populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Qiao et al., 2008</xref>). HPV16 is the most carcinogenic, followed by HPV18/45, followed by HPV31/33/35/52/58, followed by HPV39/51/56/59/68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guan et al., 2012</xref>). AVE using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm shows promise as a relatively simple and fast triage method that could be used in conjunction with HPV genotyping to generate a highly accurate composite triage test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desai et al., 2022b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>HPV-AVE (PAVE) strategy</title><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) is currently leading a consortium of a multi-centric study designed to evaluate a novel cervical screening and triage strategy for resource-limited settings, including settings with high HIV prevalence, as part of a global strategy to reduce cervical cancer burden.

This algorithm aims to visually distinguish precancerous changes from lesser abnormalities, and classifies cervical images as normal, indeterminate, or precancer+. AVE results are assessed on repeatability (correct classification of replicate images of the same patient) and accuracy (correct classification of AVE based on histopathology, as well as minimization of extreme misclassification of normal as precancer or vice versa). Accuracy is defined as a correct classification of participants to &lt;precancer or precancer+. Precancer + is rigorously defined to include HPV-positive histologic CIN3, AIS, cancer, and CIN2 diagnoses confirmed by expert pathologic review and positive for the eight most carcinogenic HPV genotypes. CIN2 is qualified because although CIN2 is the threshold for treatment in most clinical practices worldwide, it is a less reproducible pathologic diagnosis and may regress without treatment, especially when associated with lower carcinogenicity HPV genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kylebäck et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The current prototype algorithm is the result of several years of development. Earlier algorithms were limited by poor repeatability, misclassification including grave errors (i.e. cases with precancer called normal or vice versa), overfitting, and lack of portability (defined as the ability of the algorithm to accurately classify images from different image capture devices and study settings other than the dataset on which it was trained) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desai et al., 2022b</xref>). Additional techniques have been applied to develop the prototype version of the AVE algorithm that will be refined and tested in the PAVE study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2023a</xref>), resulting in improved reliability and consistency of model predictions across repeat images from the same woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lemay et al., 2022</xref>). The disease classifier algorithm is trained using histology as the truth standard for defining the presence or absence of precancer. The outcome definition for the purpose of training a three-class ordinal classification algorithm includes normal (HPV-positive with histology normal, HPV-negative, HPV-negative cervicitis), indeterminate (low-grade HPV-related abnormalities, CIN1), and precancer+, as determined by histology among HPV-positives (defined above). To ensure portability, the algorithm will undergo external validation using datasets distinct from the training set of images. Early data indicate that while our algorithm may function among patients across diverse geographies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2023b</xref>) a dedicated device may be needed because AVE fails to transfer without retraining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parham et al., 2023</xref>).

When the efficacy phase is complete, if the PAVE algorithm outperforms the SOC, we will begin the effectiveness phase. Sites that chose to participate in the effectiveness phase will test the following screen-treat-triage protocol. Screening: self-sampled HPV testing with genotyping (ScreenFire or equivalent test). Triage of HPV-positive individuals: image collection using the Iris device, upon which the AI algorithms have been installed. The AI algorithms will guide the clinician in taking high-quality images (cervix identifier, image quality classifier) and then provide a disease classification score of normal, indeterminate, or precancer+ and an SCJ visibility assessment of fully visible, partially visible, or not visible. The clinician will then enter the HPV genotyping test result and the device will output a risk category using the strata in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> (lowest, low, medium, high, highest). The risk category and SCJ visibility assessment are designed as clinical management tools to aid clinicians in determining which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment, and among those needing treatment, whether ablation can be considered. This phase will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PAVE strategy in clinical practice.</p><sec id="s2-7-1"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p>To inform decision makers designing cervical cancer prevention programs in resource-limited settings, we will analyze the cost-effectiveness (i.e. cost per precancer detected) and affordability (the impact on a payer’s budget) of the PAVE strategy at several sites. Micro-costing efforts to estimate the cost of all resource ingredients used for a screening episode are underway with technical assistance provided to study sites. A microsimulation model of genotype-specific HPV natural history and cervical carcinogenesis is being developed specifically for evaluation of novel biomarker triage tests, including AVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campos et al., 2021</xref>). By adapting this natural history model to setting-specific HPV prevalence patterns (by genotype and age); overlaying screening, triage, and treatment strategies; and using setting-specific healthcare delivery data inputs for uptake, adherence to management, and costs, we will evaluate the cost per precancer detected by the PAVE strategy relative to SOC. We will explore the health and economic implications of applying different management approaches (e.g. triage, treatment, and follow-up) to different risk strata, depending on health system capacity.</p><p>The development of the microsimulation model and the micro-costing tools for the PAVE consortium will serve as the basis for estimating the real-world costs and health benefits of implementing novel screening and management strategies. These tools can be adapted to different settings, with refinement of management algorithms, health care delivery variables, and cost estimates as implementation and scale-up occur. An early exercise to approximate the potential costs and benefits of a highly effective screening campaign delivered to women aged 30–49 years in the ~65 highest burden LMIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferlay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">GAVI, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akumbom et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">World Bank, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and an HPV vaccination program delivered to girls ages 9–14 years found that the number of screening or adolescent HPV vaccinations needed to avert one cervical cancer death was similar for each intervention (i.e. 293 for screening; 278 for vaccination). Assuming a bundled cost of US$15 per woman screened and managed appropriately, a one-time screening campaign that achieves 40% uptake and ~60% adherence to recommended treatment for screen-positive women yielded a financial cost of ~US$2.5 billion to avert ~570,000 deaths, or US$4400 per death averted. On a similar order of magnitude, a one-time single-dose bivalent HPV vaccination campaign achieving 90% coverage of girls aged 9–14 years in the same countries (US$4.50 vaccine cost; US$7 delivery cost) would cost ~US$2.0 billion and avert ~640,000 deaths, or US$3200 per death averted. Of note, these ballpark estimates are undiscounted and do not account for cancer treatment cost offsets. While data are not yet available on the costs of implementing novel highly effective screening strategies for adult women and single-dose HPV vaccination for female adolescents, these data are forthcoming from the PAVE consortium and single-dose vaccination studies. Refining these cost and effectiveness estimates, and obtaining country-specific data, is a high priority and a critical component of the PAVE consortium objectives.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7-2"><title>Stakeholder knowledge and attitudes regarding cervical cancer prevention and screening interventions in the PAVE study</title><p>Effective dissemination and implementation of the PAVE strategy in the future will require clear and consistent strategies for communicating information to healthcare providers and patients. The field of HPV and screening is rapidly evolving and constantly being enriched with new scientific information. However, this influx of information can sometimes lead to unclear or conflicting messages, which in turn may diminish the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving screening rates and optimizing management strategies. Furthermore, both healthcare providers and patients can differ in their knowledge and perceptions of cervical cancer risk, tolerance of risk, and their personal values and attitudes regarding cervical cancer prevention and screening, all of which can influence the uptake of prevention strategies such as the PAVE strategy. To address these challenges, it will be necessary to provide healthcare providers with accurate, consistent information about the latest scientific advances and guidelines, and as well as training and tools that can help them effectively inform and engage patients in cervical cancer prevention and screening.</p><p>To address these needs and prepare for broader dissemination and implementation of the PAVE strategy, the Communication and Retention Workgroup is conducting a mixed-methods pilot study utilizing both qualitative interviews and survey questionnaires administered to scientific experts as well as key stakeholders—patients and healthcare providers—at four participating sites (Brazil, El Salvador, Nigeria, Tanzania). The specific objectives of this pilot study are to explore stakeholders’ knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes regarding cervical cancer prevention and screening, and their preferences for information and participation in decision-making. The study will generate evidence to enable the future development of effective, ethical strategies for engaging eligible members of LMIC communities in cervical cancer prevention and screening, including using the PAVE strategy.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Timeline and next steps</title><p>At the time of this writing, the study has been initiated in nine countries. It is expected that a preliminary interim analysis on the efficacy of the PAVE strategy will be completed by the early 2024, and field recruitment will be completed by end of 2024. The efficacy phase is designed to assess the validity of the PAVE protocol by refining the AVE protocol using histopathology specimens and demonstrate the superiority of PAVE for detecting precancer and minimizing unnecessary referrals compared to the SOC. Following the initial efficacy phase, the effectiveness phase is planned to examine additional factors including program feasibility, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>In the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, a schematic timeline of the project from proof of principle to the estimated final efficacy and effectiveness steps.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Estimated timeline of HPV-automated visual evaluation (PAVE) validation.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91469-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulatory considerations</title><p>The rapid advancement of AI in healthcare has prompted significant ethical and regulatory discussions. Global ethical principles specific to AI in healthcare are in development and are rapidly evolving, regulatory authorities such as the WHO and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are responsible for developing guidelines that ensure the safe, effective, and appropriate use of AI technologies in healthcare and therapeutic development. In addition to complying with existing ethical principles in medicine, AI solutions must demonstrate scientific validity, ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. It is imperative that AI technologies do not perpetuate discrimination or bias, or exclude specific population segments. One major concern is the potential creation of a permanent digital identity, linked to individuals' health and personal data, without obtaining proper consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">WHO, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">FDA, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The Iris device, used in PAVE, is an example of an AI-based system in healthcare. It will incorporate AI algorithms that aim to generate scores evaluating image quality, presence of precancerous lesions, and visibility of the SCJ based on digital cervix images. These scores provide additional information to assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions. To arrive at a comprehensive decision, the provider will need to integrate the HPV information, gynecological examination findings, scoring system outputs generated from the AI algorithms, and the patient’s medical history. Considering its functionality, the AI algorithm used in the PAVE system, based on FDA specifications, can be considered an assistant to medical management offering the joint evaluation of the HPV data and the AVE outcome. As WHO is actively evaluating screening and triage approaches, it is expected that clearer regulatory guidance on the use of the algorithms will be available before their implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">WHO, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">FDA, 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Competition and commercial aspects</title><p>The PAVE strategy utilizes certain products of significant commercial importance. The selection of each device or assay is based on factors such as accuracy to achieve its purpose (i.e. high sensitivity of the ScreenFire HPV test to detect precancer, high-quality image capture by the Iris device) and affordability. It is important to note that NCI PAVE collaborators have no commercial interests that could create appearance of conflict of interest. But for collaborators does not preclude future commercial developments. The presence of competition with similar assays is desirable as long as they can provide similar qualities by commertial partners. If the PAVE strategy is proven to be more accurate than the SOC for screening and triage, there will likely be an increased demand for devices and assays. Procurement of these resources may present challenges and require effective communication with the respective Ministries of Health to ensure a smooth introduction in countries where the need is evident.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Dissemination</title><p>After the demonstration of efficacy and effectiveness, we expect to have a screen-treat-triage protocol fulfilling WHO principles that can be used at the discretion of local health authorities in LMIC for cervical cancer prevention programs. If the PAVE strategy is proven to outperform the local SOC, and be feasible, acceptable, and affordable for resource-limited settings, then countries may switch their current SOC to the PAVE strategy. De-implementation of existing strategies, such as cytology, colposcopy, and VIA, as well as implementation of self-sampled HPV with AVE triage will require buy-in from stakeholders and policymakers as well as substantial investment in educating and retraining the laboratory and clinical workforces. Cytology/colposcopy programs, though effective, are limited in scope and are costly to maintain, therefore, switching may be attractive to health ministers. However, laboratories will need funding for the purchase of equipment for running HPV testing and materials for self-sampling, and the cytotechnologist and pathologist workforce will be reduced. Countries with existing VIA programs will require significant introduction costs such as laboratory machinery and training of healthcare personnel, and recurrent costs including reagents and self-sampling materials. In all settings, program continuation beyond the initial study will require local governments and programs to address issues of procurement and implementation, as well as de-implementation of existing strategies.</p><p>In conclusion, the PAVE project will develop and validate a strategy using self-sampled HPV with genotyping and AVE to identify precancer in a large group of women from many different settings. The PAVE objective is to create an accurate, feasible, cost-effective screening and triage protocol for cervical cancer prevention in resource-limited settings. If proven effective, cost-effective, feasible, and acceptable, the strategy can have a major impact in reducing cervical cancer particularly among non-vaccinated adult women.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is an employee of Information Management Services Inc</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Writing – review and editing, Methodology, Conceptualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Validation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Conceptualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Conceptualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Conceptualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Conceptualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Data curation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Conceptualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Validation, Data curation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Writing – review and editing, Data curation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Project administration, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Writing – review and editing, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Conceptualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Methodology, Conceptualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Validation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Validation, Data curation, Methodology, Conceptualization, Supervision</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Informed consent has been obtained in each study site together with the corresponding ethical approval at each site.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-91469-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability</title><p>In the Protocol phase of the PAVE study we do not report neither previously generated nor newly generated datasets.

The PAVE study is a multicentric study to evaluate a novel cervical screen-triage-treat strategy for resource-limited settings as part of a global strategy to reduce cervical cancer burden. The PAVE strategy involves: (1) screening with self-sampled HPV testing; (2) triage of HPV-positive participants with a combination of extended genotyping and visual evaluation of the cervix assisted by deep-learning-based automated visual evaluation (AVE); and (3) treatment with thermal ablation or excision (Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone). The PAVE study has two phases: efficacy (2023-2024) and effectiveness (planned to begin in 2024-2025). The efficacy phase aims to refine and validate the screen-triage portion of the protocol. The effectiveness phase will examine few implementation of the PAVE strategy into clinical practice. In following phases implementation will further explored.</p><p>Strengths and weaknesses</p><p>The Pave Study develops and evaluates a novel strategy that combines HPV self-collection -that has been proven effective to increase screening coverage in different settings-, with genotyping and Automated Visual Evaluation as triage. The proposed strategy combined three key innovations to improve an important step in the cervical cancer care continuum. If the strategy is effective it will contribute to enhance cervical cancer prevention in low resource settings.</p><p>As authors mentioned, despite the existence of effective preventive technologies (e.g., HPV vaccine and HPV test) translation of the HPV prevention methods has not yet occurred in many Low-Middle-Income Countries. So, in this context, new screen-triage-treat strategies are needed and if PAVE strategy were effective, it could be a landmark for cervical cancer prevention.</p><p>The PAVE Study is a solid and important study that is aimed to be carried out in nine countries and recruit tens thousands of women. It is a study with a large and diverse sample that can provide useful information for the development of this new screen-triage-treat strategy. Another strength is the fact that the PAVE project is integrated into the screening activities placed in the selected countries that will allow to evaluate efficacy and effectiveness in real-word context.</p><p>The manuscript does not present results because its aim is to describe the study protocol, structure and logic of the PAVE strategy.</p><p>Phase 1 aims to evaluate efficacy of the strategy. Methods are well described and are consistent with the study aims.</p><p>Phase 2 aims to evaluate the implementation of the PAVE strategy in clinical practice. The inclusion of implementation evaluation in this type of studies is an important milestone in the field of cervical cancer prevention. It has been shown that many strategies that have proven to be effective in controlled studies face barriers when they are implemented in real life. In that sense, results of phase 2 are key to ensure the future implementation of the strategy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91469.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary: Despite being preventable and treatable, cervical cancer remains the second most common cause of cancer death globally. This cancer, and associated deaths, occur overwhelmingly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), reflecting a lack of access to vaccination, screening and treatment services. Cervical screening is the second pillar in the WHO strategy to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem and will be critical in delivering early gains in cervical cancer prevention as the impact of vaccination will not be realized for several decades. However, screening strategies implemented in high income countries are not feasible or affordable in LMICs. This ambitious multi-center study aims to address these issues by developing and systematically evaluating a novel approach to cervical screening. The approach, based on primary screening with self-collected specimens for HPV testing, is focused on optimizing triage of people in whom HPV is detected, so that sensitivity for the detection of pre-cancer and cancer is maximized while treatment of people without pre-cancer or cancer is minimized.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The triage proposed for this study builds on the authors' previously published work in designing the ScreenFire test to appropriately group the 13 detected genotypes into four channels and to develop automated visual evaluation (AVE) of images of the cervix, taken by health workers.</p><p>The move from mobile telephone devices to a dedicated device to acquire and evaluate images, overcomes challenges previously encountered whereby updates of mobile phone models required retraining of the AVE algorithm.</p><p>The separation of the study into two phases, an efficacy phase in which screen positive people will be triaged and treated according to local standard of care and the performance of AVE will be evaluated against biopsy outcomes will be followed by the second phase in which the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability will be evaluated.</p><p>The setting in a range of low resource settings which are geographically well spread and reflective of where the global cancer burden is highest.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Potential ascertainment bias due to the lack of specified biopsy (such as small four quadrant biopsies or small biopsies across the transformation zone) when aceto-white areas are not identified. This has the potential lead to lead to an over-estimate of sensitivity of the triage approach, particularly in the setting of VIA as compared to colposcopy. While the authors specify endocervical sampling in this setting, using curette or brush (for cytology), this may not be as sensitive unless clinicians are experienced in endocervical curette procedures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91469.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>de Sanjose</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rockville, MD</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Perkins</surname><given-names>Rebecca B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Boston University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Campos</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard T.H.

No line item costings are given. As far as I know, the AmpFire test is very expensive (some 6 USD) and AI-assisted colposcopy has at least formerly been very expensive.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As mentioned in the section on &quot;Cost-effectiveness analysis,&quot; the cost-effectiveness results refer to &quot;an early exercise to approximate the potential costs and benefits of a highly effective screening campaign delivered to women aged 30-49 years in the ~65 highest burden LMIC (Figure 1; Suppl Materials) and an HPV vaccination program delivered to girls aged 9-14 years&quot;. Because this modeling was intended to be a high-level approximation prior to the availability of micro-costing and use of a new microsimulation model reflecting the epidemiology of HPV in PAVE study sites, we used a bundled cost of US$15 per woman screened and managed appropriately, including the ~$6 cost of the ScreenFire test, triage with AVE for women with HPV positivity, and treatment based on risk stratification. Micro-costing and microsimulation model development for PAVE sites are ongoing alongside the study and will have the capability to reflect setting-specific differences in delivery costs, as well as different burdens of HPV and precancer. These refinements of costing and cost-effectiveness estimates are a high priority of the PAVE consortium</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>As mentioned above, the description of phase 2 could be improved. I suggest that the inclusion of Implementation Science frameworks and tools could contribute to strengthening methods to measure implementation outcomes. Perhaps if the protocol and scope of the study allows it, I suggest that the authors evaluate the incorporation of the assessment of barriers and facilitators of implementation to inform future scaling up of the PAVE strategy. To do this, for example, some Implementation Science Frameworks, such as Conceptual Framework of Implementation Research (CFIR)1-2 could be useful. In addition, as the authors mentioned, future dissemination will need an effective communication strategy and to design it they will carry out a pilot study. The inclusion of CFIR framework or other similar framework, could contribute to identifying contextual factors that might affect implementation and contribute to designing an accurate implementation and dissemination strategy.</p><p>The authors also mentioned that if the PAVE strategy is effective, it could replace the current standard of care. This fact would lead to the need to carry out a des-implementation process. This process needs stakeholders' engagement and political will, among other contextual factors (e.g., human resources, organizational changes, etc.).Implementation of new strategies needs that implementers perceive it as acceptable, adaptable, compatible and with greater advantages than the usual practice. In this sense, the analysis of implementation outcomes guided by CFIR framework could play an important role in this future des-implementation process.</p><p>1. Damschroder, et al.

Based on preliminary results of PAVE in the efficacy analysis a more comprehensive implementation intervention is being planned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This is a very strong protocol and obviously the synthesis of many years' of work. I have some minor suggestions only.</p><p>The issue raised as a weakness could be addressed by specifying that biopsy adequacy is evaluated by the local histopathologist. Those cases that don't contain at least some stroma and only superficial strips of epithelium should probably be assessed as &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; and excluded from triage performance calculations.</p><p>While endocervical curettage is commonly performed in North America, resulting in good quality samples, there is considerable global variation in this practice. The procedure yielding high quality samples is usually somewhat painful due to the cervical dilation and may in fact be more painful than small biopsies.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We are undertaking a thorough evaluation of histology assessment together with the on-site pathologists and an external expert reviewer. It is critical that the study material be of good quality and that the diagnosis be highly accurate as these elements are critical for patient management but also for an adequate training of the AI algorithm. We are recommending to use for endocervical sampling a soft tissue by Histologics that provides excellent material and it is reported to be less painful than regular curette. Pathologists are requested to verify the quality of the sampling of this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sentence starting at line 311 could add that, clinicians also record transformation type and/ or colposcopy adequacy.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Added</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The clinicians are reporting the VIA or the colposcopy impression and also the visibility of the SCJ.</p><p>The manuscript could be strengthened by specifying what will happen to people who have HPV detected and are triage negative. Will they be recalled for follow-up HPV test at around 12 months or some other interval?</p><p>Finally, will those who have been treated be recalled for a follow-up HPV test at around 12 months, particularly those treated with thermal ablation? Follow-up of people in whom HPV is detected, whether triage negative or positive (and treated) would strengthen the study and enhance participant safety. If this is already planned it would strengthen the manuscript to cover these aspects.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The PAVE strategy runs under a Consortium agreement and thus we cannot dictate specific protocols for follow-up. We are very eager to promote an adequate follow-up for those with a triage test negative, but the monitoring of its implementation is beyond PAVE. All settings have under their guidelines a yearly follow-up for any woman receiving thermal ablation and shorter intervals for those getting LEEP (LLETZ).</p></body></sub-article></article>
