We previously found that interaction with different somatic niches regulates mouse PGC proliferation along the migration route. To characterize transcriptional heterogeneity of migrating PGCs and their niches, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 13,262 mouse PGCs and 7868 surrounding somatic cells during migration (E9.5, E10.5, E11.5) and in anterior vs posterior locations to enrich for leading and lagging migrants. Analysis of PGCs by position revealed dynamic gene expression changes between faster or earlier migrants in the anterior and slower or later migrants in the posterior at E9.5; these differences include migration-associated actin polymerization machinery and epigenetic reprogramming-associated genes. We furthermore identified changes in signaling with various somatic niches, notably strengthened interactions with hindgut epithelium via non-canonical WNT (ncWNT) in posterior PGCs compared to anterior. Reanalysis of a previously published dataset suggests that ncWNT signaling from the hindgut epithelium to early migratory PGCs is conserved in humans. Trajectory inference methods identified putative differentiation trajectories linking cell states across timepoints and from posterior to anterior in our mouse dataset. At E9.5, we mainly observed differences in cell adhesion and actin cytoskeletal dynamics between E9.5 posterior and anterior migrants. At E10.5, we observed divergent gene expression patterns between putative differentiation trajectories from posterior to anterior, including Nodal signaling response genes <italic>Lefty1, Lefty2,</italic> and <italic>Pycr2</italic> and reprogramming factors <italic>Dnmt1, Prc1,</italic> and <italic>Tet1</italic>. At E10.5, we experimentally validated anterior migrant-specific <italic>Lefty1/2</italic> upregulation via whole-mount immunofluorescence staining for LEFTY1/2 and phosphorylated SMAD2/3, suggesting that elevated autocrine Nodal signaling in migrating PGCs occurs as they near the gonadal ridges. Together, this positional and temporal atlas of mouse PGCs supports the idea that niche interactions along the migratory route elicit changes in proliferation, actin dynamics, pluripotency, and epigenetic reprogramming.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primordial germ cell</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>cell heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>Nodal</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2OD007420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laird</surname><given-names>Diana J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM122902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laird</surname><given-names>Diana J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01ES023297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laird</surname><given-names>Diana J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F31HD096840</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaszczak</surname><given-names>Rebecca Garrett</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02qenvm24</institution-id><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Daniel E</given-names></name><name><surname>Laird</surname><given-names>Diana J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A temporal and positional atlas of mouse primordial germ cell (PGC) migration reveals dynamic gene expression and somatic cell interactions that suggest how changing migratory niches regulate PGC development.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian germline is initially specified as a small pool of primordial germ cells (PGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lawson and Hage, 1994</xref>), which will give rise to oocytes or spermatozoa and transmit genetic information across generations. A founding population of ~40 mouse PGCs is specified at E7.25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canovas et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ginsburg et al., 1990</xref>) from the epiblast driven by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling from adjacent extraembryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lawson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ying et al., 2000</xref>). Shortly after specification, PGCs begin migrating through the hindgut, moving anteriorly toward the forming gonadal ridges. Signaling cues such as Cxcr4 and KitL are known PGC chemoattractants and contribute to this journey while also promoting PGC survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pesce et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farini et al., 2007</xref>). Studies observing this migratory process have characterized distinct behavioral patterns in the migratory population. Time-lapse imaging across the period of mouse germ cell migration from E9.5 to E11.5 showed that PGCs early in their migration are motile within the hindgut, moving both with the morphogenetic changes of the developing embryo and anteriorly in their own right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Molyneaux et al., 2001</xref>). At E9.5, a behavioral change occurs, as some PGCs begin directed migration out of the hindgut and into the dorsal mesentery tissues. This targeted migration continues through E10.5, by which point the leading PGC migrants home in on the developing gonadal ridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Molyneaux et al., 2001</xref>). At E10.5, PGCs are located within diverse tissue niches, with migratory leaders arriving in the gonadal ridges, actively migrating cells still in the dorsal mesentery, and migratory laggards remaining in the hindgut. By E11.5, most PGCs have reached the gonadal ridges; however, a population of PGCs remains medial to the gonad and is considered ectopic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Runyan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Though the spatiotemporal distribution of migrating PGCs is well characterized, molecular features distinguishing leading vs lagging migrants remain poorly understood. Work from our lab demonstrated that early in migration, PGCs receive non-canonical WNT (ncWNT) signaling which suppresses their proliferation within the hindgut. As they leave the hindgut and progress into the mesentery and gonad, they display progressively greater canonical WNT signaling and proliferate more rapidly, reaching maximal proliferation within the gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantú et al., 2016</xref>). Epigenetic reprogramming occurs concurrently with PGC migration from E9.5 to E11.5, during which global DNA demethylation erases genomic imprints and enables later upregulation of gametogenesis and meiosis-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hargan-Calvopina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seisenberger et al., 2012</xref>). It remains unknown how shifting niche interactions throughout migration may alter PGC transcriptomes and epigenetic reprogramming, or how these influences might differentially affect earlier vs later migrants.</p><p>Investigating transcriptional differences within the PGC population during migration has been challenging as the cell population at migratory timepoints starts out quite small with just ~200 cells present at E9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durcova-Hills et al., 2003</xref>), ~1000 cells present at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saiti and Lacham-Kaplan, 2007</xref>) and ~2600 cells present at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laird et al., 2011</xref>). Other groups have harnessed single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate germ cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stévant et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mayère et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia-Alonso et al., 2022</xref>); however, these studies have precluded in-depth study of migratory PGC behavior and transcriptional dynamics within single timepoints due to the relatively small numbers of migratory PGCs in their respective datasets.</p><p>By pooling many somite-matched embryos, we successfully profiled large populations of PGCs from E9.5, E10.5, and E11.5 embryos, separating anterior and posterior embryo halves in order to isolate leading from lagging migrants and facilitate direct transcriptional comparisons between these populations. We also profiled representative cells from PGC niches along the migratory path. By investigating cell-cell communication pathways between migrating PGCs and their somatic niches, we uncover interactions that influence PGC differentiation over the course of migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A comprehensive positional survey of migrating PGCs and their niches</title><p>To ascertain the transcriptional dynamics within mouse PGCs across the migratory time period, we performed droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing to create libraries from E9.5, E10.5, and E11.5 mouse embryos, to span the onset of directed migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Molyneaux et al., 2001</xref>) and homing of PGCs into the gonadal ridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since PGCs are few in number at early migratory timepoints, we used the Oct4-ΔPE-eGFP reporter (MGI:3057158; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Szabó et al., 2002</xref>) to purify PGCs from multiple age-matched embryos via FACS (see Materials and methods). We constructed sequencing libraries from bisected E9.5 and E10.5 embryos (see Materials and methods) to facilitate comparisons between the transcriptomes of leading (anterior) and lagging (posterior) migrants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, first two panels). At E11.5, 90–95% of PGCs have arrived at the forming gonadal ridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laird et al., 2011</xref>) with some remaining in the midline between the gonadal ridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, third panel). We purified GFP+ PGCs from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGMs) to enrich both for successful migrants and any PGCs remaining in the midline and mesentery proximal to the gonads. To survey the supporting somatic cell niches at each migratory timepoint and anatomical position, we included GFP-negative somatic cells from the same sort.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Developmental and transcriptional profile of E9.5-E11.5 migratory mouse primordial germ cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal microscopy images of whole-mount mouse embryos at E9.5, E10.5, and E11.5 (left to right).

Results were visualized by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embeddings. We saw clear expression of early PGC markers <italic>Pou5f1</italic> and <italic>Dppa3 (Stella</italic>) among E9.5 and E10.5 PGCs and increasing expression of <italic>Dazl</italic> with PGC developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Using automated cell-type identification from previously published datasets (see Materials and methods), we identified the following somatic populations: coelomic epithelium, bipotential early gonadal supporting cells, neural tube, hindgut epithelium, primitive erythroid lineage, endothelial cells, neural progenitors, other epithelia, Schwann cell precursors, white blood cells, cholinergic neurons, myocytes, and sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To validate the positional separation of the cells included in the anterior vs posterior libraries, we examined genes with established roles in caudal patterning of the embryo.

This analysis supports that anterior and posterior tissues were successfully segregated using our embryo splitting strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Transcriptomic shifts over developmental time in migratory and post-migratory PGCs</title><p>All together, we examined 1268 PGCs at E9.5, 1664 PGCs at E10.5, and 10,330 PGCs at E11.5. This large number of PGCs permitted assessment of migratory PGC heterogeneity across developmental time. After pairwise differential expression testing among PGCs at each developmental timepoint, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO) or Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on the resultant lists of differentially expressed genes. E9.5 PGC migrants exhibited an elevated signature of regulation of canonical WNT signaling relative to E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This ontology term result does not indicate the direction of such regulation, but may be consistent with prior findings that WNT signaling regulates proliferative capacity of migrating PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantú et al., 2016</xref>), with increased canonical WNT signaling promoting PGC proliferation later in migration. E9.5 migrants also differentially expressed genes associated with focal adhesion compared to E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that a shift in cytoskeletal dynamics accompanies the behavior change from chiefly migratory to more proliferative over the course of migration. During PGC migration, progressive genome-wide DNA demethylation permits expression and potential transposition of transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Teixeira et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this, we found piRNA processing was an upregulated GO term at E10.5 compared to E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that expression of genes relevant for piRNA processing increases during PGC migration despite the fact that mature piRNAs are not detected until E13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ernst et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ramakrishna et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, compared to migrating PGCs at E9.5, post-migratory E11.5 germ cells express more genes associated with GO/GSEA terms related to chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), consistent with the global demethylation present by E11.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2018</xref>) and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which may reflect the increased proliferation previously observed within the gonadal niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantú et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Next, we leveraged trajectory inference techniques in CellRank after subsetting the PGC population to include 1268 cells from each timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); this subsampling avoided potential biases in embedding graph connectedness resulting solely from differences in PGC numbers from each timepoint, and we further regressed out cell cycle phase based on S and G2M scores. As expected for this developmental window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saiti and Lacham-Kaplan, 2007</xref>), we observed robust expression of <italic>Pou5f1</italic> across E9.5–11.5 PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and successive upregulation of <italic>Dazl</italic> with increasing developmental time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To better understand likely differentiation trajectories across these key migratory and early post-migratory timepoints, we employed CellRank’s pseudotime kernel to build a transition matrix among PGCs. Simulating random walks of 100 randomly selected E9.5 germ cells for 100 steps revealed that E9.5 posterior PGCs primarily reached endpoints among E11.5 PGCs, with some terminating among E10.5 and others remaining within a terminal state mostly occupied by E9.5 anterior PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). When this was repeated using CellRank’s real-time kernel only, which used only timepoint information and transcriptional relationships to build its transition matrix, all E9.5 PGCs reached final positions among E11.5 PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This discrepancy may reflect differences in differentiation potential of some E9.5 PGCs that end in a terminal state among anterior E9.5 PGCs, but could also result from technical batch effects generated during library preparation. These possible interpretations are further discussed in the Discussion section.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Trajectory inference defines terminal states for migratory mouse germ cells and conserved expression of putative driver genes across mouse and human.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plot of primordial germ cells (PGCs) downsampled to 1268 cells/timepoint colored by position-time of sample.

One major finding was significant ncWnt signaling unique to posterior PGC migrants; the source of this signaling was the hindgut and coelomic epithelia at E9.5 and primarily the coelomic epithelium at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This corroborates earlier experimental work demonstrating ncWNT signaling in the hindgut that suppresses PGC proliferation while in this early migratory niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantú et al., 2016</xref>). The hindgut and coelomic epithelium-mediated ncWNT signaling to PGCs was not present in the anterior migrants at E9.5 (data not shown) or E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>), suggesting a transient and important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laird et al., 2011</xref>) developmental signaling niche specific to posterior migrants. In further support, our reanalysis of signaling networks in human migratory PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2017</xref>) revealed that ncWNT signaling from the hindgut epithelium to early migratory PGCs is conserved in human embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>At E9.5, we found that FGF signaling was significantly enriched in the anterior cells compared to the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The spatial resolution in our mouse data reveals that posterior E9.5 PGCs exclusively send Ephrin type A signals to the hindgut epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>) while receiving Ephrin type B from the coelomic epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>); anterior E9.5 PGCs both send and receive Ephrins type A and B to and from the coelomic epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>). E10.5 posterior PGCs continue to send and receive Ephrin type A signaling to and from the coelomic epithelium, but shift to receive Ephrin type B from endothelial cells and neural progenitors in the mesentery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>). Notably, E10.5 anterior PGCs located at the final migration station before entering the gonads do not participate in Ephrin A or B signaling as either senders or receivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>). Human migratory PGCs receive Ephrins type A from the mesenchyme and endothelial cells and receive Ephrins type B from immune populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>); once they reach the gonad as gonocytes, these cells continue to receive Ephrin B from the same sources, as well as the gonadal soma, but instead send Ephrin type A to epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and immune populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

We specified the root cell to originate from the E10.5 posterior population and found a single initial state composed mostly of posterior cells. We found two terminal states (orange and green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), primarily consisting of anterior cells and one terminal state (blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) consisting of a mix of anterior and posterior cells. Plotting terminal state probabilities by position revealed that many posterior PGCs were assigned high fate probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) of reaching terminal state 2, suggesting a commonly traversed differentiation pathway linking the initial state with terminal state 2. This was supported by the finding that genetic drivers of terminal state 2 included genes involved in PGC epigenetic reprogramming and survival: <italic>Tet1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>Prc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mochizuki et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>Chd4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Castro et al., 2022</xref>), <italic>Dnmt1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hargan-Calvopina et al., 2016</xref>), and <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wells et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We previously showed that later germ cells exhibiting inappropriately prolonged DNA methylation in the fetal testis are prone to later elimination by apoptosis during sex differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). The high representation of reprogramming-related genes as drivers of terminal state 2 therefore suggests that this state is consistent with appropriate reprogramming and possibly future survival in the developing germline. In addition, we found <italic>Mki67</italic> as a driver of terminal state 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>); as PGCs in more advanced migratory niches have increased proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantú et al., 2016</xref>), this further supports the interpretation of terminal state 2 as a developmentally advanced cell state undergoing appropriate epigenetic reprogramming. To compare differentiation trajectories leading to the identified terminal states, we plotted trajectory-specific gene expression trends along pseudotime for key genes of interest, including genes involved in Nodal response, epigenetic reprogramming, and those with known fertility phenotypes. We found that <italic>Lefty1</italic> and <italic>Lefty2</italic> had the steepest upregulation trend within trajectory 2, but were upregulated to a lesser degree or stagnant for the other two states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). <italic>Lefty1</italic> and <italic>Lefty2</italic> may serve as markers of cells undergoing transcriptomic and epigenomic shifts consistent with differentiation into a putatively ‘appropriate’ terminal state 2.</p><p>To test experimentally whether increased Nodal signaling is a hallmark of anterior migrating PGCs, we performed whole-mount immunofluorescence in E10.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and H</xref>). We found anterior E10.5 PGCs exhibited significantly increased LEFTY1/2 and nuclear phosphorylated SMAD2/3 signal intensity compared to the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and I</xref>), suggesting active signaling through TGF-beta type 1 receptors that bind Nodal. These results reveal a role for Nodal signaling during the terminal phases of PGC migration, with anterior E10.5 PGCs exhibiting distinct gene expression patterns and cell-cell signaling pathways compared to posterior PGCs. Our trajectory inference analysis and immunofluorescence staining suggest that enhanced Nodal signaling in anterior PGCs is associated with successful migration and epigenetic reprogramming, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms driving PGC development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study provides a comprehensive view of transcriptional heterogeneity among migratory mouse PGCs and revisits an existing dataset of migratory human PGCs at analogous timepoints. Key innovations of this study include the sheer number of high-quality PGC transcriptomes profiled and separation of PGC populations by their migratory position, enabling direct comparisons between PGCs present at the same developmental timepoints but within distinct tissue niches.</p><p>One of the most striking findings of this study is the identification of Nodal signaling upregulation specific to anterior migrants at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which we experimentally validated with whole-mount immunofluorescence. Lefty1 and Lefty2, both of which are Nodal-responsive inhibitors of Nodal, have been previously identified as part of the early PGC pluripotency network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seisenberger et al., 2012</xref>), and Nodal signaling has recently been recognized as a key regulator of hPGC-like cell specification in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jo et al., 2022</xref>). Nodal and its co-receptor Cripto have also been identified as essential for maintaining testicular germ cell pluripotency from E12.5 to E14.5 to prevent premature spermatogenic differentiation; conversely, too much Nodal signaling during this period promotes cell invasiveness and tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spiller et al., 2012</xref>). At E13.5, <italic>Lefty2</italic> is a marker of putatively developmentally defective apoptosis-poised testicular germ cells that have not undergone differentiation to prospermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, we observed no obvious correlation between a cell’s <italic>Lefty1</italic> or <italic>Lefty2</italic> expression and its Y-chromosome transcript expression in our E10.5 PGC dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>), suggesting that the niche-specific Nodal signaling signature at E10.5 is unrelated to regulating testis-specific germ cell differentiation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic representating mouse migratory primordial germ cells and the somatic and spatial signaling cues encountered during migration.</title><p>PGCs migrate through the hindgut, dorsal mesentery, and arrive in the gonadal ridge, encountering diverse signaling niches. Multiple signaling pathways, including Nodal/Lefty, non-canonical WNT (ncWnt), and survival/homing factors such as Kit, regulate PGC proliferation and migration. Seminal literature references supporting key aspects of the migratory model are listed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gill et al., 2011</xref>), including contributions from this study.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103074-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>An additional interesting feature of this finding is that Nodal expression is not differential between anterior and posterior PGCs at E10.5, but Nodal-responsive transcripts <italic>Lefty1, Lefty2, Pitx2, Pycr2,</italic> and <italic>Fscn1</italic> are all clearly upregulated in the anterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This pattern could result from a transcriptional response to Nodal signaling, initiated first in leading PGC migrants, that persists after expression of the ligand has been downregulated. The Nodal-dependent upregulation of Fscn1 observed in anterior PGC migrants presents a tantalizing link between this signaling shift and changes in actin cytoskeletal dynamics associated with PGC migratory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yamashiro et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamakita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lamb and Tootle, 2020</xref>) as E10.5 anterior migrants reach the nascent gonad. Moreover, <italic>Fscn1’s</italic> role in potentiating TGF-beta signaling could reflect late migratory PGCs becoming primed to respond to BMP or Nodal cues once within the gonad in order to promote oogenic or spermatogenic fates, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lundgaard Riis and Jørgensen, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the initial state identified in trajectory inference analysis across PGCs from all timepoints was also identified as a terminal state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, state 2). Since state 2 is identified among E9.5 PGCs, this may reflect that some E9.5 PGCs are less able to further differentiate to later terminal states; thus, their differentiation trajectories initiate and terminate within state 2. It is known that some mouse PGCs mis-migrate and fail to reach the gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Richardson and Lehmann, 2010</xref>); PGCs with high fate probabilities for terminal state 2 may include lagging and mis-migrants. In addition, despite the fact that initial and terminal states for this analysis were based on a diffusion pseudotime ordering with a root cell identified within the E9.5 posterior sample, initial state 3 was found among primarily E9.5 anterior cells using CellRank’s cell-cell transition matrix. This likely reflects that transcriptional differences between these early migrating PGC populations are relatively subtle.</p><p>Several enriched GO terms for upregulated transcripts in posterior E9.5 PGCs relative to anterior were related to heparan sulfate proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis and degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The importance of this pathway during PGC migration was further supported by our cell-cell communication analysis. Interestingly, HSPG signaling from the hindgut epithelium and coelomic epithelium in the posterior was enriched relative to anterior at E9.5. By E10.5, HSPG signaling was instead enriched in the anterior, coming primarily from endothelial cells to PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In a manner similar to Kit signaling, HSPG signaling may shift to surround PGCs as they traverse their diverse migratory niches. HSPG signaling has been previously shown to modulate migratory behavior and survival in zebrafish PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wei and Liu, 2014</xref>), but there has not been thorough investigation of this pathway in mouse or other mammalian systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García-Castro et al., 1997</xref>). Since posterior E9.5 PGCs are mostly located within the hindgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the reduction in HSPG signaling in E9.5 anterior migrants may reflect changes to the PGC cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix interactions that permit hindgut exit and enable a shift toward greater proliferation in more anterior migratory niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantú et al., 2016</xref>). If HSPG signaling indeed facilitates directional migration, reestablishment of HSPG signaling in E10.5 anterior PGCs from the endothelium may guide final PGC homing to reach the gonadal ridges.</p><p>Considering the differences observed in Ephrin signaling to PGCs between anterior and posterior niches and between mouse and human datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G-J</xref>), Ephrins likely warrant further investigation for mediating precise control of PGC migratory behavior. Ephrin B signaling mediates germ layer separation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos; a similar mechanism could mediate PGC repulsion from hindgut and mesentery tissues at the appropriate transitions during PGC migration. In our dataset, E10.5 anterior PGCs no longer exhibit enriched Eph/Ephrin signaling; reduced repulsive signaling between PGCs and their surrounding tissues could help PGCs bind and settle into the gonadal ridges as they complete their migration. Close analysis of the particular Eph and Ephrin ligands and receptors expressed in each somatic niche and relevant PGC subsets could help further clarify the relevance of a shifting Ephrin code in migratory PGC development.</p><p>Limitations of this study include batch effects between sequencing libraries stemming from separate library preparation procedures on cells from different timepoints and anatomical locations in our mouse dataset. When appropriate, we corrected for batch effects between libraries (see Materials and methods - Batch correction). Batch effects may have contributed some spurious differentially expressed genes between timepoints and anatomical positions, leading to false detection of some differentially regulated GO/GSEA terms and cell-cell interaction pathways. Batch effects may explain the discovery of a putative terminal differentiation state within the bulk of E9.5 anterior PGCs, as it seems unlikely that such a large proportion of the PGCs profiled at this timepoint and anatomical position represent an aberrant state that is not conducive to further PGC migration and development.</p><p>Because ectopic PGCs have been shown to give rise to germ cell tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Runyan et al., 2008</xref>), one goal of our analyses was to identify cells with clearly distinct transcriptomes consistent with mis-migration and/or aberrant differentiation. Aside from the small population of PGCs consisting of mixed anterior and posterior migrants at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, state 0), we did not identify any minor clusters of obviously transcriptionally distinct PGCs suggesting ectopic localization. It is possible that this population is indeed composed of ectopic PGCs, but their small number precluded identification of specific markers for experimental validation. Moreover, it is possible that at the developmental stages profiled, ectopic PGCs have not yet acquired transcriptional differences reflecting their mislocalization in the embryo. Explicit profiling of ectopic PGCs separately from gonadal PGCs at E11.5 or later could be a fruitful way to establish a ground truth of expected transcriptional differences between successful and unsuccessful migrants to help identify these cells in future datasets and explore differentiation trajectories leading to the formation of germ cell tumors.</p><p>Finally, trajectory inference analyses like those in this study are more often performed on clearly divergent cell types within a differentiating lineage rather than within single cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lange et al., 2022</xref>); thus, the differences between putative differentiation trajectories we observed at E9.5 and E10.5 may be subtler than in other applications of these methods. Overall, the abundance of PGCs profiled in this study has enabled unprecedented comparisons among PGC subtypes within and across developmental timepoints.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this work provides a transcriptional survey of migrating and early post-migratory mouse and human germ cells.

In the mouse, we assayed transcriptional differences between migratory leaders and laggards at E9.5 and E10.5, identifying increased Nodal signaling in anterior migrants at E10.5.

To integrate cells within timepoints but allow for visual comparison of similarities and differences between PGCs on the full cell manifold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we used STITCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>), which joins the k-nearest neighbor graphs from multiple timepoints by identifying neighbors in adjacent timepoints and projecting cells from a timepoint t<sub>i</sub> into the next timepoint t<sub>i+1</sub>. To handle batch variability across libraries for different timepoints, we also provided the library_id as a batch_key in order to prioritize highly variable genes identified across batches rather than batch-specific highly variable genes for use in UMAP graph construction. This light batch correction using highly variable genes was also used to build the PGC-only manifold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cell-type identification</title><p>Of the cells we sequenced, 1268 E9.5 PGCs, 1664 E10.5 PGCs, and 10,330 E11.5 PGCs survived quality control filtering steps. We acquired an average of 3724 genes per cell at E9.5, 2076 genes per cell at E10.5, and 4115 genes per cell at E11.5. We next began to cluster the data and identify the germ cell and somatic cell components present. Automated cell-type label transfer was performed in CellTypist (v1.6.2) using published datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia-Alonso et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2019</xref>) with good coverage of gonadal and extragonadal cell types at equivalent developmental stages (E9.5–11.5). Automated cell-type predictions were verified through manual gene set scoring. Clustering resolution was varied to best capture the distribution of predicted cell types in the dataset. While the limited cell number of PGCs present in the tissue at E9.5 did not permit us to construct multiple libraries from multiple biologic replicates, we prepared the E10.5 anterior and posterior libraries, as well as the E11.5 library in biological duplicate. Automated cell-type identification was performed on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2017</xref>, human dataset using CellTypist’s Developing_Human_Gonads model based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia-Alonso et al., 2022</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Differential expression testing</title><p>Differential expression testing was performed using pyDESeq2 (v0.4.4) and pseudobulking cells by sequencing library of origin. In cases with fewer than three libraries per timepoint or anatomical position, three pseudoreplicates were generated and cells were randomly allocated to one of these three pseudoreplicates, then gene expression data were pseudobulked by pseudoreplicate. We compared gene expression using the Wald test and corrected for multiple comparisons via the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Gene set enrichment analysis</title><p>GSEA was performed with GSEApy (v1.1.2) on differentially expressed genes from pyDESeq2 (see Differential expression testing) filtered to include genes with a log2 fold change ≥0.5 or ≤–0.5 and an adjusted p-value of ≤0.01. Gene sets used for enrichment analysis were acquired from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Trajectory inference methods</title><p>We used CellRank (v2.0.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lange et al., 2022</xref>) to analyze differentiation trajectories across and within timepoints. We began by using CellRank’s real-time kernel with germ cells from E9.5 to E11.5 to generate a cell-cell transition matrix incorporating transcriptional similarities among germ cells, as well as their developmental stage, subsampling the data to contain the same number of germ cells from each timepoint to reduce biases from cell number. Assigning E9.5 posterior to contain the starting state, we plotted random walks through the transition matrix to identify the most likely endpoints of differentiation. Then, using diffusion pseudotime computed in ScanPy for cells across all timepoints in CellRank’s pseudotime kernel, we identified putative initial and terminal macrostates within migratory PGCs. For all trajectory analyses, the number of macrostates used was the lowest possible such that the CellRank algorithm identified an initial state containing the root cell used for pseudotemporal ordering. Each cell not assigned to a macrostate was scored on its likelihood of reaching a predicted terminal state using Markov chain absorption probabilities, which approximate the results of infinite random walks through the state manifold. For intra-timepoint trajectory analyses at E9.5 and E10.5, we used CellRank’s pseudotime kernel with diffusion pseudotime computed in ScanPy to build cell-cell transition matrices. Intra-timepoint initial and terminal states, as well as random walks, were also computed within CellRank’s pseudotime kernel based on diffusion pseudotime.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cell-cell communication analysis</title><p>All cell-cell communication network analysis was performed in CellChat (v2.1.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin et al., 2021</xref>). Enriched cell-cell communication networks were initially inferred from somatic and germ cells derived from each timepoint and anatomical position separately (E9.5 posterior, E9.5 anterior, E10.5 posterior, and E10.5 anterior), and then CellChat objects were compared via cross-dataset analysis. Since initial cell-type annotations were performed on the integrated cell manifold across all cells from E9.5 to E11.5, subsetted embeddings for each position and timepoint were checked for annotation accuracy and cluster annotations were slightly modified as needed prior to CellChat analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Scientific advisor at Vitra, Inc</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

This work addresses the question of how 'leading' and 'lagging' PGCs differ, molecularly, during their migration to the mouse genital ridges/gonads during fetal life (E9.5, E10.5, E11.5), and how this is regulated by different somatic environments encountered during the process of migration. E9.5 and E10.5 cells differed in expression of genes involved in canonical WNT signaling and focal adhesions. Differences in cell adhesion, actin cytoskeletal dynamics were identified between leading and lagging cells, at E9.5, before migration into the gonads. At E10.5, when some PGCs have reached the genital ridges, differences in Nodal signaling response genes and reprogramming factors were identified. This last point was verified by whole mount IF for proteins downstream of Nodal signaling, Lefty1/2.

Here, the authors examine whether there are differences in leading and lagging migratory PGCs using single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse embryos. Cleverly, the authors dissected embryonic trunks along the anterior-to-posterior axis prior to scRNAseq in order to distinguish leading and lagging migratory PGCs. After batch corrections, their analyses revealed several known and novel differences in gene expression within and around leading and lagging PGCs, intercellular signaling networks, as well as number of genes upregulated upon gonad colonization. The authors then compared their datasets with publicly available human datasets to identify common biological themes. Altogether, this rigorous study reveals several differences between leading and lagging migratory PGCs, hints at signatures for different fates among the population of migratory PGCs, and provides new potential markers for post-migratory PGCs in both humans and mice. While many of the interesting hypotheses that arise from this work are not extensively tested, these data provide a rich platform for future investigations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have successfully navigated significant technical challenges to obtain a substantial number of mouse migratory primordial germ cells for robust transcriptomic analysis. Here, the authors were able to collect quality data on ~13,000 PGCs and ~7,800 surrounding somatic cells, which is ten times more PGCs than previous studies.</p><p>The decision to physically separate leading and lagging primordial germ cells was clever and well-validated based on expected anterior-to-posterior transcriptional signatures.</p><p>Within the PGCs and surrounding tissues, the authors found many gene expression dynamics they would expect to see both along the PGC migratory path as well as across developmental time, increasing confidence in the new differentially expressed genes they found.</p><p>The comparison of their mouse-based migratory PGC datasets with existing human migratory PGC datasets is appreciated.</p><p>The quality control, ambient RNA contamination elimination, batch correction, cell identification and analysis of scRNAseq data were thorough and well-done such that the new hypotheses and markers found through this study are dependable.</p><p>The subsetting of cells in their trajectory analysis is appreciated, further strengthening their cell terminal state predictions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There were a few validation experiments within this study.

Fig. 6 has been added to highlight the main novel findings of this work and integrate them among contributions of earlier studies to provide a more complete view of signaling pathways and cell behaviors governing PGC migration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The initial discussion of CellRank analysis (under 'Transcriptomic shifts over developmental time...' heading) is somewhat confusing - e.g. If CellRank's 'pseudotime analysis' produces a result that seems surprising (some E9.5 cells remain in a terminal state with other E9.5 cells) and 'realtime analysis' produces something that makes more sense, is there any point including the pseudotime analysis (since you have cells from known timepoints)? Perhaps the 'batch effects' possible explanation (in Discussion) should be introduced here. Do we learn anything novel from this CellRank analysis? The 'genetic drivers' identified seem to be genes already known to be key to cell transitions during this period of development.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important observation. We have clarified the text in this section and added “This discrepancy may reflect differences in differentiation potential of some E9.5 PGCs that end in a terminal state among anterior E9.5 PGCs, but could also result from technical batch effects generated during library preparation. These possible interpretations are further discussed in the Discussion section.” to the pertinent results section and added additional relevant thoughts on the implications of this finding in Discussion paragraphs 4 and 7. We feel that it is important to include both results to the reader, as it is challenging to differentiate between heterogeneous developmental and migratory potential among E9.5 anterior PGCs and differential influence of batch effects across sequencing libraries with the data available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Discussion - with respect to Y-chromosome correlation, it is not clear why this analysis would be done at E10.5, when E11.5 data is available (because some testis-specific effect might be more apparent at the later stage).</p></disp-quote><p>Since we had identified autocrine Nodal signaling primarily in anterior late migratory PGCs at E10.5 and knew that Nodal signaling was involved in sex specification of testicular germ cells into prospermatogonia by E12.5, we wanted to determine whether the Nodal signaling in late migratory PGCs at E10.5 was likely to be a sex-specific effect or was common to PGCs in both sexes. This was assessed in supplementary figure 4 and determined unlikely to be related to sex specification of PGCs as Nodal signaling was not strongly correlated with Y-chromosome transcripts in migratory PGCs. Assessing the relationship between Nodal signaling and Y-chromsome transcription at E11.5, when migration is complete, would be unlikely to help us further understand the dynamics of Nodal signaling during late PGC migration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 2A - it seems surprising that there are two clusters of E9.5 anterior cells</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the interesting observation! One possibility is that the two states represent differential developmental competence as is suggested by the presence of one E9.5 anterior cluster along the differentiation trajectory in Fig 2A and one not within this differentiation trajectory. Another is that technical aspects of generating these sequencing libraries affected some cells more than others, resulting in clustering of highly affected and less affected cells, which would also be consistent with some E9.5 anterior cells lying within the differentiation trajectory and some not. Since it is challenging to differentiate between these possibilities with the data available, we have intentionally avoided overstating interpretations of this result in the manuscript text. We have included discussion of the potential implications of the transcriptional divergence you identify in Discussion paragraphs 4 and 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 5F - there does seem to be more LEFTY1/2 staining in the anterior region, but also more germ cells as highlighted by GFP</p></disp-quote><p>This is true; based on our selected anatomic landmarks for “anterior” and “posterior” as indicated in Methods, the “anterior” compartment typically contains more PGCs.

Here, the authors examine whether there are differences in leading and lagging migratory PGCs using single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse embryos. Cleverly, the authors dissected embryonic trunks along the anterior-to-posterior axis prior to scRNAseq in order to distinguish leading and lagging migratory PGCs. After batch corrections, their analyses revealed several known and novel differences in gene expression within and around leading and lagging PGCs, intercellular signaling networks, as well as number of genes upregulated upon gonad colonization. The authors then compared their datasets with publicly available human datasets to identify common biological themes. Altogether, this rigorous study reveals several differences between leading and lagging migratory PGCs, hints at signatures for different fates among the population of migratory PGCs, and provides new potential markers for post-migratory PGCs in both humans and mice. While many of the interesting hypotheses that arise from this work are not extensively tested, these data provide a rich platform for future investigations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have successfully navigated significant technical challenges to obtain a substantial number of mouse migratory primordial germ cells for robust transcriptomic analysis. Here the authors were able to collect quality data on ~13,000 PGCs and ~7,800 surrounding somatic cells, which is ten times more PGCs than previous studies.</p><p>The decision to physically separate leading and lagging primordial germ cells was clever and well-validated based on expected anterior-to-posterior transcriptional signatures.</p><p>Within the PGCs and surrounding tissues, the authors found many gene expression dynamics they would expect to see both along the PGC migratory path as well as across developmental time, increasing confidence in the new differentially expressed genes they found.</p><p>The comparison of their mouse-based migratory PGC datasets with existing human migratory PGC datasets is appreciated.</p><p>The quality control, ambient RNA contamination elimination, batch correction, cell identification and analysis of scRNAseq data were thorough and well-done such that the new hypotheses and markers found through this study are dependable.</p><p>The subsetting of cells in their trajectory analysis is appreciated, further strengthening their cell terminal state predictions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although it is useful to compare their mouse-based dataset with human datasets, the authors used two different analysis pipelines for each dataset. While this may have been due to the small number of cells in the human dataset as mentioned, it does make it difficult to compare them.</p></disp-quote><p>Direct comparisons between findings in human and mouse focused on CellChat cell-cell communication prediction results, which were conducted in an identical fashion using the same analysis methods for both datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There were few validation experiments within this study.
