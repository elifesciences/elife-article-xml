molecular identities of individual rhombomeres and the mechanism whereby they form has not been fully established. Here, we apply scMultiome analysis in zebrafish to molecularly resolve all rhombomeres for the first time. We find that rhombomeres become molecularly distinct between 10hpf (end of gastrulation) and 13hpf (early segmentation). While the embryonic hindbrain transiently contains alternating odd- versus even-type rhombomeres, our scMultiome analyses do not detect extensive odd versus even molecular characteristics in the early hindbrain. Instead, we find that each rhombomere displays a unique gene expression and chromatin profile. Prior to the appearance of distinct rhombomeres, we detect three hindbrain progenitor clusters (PHPDs) that correlate with the earliest visually observed segments in the hindbrain primordium that represent prospective rhombomere r2/r3 (possibly including r1), r4, and r5/r6, respectively. We further find that the PHPDs form in response to Fgf and RA morphogens and that individual PHPD cells co-express markers of multiple mature rhombomeres. We propose that the PHPDs contain mixed-identity progenitors and that their subdivision into individual rhombomeres requires the resolution of mixed transcription and chromatin states.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural progenitor</kwd><kwd>rhombomere</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>gene regulatory network</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS038183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sagerström</surname><given-names>Charles G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combined single nucleus RNAseq and ATACseq enabled the first molecular resolution of all hindbrain rhombomeres, the derivation of a unique gene regulatory network for each rhombomere, and the identification of gene expression changes as rhombomeres form from early progenitor pools.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Formation of a functioning central nervous system requires that neural progenitors are properly specified and positioned during embryogenesis. One model posits that neural progenitors emerge in segmental compartments (termed neuromeres) that are formed by subdivision of the embryonic neural primordium along its anteroposterior (AP) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keynes and Lumsden, 1990</xref>). While it remains under debate whether this model applies to the embryonic fore and midbrain, the embryonic hindbrain is clearly divided into neuromeric units known as rhombomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lumsden, 1990</xref>), but the unique characteristics of each rhombomere have not been defined molecularly and it remains unclear how they form during embryogenesis.</p><p>It has long been noted that the hindbrain possesses a two-rhombomere periodicity where each rhombomere pair provides neural crest cells and motor innervation to one specific pharyngeal arch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lumsden and Keynes, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lumsden et al., 1991</xref>). Each pair consists of one odd- and one even-numbered rhombomere that display unique properties – e.g., neuronal differentiation generally occurs earlier in the even-numbered rhombomere. Transplantation experiments further revealed that cells from odd versus even rhombomeres do not intermix but form discrete boundaries when they come into contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guthrie and Lumsden, 1991</xref>). Strikingly, cells from the even-numbered member of one pair intermix more readily into other even-numbered rhombomeres than into the odd-numbered member of the same pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guthrie et al., 1993</xref>). Individual rhombomeres are, therefore, characterized by belonging to a specific rhombomere pair as well as by possessing either an odd or an even identity. This periodicity is recapitulated in some gene expression patterns. For instance, <italic>egfl6</italic> is expressed in even-numbered rhombomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thisse et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghosh et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>epha4</italic> in odd-numbered ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 1995</xref>), while <italic>mafba</italic> is expressed in a two-rhombomere unit (r5/r6). r5 and r6 can, therefore, be assigned to the same rhombomere pair by their shared expression of <italic>mafba</italic> and to an even (<italic>egfl6</italic> expression in r6) versus odd (<italic>epha4</italic> expression in r5) identity, but similar assignments have not been possible for other rhombomeres. Indeed, relatively few genes have been identified that recapitulate this periodicity. It is, therefore, unclear how rhombomeres differ in terms of gene expression programs and whether an odd versus even periodicity can be defined molecularly.</p><p>It also remains unclear how the rhombomeres emerge from the hindbrain primordium. Visual observations in embryos of various species suggest that rhombomeres develop from broad early segments of the neural tube that are subsequently subdivided. For instance, ‘pro-rhombomeres’ have been observed in the chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vaage, 1969</xref>) and ‘primary’ rhombomeres have been proposed in the human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Müller and O’Rahilly, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller and O’Rahilly, 2003</xref>). In the zebrafish, the r3/4 and r4/r5 boundaries form first – thereby delineating r4 – followed by the r6/7 and r1/r2 boundaries that demarcate the r2/r3 and r5/r6 segments. Limited genetic data support the existence of a two-segment pattern in the early hindbrain. Zebrafish <italic>valentino</italic> (<italic>val</italic>) embryos carry a mutation in the <italic>mafba</italic> gene that is expressed in r5 and r6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moens et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moens et al., 1996</xref>). In <italic>val</italic> animals, r5 and r6 do not form, but are replaced by an ‘rX’ segment that displays mixed r5/r6 identity. This finding was interpreted to mean that rX represents an early ‘protosegment’ containing progenitors for r5 and r6, but it is unclear if rX cells exist in wild-type embryos and there is no genetic or molecular evidence suggesting the presence of equivalent progenitor domains for other rhombomeres.</p><p>Attempts at better defining rhombomere identities and understanding their formation have been hampered by a lack of comprehensive molecular data, as recent scRNAseq analyses could not fully resolve individual rhombomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farnsworth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tambalo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farrell et al., 2018</xref>). We reasoned that scMultiome analysis, which combines RNAseq and ATACseq of individual nuclei, might provide an improved definition of rhombomeres. Applying this method to zebrafish, we were able to resolve all rhombomeres for the first time. We find that rhombomeres become molecularly distinct between 10hpf (end of gastrulation) and 13hpf (early segmentation) and remain distinct at 16hpf (mid-segmentation). We do not detect extensive similarities among odd versus even rhombomeres, revealing an absence of general molecular identities defining these two states at early embryonic stages. Instead, we find that each rhombomere displays a unique gene expression and chromatin profile. Prior to the appearance of distinct rhombomeres, our scMultiome analysis identified three cell clusters (HB.1–3) that we refer to as primary hindbrain progenitor domains (PHPDs). Based on our analyses, these PHPDs represent r2/r3 (possibly including r1), r4 and r5/r6. We note that these domains correlate with the earliest visually observed segments in zebrafish embryos and propose that the HB.2 PHPD corresponds to the rX segment identified in <italic>val</italic> mutants. We further find that PHPD cells exhibit mixed gene expression profiles, such that individual cells co-express markers of multiple rhombomeres, and we verified the existence of such mixed-identity cells in vivo. Lastly, we demonstrate that the retinoic acid (RA) and fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) morphogens are required for the formation of the PHPDs. We propose that rhombomeres arise from PHPDs in a process where mixed transcriptional identities are resolved into specific rhombomere identities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Individual rhombomeres are molecularly resolved at segmentation stages</title><p>We applied scMultiome analysis to dissected hindbrain regions at 16hpf (when rhombomeres are becoming morphologically observable; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanneman et al., 1988</xref>) and at 13hpf (when rhombomere-restricted gene expression is well-established), as well as to whole embryos at 10hpf (the end of gastrulation). After data processing (see Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), unsupervised clustering followed by projection as UMAPs revealed multiple distinct clusters at each timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We generated lists of differentially expressed genes for each cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>) and, employing a combination of GO term analysis and comparisons to known tissue-specific genes from the literature and the zebrafish database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bradford et al., 2022</xref>), we assigned cell type identities to all clusters. Since our samples contain tissues adjacent to the hindbrain primordium, we find clusters corresponding to multiple cell types, but the most prominent group of clusters at each timepoint contained CNS cells. Based on this initial analysis, we bioinformatically isolated CNS-related cell types (excluding placodal cells and post-migratory neural crest cells but including pre-migratory neural crest cells that could not be readily separated), re-clustered them, and projected them as UMAPs. These neural UMAPs reveal well dispersed clusters at 13hpf and 16hpf, whereas clusters are more tightly grouped at 10hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>).

The r3, r5, and r6 clusters are immediately recognizable based on the known expression of <italic>egr2b</italic> (restricted to r3 and r5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oxtoby and Jowett, 1993</xref>), <italic>mafba</italic> (restricted to r5 and r6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moens et al., 1998</xref>), and <italic>sema3ab</italic> (restricted to r5 at this stage; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roos et al., 1999</xref>). r4 forms a distinct cluster that is characterized by expression of <italic>fgf3</italic> (enriched in r4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walshe and Mason, 2003</xref>), as well as <italic>cyp26b1</italic> that is expressed in r4 before gradually expanding to r3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>) – which we confirmed by hybridization chain reaction (HCR) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>). A cluster located adjacent to r4 is a strong candidate to contain r2 cells, but there are few known unique markers for r2. Our data reveal that <italic>tgfbr2b</italic> and <italic>vgll3</italic> are highly enriched in this cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). A recent report indicated that <italic>vgll3</italic> is expressed in r2 of <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simon et al., 2017</xref>), but this has not been verified in other systems. We, therefore, examined <italic>vgll3</italic> expression in 13hpf zebrafish embryos and find that it is restricted to r2, confirming the identity of this cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>). A cluster found next to r2 is enriched for <italic>irx1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) and our HCR analysis detected <italic>irx1b</italic> immediately anterior to <italic>vgll3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S</xref>), indicating that this cluster corresponds to r1. We note that one remaining cluster at 13hpf expresses markers indicative of both r1 and r2, but this cluster is also enriched in genes broadly expressed in the dorsal neural tube, such as <italic>zic</italic> family TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). A closer examination revealed that dorsal (<italic>casz1</italic> and <italic>zic2a</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grinblat and Sive, 2001</xref>) and ventral (<italic>ntn1a</italic> and <italic>sp8b</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lauderdale et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawakami et al., 2004</xref>) genes are differentially expressed across each rhombomere at 13hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M–P</xref>), indicating that dorsoventral (DV) patterning is ongoing at this stage. Since the dissected hindbrain region used for this analysis includes some adjacent neural tissue, the neural UMAP also contains clusters corresponding to the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB), the caudal hindbrain (CHB), the anterior spinal cord (SC), as well as some cells from the midbrain (MB) and forebrain (FB). An analogous analysis of the 16hpf neural UMAP readily identified r1 to r6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At this stage, we observe two clusters that express r5-specific genes (such as <italic>egr2b</italic>). As at 13hpf, we find that dorsoventral markers are differentially expressed between these clusters and across all rhombomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm the assigned rhombomere identities, we identified ATAC peaks enriched in each cell cluster relative to all other clusters and carried out a de novo search for over-represented transcription factor (TF) binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). At both 13hpf and 16hpf, the r3 and r5 clusters display a strong enrichment for accessible EGR2 motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; consistent with high expression of <italic>egr2b</italic> in both rhombomeres), but the r3 and r5 clusters also differ from each other such that the r5 cluster is enriched for accessible MAF motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; in agreement with <italic>mafba</italic> expression in r5) and r3 is enriched in accessible binding motifs for TALE TFs (such as PKNOX1 [a.k.a., Prep1]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The type of TALE binding motif observed in r3 is also enriched in other anterior rhombomeres, and corresponds to a compound binding site that supports binding of TALE heterodimers (Pbx:Prep and/or Pbx:Meis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Penkov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ladam et al., 2018</xref>), which are broadly expressed in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sagerström et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zerucha and Prince, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Waskiewicz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pöpperl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deflorian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choe et al., 2002</xref>). r6 shows enrichment for accessible MAF motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; in accordance with <italic>mafba</italic> expression in r6), as well as for paralog group (PG) 4 HOX motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). PG4 HOX motifs are also enriched in the caudal hindbrain at 13hpf and become less accessible at 16hpf, consistent with the dynamic expression of several PG4 <italic>hox</italic> genes in the caudal CNS with anterior limits at r5 and r6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prince et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prince et al., 1998b</xref>). The r4 cluster is enriched for Pbx binding motifs that are also accessible in some more caudal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Notably, this type of Pbx site is distinct from the heterodimeric TALE sites enriched in r3 and are reported at enhancers where Pbx TFs act as co-factors to Hox proteins – such as at several Hox-dependent enhancers active in r4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferretti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pöpperl et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobs et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berthelsen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferretti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tümpel et al., 2007</xref>). Cells in the r2 cluster are highly enriched for accessible binding motifs for TEAD family TFs at 13hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). TEAD TF expression is not restricted to r2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), but TEAD TFs are known heterodimerization partners to Vgll TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Günther et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maeda et al., 2002</xref>) and <italic>vgll3</italic> expression is restricted to r2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and R–T</xref>). This suggests that Vgll3 supports the binding of TEAD TFs to genomic DNA specifically in r2. We did not identify any TF binding motifs unique to r1, but the r1 and r2 clusters (along with some MHB clusters) display enrichment for NR2C/F family motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>), consistent with <italic>nr2f1b</italic> being expressed in this region of the zebrafish embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Love and Prince, 2012</xref>). Lastly, we note that many motifs enriched in the rhombomeres are also enriched in clusters containing differentiating neurons, suggesting that some genomic regions remain accessible as progenitors begin to differentiate. Overall, we find strong agreement between the scRNA and scATAC data in defining individual rhombomeres and we conclude that r1-r6 are molecularly distinct from each other and adjacent neural structures by 13hpf, which precedes the stage when individual rhombomeres become visually detectable in zebrafish.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Transcription factor binding motifs show rhombomere-restricted accessibility.</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>.

This concept is primarily based on cellular and anatomical features, such as the exit of branchiomotor nerves, the migration of neural crest cells and cell cycle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lumsden and Keynes, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lumsden et al., 1991</xref>). Despite the discovery of some genes that recapitulate this pattern (e.g. <italic>epha4a</italic> expression in r1/r3/r5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 1995</xref>, and <italic>egfl6</italic> expression in r2/r4/r6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choe et al., 2011</xref>), it is unclear if this periodicity is present earlier in development and if it is broadly recapitulated molecularly – in the form of gene expression and chromatin accessibility patterns. The UMAPs presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> do not show odd and even rhombomeres clustering into separate groups. Instead, r1, r2, and r4 cluster with anterior neural structures, while r6 clusters closer to caudal structures. Since the position of clusters in the UMAP is not fully indicative of how related the cell populations are, we next generated heatmaps of the top genes in each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). The heatmaps reveal considerable gene expression overlap between r3 and r5, but these rhombomeres do not share extensive expression with r1. Similarly, while r2, r4, and r6 share some gene expression, r2 seems to express more genes related to r3, and r6 shares closer expression with r5. To comprehensively examine these relationships across all rhombomeres, we used the weighted nearest-neighbor graphs from the Seurat analysis and projected them as dendrograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). This analysis revealed very similar relationships at 13hpf and 16hpf. At both stages, r3 and r5 are closely related to each other, while r1 is more closely related to the MHB (13hpf) or r2 (16hpf). Furthermore, r4 is related to r2, but not to r6, which instead clusters with the caudal hindbrain at both stages. As a result, there is no clustering of even versus odd rhombomeres at either 13hpf or 16hpf. To more directly assess if there is a molecular odd versus even pattern among rhombomeres, we computationally identified any genes expressed in r2, r4, and r6 – and whose average expression in those rhombomeres exceeds their expression in r1, r3, and r5 – or vice versa at 13hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). We find very few genes that fulfill these criteria. <italic>col7a1l</italic> is highly expressed in r2, r4, and r6, but most other genes expressed in an even or odd patterns are expressed weakly in one of the rhombomeres. For instance, <italic>plxna2</italic> is robustly expressed in r2 and r4, but only weakly in r6, while <italic>egr2b, epha4a,</italic> and <italic>sema3fb</italic> are highly expressed in r3 and r5, but barely detectable in r1. We carried out an analogous analysis to identify genes expressed in two adjacent rhombomeres, to determine if rhombomere pairs can be defined by co-expression of genes. This analysis identified several genes co-expressed in r5 and r6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), like the known expression of <italic>mafba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moens et al., 1998</xref>) and the PG3 and PG4 <italic>hox</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prince et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prince et al., 1998b</xref>). In contrast, we detect only a few genes co-expressed in r1 and r2 (<italic>nrp2a</italic> and <italic>pdzrn4</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) and none co-expressed in r3 and r4. We next used the Direct-Net tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) to delineate and compare the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of 13hpf rhombomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">7</xref>). This analysis revealed that each rhombomere is characterized by a unique GRN with previously known, as well as novel, TFs acting as nodes. For example, the TEAD1 TF forms a predominant node in r2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), as expected based on its known interaction with Vgll3 that is uniquely expressed in r2, but so do the Sox6 and Esrrg TFs that have not been previously implicated in r2 formation. While some TFs are shared between rhombomeres, such as Nr2f family TFs forming nodes in both the r1 and r2 GRNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>), the GRNs are clearly distinct. Even when comparing rhombomeres that share significant molecular similarity – such as r3 and r5 that both have a predominant Egr2 node – we find that their GRNs also possess numerous distinct nodes – such as the PG 3 and 4 <italic>hox</italic> genes in r5 but not r3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>). Lastly, even TFs that are shared between rhombomeres are connected to different genes in each GRN, as illustrated by Egr2 connecting to MafB and RARa in r5, but not r3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). This analysis represents the first comprehensive rhombomere-specific GRNs and extends prior work that generated GRNs based on bulk data, or incompletely separated rhombomere clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tambalo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krumlauf and Wilkinson, 2021</xref>). We conclude that each 13hpf rhombomere is characterized by a unique GRN that defines a specific molecular identity, and that there is not an overt molecular odd versus even, or rhombomere pair, pattern at this stage.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Each rhombomere displays a unique molecular profile.</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">7</xref>.

Using gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>) and motif accessibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), we assigned cell identities to each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>) and noted that dorsoventral patterning is already ongoing at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N and O</xref>). We find that, in contrast to 13hpf and 16hpf, individual rhombomeres are not apparent as distinct clusters at 10hpf. Instead, we identified three clusters (HB.1-HB.3) that express genes characteristic of mature rhombomeres. HB.1 is the largest of these and expresses genes associated with several different rhombomeres such that <italic>vgll3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; an r2 marker; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simon et al., 2017</xref>) and <italic>egr2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; a marker of r3 and r5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oxtoby and Jowett, 1993</xref>) are both enriched in this cluster. A second prominent rhombomere cluster (HB.2) expresses <italic>mafba</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; a marker of r5/r6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moens et al., 1998</xref>) and <italic>crabp2a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; expressed in r6, the caudal hindbrain, and weakly in r4/r5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sharma et al., 2005</xref>), as well as limited <italic>egr2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Since <italic>egr2b</italic> expression is initiated in r3 at the end of gastrulation (10hpf), but does not become expressed in r5 until 11hpf, this suggests that HB.1 and HB.2 correspond to prospective anterior and posterior rhombomeres, respectively. Furthermore, a third rhombomere cluster (HB.3) is related to HB.1 as these two clusters co-express <italic>cyp26b1</italic> and <italic>cyp26c1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H, I</xref>; expressed in r2-r4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2005</xref>), but HB.3 does not express either <italic>vgll3</italic> or <italic>egr2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Instead, HB.3 expresses <italic>dusp2</italic> and <italic>ppp1r14ab</italic>, two markers that we previously reported as restricted to r4 at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maurer and Sagerström, 2018</xref>). All HB clusters are clearly separate from a group of clusters corresponding to the MHB, the midbrain and the forebrain, while the HB.2 cluster is adjacent to several clusters corresponding to the caudal hindbrain and the anterior spinal cord. TF motif accessibility generally supports the gene expression analysis, and we find that multiple TF binding motifs are associated with the HB clusters at 10hpf. Egr, TEAD, and TALE binding motifs are enriched in accessible chromatin regions in HB.1 cluster cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q-S</xref>), which is supportive of our assertion that HB.1 contains precursors of anterior rhombomeres. Similarly, the HB.2 cluster is enriched for accessible Maf and Hnf1 motifs in accordance with it containing posterior progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3T and U</xref>). Egr motifs are also weakly enriched in HB.2, consistent with the <italic>egr2b</italic> gene becoming activated in r5 at this stage. Lastly, we find that Pbx motifs are enriched in HB.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3V</xref>). Although Pbx motifs are also enriched in HB.1 and HB.2, HB.3 is unique in that it shows minimal enrichment for accessible Egr, TEAD, Hnf1, and Maf motifs. These relationships are supported by dendrogram projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>), where HB.2 clusters with the caudal hindbrain, whereas HB.1 and HB.3 cluster together on a separate branch. Taken together, this analysis demonstrates that individual rhombomeres are not yet molecularly distinct at 10hpf. Instead, three progenitor domains with different anteroposterior characteristics are present, such that HB.1 likely corresponds to the future r2/r3 (and possibly r1), HB.2 to r5/r6 and HB.3 to r4. We tentatively refer to these domains as primary hindbrain progenitor domains (PHPDs).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The PHPDs contain progenitors with mixed rhombomere identities</title><p>To determine how the PHPDs relate to rhombomeres, we integrated neural clusters from all three timepoints. To simplify this analysis, we omitted all forebrain cells and projected the remaining cells as a UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The integrated UMAP reveals clearly delineated clusters, and we identified each rhombomere based on its gene expression and TF motif accessibility profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1 fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 1 and 2</xref>). We again find that each rhombomere is split into dorsal (expressing <italic>zic2b</italic>) and ventral (marked by <italic>ntn1a</italic>) clusters – except for r3, which is represented by a single cluster that nevertheless shows differential expression of dorsoventral genes in distinct subdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). Projecting the integrated data in the form of a dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) largely confirms the relationships observed at individual timepoints such that r1 and r2 cluster together with r4 on a shared branch, r3 and r5 cluster on a separate branch, and r6 forms its own branch. We then used the integrated UMAP to examine the contribution of cells from each timepoint to the integrated rhombomere clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata3">Figure 6—source data 3</xref>). We find that cells from individual rhombomeres at 13hpf and 16hpf combine into integrated clusters such that, for instance, r3 cells from 13hpf and 16hpf contribute to the integrated r3 cluster, indicating that hindbrain cells have shared rhombomere characteristics at 13hpf and 16hpf. In contrast, cells from the 10hpf PHPD clusters (HB.1–3) do not contribute fully to the integrated rhombomeres. A portion of cells from the HB.2 cluster distribute to the integrated r5 and r6 clusters, but many remain as a separate cluster (HB) in the integrated UMAP (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating that – although they express <italic>mafba</italic> (a marker of r5/r6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) – their overall molecular profile is sufficiently distinct from r5/r6 cells that they remain as a separate group. Even the HB.2 cells that do distribute to rhombomeres appear located between r4 and r6 in the integrated UMAP. Similarly, while cells from the HB.1 cluster distribute to the integrated r1, r2, and r3 clusters, a detailed examination of their distribution reveals that many occupy a position between r1 and r2, further indicating that PHPD cells are molecularly distinct from rhombomere cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Rhombomere progenitor cells display mixed gene expression identities.</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata3">Figure 6—source data 3</xref>.

We identified the top genes differentially expressed in r2 versus r3 at 13hpf (and vice versa). As expected, these genes are preferentially expressed in their corresponding rhombomere at 13hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, middle and bottom panels), but we find that both r2 and r3 genes are extensively expressed in HB.1 cells at 10hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, top panel). Examining the expression state of individual HB.1 cells, we identified many cells that express both <italic>vgll3</italic> (r2 marker) and <italic>egr2b</italic> (r3 marker at this stage), such that ~74% of <italic>egr2b</italic>-expressing cells co-express <italic>vgll3</italic> at 10hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>; top left panel).

We compared the molecular profile of cells in each PHPD at 10hpf to that of its derivative rhombomere cells at 13hpf and projected as heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We also identified genes that are expressed more highly in the PHPDs and that may need to be downregulated for the transition to specific rhombomere identities (e.g. <italic>ror1;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We conclude that the PHPDs differ from later rhombomeres in terms of their molecular profile and, at least in the case of HB.1, individual PHPD cells possess mixed identities characterized by co-expression of markers for multiple rhombomeres. During the development of PHPD cells into rhombomeres, their gene expression profiles undergo a corresponding change.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Morphogens control formation of the PHPDs</title><p>The anteroposterior pattern of the early hindbrain primordium is established by morphogens (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krumlauf and Wilkinson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frank and Sela-Donenfeld, 2019</xref>), with RA acting posteriorly (from its source in the adjacent somites) and Fgfs acting anteriorly (with an initial source at the MHB followed by a secondary source in r4). Partial disruption of RA signaling has variable effects on hindbrain gene expression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Begemann and Meyer, 2001</xref>), whereas complete inhibition appears to block the formation of caudal rhombomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dupé and Lumsden, 2001</xref>), suggesting that RA may be required for the formation of the HB.2 domain. Accordingly, we find that expression of RA signaling components – such as the <italic>RARab</italic> retinoic acid receptor and the <italic>crabp2a</italic> retinoic acid binding protein – is enriched in HB.2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). To test if formation of the HB.2 domain requires RA signaling, we used DEAB (an inhibitor of RA synthesis) to block RA signaling and assessed early HB.2 gene expression. We find that <italic>egr2b</italic> expression in r5 and <italic>mafba</italic> expression in r5/r6 is detected by 10hpf-11hpf in control embryos but is never observed in DEAB-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–K</xref>). In contrast, the expression of the anterior markers (<italic>vgll3</italic>, <italic>cyp26b1, cyp26c1,</italic> and the anterior <italic>egr2b</italic> domain) persists in DEAB-treated embryos, but the expression is observed over a broader region and may be somewhat weaker. Previous work demonstrated that disruption of r5/r6 formation in <italic>mafB</italic> mutant embryos results in a unique rX cell population between r4 and the caudal hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moens et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moens et al., 1996</xref>). To determine if such an rX domain forms in place of r5/r6 in DEAB-treated embryos, we assessed expression of <italic>cdx4</italic> in the spinal cord relative to <italic>cyp26b1</italic> in r4 and <italic>egr2b</italic> in r3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L and M</xref>). We again observe a slight expansion of <italic>egr2b</italic> in r3 and <italic>cyp26b1a</italic> in r4 of DEAB-treated embryos, but these domains closely abut <italic>cdx4</italic> expression. Inhibition of RA signaling, therefore, does not appear to induce an rX domain, but leads to a loss of the caudal hindbrain and an expansion of r4, consistent with a role for RA in HB.2 formation. Since each rhombomere produces a specific set of neuronal progenitors, we next examined if the loss of HB.2 leads to corresponding loss of differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Q–R</xref>). We find that vagal (nX) neurons in the caudal hindbrain and abducens (nVI) neurons in r5/r6 are largely absent in DEAB-treated embryos while r4-derived facial (nVII) neurons and r4-specific reticulospinal Mauthner neurons (MNs) appear expanded (2 MNs per wild-type embryo versus 3.6 MNs per DEAB-treated embryo).

Therefore, while RA is required for HB.2 formation, Fgf appears broadly required to establish the PHPDs.</p><p>While these analyses confirm a role for morphogens in patterning the hindbrain primordium and suggest that RA and Fgf are required for PHPD formation, they rely on HCR analyses of a small number of genes. It is, therefore, possible that the expression of other rhombomere markers persists and/or that the remaining rhombomeres are misspecified in embryos with disrupted morphogen signals. Previous analyses of morphogen function in early hindbrain development suffers from the same imitations, as they also did not comprehensively assess the effects on rhombomere gene expression. To address this shortcoming, we again turned to scMultiome analysis. Since RA signaling appears to be required for HB.2 formation we collected DEAB-treated embryos at 13hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), and combined DEAB-treated with control samples into an integrated UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In assessing the contribution of control versus DEAB-treated cells to each UMAP cluster, we find that the r5 and r6 clusters contain only cells from control embryos and no cells from DEAB-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Accordingly, projecting DEAB-treated and wild-type samples in separate UMAPs reveals a complete loss of r5 and r6 in the DEAB condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), consistent with the HB.2 progenitor population not forming. In agreement with the apparent expansion of anterior rhombomeres observed in our HCR analyses of DEAB-treated embryos, cell ratio comparisons reveal that r1 and r2 contain twice as many cells, and r4 contains almost three times as many cells, in DEAB-treated compared to control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Furthermore, the caudal hindbrain (CHB) clusters are lost in DEAB-treated embryos while the spinal cord clusters largely persist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>). We also find that all cells from DEAB-treated embryos can be mapped to a wild-type cluster, again indicating that an rX domain does not form in DEAB-treated embryos. Furthermore, we find only minor changes in gene expression in r1-r4 upon loss of RA signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Only ~30 genes are differentially expressed between DEAB-treated and control embryos (&gt;twofold change; p-val &lt;1e-5) in each rhombomere – and many of these genes are shared between rhombomeres – indicating that they reflect broadly RA-responsive genes rather than genes that affect individual rhombomere fates. Our results suggest that RA is required for formation of the HB.2, but not the HB.1 or HB.3 domains, although we cannot exclude the possibility that a small number of genes are RA-dependent in the anterior domains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Hindbrain rhombomeres represent a well-studied model for neural progenitor specification and positioning, but we still lack a clear understanding of the molecular basis for differences between rhombomeres, and we do not know how they form in the embryo. This is largely due to a lack of comprehensive molecular data as individual rhombomeres have not been resolved by previous scRNAseq analyses on whole embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farnsworth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farrell et al., 2018</xref>), or on dissected hindbrain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tambalo et al., 2020</xref>). Using combined single nucleus RNAseq and ATACseq (scMultiome), we successfully resolved all rhombomeres at zebrafish segmentation stages. We identify a unique molecular profile for each rhombomere and find that there is no overt odd versus even periodicity of rhombomere identities at these stages. We also define three mixed-identity progenitor domains that likely correspond to the pre-rhombomeres observed visually in early embryos of several species and that are predicted to subsequently subdivide into the mature rhombomeres. Our results provide a comprehensive molecular basis for the formation and unique identities of hindbrain rhombomeres.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Early rhombomeres lack an overt molecular periodicity</title><p>The embryonic hindbrain possesses an odd versus even periodicity of cellular and anatomical features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lumsden and Keynes, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lumsden et al., 1991</xref>), but the molecular basis of this pattern is not clear, and it is not known how early it may be present. Using the full gene expression profile for each rhombomere at segmentation stages, we find that r3 and r5 are closely related and that r2 shares features with r4, but r1 and r6 do not fall into these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, we find very few genes that are restricted to odd versus even rhombomeres at these stages. Similarly, while we observe numerous genes co-expressed in r5 and r6, we do not detect shared gene expression in other pairwise combinations of rhombomeres. Instead of a molecular periodicity, each rhombomere displays a distinct molecular profile that can be captured in a GRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">7</xref>). The GRNs of individual rhombomeres are unique – even closely related rhombomeres (e.g. r3 and r5) have clearly distinct GRNs. Our analyses of gene expression, TF motif accessibility, and GRN formation combine to indicate that repeating two-segment identities are not molecularly evident in the early zebrafish hindbrain.</p><p>Although the rhombomeres do not display an overt molecular periodicity in our analyses, previous work demonstrated odd versus even rhombomere features. For instance, transplantation and cell mixing experiments revealed that cells from odd rhombomeres mix more readily into other odd rhombomere than into even ones, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guthrie and Lumsden, 1991</xref>) – a process likely controlled by cell surface molecules such as the <italic>ephrins</italic> and their <italic>Eph</italic> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooke et al., 2001</xref>). Accordingly, we find that <italic>epha7</italic> is part of the Egr2 regulatory network in both r3 and r5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). If cell surface receptors are expressed in an even versus odd pattern to drive cell sorting, why do we not detect a corresponding molecular periodicity? The answer may be that these shared expression modules are a minor component of the overall GRN in each rhombomere. Indeed, prior work also revealed a hierarchy for cell mixing such that, for instance, r3 cells mix more readily with other r3 cells than with cells from different odd-numbered rhombomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guthrie et al., 1993</xref>) – indicating that the GRNs controlling expression of cell surface receptors may not be the same in all odd rhombomeres. In agreement, we find that <italic>epha2</italic> is part of the Egr2 network in r5, but not in r3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). In fact, if we compare the Egr2 regulatory network in r3 versus r5 (the two most closely related rhombomeres where Egr2 is an essential TF), we find that only 37% of nodes are shared. Hence, while some GRN components are shared between rhombomeres, these appear to be a minority and, in most cases, may not give rise to detectable molecular periodicities when we compare rhombomeres.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Three molecularly defined progenitor domains may correspond to pre-rhombomeres</title><p>It remains unclear how rhombomeres arise during embryogenesis. Although the hindbrain primordium – together with the entire neural tube – becomes patterned along its AP axis via the action of various morphogens (e.g. fibroblast growth factors, retinoic acid, wnt proteins, etc.; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moens and Prince, 2002</xref>), visual observations reveal that the rhombomeres do not form in a strict AP order. In zebrafish, the r3/r4 and r4/r5 borders form first, which delineates r4 as the first rhombomere. This is followed by the r1/r2 boundary, which leaves a transient r2 + r3 structure that is subsequently subdivided by the formation of the r2/r3 boundary. Similarly, a transient r5 + r6 segment is formed before being subdivided by the r5/r6 boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moens et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moens and Prince, 2002</xref>). The formation of early transient segments may be evolutionarily conserved, since three potentially analogous ‘pre-rhombomeres’ have been observed in chick and four ‘primary rhombomeres’ (where the fourth corresponds to the caudal hindbrain) are present in human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vaage, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Müller and O’Rahilly, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller and O’Rahilly, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, these early structures appear not to be solely a morphological phenomenon, but to have a genetic basis. In zebrafish <italic>valentino</italic> mutants (that lack <italic>mafb</italic> TF function), r5 and r6 do not form properly, but are replaced by an ‘rX’ rhombomere that is postulated to contain precursors for r5 + r6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moens et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moens et al., 1996</xref>). rX has not been well defined and it is not clear if it is present in wild-type embryos, nor if there are analogous progenitors for the r2 + r3 segment. Our 10hpf Multiome data identify three hindbrain populations (PHPDs), and our analyses demonstrate that they contain rhombomere progenitors. The HB.2 population contains r5 + r6 progenitors, suggesting that it corresponds to rX, while HB.3 appears to correspond to the r4 segment, and HB.1 to the r2 + r3 segment. Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, HB.1 may also contain r1 progenitors, but we cannot confirm this as we do not have an r1 marker at 10hpf. These analyses provide the first molecular characterization of the progenitor domains that precede the formation of individual rhombomeres. It is likely that the PHPDs in turn arise from an earlier unpatterned primordium. Indeed, analyses by several groups have shown that blockade of all Hox TF function – by inhibiting key Hox cofactors – produces a structure that uniformly expresses early hindbrain markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Waskiewicz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choe and Sagerström, 2005</xref>). It remains unclear if an equivalent structure exists in wild-type embryos, but scMultiome analyses at earlier stages of embryogenesis might allow a molecular characterization of such a primordium.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>PHPD cells have mixed gene expression profiles that must be resolved during rhombomere formation</title><p>Our data reveal that the HB.1 cluster expresses markers of both r2 (<italic>vgll3</italic>) and r3 (<italic>egr2b, nab1b</italic>) at 10hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A closer examination further demonstrated that individual HB.1 cells co-express r2 and r3 markers and such co-expression was confirmed by HCR analyses in developing embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These findings indicate that HB.1 cells possess a mixed gene expression profile and may be able to take on both r2 and r3 fates. Accordingly, when 10hpf cells are computationally integrated with cells from 13hpf and 16hpf, they contribute to both the r2 and r3 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Notably, the gene expression profiles of HB.1–3 cells are distinct from those of their corresponding rhombomere derivatives and our comparisons between developmental timepoints identified a profound change in gene expression as PHPD cells transition to rhombomere cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that the mixed gene expression profiles are resolved during rhombomere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Analogous to dorsoventral patterning of the neural tube by repressive interactions between TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briscoe and Novitch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kutejova et al., 2016</xref>), we hypothesize that TFs expressed in the PHPDs repress each other to drive distinct rhombomere fates. For example, <italic>vgll3</italic> and <italic>egr2b</italic> (or components of their respective GRNs) may repress each other’s transcription in HB.1 to force an r2 versus an r3 fate. Our HCR analyses also indicate a gradual resolution of r2 versus r3 profiles along the AP axis, such that HB.1 cells at the anterior end lose <italic>egr2b</italic> expression first. This may indicate that a morphogen with a source in the anterior hindbrain (such as Fgf produced at the MHB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rhinn and Brand, 2001</xref>) acts to bias <italic>vgll3</italic> versus <italic>egr2b</italic> expression within the HB.1 domain, thereby shifting the repressive balance between these TFs and resolving the mixed gene expression profile. The mixed cell identities we observe in the HB.1 domain appear unrelated to the process of ‘border sharpening’ that takes place during rhombomere formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooke and Moens, 2002</xref>). In that case, cells of adjacent rhombomeres intermix during boundary formation, which leads to some instances of cells in one rhombomere expressing a gene indicative of the adjacent rhombomere. Such cells are relatively few, usually associated with a rhombomere border, and become sorted into the correct rhombomere based on their expression of <italic>Eph</italic> and <italic>ephrin</italic> cell surface molecules. This contrasts with the mixed identity cells we observe in the HB.1 domain, that are more numerous and not associated with rhombomere boundaries – which have yet to form at this stage. We expect cells in the HB.2 cluster to similarly display a mixed gene expression profile between r5 and r6, but we currently lack robust r6-restricted markers to test this directly. However, we note that 10hpf HB.2 cells contribute to both r5 and r6 in the integrated UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and that the rX cells found in this region of <italic>mafB</italic> mutant embryos give rise to both r5 and r6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moens et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moens et al., 1996</xref>) – consistent with HB.2 corresponding to a shared progenitor pool for r5 and r6.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the transition from mixed identity primary hindbrain progenitor domain (PHPD) cells to rhombomere cells.</title><p>An early ground state that lacks an anteroposterior pattern is proposed to respond to morphogens (fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) anteriorly and retinoic acid posteriorly) to generate three PHPDs.

This finding indicates that early hindbrain cells are simultaneously responding to both DV and AP axial cues – although DV patterning may start prior to AP patterning – further contributing to their mixed molecular identities.

rid="bib62">Tambalo et al., 2020</xref>), we cannot exclude the possibility that further analyses – perhaps using supervised clustering – could identify such structures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Colorado Medical School approved all procedures involving zebrafish under protocol #870. Wild-type AB (ZL1) and TU (ZL57) zebrafish were obtained from the Zebrafish International Resource Center and reared in our facility. The <italic>TG(hoxb1a:eGFP<sup>um8</sup></italic>) and <italic>TG(isl1a:GFP<sup>rw0</sup></italic>) transgenic lines were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Higashijima et al., 2000</xref>). To collect embryos for scMultiome and HCR analyses, one adult male fish and one adult female fish were placed in separate chambers of a 500 mL tank overnight then placed together the following morning. Eggs were collected in 10 cm dishes, immersed in egg water (60 µg/mL Instant Ocean, 0.0002% methylene blue), and maintained in an incubator at 29 °C. Dead and unfertilized eggs were manually removed every 2 hr and were excluded from analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>scMultiome sample preparation</title><p>To enrich hindbrain cells, tissue was dissected from the posterior edge of the eye to the level of somite 5 from 25 <italic>TG(hoxb1a:eGFP<sup>um8</sup></italic>) transgenic embryos (that express GFP in rhombomere 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choe et al., 2009</xref>) at 13hpf and 16hpf. Since the hindbrain primordium is difficult to detect at 10hpf, 100 whole embryos were pooled and used at this stage. Dead and unfertilized embryos were excluded from sample preparation. No other animals were excluded, and sample size was selected to achieve sufficient material for analysis and to smooth small variations in developmental stage. Tissue was collected in 1X PBS, dissociated by repeated pipetting through a p1000 tip, and centrifuged at 4°C at 400 G for 5 min followed by resuspension of the pellet in 500 μl of protease solution (10 mg/ml BI protease (Sigma, P5380), 125 U/ml DNase, 2.5 mM EDTA in PBS) for 15 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 4°C at 400 G for 5 min, resuspended in 1 ml HBSS + FBS (2%), filtered through a 20 μm cell strainer (pluriSelect, KL-071912), recentrifuged at 4°C at 400 G for 5 min, resuspended in 500 μl of HBSS + FBS (2%) and again filtered through a 20 μm cell strainer. Following centrifugation at 4°C at 400 G for 5 min, the cells were resuspended in 200 μl PBS. For nuclei isolation, we followed the 10 X Genomics recommended protocol with minor modifications. The dissociated cells were centrifuged at 900 G at 4°C for 5 min, resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1 X lysis buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 1 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, 0.01% Tween-20, 0.01 % NP40, 0.001% Digitonin (Invitrogen, BN2006), 0.1 mM DTT, 0.1 U/μl RNase inhibitor, in nuclease-free water) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Samples were then washed three times by centrifugation at 4°C at 900 G for 10 min and resuspension in 1 ml of chilled wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/μl RNase inhibitor in nuclease-free water). Finally, nuclei were counted and resuspended in 1 X nuclei buffer (provided in the 10 x Genomics Single-Cell Multiome ATAC Kit A; 1 mM DTT, 1 U/μl RNase inhibitor in nuclease-free water) at a final concentration of approximately 2000–3000 nuclei/μl for sequencing on the 10 X scMultiome platform.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq/ATAC-seq analysis</title><p>Fastq sequencing files from 10 X Genomics multiomic single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq were processed through Cell Ranger ARC (v1.0.1) with a zebrafish GRCz11 library to obtain UMI gene expression counts and ATAC peak fragment counts. These were analyzed using the standard methods in the Signac (v1.6.0) package in R. Briefly, a Seurat Object was created from the matrix.h5 and fragments.tsv.gz files, annotated with GRCz11.v99.EnsDb, and ATAC peaks corrected by calling with macs2 (v2.2.7.1) and finally filtered to exclude cells with low total RNA expression, low total ATAC counts, high percent mitochondrial gene expression, nucleosome expression &gt;2 or TSS enrichment &lt;1. Gene expression was normalized with SCTransform and the dimensionality was reduced with PCA. DNA accessibility was processed by performing latent semantic indexing. The Seurat weighted nearest neighbor method was used to compute a neighbor graph which was visualized with UMAP and clusters were annotated based on the expression of marker genes. Per cell motif activities were scored with chromVar. Significantly differentially expressed genes and differential activity motifs were identified for each cluster of cells. The Seurat Objects were integrated by finding the full intersecting ATAC peaks containing peaks in any of the three datasets and creating a new chromatin accessibility assay in each based on the full intersection peak file. The RNA-seq data was integrated with the Seurat V4 integration method and the new chromatin data integrated using Harmony followed by Seurat weighted nearest neighbor method to compute a UMAP and clusters. The cell types and UMAP embeddings for the DEAB-treated 13hpf Seurat Object were predicted using the wild-type 13hpf Seurat Object as a reference following the Seurat V4 reference mapping multimodal reference tutorial. The counts of cells in clusters which expressed a gene were based on cells which had a normalized expression of the gene greater than 0. Dendrograms were calculated with the Seurat BuildClusterTree function. Volcano plots were generated with EnhancedVolcano v1.12.0. A biological replicate of HB13hpf multiomic 10 X Genomics single-cell library was generated and processed identically to the previous single-cell libraries and the two replicates of HB13hpf were integrated and used to calculate GRNs using DIRECT-NET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). DIRECT-NET was written to analyze human single-cell multiomic data for GRNs and relies on matching gene names in the data with JASPAR motif names. In order to utilize the DIRECT-NET package we first converted our scRNAseq gene names to their human orthologs using the human and zebrafish orthology file downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org">https://zfin.org</ext-link> and modified the scripts slightly to accommodate the use of appropriate motif names.

Use the data to generate a GRN for hindbrain segmentation. This could be done using a toolkit such as SCENIC+. The resulting GRN could provide mechanistic insight into early aspects of hindbrain segmentation, which would increase the impact of this work. It would also serve as a very useful point of comparison with hindbrain GRN models described in the literature.</p><p>2. Infer cell trajectories to investigate the allocation of PHPD cells into separate rhombomeres. This could provide insight into how PHPDs become subdivided into rhombomeres. A tool such as scVelo or MultiVelo could be used.</p><p>3. This manuscript would benefit from a summary figure depicting the key findings and conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The goal of this project was to transcriptomically profile the developing zebrafish hindbrain from gastrulation through to rhombomere formation. In that regard, the authors have produced transcriptomic data which will be a valuable resource to the field. However, in its current form, the data is largely descriptive, and in the absence of functional experimentation unfortunately the data tells us very little that's new about the fundamental development or function of the hindbrain and its segmentation into rhombomeres.</p><p>In the absence of functional experiments, the authors speculatively assign relevance and significance. In trying to tie their transcriptomic data to dispel the notion and significance of odd versus even numbered rhombomeres the authors really miss the mark and a huge opportunity was lost.</p><p>The data the authors present does nothing to counter the developmental value of the concept and importance of odd versus even rhombomeres. In many respects I think the authors don't fully grasp the value or functional anatomical relevance of the odd versus even designation and the wealth of experimental data that revealed how the rhombomeres form as segments (based on differences in cell adhesion, and proliferation at the borders), and the consequences to hindbrain and PNS patterning and development from gene loss-of-function or over expression studies (especially of the Hox, Eph/Eprin and cadherin families), including behavioral changes from converting the character of one even numbered rhombomere to that of another. I'm surprised the authors didn't discuss the work of Chuck Kimmel's lab from 2000 or the principles conveyed in a recent review from Alice Bedois and Robb Krumlauf 2021 that clearly articulate the separation between molecular segmentation and cellular or physical separation and their evolutions. The hindbrain progenitor clusters HB1-3 that the authors identify molecularly, resemble very closely the anatomical or cellular pro-rhombomere A, B, C designations that have been part of the literature since the 1990s. See Osumi-Yamashita et al. 1997 for an example.</p><p>The authors' conclusions about egr2 and mafb being primary regulators of r3/r5 and r5/6 identity based on prevalence of binding motifs fits with the known roles of these genes in these segments from loss-of-function studies. Furthermore, the data relating FGF versus RA signaling to regulation of gene expression throughout the hindbrain recapitulates their well know roles. This was however a missed opportunity to functionally test new targets of these signaling pathways to show they have a functional role to play in hindbrain patterning, segmentation, or function with effects on the PNS as well.</p><p>The data presented in many figures is too small to be readable and will be lost on the readers. The most obvious examples of this are the dotplots in Figure 1B, 2B, 3C, 7C, S1C, S2C, S3C, S4C</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to review this work and your patience. My methodological expertise is limited here. However, I find the overall work to be conceptually compelling and worth publishing. I do not see the need for additional experiments, as long as the limitations of their work and approach are discussed as well as how those limitations may be overcome in the future.</p><p>The manuscript would be strengthened by consideration of the following points. First, why isn't r1 resolved into a pre-rhombmere cluster? Is it the lack of TF binding motifs unique to r1 or its closer alignment with the MHB? Given engrailed's expression into the MHB, could r1 and midbrain be another proto-cluster? Greater discussion of r1's place in early specification between MHB and HB1 would be helpful.</p><p>Dorsal vs ventral patterning can be delineated in this study. Can analysis be done to determine if cells can be further resolved into sub-rhombomere domains such as border vs center or further refinement in the D-V domain be achieved? The neurovascularization of rhombomere follows a notable but consistent pattern across all rhombomeres where sprouting starts in the ventral, A-P center of each rhombomere and follows a circuitous or arched route to connect to the basilar artery (Ulrich et al. 2011; Fujita et al., 2011) indicating a complex but rhombomere defined path for vascularization. Much of this does occur later at 26hpf, but it would be interesting to see if early clusters in 16hpf dataset could be resolved that might ultimately go on to serve as internal landmarks within a rhombomere.</p><p>Can border vs center neurons be defined? Beyond boundary or border cells can anterior vs posterior boundary cells be differentiated for a given rhombomere? For example, Fortin et al. 1999 and Coutinho et al. 2004 showed that both the R4 anterior and posterior boundaries were important for the maturation from LF vs HF bursting (likely as part of the chick primordial respiratory rhythm). While the situation regarding hindbrain CPG generation in zebrafish is not fully equivalent to other vertebrates in space and time, the possible delineation of border information here may yield key insights for a number of species. If the data is not of a sufficient density or quality, a discussion on what would be needed to further resolve additional sub-rhombomere features would be welcome.</p><p>Line 117 – HCR is not defined at its first use.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87772.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We took advantage of the fact that our Multiome data is the first to successfully distinguishing all hindbrain rhombomeres to generate the first complete set of GRNs for individual rhombomeres (new Figure 5 —figure supplements 1-7). We next demonstrate the utility of these GRNs by highlighting the presence of novel genes in the GRNs relative to prior work and by using them to demonstrate that even closely related rhombomeres (such as r3 and r5) possess clearly distinct GRNs (described in lines 205-223).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Nevertheless, our data can be used to identify transcriptional signatures that change during development (which is a goal of trajectory analysis). We demonstrate this by identifying genes whose expression changes as HB.1 and HB.2 develop in to their derivative rhombomeres (r2 and r3 vs. r5 and r6) in new figures (Figure 6I and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1) and discuss our findings in lines 306-318.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Thus, while it is plausible that r1 forms from HB.1 along with r2 and r3 (based on Figure 6D), we cannot say this with certainty, and we have made this clear in lines 452-454. We detect DV patterning at all stages, and this is discussed in lines 129-132, 137-138, 228-229 and 497-502. Using our current parameters, we do not detect evidence for sub-rhombomere features and this is now stated in lines 503-507.</p><p>While not requested by the Editors, we have also elected to further clarify how our work relates to the concept of an odd versus even pattern of rhombomere identities. We addressed this point in the discussion of the original submission, but Reviewer 2’s comments suggest that we were not sufficiently clear. There are numerous studies indicating an odd versus even periodicity in terms of cellular/anatomical rhombomere features – cell mixing, neuronal trajectories, neural crest contributions, etc. – but a comprehensive analysis of the molecular basis for such a periodicity has not been possible. Because we were able to identify each rhombomere individually in our scMultiome analysis, we can now carry out direct comparisons of the molecular identities of all rhombomeres. Our finding that there is no wholesale even versus odd molecular pattern is not in disagreement with the presence of cellular/anatomical odd versus even features, instead it raises the question how rhombomeres with unique molecular profiles nevertheless display odd versus even cellular/anatomical features. We have attempted to further clarify this in the text, most notably in the Discussion section in lines 408-431 where we also propose a potential explanation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
