both the sequence of lineage choices made by multipotent cells and to identify the genes influencing these decisions is challenging. Here we discover a pattern in the expression levels of a sparse subset of genes among cell types in B- and T-cell developmental lineages that correlates with developmental topologies. We develop a statistical framework using this pattern to simultaneously infer lineage transitions and the genes that determine these relationships. We use this technique to reconstruct the early hematopoietic and intestinal developmental trees. We extend this framework to analyze single-cell RNA-seq data from early human cortical development, inferring a neocortical-hindbrain split in early progenitor cells and the key genes that could control this lineage decision. Our work allows us to simultaneously infer both the identity and lineage of cell types as well as a small set of key genes whose expression patterns reflect these relationships.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20488.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20488.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>systems biology</kwd><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furchtgott</surname><given-names>Leon A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramanathan</surname><given-names>Sharad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008796</institution-id><institution>Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Menon</surname><given-names>Vilas</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramanathan</surname><given-names>Sharad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sparse patterns in gene expression allow simultaneous discovery of cell states, lineage relationships and key genes controlling developmental decisions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title id="head_1">Introduction</title><p>During development, pluripotent cells make a series of lineage decisions to give rise to the different cell types of the body. These lineage decisions are controlled by intra-cellular molecular networks that include transcription factors and signaling molecules. There are two fundamental challenges associated with understanding the differentiation of individual cells. The first is to identify lineage relationships: how cells and their progeny move from pluripotent through intermediate to terminally differentiated cell states. The second is to identify the key molecular drivers that allow cells to make fate decisions along their developmental trajectory.</p><p>Reconstructing cell lineages has traditionally involved prospectively tracking cells and their progeny using a variety of imaging or genetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buckingham and Meilhac, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Frumkin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Orkin and Zon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>). Recent progress in single-cell sequencing techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Grün et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jaitin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Patel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Paul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>) allows for a complementary view of the transcriptional states of individual cells during the course of development, providing static snapshots of the dynamics of the underlying molecular network. But inferring lineage relationships and the dynamics of the underlying molecular networks has proved difficult using transcriptional data alone, in part because of the high dimensional nature of these data. Overcoming this challenge would be particularly useful for understanding the development of human organs such as the brain where traditional lineage tracing experiments are more difficult.</p><p>High dimensional data analysis techniques such as PCA, ICA, or t-SNE, are useful at reducing dimensionality. However, since the resulting axes represent linear combinations of a large number of features (for example, expression levels of each gene), interpreting the analysis or making experimental predictions is sometimes challenging. Meanwhile, traditional statistical methods such as linear multivariate regression have limited applicability for detecting patterns in high dimensional data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Advani and Ganguli, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Donoho and Tanner, 2009</xref>). The challenges inherent in high-dimensional data analysis such as identifying discriminatory features are further exacerbated as the fraction of relevant features decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Donoho and Tanner, 2009</xref>). Computational techniques currently in use to cluster single cell data or to infer relationships among cells are built on these approaches, thereby assuming that all high-variance genes are equally relevant for pattern detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Marco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Satija et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, decades of work in developmental biology have revealed that combinations of a few transcription factors can be sufficient to experimentally perturb cell fate and developmental decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gilbert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Graf and Enver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>) suggesting that the expression patterns of a few genes may be most relevant for making computational inferences. Therefore, there is a need to detect patterns involving a small fraction of all genes. Unfortunately, except in the case of well-studied lineage decisions, we do not know the identity of this fraction.</p><p>In statistics, techniques relying on L1 regularization have been successful in contexts where the number of informative variables is known to be small but whose identities are unknown, both for regression problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Baraniuk, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Candès et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Tibshirani, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Wainwright, 2009</xref>) and for clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Witten and Tibshirani, 2010</xref>). Inspired by these successes in statistics, our aim here is to discover generalizable sparse patterns in gene expression data during development (if they exist), and to exploit these patterns to computationally infer the dynamics of cell state transitions from high-dimensional transcriptional data obtained during the course of development.</p><p>In this manuscript we analyze expression patterns among cell types with known lineage relationships in late hematopoiesis and discover a pattern in a sparse subset of genes that correlates with these relationships. We develop a Bayesian framework based on this gene expression pattern to simultaneously infer lineage transitions and the key genes that drive them. We apply this method to reconstruct the lineage tree among a different set of cell types in early hematopoietic development, and in this process identify many known drivers of early hematopoiesis, including <italic>Gata1</italic>, <italic>Cebpa</italic> and <italic>Ebf1</italic>. We further extend our method to analyze single-cell gene expression data, using genes exhibiting the discovered pattern to cluster cells from early brain development and to infer lineage relationships between these clusters. Our analysis reveals a split from early progenitors to putative neocortex and mid/hindbrain cell types, as evidenced by the mutually exclusive expression of region-specific genes such as <italic>FOXG1</italic>, <italic>LHX1</italic>, and <italic>POU3F2</italic> (<italic>BRN2</italic>). This prediction was validated experimentally in a separate work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). We finally discuss the advantages of using sparse patterns for making inferences and for modeling the underlying gene regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title id="head_2">Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title id="head_3">Discovering sparse patterns correlated with lineage transitions</title><p>In order to identify gene expression patterns that are robustly predictive of lineage relationships, we analyzed gene expression data from 41 cell types during B- and T- cell development that have an experimentally established developmental lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Heng et al., 2008</xref>).

Three such triplets are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. These triplets constituted both cell fate decisions (for example, cell type A gives rise to cell type B and C) and lineage progressions (cell type B gives rise to cell type A which then gives rise to cell type C). For each triplet, we noted which cell type was the progenitor or intermediate cell type (‘root’ cell type A) and which cell types were not (‘leaf’ cell types B and C). Note that even in the case in which cell type B gives rise to cell type A which gives rise to cell type C, we will refer to A as the ‘root’ and B and C as ‘leaves’ for that particular triplet. We analyzed transcription factor gene expression data for these triplets from the Immunological Genome Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Heng et al., 2008</xref>) since transcription factors are the ultimate drivers of cell fate decisions.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that specific expression patterns involving only single genes correlated well with lineage relationships between three cell types. Genes that are not differentially expressed within a triplet of cell types convey no information about relationships between the cell types. Therefore, we select genes with expression variability among the three cell types. The expression pattern of such genes can belong to one of only two possible patterns: (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>): the <italic>clear minimum pattern</italic>: the gene has a clear minimum level in one of the three cell types, with its distribution of gene expression levels being well-separated from the other two (p&lt;0.005 in both two sample <italic>t</italic>-tests between the minimum cell type and the other two cell types; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>); the <italic>clear maximum pattern</italic>: the gene has a clear maximum level in one of the cell types (p&lt;0.005 in both sample <italic>t</italic>-tests; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Note that both patterns can be satisfied simultaneously if the distribution of expression levels in the three cell types are all well-separated with a clear maximum and minimum. We tested if either of the two patterns correlated with the lineage topologies between the three cell types with known lineage relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Triplets of cell types can be separated into categories based on how many genes exhibit the aforementioned patterns. 56% of the triplets contained more than 10 genes exhibiting the clear minimum pattern, and in 100% of these triplets the majority of genes with expression fitting this pattern reached their minimum expression in one of the leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and never in the root of the triplet. The frequency with which the pattern correctly indicated the lineage relationship increased with the number of genes within a triplet exhibiting the pattern, thus suggesting a confidence measure. The genes showing the clear minimum pattern fell into two distinct groups, corresponding to whether the minimum expression level was in one or the other of the two leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Thus the expression pattern of the total set of clear minimum genes correlated with the topology. Since genes showing the clear minimum pattern correlated with lineage relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) between cell states both in the case of branches and linear sequences of cell state transitions, we refer to them as <italic>transition genes</italic>.</p><p>We further verified that the clear minimum pattern could be observed (a) in the set of all 25,194 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), (b) using FDR-adjusted p-values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), (c) in triplets of different lengths along the lineage tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), (d) in triplets both containing only internal nodes and including terminal nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>), (e) and in both lineage progression and cell fate decision triplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><p>The clear maximum pattern was a poorer indicator of lineage relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). 83% of the triplets had more than 10 genes exhibiting this pattern, but 10% of those showed the majority of genes with expression fitting this pattern reaching their maximum in the root while the others did so in the leaves. Crucially, the integrity of the relationship between the clear maximum pattern and lineage topology was not correlated with the number of genes exhibiting the pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). While the clear maximum pattern did not correlate with lineage relationships, genes exhibiting this pattern identify individual cell types, and therefore we will refer to them as <italic>marker genes</italic>.</p><p>There are many examples of genes known to be functionally important for lineage decisions whose expression patterns fit the clear minimum pattern. In the case of lateral inhibition commonly used during development, progenitor cells express genes together (for example, <italic>Notch</italic> and <italic>Delta</italic>) which are differentially expressed in the differentiated states (only <italic>Notch</italic> or only <italic>Delta</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Perrimon et al., 2012</xref>) reaching the minimum expression level in one of the leaves. The same pattern is also seen in multiple examples of lineage decisions often involving mutual inhibition, where key genes expressed in the progenitor are differentially regulated in the progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Graf and Enver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Qi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Thomson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). In each of these cases, key genes reach minimal expression levels in one of the leaves of the triplets.</p><p>The observation that genes exhibiting the clear minimum pattern are correlated with the lineage topology of a triplet of cell types further revealed that (i) only this fraction of transcription factors can be useful for inferring lineage relationships, and (ii) the identity of this fraction depends on which group of three cell types were analyzed. As the subset of genes that are informative varies based on the triplet of cell types being considered, establishing lineage relationship between all cell types at once as opposed to three at a time could be challenging. Indeed, our attempt to reconstruct the lineage relationships between all cell types using methods based on PCA failed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>We further evaluated the clear minimum pattern in 100 triplets in which there was no clear relation between the cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We found that while there were a substantial number of genes exhibiting a clear minimum in one of the three cell types in unrelated triplets, their minima were evenly distributed amongst the cell types. To quantify that the minima were evenly distributed, we counted the fraction of genes <italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic> which reached a clear minimum in cell type <italic>i = A, B, C</italic> (for A, B, and C unrelated cell types), and for each triplet, we computed the entropy <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. We compared the distribution of the entropy and the number of genes showing a minimum in any triplet for unrelated and related triplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The unrelated triplets have higher entropy and typically more genes with a minimum level. This suggested that unrelated triplets show a distinct pattern from the related triplets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title id="head_4">Using patterns to infer lineages</title><p>Together, these observations suggested a strategy for inferring the lineage topology between three cell types: each gene showing the clear minimum pattern with a minimum expression level in a particular cell type increases to the probability that this cell type is not the root of the topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We next developed a statistical machinery to systematically detect this pattern in gene expression data and to use the resulting sparse subset of genes to infer lineage relationships between three cell types at a time.

Although the values of the probabilities of the genes being transition genes vary with the value of the sparsity parameter, the relative order of different genes does not change.

The transition genes we discovered thus not only have gene expression patterns that reflect the lineage decision but also include functionally important genes.</p><p>In addition to the transition genes, we identified marker genes (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf47"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow/><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow/><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.8</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) present only in ST (including <italic>Mpl</italic> and <italic>Rai14</italic>, consistent with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Solar et al., 1998</xref>]) and then symmetrically downregulated in both CMP and MPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Although these genes were not used to determine the topology, they are good markers for cell types ST, CMP and MPP.</p><p>Plotting the cell types using the mean expression levels of the two transition gene class captures the fork in the gene expression space associated with the cell-fate decision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast with the PCA analysis of the cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), in which MPP appears to be an intermediate between the hematopoietic stem cell types (LT and ST) and CMP, the projection of the cell types onto the transition-gene subspace shows that ST splits into CMP and MPP.</p><p>In contrast to the case of the triplet of cell types CMP/ST/MPP, for triplet MEP/GMP/FrBC, the distributions of genes supporting different topologies are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus the most likely topology calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> is the null hypothesis (99%), which is that transition genes, if they exist, do not have patterns that depend on the cellular topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), in which case there is insufficient evidence to classify the triplet according to a particular non-null topology. The distribution of the maximal probability of non-null topologies in the different triplets is heavily concentrated near 1, allowing for clear separation between null and non-null triplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Null topologies were identified by the algorithm for triplets with cells that are from three terminal nodes (for example, the triplet MEP/GMP/FrBC) or from triplets that contain very distantly related triplets (for example, LT/CLP/ETP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title id="head_6">A lineage tree for early hematopoiesis</title><p>We next reconstructed the early hematopoietic lineage tree and identified transition genes involved in the different cell state transitions using all the non-null triplet relationships as constraints on the lineage relationships between all cell types. Out of the 165 possible triplets of hematopoietic progenitors, 144 showed one single non-null topology with probability greater than 0.6 over a range of the prior odds from 10<sup>−6</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup>. We next determined an undirected graph that recapitulates all of the individual triplet topologies (note that we are only inferring triplet topologies and are not inferring directionality). For example, although triplet CMP/LT/MPP has topology CMP – <bold>LT</bold> – MPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we could determine that LT cannot be the <italic>direct</italic> progenitor of CMP or MPP, because ST is an intermediate between LT and both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). We could thus 'prune' this triplet when inferring the full graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). A visualization of the pruning process is shown in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, where successive triplets are added to the graph, creating new edges and pruning others, leading to the final undirected tree. In practice, though, the pruning process was performed on all triplets simultaneously, not in succession.</p><p>The ST/CMP/MPP triplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>) immediately distinguishes between two competing models regarding the hierarchy of early hematopoietic progenitors. According to the traditional picture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Iwasaki and Akashi, 2007</xref>), MPP is the progenitor of CMP, and ST is the progenitor of MPP – therefore MPP should be an intermediate between ST and CMP and the topology of triplet ST/MPP/CMP should be ST – <bold>MPP</bold> – CMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left). According to a model suggested by Adolfsson and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolfsson et al., 2005</xref>), ST splits into CMP and MPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right), and the topology should be CMP – <bold>ST</bold> – MPP. We identify both CMP – <bold>ST</bold> – MPP and CMP – <bold>LT</bold> – MPP as the correct topologies, lending support to the Adolfsson model. The Adolfsson and traditional models differ in the topology of 9 triplets. The inferred expected topologies of 8 out of these nine triplets support the Adolfsson model, which led to the identification of the final tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The lineage tree that we determined is consistent with the Adolfsson model and contains three additional lineage decisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). First, CMP gives rise to MEP (megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitor) and GMP (granulocyte/macrophage progenitor). Second, MPP gives rise to MLP (multilineage progenitor), which then splits into the GMP and CLP (common lymphoid progenitor) cell types. In the final lineage decision, CLP gives rise to the ETP (pre-T) and FrA (pre-pro-B) cell types.</p><p>For each triplet of cell types along the tree, we identified transition and marker classes of genes. Among the 14 triplets that contained only adjacent cell types, we identified on average 24 marker genes per cell type and 25 transition genes (probability threshold of 0.8, prior odds <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf48"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). Many genes we discovered as belonging with high probability to the transition and marker classes of genes at each lineage decision are known in the literature to be functionally important genes, including classic hematopoietic regulators such as <italic>Cebpa</italic>, <italic>Sfpi1</italic>, <italic>Gata1</italic>, <italic>Satb1</italic>, <italic>Irf8</italic> and <italic>Ebf1</italic> (see full tables with references in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Additionally, the genes identified include many genes successfully used in hematopoietic reprogramming experiments, including <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Pbx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Together these observations suggest that the sparse subspace of transition and marker genes identified by our framework not only allows for accurate reconstruction of the lineage hierarchy but also constitutes a set of candidates for relevant biological functions.</p><p>As further validation of the inference method, we compared it to the method proposed by Grun et al. on a single-cell intestinal development data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Grün et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2016</xref>). We inferred lineages between each cell type based on their cluster identifications, excluding clusters with fewer than 10 cells, and constructed an undirected lineage tree by taking triplets with probability &gt; 0.6 and applying the pruning rule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The only disagreement between the two methods is the progression from crypt base columnar cells (C<sub>2</sub>) to different populations of Goblet cells (C<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>8</sub>). Grun et al. hypothesize a C<sub>2</sub> – C<sub>8</sub> – C<sub>4</sub> progression, while we infer the triplet C<sub>8</sub> – C<sub>2</sub> – C<sub>4</sub> with p&gt;0.99, suggesting that the progenitor C<sub>2</sub> gives rise to both differentiated Goblet subpopulations. Both lineage trees are supported by the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">van der Flier and Clevers, 2009</xref>).

We studied the differentiation of stem cells both into germ layer progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jang et al., 2017</xref>) and into cortical neurons. To study the latter, we analyzed single-cell gene expression data from 2217 cells from an in vitro differentiation protocol for early human neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were subjected to a SMAD inhibition-based cortical induction phase, a progenitor expansion phase, and a neural differentiation phase. Single cells were sorted at 12, 26, 54, and 80 days into differentiation, and their gene expression was profiled using the SMART-Seq2 technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Picelli et al., 2013</xref>). In the initial clustering of the single-cell data, dimensionality reduction by PCA (into 15 above-noise components) followed by t-SNE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Van Der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Satija et al., 2015</xref>) showed separation by day and <italic>SOX2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, the number of predicted clusters varied depending on the perplexity parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). In addition, no clear lineage or distance relationship among the putative types is immediately apparent from this clustering.

Computationally, it is necessary define a measure of similarity in the gene expression profiles of individual cells so as to be able to cluster them and define cell states. Here again, it is necessary to identify the correct gene subspace to use for clustering. Clustering and determining lineage have typically been performed sequentially and treated as independent problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Satija et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Trapnell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>). However, we found that it is informative to solve both these problems simultaneously.</p><p>In our framework, the relevant feature set for clustering is the set of marker and transition transcription factors from the triplets with non-null topologies. But determination of these sets of genes and of the transition topologies depends itself on knowledge of the cluster identities. Following previous work on sparse clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Witten and Tibshirani, 2010</xref>), we simultaneously determined optimal clusters, lineage topology and sets of transition and marker genes by iteratively selecting transition and marker genes and clustering the data using this set of features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>In order to utilize information about developmental distances in clustering, we iteratively maximized a joint distribution, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf74"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, over the developmental tree, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf75"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and the set of clusters of cells, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf76"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Overall, this global comparison, combined with the identification of genes with known regional expression, suggests that the inferred clusters from the in vitro data capture the diversity of differentiation into the early stages of the major neuronal lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These lineage predictions based on our analysis techniques were verified experimentally using viral barcoding in a separate work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Yao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To estimate the sparsity of the underlying network and to find a minimal subset of genes through which lineage could be inferred, we replicated the analysis while only considering a limited set of genes per triplet. We assembled a collection of 20 triplets with maximal leaf-to-leaf distance of 4 nodes, and non-null inferred topology. For each triplet, we ranked genes based on their odds of being a transition gene, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf124"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">𝒪</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> agnostic of the true topology of the triplet. We then replicated the inference process using only the N genes with the greatest odds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We found that with as few as 4 genes per triplet, the correct lineage topology could be inferred for all of the triplets. Genes with greatest odds comprise a restricted subset of genes for further experimental investigation. Further, these findings suggest that the dynamics of expression of just four specific genes are sufficient to monitor a particular lineage decision in single cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title id="head_8">Discussion</title><p>Finding an informative subspace of variables for data analysis is a general problem in machine learning, both for regression and clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Tibshirani, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Witten and Tibshirani, 2010</xref>); the innovation in this paper is to use a statistical pattern learned from known biology to inform this subspace search. The approach we take here is complementary to methods that project expression variability onto coordinates of PCA, ICA or t-SNE maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Marco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Satija et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>), which are combinations of all variables.

Following the dynamics of this small set of high-probability transition genes via fluorescent tagging could allow for the tracking of lineage decisions of individual cells in real time. Further, these genes provide a list of candidates for drivers of fate decisions, and hence a set of experimental hypotheses.</p><p>Not all genes give us equal information about the dynamics of differentiation. We discovered that genes showing the clear minimum pattern are most predictive of the sequence of lineage transitions during development. Although our pattern discovery and subsequent lineage reconstruction does not assume any functional role for the clear minimum pattern, we note that this pattern is shown by genes known to be regulators of development during hematopoiesis. The same pattern observed in many differentiating systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Graf and Enver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Qi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Thomson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>), and is consistent with mutual inhibition. Mutual inhibition, in turn, is hypothesized to play an important role in maintaining multi-stable systems and in mediating transitions between different stable states of multi-stable systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ferrell, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Discovery of sparse representations of the cell states and variability between them demonstrates the efficacy of low dimensional descriptions of the system. Understanding the dynamics and transitions of complex physical systems composed of a large number of variables has been driven by the discovery of low dimensional order parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Landau and Lifshitz, 1951</xref>). As opposed to measuring and modeling states as high dimensional objects in their native representation, order parameters provide low dimensional descriptions of the states and dynamics, which has proven crucial in developing both qualitative and quantitative models. Finding small subsets of genes which captures the lineage transitions in cells analogously provides a low dimensional subspace that captures the dynamics in genetic networks and can be useful for modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jang et al., 2017</xref>).

Mathematically, these cases come up when the genes that are most likely to show the clear minimum pattern (furthest on the right in a ‘dot plot’) suggest one topology, but if one used a more permissive value of the sparsity parameter, a different topology wins out. One of the cell types might have a small number of genes with very high odds, but then fewer genes with moderately high odds compared to the other cell types. We did not notice a clear pattern in the identity of the triplets exhibiting this behavior, but 9 of the 14 were triplets of length five or greater in the Adolfsson model. One of the triplets with this behavior was the MLP/CMP/GMP triplet, and the dominant topology was either MLP (at low prior odds) or CMP (at higher prior odds). Interestingly, both cell types are progenitors to GMP in the Adolfsson model.</p><p>We consider triplets for which only one non-null topology has probability <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf340"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow/><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow/><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>greater than 0.6.

Since we determined topologies by considering cell types three at a time, we obtain topological relationships involving both cell types that are nearest neighbors and cell types that are more distantly related. In order to reconstruct the tree, we must determine which cell types are nearest neighbors and which ones are separated by one or more intermediate cell types.</p><p>The set of inferred topologies allows us to determine which cell types are separated by intermediates. For every pair of cell types, we ask whether any of the inferred topologies features an intermediate between the two cell types. If such a topology has been inferred, we consider that the two cell types are not nearest neighbors, and that at least one other cell type is an intermediate. For example, we can ignore triplet CMP – <bold>LT</bold> – MPP because triplet LT – <bold>ST</bold> – CMP testifies that there exists an intermediate between LT and CMP, and triplet LT – <bold>ST</bold> – MPP testifies that there exists an intermediate between LT and MPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Note that this pruning rule does not assume the absence of loops. The lineage tree we infer for the hematopoietic progenitors contains a loop that includes ST to CMP to GMP on one side and ST to MPP to MLP to GMP on the other side. The loop involves triplets CMP – <bold>ST</bold> – MPP, ST – <bold>CMP</bold> – GMP, ST – <bold>MPP</bold> – MLP and MPP – <bold>MLP</bold> – GMP (we cannot determine the topology of triplet CMP/MLP/GMP). None of the triplets shows a topology that would allow us to break up the loop.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title id="head_27">Distinguishing between two models of hematopoiesis</title><p>The topologies we infer support the model from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolfsson et al. (2005)</xref>, in which CMP splits from ST-HSC. In particular, there are several triplets that can distinguish the Adolfsson model from the traditional picture, and they support the Adolfsson model. These triplets include CMP – <bold>ST</bold> – MPP, CMP – <bold>ST</bold> – MLP, MEP – <bold>ST</bold> – MLP and CMP – <bold>LT</bold> – MPP.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Arup Chakraborty (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Nir Yosef (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents an interesting framework for identification of lineage/ developmental relationships based on whole transcriptome profiles. The basic notion is that differentially expressed genes among triplets of samples (representing either a developmental fork or a linear developmental progression) should largely exhibit a prototypical pattern that reflects the lineage relationship. The authors successfully apply this to infer lineage relationship in hematopoiesis, using bulk- level RNA-seq. They then turn to apply their method to single cell data of early neuronal development, and concomitantly infer clusters of cells (each representing a developmental state), and their organization into a lineage structure. A subset of these results is followed up in another, yet unpublished manuscript. The algorithm was also used and followed up on in a companion manuscript of ESC differentiation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, this study is innovative and provides new insights into cell-type detection and lineage relationship. The method developed here is complementary to existing pseudotime inference methods in single-cell analysis and the paper is clearly written. Nonetheless, the paper may benefit from additional valuation of the method's performance, specifically – by applications to additional data sets and by systematic comparison with existing methods. More detailed descriptions of their methods is also merited, as described below.</p><p>1) &quot;Lineage progression&quot; triplets: In the case of cell type B that gives rise to cell type A that gives rise to cell type C the middle node (A) is chosen as the &quot;root&quot;</p><p>1.1) The terminology &quot;root cell type&quot; and &quot;terminal leaf cell types&quot; seems inappropriate and confusing in this case and should be revised.</p><p>1.2) The minimum-in-leaf model makes sense in the &quot;Lineage progression&quot; case as it captures the common scenario of genes that get turned on or off in a lineage path, with some persistence of this state. However, in such triplets that are distant enough along the path this may contradict the single &quot;pulse&quot; model (i.e., transient change) proposed in other studies. To explore this, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> should be revised. Currently it only shows the majority statistics. It would be important to see the fraction of genes that conform to the minimum-in-leaf model (which can be anywhere between 51% and 100%) while contrasting:</p><p>1.2.1) &quot;Lineage progression&quot; vs. &quot;cell fate decision&quot; triplets.</p><p>1.2.2) Triplets with leaves vs. triplets that only include internal nodes.</p><p>1.2.3) Triplets with different distance in the tree.</p><p>2) The Clear-minimum-in-leaf model.</p><p>2.1) To further support the validity of the minimum-in-leaf model, the latter extension to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (comment 1.2) should also include comparison between all related triplets vs. all unrelated triplets (i.e., representatives from three different branches).</p><p>2.2) Subsection “Discovering sparse patterns correlated with lineage transitions”, third paragraph: There are more than 2 possible patterns for differentially expressed genes between 3 cell types. In addition to the clear minimum A&lt;B=C and clear maximum A=B&lt;C there is also A&lt;B&lt;C, which is actually what is expected for lateral inhibition, discussed in the text several times. This pattern of three clearly distinct expression levels is not discussed at all in the text (in fact, it is excluded from the model, as described in subsection “1. Notation; Bayes’ Rule”, first paragraph). A clear example is HLF, mentioned in the text as higher in MPP compared to CMP, but it is much higher in the third member of the discussed triplet, ST (according to ImmGen skyline browser).</p><p>2.3) The B&amp;T subtree used for the observation has a very simple topology of only two branches. That might limit the generality of the conclusion. Indeed, the reconstructed lineage tree of the progenitors include a loop, which is not supported by the literature. Authors should discuss this difference from known tree topology. Also, why did they use their approach to reconstruct only hematopoietic progenitors and not all ~250 ImmGen populations?</p><p>3) First algorithm.</p><p>3.1) For the formula in the third paragraph of the subsection “Using patterns to infer lineages”, but I wonder how to draw a cutoff for a tree to be 'correct'. If the method is applied to unrelated cell-types, what is distribution of the p-values?</p><p>3.2) How robust is the lineage prediction model to the initialization procedure and parameter choices? For example, how sensitive is the resulting tree on the number of initial clusters? how sensitive are the results for the algorithm's parameters (e.g., probability cutoffs) or for sub-sampling of samples or genes? A similar stability analysis should also be included for the second algorithm (extension to single cells), which can be even more sensitive due to its iterative nature.</p><p>4) Application to hematopoiesis:</p><p>4.1) It is not clear how well the algorithm can separate related from unrelated triplets? (i.e., representatives from three different branches). While this is mentioned anecdotally in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it should be evaluated systematically, e.g., with AUROC.</p><p>4.2) Given the constraints of the algorithm, the aggregated lineage tree is undirected. While this is mentioned briefly, this key point should be better clarified in the main text.</p><p>5) Algorithm's extension to single cells.</p><p>5.1) Comparison to other methods.</p><p>Recently a number of papers have been published to infer cell lineages from single-cell gene expression data, such as Monocole (Trapnell et al. NBT, 2014), Treutlein et al. (Nature 2014), Wishbone (Setty, Nature Biotech, 2016), tSCAN (Ji, NAR, 2016), StemID (Grun, Cell Stem Cell 2016), and diffusion map (Haghverdi, Nature Methods, 2016). It will be useful to compare with these methods at least to get a sense to what degree this method provides new information (note: it looks like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> comes from Monocole, but we could not find a mention for it in the Results section).</p><p>5.2) Differential expression in single cells.</p><p>The t-test used to identify clear minimum and clear maximum patterns is appropriate for microarray analysis, but one limitation of t-test is it assumes the underlying distribution is normal, which is not true for RNAseq, and especially single-cell RNA-seq data. Specifically, single-cell RNA-seq can be severely under-powered because many genes (especially transcription factors) have low or even zero expression values due to dropout. Please discuss ways to incorporate more sophisticated tests that addresses this challenge (e.g., as in scDE), or demonstrate why this is not needed.</p><p>5.3) Related to that – the threshold used for definition of a pattern is p&lt;0.005 in a two sample t-test. Though not specified by the authors, it seems that as there are 1500 transcription factors tested, and 3 tests performed per gene (to test the separation of each of the 3 triplet members from the other two), 4500 tests were performed per triplet. Thus, one would expect to find 22 transcription factors (4500*0.005) with a pattern that pass this threshold for each triplet in the absence of a signal. The authors have to address the multiple comparisons issue.</p><p>6) Application on Single cell data</p><p>6.1) While the single-cell data comes from another manuscript that is under review elsewhere; the information provided on this data is insufficient.</p><p>6.1.1) Please provide a compete &quot;census&quot; of the data – how many cells from each condition; how many reads per library, which read lengths were used?</p><p>6.1.2) How was the data processed? Should we worry about potential confounders of library quality (which have been presented and discussed time and again in the recent scRNA-seq literature)?</p><p>6.2) The algorithm should have been demonstrated first on a single cell RNA-seq datasets where the true cell type transitions tree is known, such as one of the publicly available hematopoietic progenitors single cell RNA-seq datasets.</p><p>6.3) There is no estimate of how sparse is the resulting code – how many genes can be used to decipher the topology? Can they be identified ahead? Is it possible that any group of genes of similar size (~1500) can code for cell states and cell transitions with the same success as the transcription factors?</p><p>6.4) It is not clear how the tree was generated. Was it using the generic algorithm from the previous section, or by enforcing the temporal order of the samples? If it is the latter – please describe the procedure and explain why the generic algorithm does not work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20488.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Overall, this study is innovative and provides new insights into cell-type detection and lineage relationship.

B) intermediate node and endpoints. C) internal node and leaf nodes.</p><p>D) central node and terminal nodes.</p><p>We have also clarified our use of the terms “root” and “leaf, adding: “Note that even in the case in which cell type B gives rise to cell type A which gives rise to cell type C, we will refer to A as the “root” and B and C as “leaves” for that particular triplet.”</p><p><italic>1.2) The minimum-in-leaf model makes sense in the &quot;Lineage progression&quot; case as it captures the common scenario of genes that get turned on or off in a lineage path, with some persistence of this state.

Although biologically, each of these subsets could reasonably be expected to exhibit different statistics, we found that each scenario produced aggregate statistics that were indistinguishable from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> includes plots for each of the scenarios suggested in this comment, we have left the representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> unchanged for the purposes of clarity. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> has been appropriately updated.</p><p><italic>2) The Clear-minimum-in-leaf model.</italic> </p><p><italic>2.1) To further support the validity of the minimum-in-leaf model, the latter extension to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (comment 1.2) should also include comparison between all related triplets vs. all unrelated triplets (i.e., representatives from three different branches).</italic> </p><p>The comment suggests we compare the model’s success on triplets with known relationships vs. those with unknown relationships to establish an expectation of the false positives from our algorithm. This is an important point that we have addressed in two ways.</p><p>First, we have repeated the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> on a set of 100 unrelated triplets from the same hematopoietic lineage tree, where there is no clear relationship between the cell types. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> has been updated with these triplets. We found that while there were a substantial number of genes exhibiting a clear minimum in one of the three cell types in unrelated triplets, their minima were evenly distributed amongst the cell types (in contrast to what is seen in related triplets: the clear minimum pattern is not seen in the ‘root’). To quantify this, we counted the fraction of genes <italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic>which reached a clear minimum in cell type <italic>i = A, B, C</italic> (For A, B, and C unrelated cell types), and for each triplet, we computed the entropy 𝑆 = −∑<sub>i=</sub><italic><sub>A,B,C</sub> f<sub>i</sub></italic> log (<italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic>) and plotted this quantity vs. the number of genes showing a minimum in any triplet for unrelated and related triplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The unrelated triplets have higher entropy and typically more genes showing the downregulation pattern.</p><p>Second, we applied our Bayesian methodology to the set of 150 related and 100 unrelated triplets and compared the distribution of the probability of obtaining a non-null topology. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The two distributions diverge considerably, with an AUROC (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic) of 0.96, which is shown in a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p><italic>2.2) Subsection “Discovering sparse patterns correlated with lineage transitions”, third paragraph: There are more than 2 possible patterns for differentially expressed genes between 3 cell types. In addition to the clear minimum A&lt;B=C and clear maximum A=B&lt;C there is also A&lt;B&lt;C, which is actually what is expected for lateral inhibition, discussed in the text several times. This pattern of three clearly distinct expression levels is not discussed at all in the text (in fact, it is excluded from the model, as described in subsection “1. Notation; Bayes’ Rule”, first paragraph). A clear example is HLF, mentioned in the text as higher in MPP compared to CMP, but it is much higher in the third member of the discussed triplet, ST (according to ImmGen skyline browser).</italic> </p><p>This is an important comment and we have tried to clarify the text accordingly. First, we are defining the clear minimum pattern as A &lt; B &amp; A &lt; C and the clear maximum pattern as A &lt; C &amp; B &lt; C. (The p-value we calculate for the clear minimum model is the less significant of the two p-values for ttest(A,B) and ttest(A,C)). Given this definition, a gene displaying the A &lt; B &lt; C pattern would fulfill both the clear minimum and clear maximum patterns.</p><p>In our inference method, transition genes are similarly defined as having a minimum expression level, i.e. A &lt; B and A &lt; C. These constraints are enforced in the bounds of the numeric integration (point 3 of the subsection “Bayesian Framework for inferring cluster identities, state transitions, and marker and transition genes simultaneously”), and we are not constraining B=C. Indeed, Hlf is identified with high probability as a transition gene for triplet ST/MPP/CMP despite the two levels in ST and MPP. We have revised the text to discuss and clarify genes with three distinct levels (subsection “Discovering sparse patterns correlated with lineage transitions”, third paragraph).</p><p>In response to the comments we defined the A &lt; B &lt; C pattern as the “clear median” pattern, and we have evaluated how well the pattern correlates with the known topologies. Specifically, does the cell type with median expression level tend to be the root cell type of the triplet? We found that, similar to the clear maximum pattern, the clear median pattern was not a good predictor of the topology.</p><p>Therefore, for clarity, we did not define an additional clear median pattern in the main text, and clarified that genes with the clear median pattern belonged to both the clear minimum and clear maximum classes (in the aforementioned paragraph).</p><p><italic>2.3) The B&amp;T subtree used for the observation has a very simple topology of only two branches. That might limit the generality of the conclusion.</italic> </p><p>The B and T lineage tree is certainly simpler than some systems, but it contains a combination of lineage decisions as well as lineage progressions. While we were restricted by the relative paucity of well-verified lineage trees, our algorithm has been successfully tested on a) microarray data from early hematopoietic progenitors, b) single-cell gene expression data from intestinal cell differentiation (added in the revised manuscript, now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), c) single-cell gene expression data from early germ layer differentiation (accompanying Jang et al. manuscript). The predictions in this paper regarding a forebrain/hindbrain split in neural development have been experimentally verified with viral barcoding in human brain development (Yao et al., 2017). Together, this body of evidence suggests to us that the motif we identified and the approach we developed may have more general applicability.</p><p><italic>Indeed, the reconstructed lineage tree of the progenitors include a loop, which is not supported by the literature. Authors should discuss this difference from known tree topology.</italic> </p><p>The loop we predict in the progenitor tree is in fact supported by the Adolfsson model in the literature (Adolfsson et al., 2005). We have written a discussion of the differences between the reconstructed lineage tree and the traditional model (subsection “A lineage tree for early hematopoiesis”, second paragraph). To address the conflicting models of early hematopoietic progenitor lineages, we have compared the triplet topologies expected in the canonical model and in the Adolfsson model, and demonstrated that our predictions support the key features of the Adolfsson model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Also, why did they use their approach to reconstruct only hematopoietic progenitors and not all ~250 ImmGen populations?</italic> </p><p>We did not test our model on the entirety of the ImmGen data set because not all of the lineage relationships were verified experimentally as the B- and T- cell branches and early progenitors, meaning the results would not necessarily have been informative of the performance of the algorithm.</p><p><italic>3) First algorithm.</italic> </p><p><italic>3.1) For the formula in the third paragraph of the subsection “Using patterns to infer lineages”, but I wonder how to draw a cutoff for a tree to be 'correct'. If the method is applied to unrelated cell-types, what is distribution of the p-values?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this helpful suggestion. We compiled the inferred probability of triplet topologies for both related and unrelated triplets explored earlier from the B- and T- cell branches of the hematopoietic tree (see comment 2.2). We applied our Bayesian methodology to the set of 150 related and 100 unrelated triplets and compared the distributions of the probability of obtaining a non-null topology in a new supplemental subfigure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). As mentioned in a previous comment and addressed in the new supplemental figure, the two distributions diverge considerably, with an AUC of 0.96 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p><italic>3.2) How robust is the lineage prediction model to the initialization procedure and parameter choices? For example, how sensitive is the resulting tree on the number of initial clusters? how sensitive are the results for the algorithm's parameters (e.g., probability cutoffs) or for sub-sampling of samples or genes? A similar stability analysis should also be included for the second algorithm (extension to single cells), which can be even more sensitive due to its iterative nature.</italic> </p><p>We have added a subsection “Stability analysis” to the Materials and methods section, covering both algorithms. We found that the resulting trees are robust to probability cutoff, the prior probability of having a null topology p(T), the relative probabilities of irrelevant and marker genes, and the number of initial clusters.</p><p>In a new subfigure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), we have shown the distribution of maximal probabilities for non-null topologies in hematopoiesis. Here we show that triplets tend to have very high probabilities (close to 1), and varying the probability cutoff for triplet consideration does not affect the overall tree construction.</p><p>Additionally, a key input parameter into the algorithm is the expected prior distribution of means and standard deviations 𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎) used in the numeric integration (LXYZ). We have been using a uniform prior for both mean and standard deviation, but this requires specification of the ranges of the mean and standard deviation. We implemented an empirical prior 𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎) by estimating the empirical distribution over all the Immgen cell types, using kernel density estimation. The resulting hematopoietic lineage tree was identical. Using the kernel density estimated empirical prior may provide more stability in future analyses.</p><p><italic>4) Application to hematopoiesis:</italic> </p><p><italic>4.1) It is not clear how well the algorithm can separate related from unrelated triplets? (i.e., representatives from three different branches). While this is mentioned anecdotally in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it should be evaluated systematically, e.g., with AUROC.</italic> </p><p>We have systematically annotated each of the 165 triplets, noting the topologies expected in the traditional model and in the Adolfsson model, and the expected triplet length in each model. This information has also been added to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>. and demonstrated that our predictions support the key features of the Adolfsson model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Null topologies were identified by the algorithm for triplets with cells that are from 3 terminal nodes (e.g. the triplet MEP/GMP/FrBC) or from triplets that contain very distantly related triplets (e.g. LT/CLP/ETP).</p><p>For 7 triplets with terminal nodes in there is no expected topology (e.g. MEP/GMP/FrA), the method identified a non-null topology (e.g. GMP). However, these misidentified triplets did not affect the final tree, since they were eliminated using the pruning rule (subsection “Pruning rule”), which prunes triplets that contain links between cell types that are not nearest neighbors. In the case of MEP/GMP/FrA, MEP and GMP are separated by CMP, and GMP and FrA are separated by MLP.</p><p>By our count, the Adolfsson and traditional models differ in the topology of 9 triplets. The inferred expected topologies of 8 out of these 9 triplets support the Adolfsson model, which led to the identification of the final tree.</p><p><italic>4.2) Given the constraints of the algorithm, the aggregated lineage tree is undirected. While this is mentioned briefly, this key point should be better clarified in the main text.</italic> </p><p>This is indeed a key point that is easily missed. We have amended the text to clarify this point, stating that “we next determined an undirected graph that recapitulates all of the individual triplet topologies (note that we are only inferring triplet topologies and are not inferring directionality).”</p><p><italic>5) Algorithm's extension to single cells.</italic> </p><p><italic>5.1) Comparison to other methods.</italic></p><p><italic>Recently a number of papers have been published to infer cell lineages from single-cell gene expression data, such as Monocole (Trapnell et al. NBT, 2014), Treutlein et al. (Nature 2014), Wishbone (Setty, Nature Biotech, 2016), tSCAN (Ji, NAR, 2016), StemID (Grun, Cell Stem Cell 2016), and diffusion map (Haghverdi, Nature Methods, 2016). It will be useful to compare with these methods at least to get a sense to what degree this method provides new information (note: it looks like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> comes from Monocole, but we could not find a mention for it in the Results section).</italic> </p><p>While our method is complementary to many of these alternative approaches, we have addressed some specific areas in which our method can add insight to analysis of single cell data. We applied Monocle 2, tSCAN, and StemID to the neuronal differentiation data set in this paper and were unable to extract meaningful results as shown in a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In each of these cases, it was difficult to extract experimentally verified hypotheses from the analysis. In particular, the forebrain/hindbrain split in early development was not correctly identified (this split has been verified experimentally in Yao et al., 2017). We have also addressed this in the main text, adding that: “Analysis of this data with other recent methods such as Monocle and Monocle2 (Trapnell et al., 2014), TSCAN (Ji and Ji, 2016), and StemID (Grün et al., 2016) did not clearly reconstruct lineage or infer key genes regulating transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> – Bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Monocle2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) produces a tree with complex branching, but <italic>Sox2Sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitors and DCX+ differentiated neurons do no clearly separate”.</p><p>In addition, we performed a more in-depth comparison with StemID to explore the different conclusions one could gain from these orthogonal methods. We analyzed the intestinal cell differentiation system investigated by Grun et al., 2015 and compared our conclusions with those that they found. Using the Grun et al. cell clusters and a minimum cluster size of 10 cells, we accurately predicted the topology of each triplet in the lineage tree which they reconstruct, as shown in a new supplemental figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p><p>Our method is complementary to StemID in that for each of the triplets, we were able to identify a sparse set of transition genes which could be experimentally perturbed to explore the dynamics of the system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>), many of which have known developmental relevance.</p><p><italic>5.2) Differential expression in single cells.</italic></p><p><italic>The t-test used to identify clear minimum and clear maximum patterns is appropriate for microarray analysis, but one limitation of t-test is it assumes the underlying distribution is normal, which is not true for RNAseq, and especially single-cell RNA-seq data. Specifically, single-cell RNA-seq can be severely under-powered because many genes (especially transcription factors) have low or even zero expression values due to dropout. Please discuss ways to incorporate more sophisticated tests that addresses this challenge (e.g., as in scDE), or demonstrate why this is not needed.</italic> </p><p>We have now clarified that the single cell data is analyzed using the Bayesian formalism introduced earlier, and does not use a <italic>t</italic>-test to quantify separation between distributions. The inference methodology does, however, implicitly fit the expression data to a log-normal distribution. The choice of a log-normal distribution could potentially confound the results, particularly in cases with significant zero-inflation. This is a potential area for improvement in our algorithm, but the method can easily be adapted to model different distributions of RNA expression, such as γ distributions (Shahrezaei and Swain, 2008; Wills et al., 2013) and β-Poisson distributions (Vu et al., 2016; Delman and Hemberg, 2016). In either case, the probability of the data given different topologies would be computed by numeric integration over the parameters of the distribution, e.g. 𝛼 and 𝛽 for the Γ distribution, by replacing the log-normal distributions in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6 equ8 equ9">Equations 6, 8 and 9</xref> with ones from the appropriate model.</p><p>The choice of the right parametric form for single-cell RNA expression is still an area of active research. Our choice of log-normal distributions assumes that higher order moments of the distributions (beyond standard deviation) ought to have a minimal contribution to the predictions, but we have not tested this extensively.</p><p><italic>5.3) Related to that – the threshold used for definition of a pattern is p&lt;0.005 in a two sample t-test. Though not specified by the authors, it seems that as there are 1500 transcription factors tested, and 3 tests performed per gene (to test the separation of each of the 3 triplet members from the other two), 4500 tests were performed per triplet. Thus, one would expect to find 22 transcription factors (4500*0.005) with a pattern that pass this threshold for each triplet in the absence of a signal. The authors have to address the multiple comparisons issue.</italic> </p><p>We computed the FDR-adjusted p-values for the pattern recognition and found that the clear minimum pattern is still robust to this multiple hypothesis correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In the Bayesian inference method, the prior odds of being a transition gene serves as a sparsity parameter which directly addresses the multiple comparisons issue.</p><p><italic>6) Application on Single cell data</italic> </p><p><italic>6.1) While the single-cell data comes from another manuscript that is under review elsewhere; the information provided on this data is insufficient.</italic> </p><p><italic>6.1.1) Please provide a compete &quot;census&quot; of the data – how many cells from each condition; how many reads per library, which read lengths were used?</italic> </p><p><italic>6.1.2) How was the data processed? Should we worry about potential confounders of library quality (which have been presented and discussed time and again in the recent scRNA-seq literature)?</italic> </p><p>We have added a new subsection to the Materials and methods to include this information (“In Vitro Neuronal Differentiation”). In particular, as the single cells were profiled independently using the Smart- Seq2 protocol (without pooling before amplification, as in methods such as Cel-Seq, STRT, or Drop-Seq), we did not observe the batch effects present in pooling-based methods. We would also like to note that the paper detailing the collection of this data set has now been published in Cell Stem Cell(Yao et al., 2017).</p><p><italic>6.2) The algorithm should have been demonstrated first on a single cell RNA-seq datasets where the true cell type transitions tree is known, such as one of the publicly available hematopoietic progenitors single cell RNA-seq datasets.</italic> </p><p>We applied our method to the intestinal cell differentiation from Grun et al., (Figure 4—figure supplement 3) and found that our method correctly predicts the topology of each triplet based on the Grun et al. reconstructed lineage tree. Further, we identified key genes in many of the triplets with known developmental relevance. By reducing the system to a sparse measure of distances between cell types in the lineage tree, we can provide complimentary biological insight to existing methods which would allow for further experimental investigation. We have modified the main text in the last paragraph of the subsection “A lineage tree for early hematopoiesis”, to discuss this additional analysis.</p><p><italic>6.3) There is no estimate of how sparse is the resulting code – how many genes can be used to decipher the topology? Can they be identified ahead? Is it possible that any group of genes of similar size (~1500) can code for cell states and cell transitions with the same success as the transcription factors?</italic> </p><p>To address this suggestion, we explored the sparsity of the code based on our reconstruction. We assembled 20 triplets from brain development that were originally inferred to be non-null and had a maximal leaf-to-leaf distance no greater than 5. For each triplet, we ranked genes based on their odds of being transition genes 𝒪<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>. We then attempted to infer the correct topology using only the N genes per triplet with the largest odds, and varied N between 1 and 50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We find that with just 4 genes per triplet (80 total), we can correctly infer the topology of each of these triplets. Note that these genes are ranked by their odds of being transition genes, which is agnostic to the true topology of the triplet. Given assignments of cells to cell types (or clustering), these genes can be found without knowing the topology of the tree by computing the odds. We thank the reviewers for pointing out this relevant feature of the tree reconstruction. We have added discussion of the sparsity to the last paragraph of the subsection “Inferred lineage tree for human excitatory neuronal progenitors from in vitro single-cell data over 80 days of differentiation”.</p><p><italic>6.4) It is not clear how the tree was generated. Was it using the generic algorithm from the previous section, or by enforcing the temporal order of the samples? If it is the latter – please describe the procedure and explain why the generic algorithm does not work.</italic> </p><p>We have now clarified in the main text (subsection “Inferred lineage tree for human excitatory neuronal progenitors from in vitro single-cell data over 80 days of differentiation”, sixth paragraph) that the tree was compiled using a) triplets with P&gt;0.6, b) knowledge that <italic>Sox2Sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> cell types were progenitors, and DCX+ cell types were differentiated (so a DCX+ cell type could not transition to a <italic>Sox2Sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> cell type), c) using the pruning rule as described in the Materials and methods section. Using these rules, the tree was assembled by hand. A method for computationally generating a tree from a set of triplets would be a valuable extension of this work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
