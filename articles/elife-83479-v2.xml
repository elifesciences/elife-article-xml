In response, bacteria may become resistant by modifying surface receptors, by lysogenization, or by other poorly known processes. All these mechanisms affect bacterial fitness and population dynamics. To understand the evolution of phage resistance, we co-cultivated a phage-sensitive strain (BJ1) and a polylysogenic <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> strain (ST14) under different phage pressures. The population yield remained stable after 30 days. Surprisingly, the initially sensitive strain remained in all populations and its frequency was highest when phage pressure was strongest. Resistance to phages in these populations emerged initially through mutations preventing capsule biosynthesis. Protection through lysogeny was rarely observed because the lysogens have increased death rates due to prophage induction. Unexpectedly, the adaptation process changed at longer time scales: the frequency of capsulated cells in BJ1 populations increased again because the production of the capsule was fine-tuned, reducing the ability of phage to absorb. Contrary to the lysogens, these capsulated-resistant clones are pan-resistant to a large panel of phages. Intriguingly, some clones exhibited transient non-genetic resistance to phages, suggesting an important role of phenotypic resistance in coevolving populations. Our results show that interactions between lysogens and sensitive strains are shaped by antagonistic co-evolution between phages and bacteria. These processes may involve key physiological traits, such as the capsule, and depend on the time frame of the evolutionary process. At short time scales, simple and costly inactivating mutations are adaptive, but in the long term, changes drawing more favorable trade-offs between resistance to phages and cell fitness become prevalent.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>K pneumoniae</kwd><kwd>polylysogen</kwd><kwd>phage resistance</kwd><kwd>coevolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR 18 CE12 0001 01 ENCAPSULATION</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rendueles</surname><given-names>Olaya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rocha</surname><given-names>Eduardo PC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EQU201903007835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rocha</surname><given-names>Eduardo PC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The emergence and evolution of different phage-resistance strategies during coevolution between a phage-sensitive strain and a polylysogenic competitor depend on the amount of phage pressure, the fitness costs of resistance, and how these may change at different time scales.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parasites shape the life history and fitness of their hosts. They also impact community structure via predation and competition, and thereby affect numerous ecological and evolutionary processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koskella and Brockhurst, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pedersen and Fenton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lefèvre et al., 2009</xref>). Bacteriophages (phages) are very abundant predators of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brüssow and Hendrix, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suttle, 2007</xref>). Temperate phages either follow a lytic cycle in which they replicate within bacterial cells and release infectious virions, or a lysogenic cycle in which they integrate the bacterial genome and replicate with it. Nearly half of the sequenced bacterial genomes are lysogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Touchon et al., 2016</xref>). The dual lifestyle of temperate phages is costly, but can also provide the host with multiple advantages. During lysogeny, prophages may increase biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gödeke et al., 2011</xref>), phosphate acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sullivan et al., 2005</xref>), or express virulence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Busby et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fasano et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Varani et al., 2013</xref>). Inactivated prophages leave genes in the genome that are co-opted by the host and result in functional innovation, e.g., as bacteriocins used in bacterial warfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Winstanley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bobay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakayama et al., 2000</xref>). Prophages also protect bacteria from closely related phages, a process called superinfection resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bondy-Denomy et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, when the lytic cycle is initiated in a small subpopulation, it may facilitate colonization by directly mediating competition within communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Joo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harrison and Brockhurst, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wendling et al., 2021</xref>), because the released virions will infect and lyse closely related but not identical strains. This can promote the acquisition of adaptive traits from bacterial competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wendling et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haaber et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, it is suggested that prophage induction affects bacterial population dynamics, community structure, and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bondy-Denomy and Davidson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bossi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Paepe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nanda et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>How parasite pressure may alter co-evolving bacterial populations has been seldom addressed, and most of these studies focused on virulent phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brockhurst et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fazzino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lourenço et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weinbauer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weinbauer and Rassoulzadegan, 2004</xref>). A few other studies have tested the impact of coevolution between lysogens and non-lysogens and the advantages the former provides in vivo by mediating bacterial interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Joo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Paepe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frazão et al., 2022</xref>). However, the relevance of poly-lysogeny for population dynamics during hundreds of generations remains unknown. Further, little is known about the interactions between the different resistance mechanisms, how they affect the cost of resistance, and how they may provide an opportunity for the emergence of novel mechanisms. To test this, we co-evolved two natural isolates of <italic>K. pneumoniae,</italic> an ubiquitous species, of which at least 75% of the species’ genomes are polylysogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Sousa et al., 2020</xref>): (i) the hypervirulent BJ1 strain without inducible or cryptic prophages, that was isolated from a liver abscess (ST380) and (ii) a polylysogenic multidrug-resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strain (ST14) isolated from a urinary tract nosocomial infection. ST14 produces multiple infectious virions for which the BJ1 is known to be sensitive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Sousa et al., 2020</xref>). Based on previous studies, cell defense mechanisms, such as restriction-modification systems, are not expected to impact population dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Sousa et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that resistance would rather emerge by lysogenization under strong phage pressure and by inactivation of the extracellular capsule, the main surface receptor of phage at intermediate and low phage pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Sousa et al., 2020</xref>). To test if, and how, prophage induction affects the competition outcome between the two strains, we followed their population dynamics through time. We then tested for the emergence of phage resistance in the susceptible strain. This revealed the diversity and interactions of the emerging mechanisms of phage resistance. It also provided unique insight into how these different mechanisms coexist within a population and evolve through time in response to infection pressure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Temperate phages provide fitness advantage during competition</title><p>We first aimed at understanding if the prophages of strain ST14 provide a fitness advantage during competition with phage-susceptible strain BJ1. To limit confounding factors such as competition for resources, we grew the cells in a rich environment. To modulate the amount of phage produced, and the ability of the latter to infect, we defined three conditions: (i) LB, (ii) LB supplemented with 0.2% citrate to inhibit phage infection due to calcium chelation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Sousa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shafia and Thompson, 1964</xref>), and (iii) LB with mytomicin C (MMC, 0.1 µg/mL) to increase the phage titers in the environment. MMC was added at a concentration that did not significantly affect the growth of BJ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), and despite the consumption of citrate by <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, after 24 hr there is still a large amount of citrate remaining, that is sufficient to inhibit infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also quantified the amount of PFU/mL produced by strain ST14 in the different growth conditions. As expected, phage production in ST14 was significantly higher in MMC compared to the two other treatments. Interestingly, ST14 grown in citrate resulted in a marginal increase in phage production relative to the control (LB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><p>To test whether phages could contribute to the competitive fitness of their host, we co-inoculated both strains (BJ1 and ST14) at an initial ratio of 1:1 for 24 hr. First, we tested if mixing the two strains affected the total growth or the population yield. We observed no increased cell death due to the competition in the different growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Then, we calculated the competitive index of the strains and observed that there was a large fitness advantage for strain ST14 in all three conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This was most likely because ST14 has both a higher growth rate and population yield than BJ1, except in the presence of MMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Most importantly, we also observed differences in the competitive index depending on the amount of phage released, or its ability to infect the BJ1 (Kruskal-Wallis, dF = 2, p=0.006). This effect could be due to the different population yields of each strain in each environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To take into account only the fitness effects due to phages, we quantified the strain-interaction effects using C<italic><sub>i</sub>(j),</italic> which measures the effect of mixing two strains <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> on the viable population size of strain <italic>i</italic>, relative to pure culture controls. This measure accounts for the absolute performance of each competitor in mixed groups (see Methods). Negative C<italic><sub>i</sub>(j</italic>) values indicate that strain <italic>i</italic> have a lower population yield during growth in the presence of <italic>j</italic> than in pure culture, and positive values indicate the opposite. For the phage producer, strain ST14, the competition had no positive or negative effect on total population yield, most likely because the increased release of viruses resulting in ST14 death is outweighed by an exacerbated death of phage-sensitive BJ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the presence of citrate, a condition in which phage cannot infect, the growth of strain BJ1 was not significantly inhibited. However, in the absence of citrate, when phages can infect, C<italic><sub>i</sub>(j</italic>) was significantly lower than zero, indicating a negative effect on the growth of strain BJ1. This effect was dependent on the amount of phage released into the environment, as an increased production of phages by ST14 due to MMC leads to an even lower C<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>j</italic>) for BJ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Kruskal-Wallis, dF = 2, p=0.007).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fitness of strains during competition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The competitive index is calculated as the final frequency of each strain divided by the initial frequency in the mixed cocultures. * <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg correction.

Taken together, our results showed that prophages can increase the fitness of their host in co-culture by disfavouring the non-lysogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Resistance to temperate phages emerges rapidly during coevolution</title><p>To assess whether ST14 prophages could provide a long-term fitness advantage to their hosts, and allow them to outcompete non-lysogens, we set up an experiment in which we allowed three independent mixed populations composed of phage-producing ST14 and phage-susceptible BJ1 strains to coevolve during 30 days, in the three previously defined environments (LB, LB supplemented with 0.2% citrate, and LB supplemented with MMC). To follow the evolution of each strain, we plated the populations every day on selective media and counted CFU. As expected, no significant changes in the group yield were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is mostly explained because the dominant strain, the phage producer, does not change its population yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, the frequency of BJ1 decreased rapidly during the first four days, suggesting a large initial fitness disadvantage of this strain. This is observed in all three conditions, but it is accelerated in conditions in which phage release is exacerbated (with MMC) and bacterial infection is not restricted (without citrate). Decrease in BJ1 populations was also correlated with large increases in phage production during the first ten days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, shortly after the beginning of the experiment, both phage production and evolved BJ1 populations seem to stabilize, except for one BJ1 population evolving in MMC (which increases significantly in frequency). This suggested the emergence of phage resistance. However, after day 15, BJ1 populations evolving in MMC remain stable whereas the ones in the other conditions showed a second decrease in CFUs. This second decrease continued until day 22, beyond which BJ1 populations once again stabilized at <italic>ca</italic> 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL. Taken together, in 30 days of coevolution, ST14 did not completely displace BJ1 from the populations, even in conditions where the production of the phage by strain ST14 is exacerbated. Indeed, across all conditions, and throughout all the experimental evolution, infectious virions were actively produced and released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), representing a constant, active selective pressure. This suggests that prophage-mediated competition can be counter-balanced by the evolution of resistance mechanisms in the competitor strain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Population yield and proportion of capsulated clones of the two strains during the coevolution experiment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Total CFU per mL of each strain was estimated every day on selective media.

We observed that the emergence of non-capsulated clones in the BJ1 background is exacerbated in the environment in which phage pressure is greater (insert, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and is diminished when phages cannot infect. Hence, phage pressure accelerated capsule inactivation.

We expected to find BJ1 lysogens, since super-infection exclusion due to the lysogenization of capsulated bacteria could prevent further infection by the same phages. Further, our previous work had already shown that, when infected with phage lysate at high titers, at least two of the four intact phages from strain ST14 could lysogenize BJ1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Sousa et al., 2020</xref>).

As expected, lysogens emerged in all populations, but remained at low frequency and their numbers quickly dwindled after their emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We verified that the 94 identified lysogens, out of the 1209 screened clones, were <italic>bona fide</italic> lysogens. This could be confirmed by their production of phages infecting naïve BJ1 cells, both when induced by MMC (92 out of 94), and in the absence of induction (87 clones out of 94) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we observed that when new lysogens are grown in LB, in the absence of induction, there is a detectable amount of cell death, and growth delay at the end of the exponential phase in at least in 29 out of 94 tested clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). This could correspond to a high frequency of spontaneous induction in the newly lysogenized bacteria. Indeed, we observed a large amount of phage release, as evidenced by large inhibition halos on an overlay of ancestral BJ1. We then selected five different lysogens that consistently showed large inhibition halos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and exacerbated death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) descending from three independently evolving BJ1 populations. We quantified the amount of phage released, in the absence of induction, on a lawn of ancestral BJ1. New lysogens produced between 100 and 1000 more PFU/mL than the ancestral phage producer (ST14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This suggests that protection by lysogeny results in significant fitness costs because prophage induction is frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3A</xref>).</p><p>To study the impact of prophage acquisition on the long-term stability of lysogens in a population, we used eVIVALDI, an individual-based model for microbial interactions and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Sousa and Rocha, 2019</xref>). We used these simulations to explore different rates of induction of prophages, in the presence or absence of abiotic agents. We designed a scenario where a population of initially sensitive bacterial cells is exposed to an inoculum of temperate phages, and we followed the populations for a period of 150 iterations (e.g. approximately 150 generations). Simulated bacteria could either be infected by phage (thus either dying upon a lytic infection or becoming lysogens if the phage integrates the bacterial genome) or become resistant to phage by mutation (i.e. capsule inactivation, which decreases their growth rate). We then measured, over time, both the total number of cells and the proportions of lysogens.</p><p>We observed two main patterns. When prophages have low spontaneous induction rates (1 to 5%), they generate stable, non-costly lysogens. Consequently, phages spread slowly in the bacterial population, which gives time for the phage-resistant mutants to emerge and increase to high frequencies. However, because these mutations are costly, lysogens slowly displace these mutants. This results in a sigmoidal-like temporal frequency of lysogens, where at the end of the simulations most of the resistant population is composed of lysogens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and lower left part of panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). These dynamics are in contrast with the bell-shaped dynamics observed for high or intermediate rates of spontaneous prophage induction (i.e. ≥11%), where lysogens quickly invade the population but are absent at the end. Such high rates correspond to unstable lysogens that quickly die due to spontaneous induction of their prophages. These conditions facilitate the propagation of phage throughout the population (due to fast phage amplification), and result in the rapid emergence of new bacterial lysogens (t=10 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Becoming a lysogen can be advantageous if these cells are protected from new phage infections. However, if there are high rates of prophage induction, lysogeny may become less adaptive than other mechanisms of protection, e.g., receptor loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). As a result, when spontaneous induction rates are high and other, potentially fitter, resistant clones emerge, few or no lysogens are expected to survive as they will be outcompeted (top-right areas for the heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). This is consistent with our experimental results, where BJ1 clones quickly become lysogens with high induction rates which leads to their removal from the population by the end of the experimental evolution.</p><p>In our simulations, the absence of capsule-inactivating mutations (resistance probability = 0, rightmost column of the heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>), implies that populations either become extinct (if induction rates are too high) or are completely composed of lysogens. In contrast, our in vitro experiments revealed some resistant clones that were still capsulated and non-lysogens, indicating alternative mechanisms of resistance to phage. These novel clones were more frequent in populations under high phage induction pressure (MMC), when the cost of lysogeny is high, and less frequent undergrowth in LB with or without citrate (Kruskal-Wallis, dF = 2, <italic>P</italic>=0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Taken together, our results show that most clones became resistant to capsule inactivation, a few by lysogenization, and others by novel mechanisms. These experimental results fit our simulations in suggesting the existence of competition between multiple phage resistance mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The cost of the resistance mechanism varies with phage pressure and across time scales</title><p>To test the competitive fitness of the evolved clones having different phage-resistance mechanisms, we compared the area under growth curves of all BJ1 evolved clones isolated in the presence or in the absence of phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the first ten days of the evolution experiment, non-capsulated clones had a higher AUC than all other resistant clones in the presence of the phage and in the controls. This can be explained both by their intrinsic fitness advantage in nutrient-rich environments, compared to wild-type clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buffet et al., 2021</xref>) and by their efficient resistance to phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Sousa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hesse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tan et al., 2020</xref>).

However, this is not so, in the presence of phage at short evolutionary time scales. At longer time scales (after ten days of evolution), resistant capsulated clones are fitter than lysogens, in the presence of phage, supporting our previous observations that lysogeny incurs a high fitness cost. This suggests that resistant mechanisms that emerge more frequently or that are accessible in evolutionary terms, such as capsule inactivation and lysogeny could be initially selected for, but become less advantageous at longer timescales where other less costly resistance mechanisms seem to provide higher fitness.

Five independent clones had mutations in the capsule operon. Two clones (3E1 and 9G11) had frameshift mutations in a gene coding for an acyltransferase, <italic>orf13</italic>, and potentially leading to a change in the capsule’s biochemical composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These clones were fully resistant to phage both in liquid and on agar and had a diminished capsule production, comparable to the phage-susceptible ∆<italic>rcsB</italic> mutant. However, phage particles could not successfully adsorb to the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The three remaining clones had a non-synonymous mutation in <italic>orf13</italic> (2D2) and in <italic>wcaJ</italic> (9H3) and an 11 base-pair deletion in the capsule regulator <italic>wzi</italic> (9H7). These clones have reduced capsule expression comparable to mutations 3E1 and 9G11 in <italic>orf13</italic>, reduced phage adsorption, and an increased resistance to phage in liquid media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Surprisingly, these three clones are susceptible to phage when growing on agar. These results suggest that the effect of small capsule modifications on phage resistance might be dependent on the environment. Finally, we found no mutations in known phage defense mechanisms, such as CRISPR-Cas or restriction-modification enzymes. Taken together, our results show that there are multiple paths to resistance that involve modulating either the capsule amount or its composition.</p><p>Interestingly, the remaining seven clones that were identified in our initial screens to be resistant seem to be susceptible to phage lysate in all subsequent tests. Despite their marginally lower capsule production, we could not detect mutations in their genome relative to their ancestors (except for one clone with an intergenic mutation). To discard the possibility that this could be due to a problem in our initial screen for resistant clones, we returned to the original glycerol stocks and retested these clones for their resistance to phage during growth in liquid (i.e. the same conditions as the screen) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). To avoid a possible loss of the phenotype due to culture passaging, we initiated the growth curves directly from the glycerol stock without performing a preconditioning culture, that is, an acclimation step. When the culture reached OD ~0.2, we added the phage lysate. We observed that the cultures grown directly from the stocks were resistant to phage. The difference between the clones from the glycerol stock and those sequenced is that the sequenced clones underwent two extra rounds of LB passaging without phage pressure. Hence, these results suggest that transient resistance to phages can emerge without mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Transient resistance to phages.</title><p>The difference in the area under the curve (AUC) represents the effect of adding phage to a growing culture as estimated by the difference in the growth curve in the absence of phage and with phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To test potential cross-resistance between lysates, we produced phage lysates from strains 03–9138, ST17, and T69, all of which were previously shown to successfully infect BJ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Sousa et al., 2020</xref>). We first infected the non-lysogenized BJ1 clones that are capsulated and resistant to ST14 phages.

Despite similarities between phages across lysates, BJ1 lysogens were only resistant to ST14 lysate, remaining sensitive to lysates produced by other strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Hence, and in contrast with the cross-resistance profile of clones with capsule modifications, integration of ST14 phages into BJ1 does not result in resistance to superinfection against a larger array of serotype-specific phages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We explored how temperate phages drive population dynamics during coevolution between two <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains under different degrees of parasite pressure. Based on theoretical works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2006</xref>) and direct 24 hr competitions, we hypothesized that phage-sensitive BJ1 would coexist with polylysogenic ST14 in conditions with low phage infection but would be outcompeted fast in conditions of high phage concentration. We however observed that both ST14 and BJ1 are present in all populations. The varying relative frequency of the two strains over time suggests continuing co-evolution, since the initial drop in phage-susceptible BJ1 populations correlates with an increase in phage production, and then stabilization of both phage and BJ1 populations, prior to a second drop in BJ1 frequency. In populations evolving in the environment with MMC, BJ1 populations dropped faster than in the other conditions. This could be linked to a faster capsule inactivation. Changes in the <italic>Klebsiella</italic> capsule are a primary mechanism of resistance to temperate phages, as shown for virulent phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hesse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Majkowska-Skrobek et al., 2021</xref>). More broadly, fast inactivation of the capsule confirms that alteration of the host recognition determinants frequently results in the protection of bacterial populations against phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mutalik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Westra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shaer Tamar and Kishony, 2022</xref>). However, after six days of co-evolution, the frequencies of both strains in MMC reached an equilibrium. This also resulted in a higher frequency of BJ1 strain at the end of the evolution experiment, compared to populations that were initially exposed to less phage pressure. High BJ1 frequencies in these populations are potentially linked to the emergence of diverse resistance mechanisms imposing lower fitness costs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Indeed, non-capsulated clones are fitter at the early stages of the coevolution, but capsulated non-lysogenized BJ1-resistant clones may outcompete other resistant BJ1 at longer evolutionary time scales.</p><p>Lysogenization often renders bacteria resistant to phages due to superinfection exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cumby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Susskind et al., 1974</xref>). Our previous work revealed frequent lysogenization of BJ1 when exposed to a highly concentrated lysate of ST14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Sousa et al., 2020</xref>), as expected from experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>) and modeling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Sousa and Rocha, 2019</xref>). We now show that lysogenization is not a stable mechanism of defense in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This is because it results in high rates of spontaneous phage induction that lead to cell death. Similar observations were made with <italic>E. coli</italic> in a murine model in which high induction rates of phage lambda decreased the fitness of lysogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Paepe et al., 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frazão et al., 2022</xref> also observed that after lysogenization, phage induction was very high, however, this was followed by progressive domestication, suggesting that the cost of some resistant mechanisms can be overcome. In the present work, the producing strain is a polylysogen, which could further complicate the acquisition of resistance since full protection requires multiple lysogenization events (one for each phage). For instance, lysogenic conversion was less frequent (~50% less) when a non-lysogenic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was competed against a polylysogenic strain, compared to conditions when it was exposed to a single-lysogenized strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burns et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, lysogeny is disfavoured as a mechanism of phage resistance when the rates of spontaneous induction are high, when bacteria are targeted by multiple different phages, or when other less costly alternative resistant mechanisms may emerge.</p><p>A major finding of our work is that the dominant type of the resistance mechanisms changes across evolutionary time scales. At first, resistance emerged quickly to the loss of capsule production because functional inactivation can be achieved in many ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiarelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haudiquet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nucci et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). At later stages, resistance may emerge by changes in the composition or expression of the capsule, which can outcompete both lysogens and non-capsulated clones. The emergence of these mechanisms later in the experiment suggests that such mutations are under a more limited supply than those resulting in capsule loss. This suggests that either long-term adaptation requires a small pool of rare mutations, contrary to gene inactivation that can be achieved in multiple ways, or that these adaptive paths are more complex, e.g., require multiple steps.</p><p>Surprisingly, our study revealed that some phage-resistant clones reverted to susceptibility after two passages in the absence of phage pressure. Yet, the sequence of these clones failed to reveal any mutations that could explain the phenotypic change. An increasing number of recent reports suggest that phage resistance could often be transient. For instance, Hesse and colleagues sequenced 57 different clones of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> resistant to a virulent phage and found that almost half of them lacked identifiable mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hesse et al., 2020</xref>). Our clones could be transiently resistant because the nucleotide sequence of the gene <italic>wcaJ</italic> of the K2 capsule has short simple sequence repeats (SSR) whose changes are difficult to detect with the current genome assemblers and variant calling software. SSR are often mutational hotspots allowing rapid evolution of traits by changes that are easily reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moxon et al., 1994</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, we found that capsule inactivation in ST14 is associated with an insertion of a thymine among a repeat of thymine residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Other, non-genetic mechanisms of transient resistance to phages have also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bull et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cota et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ongenae et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wohlfarth et al., 2023</xref>). One is the epigenetic-based resistance based on DNA modifications, such as methylation. This was previously shown to regulate the length of the O-antigen length by phase variation in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, and resulted in transient phage resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cota et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, transient cell wall shedding in filamentous actinobacteria, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ongenae et al., 2022</xref>) and conversion to cell wall-deficient L-forms in <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wohlfarth et al., 2023</xref>) can lead to transient phage resistance. An analogous process in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> could involve the shedding of the capsule in response to phage pressure, resulting in a state of reduced phage adsorption and limited infection. Such non-genetic protective changes are comparable to inducible immune responses (CRISPR-Cas) that incur in lower fitness costs relative to other constitutive changes such as permanent loss of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Westra et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show that at a longer evolutionary time scale, non-genetic modifications or inducible resistance can emerge. Contrary to a constitutive inactivation of the capsule, non-genetic mechanisms do not result in added cost and the bacteria can revert to susceptibility once phage pressure is relieved.</p><p>Both the efficiency and fitness costs of phage-resistance mechanisms are context-dependent, as they can impose trade-offs in different environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meaden et al., 2015</xref>). We found that some mutants were only resistant to phages in liquid media, i.e., in the environment where they evolved, but remained fully sensitive to the same phages when growing on agar. This recapitulates phage-resistant <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> evolved in vitro that did not display a fitness advantage compared to phage-sensitive cells when grown on a plant surface in the presence of phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hernandez and Koskella, 2019</xref>). These results are unexpected given previous studies showing that phage-sensitive bacteria are able to survive phage attacks in structured environments (agar, gut, or plant surface) due to the existence of refuges where sensitive cells may evade the phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lourenço et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eriksen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schrag and Mittler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simmons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Testa et al., 2019</xref>). However, survival in refuges is often contingent on the presence of other phage-resistant clones, or enhanced phenotypic resistance in structured environments due to reduced receptor expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attrill et al., 2021</xref>). A plausible explanation could be that in well-shaken liquid, phage-bacterium interactions are unstable, compared to interactions on agar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brockhurst et al., 2006</xref>). If this is true, then less capsulated mutants could attain a higher level of resistance in liquid than in solid. Yet, resistance is not necessarily linked to a mere reduction in the production of the capsule because the ∆<italic>rcsB</italic> mutant that produces fewer capsule remains equally sensitive to phage in both liquid and agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, our results highlight the complexity of the outcomes of bacterial interactions when they are affected by prophages.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>BJ1 (ENA: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SAMEA4968482">SAMEA4968482</ext-link>) and ST14 (ENA: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SAMN22024794">SAMN22024794</ext-link>) are two phylogenetically-distant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, both bearing the K2 capsule serotype.

Each of the three mixed populations evolved in three different environments: (i) LB, (ii) LB supplemented with 0.2% citrate, and (iii) LB with mitomycin C (MMC, 0.1 µg/mL). Cultures were allowed to grow for 24 hr at 37 °C and diluted again to 1:100 in fresh media. This was repeated for 30 days. Each day, each independently evolving population was plated and serially diluted. CFUs were counted (three plates per sample) and the emergence of non-capsulated mutants was recorded. Non-capsulated mutants are easily visualized by the naked eye as mutants produce smaller, rough, and translucent colonies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Phage experiments</title><p>(<italic>i) Growth curves:</italic> 200 µL of diluted overnight cultures of <italic>Klebsiella spp</italic>.

Mitomycin C was added to the final 5 µg/mL. After 4 hr at 37 °C, cultures were centrifuged at 4000 rpm and the supernatant was filtered through 0.22 µm. Filtered supernatants were mixed with chilled PEG-NaCl 5 X (PEG 8000 20% and 2.5 M of NaCl) and mixed through inversion. Phages were allowed to precipitate for 15 min and pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellets were dissolved in TBS (Tris Buffer Saline, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). (<italic>iii) Calculating plaque forming units (PFU</italic>). Overnight cultures of susceptible or tested strains were diluted 1:100 and allowed to grow until OD = 0.8. 250 µL of bacterial cultures were mixed with 3 mL of top agar (0.7% agar) and poured into prewarmed LB plates. Plates were allowed to dry before spotting serial dilutions of induced PEG-precipitated phages. Plates were left overnight at room temperature and phage plaques were counted. (<italic>iv) Phage adsorption</italic>. Adsorption of phage particles to the cell surface was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hesse et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, each resistant clone was grown until OD ~0.35. One ml of each culture was transferred to separate wells in a 24-well plate, to which 10 µl of filtered phage lysate (<italic>ca</italic>. 5*10<sup>6</sup> phage particles) was added. The mix was allowed to sit for 2 min at room temperature prior to incubation at 37 °C for 15 min with shaking at 140 rpm. Phage adsorption was measured by quantifying the free phage remaining in the solution, after centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm, to get rid of bacterial cells. The supernatant was serially diluted and the non-adsorbed phage was quantified by spot titer on a bacterial lawn of strain BJ1. Finally, to quantify how many phage was adsorbed, the non-adsorbed phage was subtracted from the initial amount of phage added to the culture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Sequencing</title><p>(<italic>i) Genomes of phage-resistant clones</italic>.

RNAse A treatment (37 °C, 30 min) was performed before DNA precipitation. Each clone (n=15) was sequenced by Illumina with 150pb paired-end reads, yielding approximately 1 Gb of data per clone. The reads were compared to the reference genome using <italic>breseq</italic> v0.33.2, default parameters. (<italic>ii) wcaJ gene</italic>.

Briefly, 500 μL of an overnight culture was adjusted to OD of two and mixed with 100 μL of 1% Zwittergent 3–14 detergent in 100 mM citric acid (pH 2.0) and heated at 56 °C for 20 min. Afterward, it was centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm and 300 μL of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Absolute ethanol was added to a final concentration of 80% and the tubes was placed on ice for 20 min. After a second wash with ethanol at 70%, the pellet was dried and dissolved in 250 μL of distilled water. The pellet was then incubated for 2 hr at 56 °C. Polysaccharides were then quantified by measuring the amount of uronic acid, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blumenkrantz and Asboe-Hansen, 1973</xref>. A 1,200 μL volume of 0.0125 M tetraborate in concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was added to 200 μL of the sample to be tested. The mixture was vigorously vortexed and heated in a boiling-water bath for 5 min. The mixture was allowed to cool, and 20 μL of 0.15% 3-hydroxydiphenol in 0.5% NaOH was added. The tubes were shaken, and 100 μL were transferred to a microtiter plate for absorbance measurements (520 nm). The uronic acid concentration in each sample was determined from a standard curve of glucuronic acid.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Citrate quantification</title><p>24 hr cultures of BJ1, ST14, their coculture, or blank tubes with citrate, were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and the supernatant was sterilized with 0.22 μm filter, prior to deproteination by centrifugation in an Amicon tube (10 kDa). Citrate concentration was measured using a Citrate assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich MAK333).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Individual-based simulations of bacteria-phage interactions</title><p>Simulations were performed based on the model described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Sousa and Rocha, 2019</xref>. Briefly, both bacterial cells and phage particles are independent individuals in an environment represented as a two-dimensional grid. The environment is simulated as well-mixed, meaning that positions of bacteria and phage are randomized at each iteration. Bacterial death can be intrinsic (e.g. of old age) or explicit (e.g. lysed by phage). Bacteria can resist phage infection by acquiring a mutation that mimics capsule loss (at varying rates, with a varying fitness cost, see results). Upon phage infection, the phage can either follow a lytic cycle or a lysogenic one, according to a stochastic decision defined by the parameters LysogenyAlpha and LysogenyKappa, which takes into consideration the density of nearby phages. When lysogenized, bacteria become insensitive to new phage infections, but the integrated prophage can excise (and thus lead to the death of this specific cell) at varying frequencies (see results). The simulations we explored are initiated with 10,000 bacterial cells, and 1000 phage particles are added into the environment at the beginning of the simulation. For each condition explored (varying the probability of phage induction, the probability of bacteria acquiring a phage resistance mutation, and the cost of this mutation), we performed 30 replicate simulations, each running for 150 iterations. The values presented in the results correspond to the median of the 30 replicate simulations, for each condition. The set of parameters explored, that are relevant to the questions in this study, are shown in Text S1. Other mechanisms that can be simulated in eVIVALDI (e.g. transduction) were not used in these simulations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>wGRR calculations</title><p>Phage similarity was calculated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Sousa et al., 2020</xref>. Briefly, we searched for sequence similarity between all proteins of all phages using mmseqs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steinegger and Söding, 2017</xref>) with the sensitivity parameter set at 7.5. The results were filtered with the following parameters: e-value lower than 0.0001, at least 35% identity between amino acids, and a coverage of at least 50% of the proteins. The filtered hits were used to compute the set of bi-directional best hits (bbh) between each phage pair. This was then used to compute a score of gene repertoire relatedness for each pair of phage genomes, weighted by sequence identity, computed as follows:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mtext>wGR</mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>R</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where A<sub>i</sub> and B<sub>i</sub> is the pair <italic>i</italic> of homologous proteins present in <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> (containing respectively #A and #B proteins), id(<italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic>,<italic>B<sub>i</sub></italic>) is the percent sequence identity of their alignment, and min(<italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic>) is the total number of proteins of the smallest prophage, i.e., the one encoding the smallest number of proteins (<italic>A</italic> or <italic>B</italic>). wGRR varies between zero and one. It amounts to zero if there are no orthologs between the elements, and one if all genes of the smaller phage have an ortholog 100% identical in the other phage. Hence, the wGRR accounts for both frequencies of homology and the degree of similarity among homologs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>PHASTER prophage prediction in strain ST14.</title><p>The genome was analyzed with PHASTER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arndt et al., 2016</xref>) in April 2021.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83479-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Mutations accumulated in <italic>wcaJ</italic> gene resulting in non-capsulated mutants.</title><p>ND; none detected.

The strength of the evidence in the manuscript is compelling, with a huge amount of data and very interesting observations. The conclusions are well supported by the data.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Samuel L Díaz-Muñoz as the Reviewing Editors and Reviewer #2, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Landry as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript concludes that selection favors more subtle capsule mutations because they are less costly than capsule-loss mutants (lines 497-500). However, there are no data to support this conclusion, as fitness costs of the various resistance phenotypes analyzed were not measured.</p><p>The revised manuscript should either include such data if available or, without such data, substantial changes in the focus of the paper would have to be made, as the manuscript places considerable emphasis on the importance of fitness costs in resistance evolution, notably in the title.</p><p>2) The manuscript attempts to directly relate the emergence of the various resistance mechanisms to phage infection pressure during the coevolution experiment. However, while bacterial population dynamics data are monitored meticulously, the reviewers were not able to find the phage dynamics data. It seems likely to the reviewers that these data exist and these data are needed to make conclusions that link resistance mechanisms to phage pressure.</p><p>In the absence of these data, a major change in the narrative would be needed to bring the conclusions of the paper in line with the evidence (i.e. conclusions would be related to competition with the lysogenic strain and avoid a mention of phage pressure).</p><p>3) We note that if there is no further evidence to support both conclusions noted in 1) and 2) above, then the conclusions made by the manuscript would be substantially altered and the significance of the contribution would also substantially change.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have gathered a huge amount of data and made some very interesting observations but unfortunately, a clear narrative is missing and the data do not support the main conclusions. One relatively simple thing would be to measure phage titers alongside bacterial densities over time – this would allow the authors to directly say something about phage infection pressure. To understand whether resistance mechanisms confer different fitness costs in the presence/absence of phage (and high/low phage pressure) should in my view be tested separately and directly in short-term experiments by directly competing clones with different resistance mechanisms isolated from the experiment. If the latter is not possible (genetic markers may not be available to tease them apart easily – qPCR is a good alternative but obviously more labour-intensive and expensive) the authors could measure bacterial growth curves instead to make inferences about their fitness.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I think this is a very well-done and very interesting study! Please see below my recommendations:</p><p>1) Rearrange the discussion to provide the salient overall, general points. Make it. I think those major take-home messages are that 1) lysogenization might not be as prevalent a phage resistance mechanism as we thought previously (or at least in as wide a set of conditions as we thought), particularly in the long-term and 2) that receptors continue to be the primary mechanism, importantly through loss at first and then through changes in expression/composition. Secondarily, the multiple mechanisms and the transience can be discussed, but as written these aspects detract from the overall message.</p><p>2) Please acknowledge previous work on context dependence (i.e. agar/liquid) from multiple groups, but Britt Koskella and Ellie Harrison come to mind immediately.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83479.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript concludes that selection favors more subtle capsule mutations because they are less costly than capsule-loss mutants (lines 497-500).
