They are composed of a highly branched system of primary and secondary filaments, housing blood vessels, a distinct type of cellular filament cartilage, pillar cells (specialized endothelial cells), and epithelial cells maintaining ionic balance. In teleost gills, two rows of filaments are anchored to a prominent gill bar skeleton. Both the filaments and supportive gill bars develop from the embryonic pharyngeal arches that consist of mesenchyme of neural crest and mesoderm origin and epithelia of endodermal and ectodermal origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fabian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mongera et al., 2013</xref>). The third and more posterior arches generate gills in most fishes. The second (hyoid) arch also forms a hemibranch (one row of gill filaments) in the jawless lamprey fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dohrn, 1882</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gaskell, 1908</xref>), in cartilaginous and various non-teleost fishes (e.g. coelacanth, lungfishes, sturgeon, and gar), but not in teleost fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goodrich, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jollie, 1962</xref>). A classical theory for the origin of jaws posits that an ancestral gill support skeleton in the mandibular arch was repurposed for jaw function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gegenbaur et al., 1878</xref>). However, extant agnathans (the cyclostomes lamprey and hagfish) lack a mandibular gill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cole, 1905</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mallatt, 1996</xref>), and fossil evidence for ancestral vertebrates with a mandibular gill is scant. Whereas exceptional soft tissue preservation of <italic>Metaspriggina walcotti</italic> from the Cambrian Burgess Shale had suggested a dorsoventrally segmented cartilaginous gill bar in the presumptive mandibular arch, gill filaments were not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Morris and Caron, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The pseudobranch is an epithelial structure located just behind the eye that has been proposed to regulate ocular blood pressure and/or have an endocrine function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jollie, 1962</xref>). While it shares an anatomical resemblance to gill filaments and is found in many jawed fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dohrn, 1882</xref>), its embryonic arch origins remain debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Miyashita, 2016</xref>). In parallel work in little skate, we identify a mandibular arch origin of the pseudobranch in chondrichthyans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hirschberger and Gillis, 2022</xref>), which form one branch of jawed vertebrates. Whether the mandibular origin of the pseudobranch is conserved across vertebrates, including bony fishes, remained unknown. Another important question is whether the pseudobranch and gills can be considered serially homologous, i.e., representing morphologically related structures that arise through shared developmental and genetic mechanisms. Through lineage tracing and genetic analyses in zebrafish here, and lineage analysis in skate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hirschberger and Gillis, 2022</xref>), we infer that the pseudobranch is a mandibular arch-derived serial homolog of the gills that was present in at least the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In zebrafish, the pseudobranch is located anterior to the gill filaments and connected to the eye via the ophthalmic artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, c</xref>), as described for other fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Laurent and Dunel-Erb, 1984</xref>). The pseudobranch appears in histological sections as a small bud behind the eye at 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Examination of <italic>Sox10:Cre; acta2:loxP-BFP-Stop-loxP-dsRed</italic> zebrafish shows this bud to be composed of a core of Cre-converted dsRed+ neural crest-derived cells ensheathed by unconverted BFP+ epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). The position of this bud corresponds to <italic>kdrl:mCherry</italic> labeling of a branch of the first aortic arch that likely gives rise to the ophthalmic artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). At 17 dpf, the pseudobranch is composed of five distinct filaments that resemble the primary gill filaments, with the five filaments merging to form a single pseudobranch by adult stages (90 dpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Alcian Blue staining reveals that the adult pseudobranch contains five cartilage rods, reflecting the five fused filaments, with this cartilage resembling the specialized filament cartilage seen in the gills (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fabian et al., 2022</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The zebrafish pseudobranch derives from mandibular arch mesenchyme and first pouch epithelia.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>), Schematic showing the pseudobranch (arrows), gill filaments (branched green structures) connected to gill bars (blue), teeth (purple), vasculature (pink), and jaw and jaw-support skeleton (gray).

Photoconversion of dorsal first arch mesenchyme at 1.5 dpf labeled the pseudobranch mesenchymal bud at 3.5 dpf, as well as the palatoquadrate cartilage, a known first arch derivative; photoconversion of dorsal second arch mesenchyme did not label the pseudobranch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). To trace the epithelial origins of the pseudobranch, we performed short-term lineage tracing using <italic>fgf10b:nEOS</italic>, in which the photoconvertible nuclear-EOS protein is expressed in endodermal pouch epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref>).

To test whether this reflects shared gene regulatory mechanisms indicative of serial homology, we examined activity of several gill-specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fabian et al., 2022</xref>). At 5 dpf, the gata3-p1 enhancer drives GFP expression in the growing tips of both the pseudobranch and gill buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). At 14 dpf, the ucmaa-p1 enhancer, active in gill filament but not hyaline cartilage in the face, drives GFP expression in both pseudobranch and gill filament cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), as seen for endogenous expression of <italic>ucmaa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1a</xref>).

The absence of a pseudobranch in extant agnathans (i.e. lamprey and hagfish) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cole, 1905</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mallatt, 1996</xref>) suggests that either the pseudobranch arose along the gnathostome stem (i.e. prior to the divergence of cartilaginous and bony fishes), or that it was an ancestral feature of vertebrates that has been lost in cyclostomes. The latter would be analogous to loss of the hyoid hemibranch gill during teleost fish evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goodrich, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jollie, 1962</xref>), consistent with our failure to observe gill filament gene expression or transgene activity in the hyoid arch of zebrafish.</p><p>Whereas our data clearly point to the filament systems of the pseudobranch and gills being serially homologous, the major skeletal bars supporting the jaws and gills (not to be confused with the gill filament cartilage) appear to develop largely independently from the filaments. Unlike the gill filaments, the zebrafish pseudobranch is not attached to a major skeletal bar. Conversely, the skeletal bars derived from the seventh arch of zebrafish lack gill filaments and instead anchor pharyngeal teeth, and no gill filaments were observed with the fossilized rostral-most gill bar of <italic>M. walcotti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Morris and Caron, 2014</xref>). In addition, <italic>gata3</italic> loss affects the pseudobranch and gill filaments but not the gill bars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sheehan-Rooney et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore possible that, rather than the pseudobranch evolving from an ancestral mandibular gill whose gill bar was transformed into the jaw skeleton, the pseudobranch arose independently after appearance of the jaw by co-option of a gill filament developmental program. While we demonstrate gill-like developmental potential of the mandibular arch in extant vertebrates, whether an ancestral mandibular gill bar gave rise to vertebrate jaws awaits more definitive fossil evidence.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Craig T Miller (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate pseudobranch development in zebrafish in the context of seeking evidence for a proposed gill arch origin for the vertebrate jaw. They provide data that supports that the pseudobranch is derived from the mandibular arch and that the pseudobranch is a segmental homolog of the gills. The reviewers agree that this work is potentially appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if certain concerns can be addressed.</p><p>1. The first arch kikGR fate mapping example in Figure 1e is of poor resolution and it's difficult to see the cellular composition of the forming pseudobranch. (by contrast, the Sox10Cre:b-actin:BFP)</p><p>2. Similarly for Figure 3S2b (the 13 dpf irx5a-p1 figure) is that the best representative figure? This is a weak data point with only a single blip of GFP positive signal which may or may not even be a cell.</p><p>3. The fgf10b:nEOS does not appear to be truly endodermal specific. Thus, it's not clear whether the magenta label in Figure 1f came from the first pouch as claimed, or alternatively from non-endodermal fgf10b expressing cells. Do the authors have data showing sox17:CreER; ubb:stop-mCherry tamoxifen labeled magenta cells in the pseudobranch? Alternatively, can the authors show an example of photoconverting nEOS in the fgf10b:nEOS line that is more localized onto the first pharyngeal pouch (the example in Figure 1F appears to include photoconverted cells both posterior but especially more ventral than the first pharyngeal pouch).</p><p>4. It seems that in this group's recent 2022 Nat. Comm. scRNA-seq paper, pseudobranch cells might also have been sequenced. Can the authors ask whether pseudobranch cells in their existing scRNA-seq data cluster with different gill cell clusters? E.g. perhaps gill cells are hox+ (and gata3+, ucmaa+, or irx5a+) while pseudobranch cells are hox- (and gata3+, ucmaa+, or irx5a+)? Perhaps the sequencing depth is not deep enough to answer this question, or perhaps the authors have no markers that distinguish pseudobranch cells from gill cells and this approach would not work. But it seems possible that the scRNA-seq data could provide additional evidence for serial homology of the pseudobranch and gills.</p><p>5. Are there gill-like structures derived from the second arch in teleosts? The authors mention the hemibranch derived from the hyoid arch in cartilaginous fishes. Is there a similar structure in any teleost? If there are no arch 2 gill-like structures, how this fits into the gill origin of jaw hypothesis should be discussed. Also, there is no discussion of jawless fish and how the considerable literature from species such as lamprey relates to the findings presented here. Do agnathans develop a pseudobranch? Addressing both of these points would help a general audience.</p><p>6. Better care should be taken with the word homology, and the distinction between serial homology vs historical or functional homology should be made clear. It would be helpful to define for a general audience what is meant by serial homology.</p><p>7. The first sentence of the discussion is not fully supported by the data. More species need to be included to make this claim. This statement should be tempered.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>In the figures, the font size of text and figure panels should be increased throughout for clarity.</p><p>In Figure 1A, the jaw and hyoid skeleton is cartooned in gray, not just the hyoid, so in the Figure 1A legend, &quot;jaw support skeleton&quot; should be more accurately changed to &quot;jaw and jaw support skeleton&quot;. The uninterrupted medial gray bar should be removed from this diagram as it's neither anatomically accurate nor relevant for the images/data in this paper. Likewise, the gray blob in front of the pterygoid process should either be removed or extended posteriorly to more accurately represent the neurocranium.</p><p>In the Figure 1D legend, one of the two &quot;in green&quot; should be removed from this sentence: &quot;In green, fli1a:GFP labels the vasculature and neural crest-derived mesenchyme for reference in green, and unconverted sox10:kikGR cells also labels mesenchyme.&quot;</p><p>The Figure 1F legend is mislabeled as &quot;e&quot;.</p><p>The Figure 3A legend should define the white arrow and the yellow arrow separately.</p><p>The Figure 1S1D legend indicates that pouches are numbered, but they are not numbered in the figure. Either numbers should be added or the legend corrected.</p><p>In Figure 3S1, labeling the gill buds with yellow arrows as in the other figures would be helpful and make the presentation more consistent.</p><p>p. 4, Reference(s) should be provided to support this claim: &quot;The pseudobranch is an epithelial structure located just behind the eye of most fishes that regulates ocular blood pressure.&quot;</p><p>p. 7 &quot;Gata3 and Gata2a&quot; to &quot;gata3 and gata2a (italicized)&quot;?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Suggestions to strengthen the science are listed below:</p><p>1. The first arch kikGR fate mapping example in Figure 1e is of lowish resolution and difficult to see the cellular composition of the forming pseudobranch. It is listed that an n of 6 was done here. In contrast, the example shown in Figure 1S1A with the Sox10Cre:b-actin:BFP</p><p>2. The fgf10b:nEOS does not appear to be truly endodermal specific. Thus, it's not clear whether the magenta label in Figure 1f came from the first pouch as claimed, or alternatively from non-endodermal fgf10b expressing cells.

Similarly for Figure 3S2b (the 13 dpf irx5a-p1 figure) is that the best representative figure? This is a weak data point with only a single blip of GFP positive signal which may or may not even be a cell.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of including an image of the irx5a-p1:GFP transgenic line at 13 dpf is to highlight the very earliest timepoint at which we see signal in the pseudobranch. While it is true that there are very few GFP+ cells at this stage, this is consistent across multiple animals. We now include a second example from this stage with slightly stronger contribution in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2b. As can be seen in Figure 2c and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2c, the number of irx5a-p1:GFP+ cells in the pseudobranch greatly increases by late juvenile and adult stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The fgf10b:nEOS does not appear to be truly endodermal specific. Thus, it's not clear whether the magenta label in Figure 1f came from the first pouch as claimed, or alternatively from non-endodermal fgf10b expressing cells. Do the authors have data showing sox17:CreER; ubb:stop-mCherry tamoxifen labeled magenta cells in the pseudobranch? Alternatively, can the authors show an example of photoconverting nEOS in the fgf10b:nEOS line that is more localized onto the first pharyngeal pouch (the example in Figure 1F appears to include photoconverted cells both posterior but especially more ventral than the first pharyngeal pouch).</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a lineage trace of <italic>sox17:CreERT2</italic>-labelled endoderm and show contribution to both gill and pseudobranch <italic>cdh1:mlanYFP</italic>+ epithelia (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1d). We also performed more specific photoconversion of <italic>fgf10b:nEOS</italic> in just the first pouch and show similar contribution to pseudobranch epithelia (new Figure 1f, old exampled moved to Figure 1figure supplement 1d). These new experiments now better support contribution of first pouch endoderm to the pseudobranch epithelium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It seems that in this group's recent 2022 Nat. Comm. scRNA-seq paper, pseudobranch cells might also have been sequenced. Can the authors ask whether pseudobranch cells in their existing scRNA-seq data cluster with different gill cell clusters? E.g. perhaps gill cells are hox+ (and gata3+, ucmaa+, or irx5a+) while pseudobranch cells are hox- (and gata3+, ucmaa+, or irx5a+)? Perhaps the sequencing depth is not deep enough to answer this question, or perhaps the authors have no markers that distinguish pseudobranch cells from gill cells and this approach would not work. But it seems possible that the scRNA-seq data could provide additional evidence for serial homology of the pseudobranch and gills.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. Unfortunately, we have analyzed our scRNAseq data at 60 dpf but find no clear segregation of hox+ and hox- cells within gill cell types (<italic>ncam3</italic>+ pillar cells, <italic>ucmaa</italic>+ gill filament chondrocytes, <italic>fgf10a</italic>+ gill progenitors). The only Hox genes we detect at this stage are <italic>hoxa3a</italic> and <italic>hoxb3a</italic>, yet these do not co-localize in any clear subset of gill cells. It may be that Hox expression has largely been extinguished during these later differentiation stages, and/or that gill cells greatly outnumber pseudobranch cells, thus making it difficult to detect a distinct hox- pseudobranch cluster.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78170-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Are there gill-like structures derived from the second arch in teleosts? The authors mention the hemibranch derived from the hyoid arch in cartilaginous fishes. Is there a similar structure in any teleost? If there are no arch 2 gill-like structures, how this fits into the gill origin of jaw hypothesis should be discussed. Also, there is no discussion of jawless fish and how the considerable literature from species such as lamprey relates to the findings presented here. Do agnathans develop a pseudobranch? Addressing both of these points would help a general audience.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite references that a hyoid hemibranch is present in non-teleost but not teleost fishes, suggesting it was lost along the teleost lineage. This is consistent with our observed lack of gill filament gene expression and transgene activity in the zebrafish hyoid arch. We also now cite references for a hyoid hemibranch and more posterior gills in lamprey, yet a lack of pseudobranch in either lamprey or hagfish.</p><p>pp. 2-3: âThe second (hyoid) arch also forms a hemibranch (one row of gill filaments) in the jawless lamprey fish (Dohrn, 1882; Gaskell, 1908), in cartilaginous and various non-teleost fishes (e.g. coelacanth, lungfishes, sturgeon, gar), but not in teleost fishes (Goodrich, 1930; Jollie, 1962).â</p><p>pp. 3: âHowever, extant agnathans (the cyclostomes lamprey and hagfish) lack a mandibular gill (Cole, 1905; Mallatt, 1996)â¦â</p><p>pp. 6-7: âThe absence of a pseudobranch in extant agnathans (i.e. lamprey and hagfish) (Cole, 1905; Mallatt, 1996) suggests that either the pseudobranch arose later along the gnathostome lineage, or that it was lost along the cyclostome lineage. The latter would be analogous to loss of the hyoid hemibranch gill during teleost fish evolution (Goodrich, 1930; Jollie, 1962), consistent with our failure to observe gill filament gene expression or transgene activity in the hyoid arch of zebrafish.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Better care should be taken with the word homology, and the distinction between serial homology vs historical or functional homology should be made clear.
