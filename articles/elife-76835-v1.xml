Insulin resistance in overweight has recently been shown to reduce the inhibitory function of insulin in the human brain. How this relates to effective weight management is unclear, especially in older people, who are highly vulnerable to hyperinsulinemia and in whom neural target systems of insulin action undergo age-related changes. Here, 50 overweight, non-diabetic older adults participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging study before and after randomization to a 3-month caloric restriction or active waiting group. Our data show that treatment outcome in dieters can be predicted by baseline measures of individual intranasal insulin (INI) inhibition of value signals in the ventral tegmental area related to sweet food liking as well as, independently, by peripheral insulin sensitivity. At follow-up, both INI inhibition of hedonic value signals in the nucleus accumbens and peripheral insulin sensitivity improved with weight loss. These data highlight the critical role of central insulin function in mesolimbic systems for weight management in humans and directly demonstrate that neural insulin function can be improved by weight loss even in older age, which may be essential for preventing metabolic disorders in later life.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>intranasal insulin</kwd><kwd>mesolimbic</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>weight management</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR 134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brassen</surname><given-names>Stefanie</given-names></name><name><surname>Tiedemann</surname><given-names>Lena J</given-names></name><name><surname>Meyhöfer</surname><given-names>Sebastian M</given-names></name><name><surname>Francke</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Beck</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name><name><surname>Büchel</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR 289 - ID 422744262</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Büchel</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name><name><surname>Brassen</surname><given-names>Stefanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Insulinergic neuromodulation of hedonic food processing predicts future weight management and improves with weight loss in older overweight dieters.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prevalence of overweight and obesity rises dramatically with age and is associated with increased morbidity and reduced quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalyani et al., 2017</xref>). Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are potential causes and consequences of obesity. Both are negatively affected by age and both play a pivotal role for the development of type 2 diabetes and other age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palmer and Kirkland, 2016</xref>). The mechanisms and directions of these interactions are under debate. For instance, it has long been assumed that insulin resistance in aging precedes the development of hyperinsulinemia, while recent data suggest a reverse direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janssen, 2021</xref>). Moreover, there is evidence from animal and human research of an weight-independent effect of aging on insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ehrhardt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Besides the importance of peripheral insulin for the glycemic control in the body, recent findings also highlight the role of insulin action in the brain for the metabolic and hedonic control of food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kullmann et al., 2020a</xref>). Findings in rodents and humans indicate that, apart from signaling in hypothalamic neurocircuits regulating energy homeostasis, central insulin mediates non-homeostatic feeding for pleasure by signaling within mesolimbic reward circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiedemann et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, insulin action in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) reduces hedonic feeding in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Labouèbe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mebel et al., 2012</xref>) and decreases hedonic value signals in the VTA and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in lean subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiedemann et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, insulin-mediated long-term depression of VTA dopamine neurons is reduced in hyperinsulinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) and aberrant insulin action in VTA–NAc pathways has been observed in insulin-resistant participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiedemann et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>There is consensus that the improvement of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, as achieved by caloric restriction (CR), is key in the prevention and treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janssen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ryan, 2000</xref>). Evidence from human studies for such effects, however, are sparse, especially when it comes to central nervous insulin signaling. High insulin sensitivity in MEG theta activity was predictive for long-term weight management in 15 young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kullmann et al., 2020b</xref>) suggesting the critical role of central insulin action for future feeding regulation and as a major target of treatment intervention. Whether such intervention can modulate brain insulin sensitivity in older age is particularly questionable given that changes in function and distribution of adipose tissue can trigger metabolic alterations such as hyperinsulinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palmer and Kirkland, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tchkonia et al., 2010</xref>) and relevant brain circuits for central insulin action like the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway undergo age-related changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karrer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the current longitudinal study, we investigated the role of peripheral and central insulin resistance regarding their predictive value for dietary success in older adults and whether both can be modified by weight changes. Fifty older (&gt;55 years) overweight, non-diabetic individuals were randomly assigned to a 3-month, CR intervention or an active waiting group (WG). Before and after the intervention, overnight fasted participants took part in a crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blind pharmacological fMRI examination in which they rated the palatability of high and low sugar food pictures and the attractiveness of non-food items (control) after receiving intranasal insulin (INI) or placebo. Fasting c-peptides and blood glucose were assessed to calculate peripheral insulin sensitivity. We tested several predictions: (1) successful weight loss can be predicted by peripheral and central insulin sensitivity, the latter indicated by an insulinergic inhibition of mesolimbic responses to hedonic food stimuli at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiedemann et al., 2017</xref>), and (2) both, peripheral and central insulin sensitivity improve with successful weight loss at follow-up. Moreover, we explored the common and distinct impact of both markers on weight (changes) in older age.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Fifty overweight and obese older adults (age: 63.7 ± 5.9 years, range 55–78 years; body mass index [BMI]: 32.7 ± 4.3 kg/m², range 25.8–32.4 kg/m²; 20 men) with an explicit wish to lose weight participated in this study. Of these, 30 randomly selected participants underwent a 3-month CR diet (diet group, DG, 14 men), while 20 participants were randomly assigned to a 3-month active WG (6 men). Before (T0) and after (T1) the intervention phase, we assessed anthropometrics and blood measures. Normal HbA1C values confirm the exclusion of manifest diabetes in overweight and obese participants who are at risk for T2D but in whom elevated insulin release may still compensate for reduced insulin sensitivity (mean HOMA-2: 2.2 ± 0.08, range 1.2–3.5). All participants underwent a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled fMRI paradigm on food and non-food liking combined with an INI application before and after the intervention phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, each participant attended a total of four scanning sessions.

In non-diabetic, overweight, and obese older participants who underwent a 3-month CR, significant weight loss could be predicted by baseline measures of c-peptide-based insulin sensitivity as well as acute insulinergic inhibition of VTA responses to high sugar food items. Both markers of insulin function made an independent contribution to weight loss prediction emphasizing the necessity to take both aspects into account when assessing predictors and consequences of overweight in the elderly. At follow-up, weight loss in dieters was associated with improved peripheral insulin sensitivity which was directly related to a stronger insulinergic inhibition in the NAc during hedonic food valuation. These findings extend work in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mebel et al., 2012</xref>) and first studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kullmann et al., 2020b</xref>) about the critical role of insulin sensitivity for future feeding regulation. It is also, to our knowledge, the first study that demonstrates positive effects of CR on central insulin function in humans using a longitudinal within-subject design. The observation of such an effect in older adults is particularly important given age-related metabolic and neural changes and the potential, detrimental consequences of hyperinsulinemia, overweight, and obesity in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janssen, 2021</xref>).</p><p>As was expected from overweight and obese individuals, both peripheral and central markers of insulin sensitivity were low at baseline and both selectively improved with weight loss after CR in dieters. At baseline, participants with higher hyperinsulinemia demonstrated a specifically enhanced sugar preference which fits animal and human data on the critical role of sugar-enriched diets on whole-body insulin functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Macdonald, 2016</xref>). Baseline insulin markers in the blood, however, were not related to behavioral or neural INI responses to HS items. This may be driven by the general lack of central insulin effects across participants at baseline which fits with data in overweight younger adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiedemann et al., 2017</xref>) and which might result from an attenuated insulin transport into the cerebrospinal fluid in individuals with reduced whole-body insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heni et al., 2014</xref>). However, there was also no such association in the subgroup of successful dieters in whom there was a significant response to INI already before the intervention. This indicates that, even though peripheral insulin might be a good proxy for central insulin functioning in younger lean adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiedemann et al., 2017</xref>), pathophysiological changes due to overweight and aging might at least in part independently affect peripheral and central insulin effects. This is further underlined by the independent predictive value of both markers for weight changes after 3 months of CR. The impact of these predictive values could not be explained by body mass, which demonstrates that insulin sensitivity, but not necessarily obesity, is predictive for future weight management. Indeed, there is evidence from animal and human research of an adiposity-independent effect of aging on insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ehrhardt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>), that, for instance, may result from age-related changes in mitochondrial energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>) or increased systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ehrhardt et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Inhibitory INI effects on VTA value signals to sweet food items were selectively predictive for subsequent success of CR. The VTA plays a central role in the insulinergic modulation of hedonic eating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Labouèbe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mebel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiedemann et al., 2017</xref>). Direct administration of insulin into the VTA reduces hedonic feeding and depresses somatodendritic DA in the VTA which has been attributed to the upregulation of the number or function of DA transporter in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mebel et al., 2012</xref>). Connectivity analyses of fMRI data further suggest that INI can suppress food value signals in the mesolimbic pathway by negatively modulating projections from the VTA to the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiedemann et al., 2017</xref>). Insulinergic effects at baseline and follow-up were specifically restricted to HS food stimuli. The palatability of sugar has been linked to DA release in the NAc in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hajnal et al., 2004</xref>) and there is evidence for neural adaptations in the NAc in response to excessive sugar intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klenowski et al., 2016</xref>). For instance, higher sugar preference in overweight individuals has been related to stronger white matter connectivity within the VTA–NAc pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Francke et al., 2019</xref>). Our data indicate that insulinergic functionality in this network may be critical for hedonic feeding regulation as the reduction of sugar intake is substantial for the success of a dietary intervention.</p><p>A reduced insulinergic functionality of this network in older overweight individuals may not only be the consequence of adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mattson and Arumugam, 2018</xref>) but may also result from age-related metabolic and neural changes. Aging is associated with a decrease of cortical insulin concentration, reduced insulin receptor binding ability and reduced insulin transport across the blood–brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cholerton et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, target systems of metabolic–hedonic networks relevant for insulin action undergo age-related changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mattson and Arumugam, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). The dopamine system, for example, is particularly vulnerable to aging which might lead to functional changes in subcortical reward circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dreher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karrer et al., 2017</xref>). There is a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia including the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Siddiqi et al., 1999</xref>). Given that insulin acts via glutamatergic synaptic transmission onto VTA DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Labouèbe et al., 2013</xref>) this might have direct consequences on the insulinergic suppression of subsequent DA release in mesolimbic regions. The potential negative impact of adiposity and age on described dysfunctions are thereby probably not simply additive. For instance, chronic metabolic morbidities like obesity can further accelerate brain aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mattson and Arumugam, 2018</xref>). A chronic positive energy balance thereby adversely affect brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beyer et al., 2017</xref>) and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Janowitz et al., 2015</xref>) and is related to many of the cellular and molecular hallmarks of brain aging such as oxidative damage and neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mattson and Arumugam, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, while there was no association between blood parameters and central insulin action at baseline, weight-change related improvements in peripheral and central insulin sensitivity in our sample of older dieters were directly correlated at follow-up, indicating a common modulator. Moreover, changes in central insulin sensitivity were restricted to an increased inhibition of value signals in the NAc but not the VTA. Thus, one could speculate that weight change specifically normalized adiposity-related dysfunctions while variability due to aging itself were less affected. Improvement in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis is a broadly observed metabolic effect of CR in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) as well as young and older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fontana and Klein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Most and Redman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Most et al., 2017</xref>). The mechanisms behind these effects are not fully understood yet but have been related to significantly increased hepatic insulin clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosello et al., 1990</xref>), reduced levels of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>), and generally decreased oxidative stress and inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fontana and Klein, 2007</xref>). Animal data about CR effects on brain functioning suggest that CR can induce adaptive cellular responses that can enhance neuroplasticity and stress resistance, for example, by the upregulation of neurotrophic factor signaling, suppression of oxidative stress and inflammation, stabilization of neuronal calcium homeostasis, and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mattson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mattson and Arumugam, 2018</xref>). In addition, recent work in rodents demonstrate improved insulin sensitivity following CR that was associated with enhanced brain monoamine concentrations such as increased DA levels in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Portero-Tresserra et al., 2020</xref>). Our data extend these beneficial neural effects of CR in animals to improved central insulin functioning in the human brain. This is particularly intriguing with regard to our non-diabetic sample of elderlies, in whom weight-related brain dysfunction is not only a risk factor for metabolic disorders but also for cognitive decline and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ekblad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janssen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mattson and Arumugam, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We chose a relatively mild dietary intervention that reduced participants’ individual caloric intake by 10–15% with a minimal intake set to 1200 kcal per day. This was done to increase compliance and to provide elderlies with a feasible long-term strategy to lose and maintain weight. Accordingly, there was only a mild-to-moderate average weight loss of 4%. Even this mild weight change was related to significant improvement of insulin sensitivity in the periphery and in the brain which underline that adiposity-related dysfunctions in later life are able to normalize. This is especially promising given new evidence for hyperinsulinemia preceding insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janssen, 2021</xref>) which makes it a key target for early interventions. It is now critical to understand the long-term effects of such changes with a special focus on food intake assuming that long-term effects are probably particularly dependent on prefrontal mediated psychological strategies including self-control during eating decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hare et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phelan et al., 2020</xref>). In conclusion, we provide data demonstrating that peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as central hedonic feeding regulation predict and normalize with dietary success in overweight elderlies. Our results of an independent contribution peripheral and central insulin sensitivity make for successful feeding regulation emphasize the necessity to control for both when treating individuals at risk for metabolic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Sixty-four overweight and obese participants (age &gt;55, BMI &gt;25 kg/m²) with an explicit wish to lose weight were recruited for this study.

Sensitivity measures derived from G*Power 3.1.9 for the final sample sizes indicate our design to be sensitive to detect small (<italic>N</italic> = 50) to medium (<italic>N</italic> = 30) effects in one-sample and paired <italic>t</italic>-tests and large effects in two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests (<italic>N</italic> = 30, <italic>N</italic> = 20) given an <italic>α</italic> of 0.05 and <italic>β</italic> of 0.80.</p><p>Participants were recruited via newspapers and online announcements. Exclusion criteria were current or previous psychiatric or neurological disorders, chronic and acute physical illness including diabetes, current psychopharmacological medication as well as MR-specific exclusion criteria. Initial screening as well as all clinical measurements in this study were performed by a physician (P.F. and K.G.). No participant followed any specific diet at the start of the experiment. To exclude systematic confounds during food evaluation, severe food allergies and adherence to a vegan diet constituted further exclusion criteria. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Ethical Board, Hamburg, Germany. All participants gave informed consent and were financially compensated for their participation. Additional financial incentives (50€) were provided to participants from the DG for successful weight loss (≥4 kg) and to participants from the WG for keeping their weight stable (weight changes ≤2 kg). The whole study was conducted at the Department of Systems Neuroscience, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf. The study has been registered at DRKS (DRKS00028576).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental protocol</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Baseline (T0)</title><p>After successful screening, participants attended two experimental sessions, separated by at least 1 week. On each day, participants arrived in the morning between 7:30 and 10:30 hr after an overnight fast of at least 10 hr. After anthropometric measurements, ratings of feelings of current hunger and collection of blood samples, participants received 160 IU of insulin (Insuman Rapid, 100 IU/ml) or vehicle (0.27% m-Kresol, 1.6% glycerol, and 98.13% water) by intranasal application. Participants received eight puffs per nostril, each puff consisting of 0.1 ml solution containing 10 IU human insulin or 0.1 ml placebo. The order of insulin and placebo was randomized and balanced, and the application was double blind. Before scanning, participants were familiarized with the task during a training session. Participants began the preference paradigm (in the fMRI scanner) 30 min after the nasal spray was applied; this delay was introduced to ensure that the insulin had time to take its full effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Born et al., 2002</xref>). After completion of the scans, participants again rated their feeling of hunger and a second set of blood samples was collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Intervention</title><p>Directly following the second scanning session, participants were randomly assigned to either the DG or the WG following a 60:40 randomization scheme. Participants of the DG received a 12-week professional diet program that consisted of (1) individual nutrition counseling by experienced clinical dieticians, who were blinded to the underlying study hypothesis, and (2) a psychological group intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Within individual sessions and based on individual dietary records from the previous 7 days, dieters received an individually planned dietary regimen that reduced each subject’s individual caloric intake by 10–15%. Minimal intake was set to 1200 kcal per day. The regimen was based on the 10 guidelines of the German Nutrition Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dge.de/">https://www.dge.de/</ext-link>). Compliance was assured by three telephone contacts after 2, 6, and 12 weeks during which participants confirmed that they continued to adhere to the diet and had the opportunity to clarify any questions regarding the dietary regimen. After 2 weeks, participants additionally attended a 90-min group session consisting of psychoeducation regarding obesity and T2D, a mindfulness-based eating awareness training and a training of self-monitoring and -control strategies (e.g., use of goal-related eating protocols). In a final counseling, the dietary regimen was reviewed and future eating behavior was discussed.</p><p>Participants from the WG were instructed to not change previous eating habits during the 3-month period. In week 6, they attended a 90-min group session which consisted of a psychoeducational unit about stress and stress management as well as a training of progressive muscle relaxation. After finishing all experimental sessions, participants of the WG were offered gratis dietary counseling identical to the one offered to the DG.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Follow-up (T1)</title><p>Three months after the last baseline measurement, participants from both groups repeated the double-blind randomized crossover design from T0, that is they attended another three study days (screening, fMRI + placebo, fMRI + insulin).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Blood measures</title><p>On each scanning day before insulin/placebo application, blood samples were collected, containing the following: 2.7 ml blood in a sodium fluoride for analysis of blood glucose, 7.5 ml blood in a serum tube for analysis of insulin and c-peptide. After completion of MR scans blood sample collection for insulin and glucose analysis was repeated. After 10 min of centrifugation (2800 × <italic>g</italic> and room temperature), the supernatants of the blood samples were stored at −80°C until further processing. Concentrations of insulin and c-peptide were measured using an electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche, ECLIA). Blood glucose was quantified through photometry (Beckman Coulter). We used fasted c-peptide serum levels for the calculation of an effective measure of insulin resistance (HOMA-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levy et al., 1998</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/index.php">https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/index.php</ext-link>). A c-peptide-based index is thought to be a more reliable indicator of insulin secretion that is minimally affected by hepatic insulin clearance, has longer half-life and that is more sensitive to incident T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones and Hattersley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leighton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okura et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, in a control analysis we observed a significantly higher within-subject variability (coefficient of variance, COV) in prescan insulin levels at T0 as well as T1 compared to c-peptide levels (T0: <italic>T</italic><sub>(49)</sub> = 4.79; p &lt; 0.001; T1: <italic>T</italic><sub>(49)</sub> = 4.47; p &lt; 0.001).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Behavioral and metabolic data processing were conducted using MATLAB (Mathworks, MA) and SPSS 27 (IBM, NY). We report statistical tests from the general linear model framework, including one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests, two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests, rmANOVA, multiple regression, and Pearson’s correlations. We used the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to test the null hypothesis that our data come from a normal distribution. In case when data were not normally distributed non-parametric testing was applied using the Wilcoxon test and the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. Statistical significance was assumed based on an alpha value of 0.05. Bonferroni correction was applied on multiple regression coefficients.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>fMRI food-rating paradigm</title><p>Four sets of stimuli were randomly presented on the four scanning days. Each one of the four parallel versions consisted of 70 food and 70 non-food color images selected from the internet. All pictures had a size of 400 × 400 pixels and were presented on a white background. Food pictures featured both sweet and savory items. Pictures were specifically selected to cover common high- and low-palatable foods. The four food sets did not differ in sugar content (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref> for distribution of sugar content). Non-food pictures, such as trinkets and accessories were chosen to evoke similar degrees of attractiveness. Validation of all four sets was conducted in an independent sample (<italic>n</italic> = 16) and revealed that the four sets did not differ significantly regarding the mean preference ratings (all p &gt; 0.43). Importantly, preference ratings as well as picture saliency for HS and LS stimuli did not differ between sets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>).</p><p>On each scanning day, food and non-food stimuli were pseudo-randomly presented (not more than three pictures from one category in a row) during three runs; each run lasted ~12 min and runs were separated by a 1-min relaxation break. Every run began with the instructions (‘We will soon start with the question: Do you like the presented item or not?’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>MRI data acquisition</title><p>All imaging data were acquired on a Siemens PRISMA 3T scanner (Erlangen, Germany) using a 32-channel head coil. Functional data were obtained using a multiband echo-planar imaging sequence. Each volume of the experimental data contained 60 slices (voxel size 1.5 × 1.5 × 1.5 mm) and was oriented 30° steeper than the anterior to posterior commissure (AC–PC) line (repetition time [TR] = 2.26 s, echo time [TE] = 30 ms, flip angle = 80°, field of view [FoV] = 225 mm, multiband mode, number of bands: 2). An additional structural image (magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo [MPRAGE]) was acquired for functional preprocessing and anatomical overlay (240 slices, voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>fMRI data analysis</title><p>Structural and functional data were analyzed using SPM12 (Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) and custom scripts in MATLAB. All functional volumes were corrected for rigid body motion and susceptibility artifacts (realign and unwarp). The individual structural T1 image was coregistered to the mean functional image generated during realignment. Image diagnostics was performed using visual inspection of image-to-image variability (tsdiffana, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DataDiagnostics">https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DataDiagnostics</ext-link>). The functional images were spatially normalized and smoothed with a 4-mm full-width at half maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel.</p><p>A two-level random effects approach utilizing the general linear model as implemented in SPM12 was used for statistical analyses. At the single subject level, onsets of HS, LS, and non-food stimuli presentation were modeled as separate regressors convolving delta functions with a canonical hemodynamic response function. In addition, combined rating scores were entered as parametric modulators of HS, LS, and non-food regressors separately. Onsets of HS and LS were defined based on median splits on sugar content (g/100 g) of the respective stimulus set. Importantly, sugar medians did not differ between sets for placebo/insulin sessions before and after the intervention (all p &gt; 0.25; mean sugar median = 12.8 g sugar/100 g). Data from the placebo and the insulin sessions were defined as single models. In all analyses, we accounted for the expected distribution of errors in the within-subject (dependency) and the between-group factors (unequal variance).</p><p>For each subject, contrast images of interest were then entered into second-level group analyses, that is one sample and two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests. Contrast images of interest comprised onset and parametric regressors for food &gt;non-food and HS &gt; LS from the placebo session at T0 (general paradigm-induced activation) and parametric regressors for HS &gt; LS covering insulin effects at baseline (PL &gt; IN) and compared to follow-up (T1 &gt; T0). We report results corrected for FWE due to multiple comparisons. We conducted this correction at the peak level within small volume of interest (ROI) for which we had an a priori hypothesis or at the whole-brain level. Based on findings in our previous work using the identical pharmacological fMRI setup in younger individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiedemann et al., 2017</xref>), we focused on the NAc and the VTA. We applied the identical functional ROIs (4 mm spheres) centered on the bilateralized peak voxels in the NAc (±12, 10, −8) and the VTA (±4, −14, −12) as in this previous work and as identified via meta-analyses conducted on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neurosynth.org/">neurosynth.org</ext-link> platform.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Senior editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Informed consent and consent to publish was obtained in all participants.

Both aspects strongly suggest that we observed two independent predictive mechanisms in this context.</p><p>We agree that an OGTT or clamp based assessment of insulin sensitivity would have been an interesting addition to this study When we designed the study, we decided against an euglycemic clamp procedure or oGTT, mainly for logistic and compliance reasons. The latter, in particular, could have had an impact on participants’ performance in the scanner. Participants already had to fast overnight for at least 10 hours, meaning that scanning took place in the early morning. Considering that one study day already lasted 2 hours (before participants were finally allowed to eat), a preceding clamp or oGTT would have probably overstretched the physical and psychological compliance of some participants.

Importantly, the four parallel stimulus sets did not differ significantly w.r.t. mean and median sugar content. This is particularly important for the sets used at placebo and insulin at T0 and T1 respectively. The use of the first two sets was counterbalanced for IN/PL at T0, the third and fourth sets were counterbalanced for IN/PL at T1.

They were selected via a Google search from a predefined list that we had created to ensure that a similar amount of savory and sweet foods were included. Sugar in all four stimulus sets was evaluated using the food database on fddb.info. Sugar content did not differ between sets. The correspondence of “valence” between the four stimulus sets was previously validated in an independent sample of 16 participants using liking ratings. We have now made a further subdivision into HS and LS stimuli and, as a kind of approximation to “arousal” / visual complexity, we have done the same for picture saliency (line 516 ff).

Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We preferred the more conservative summary statistics (T-Tests) to factorial designs primarily for the following reasons: Mixed-effects models (i.e., with both within-subjects and between-subject factors, as in our study) require full variance partitioning. Repeated measures ANOVAs (i.e., flexible designs) in SPM provide only one variance term, in this case, within-subject variance. This means that the results of group main effects as well as individual condition main effects can be inflated and therefore require separate models (for more details on this topic, see McFarquhar: Modeling group-level repeated measurements of neuroimaging data using the univariate general linear model. Frontiers in Neuroscience, 13, 2019). Summary statistics are robust to potential misspecification, and since we were primarily interested in analyses with covariates (i.e., simple regressions), we set up all the relevant contrasts at the single subject level and submitted each of the contrast images in a separate one- or two-sample T-test which corresponds to results from an ANOVA with partitioned error terms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) The method section is lacking a statistical methods paragraph for the regression analysis and behavioral data analyses. What tool was used, etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, this paragraph has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) The authors used one-way ANOVAs for analyzing parametric liking scores for the different picture sets. What is the distribution of the liking ratings? Are they normally distributed? The authors computed several rmANOVAs. Were the assumptions for such analyses tested?</p></disp-quote><p>There are three main assumptions for rmANOVAs:</p><p>1) Independent observations: Given for individual subjects.</p><p>2) Sphericity of all difference scores among test variables: We used only two-level within subject factors (i.e., pre vs. post, PL vs. IN, HS vs. LS), that is, testing for sphericity of all differences (e.g., using Mauchly’s Test) is not applicable. In other words, there is no possible violation of this assumption.</p><p>3) Normality: We now have tested for normality for all variables of interest both across participants and within groups using the Kolmorgorov-Smirnov-Test (line 502 ff). The main results here are:</p><p>HS and LS liking scores before and after the scan, at T0 and T1, are normally distributed across participants and within groups (all P &gt;.098).</p><p>HOMA-2 scores at T0 and T1 and difference scores across and within groups are normally distributed (all P &gt;.20)</p><p>We also tested all other variables included in control analyses (hunger, time fasted, glucose, insulin, c-peptides). Here, we found at least one single measure (from pre or post, PL or IN, T0 or T1) was not normally distributed for fasting time, hunger and glucose. Nonparametric tests are now given for these variables (Table 1, Methods line 503 ff, Appendix Tables 1 and 5). As expected, the results did not differ from those of the parametric testing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>BMI reduction was correlated with several measures (predictors of subsequent weight loss). In this (18) case, you must correct your p-values in relation to the number of tests (Bonferroni correction).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now restricted the reported correlations to those related to our main hypotheses on weight loss prediction, i.e., one correlation with peripheral insulin sensitivity and one correlation with neural insulin sensitivity. The neural results are already corrected by family wise error (FWE) correction. In addition, the multiple regression model was used to test the predictive value of both parameters within a single model (partial correlations). To address the reviewer’s concern, however, we Bonferroni corrected the regression coefficients. Both coefficients survived the corrected threshold in our model of interest. In the control analysis with BMI as a third predictor, peripheral insulin sensitivity survived only an uncorrected threshold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were the correlations between the BOLD response and peripheral insulin resistance still significant after adjusting for BMI and age?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, we performed a control analysis including BMI and age as covariates in the regression model of central and peripheral insulin changes. This analysis again revealed significant results in the left NAc with an identical peak voxel (-10, 10, -7, P &lt;.05, FWE corrected). This information was added to the results. For standardization, we also performed this control analysis for baseline findings in the VTA. Again, the addition of the covariates age and BMI did not result in a difference for the significant BOLD response in the VTA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(19) Was the study registered, for example at clinical trials.gov? Were the hypothesis and primary outcomes or study design preregistered? How was weight loss success defined?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, when the study was initiated in 2015, we did not pre-register the project (as we do by default today). This study is based on a peer-reviewed grant proposal where hypotheses are specified and that can be provided by request. It is now post-hoc –registered, but we admit that this is not very satisfactory. Basically, the project was not designed as a clinical trial with no primary focus on clinical outcomes but as a basic research study of how peripheral and central insulin function relates to weight changes in this particular population. For this reason, weight loss (outcome) was only defined by BMI changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(20) The study by Tiedmann et al., 2017 Nat Comm used the same fMRI paradigm to investigate insulin response of the reward circuitry in young adults of normal weight as well as overweight and obesity. In that study, the authors used HOMA-IR as a measure of peripheral insulin resistance. Why change this in the current study?</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for using a c-peptide based measure was that in the current study we observed a surprisingly high within-subject variability in insulin compared to c-peptide levels in some participants. This was also statistically relevant, as evidenced by significantly higher coefficients of variance compared with c-peptide levels. Due to this variability together with reports that c-peptide based indices are a more reliable indicator of insulin secretion, we preferred a c-peptide based measure and are grateful for the reviewer’s suggestion to use HOMA-2 as a further updated model of HOMA-IR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, in the previous study by Tiedemann, DCM model was used to show insulin-induced changes in connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and VTA. This connection was significantly modulated by intranasal insulin. Why wasn't this evaluated in the current study?</p></disp-quote><p>In Tiedemann et al., 2017, we were interested in whether consistent animal findings on insulin action in mesolimbic networks / connections can be translated into the human brain and our DCM results mainly confirmed this translation. In the current study, we used these results to define regions of interest for studying individual predictors and consequences of weight changes. In fact, we had no hypotheses for a generally different basic insulinergic mechanism in this particular sample. But if there are hypotheses of age-related changes in basic insulin function, this should first be tested in healthy, lean older (compared with younger) adults, perhaps involving structural measures. We agree that this could be an interesting question to address in the future. However, the focus of the current project was on longitudinal aspects of the interactions between insulin and weight, and the amount of data and analyses reported here are already quite complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(21) The study of Tiedemann published in 2017 investigated the response of intranasal insulin in young individuals, while the current study included elderly persons. The impact of age independent of BMI has not been investigated thus far on neural insulin processing. Have you looked at the effect of age on the nucleus accumbens or VTA BOLD response to insulin?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that age effects per se are very interesting. At the moment, we do not have data from healthy, lean, older adults to examine this aspect, but we hope to address this question in an upcoming project. At least, as suggested by the reviewer and addressed in response #18, our results hold when including age and BMI as covariates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(22) The authors use the term insulinergic inhibition. Is it possible to evaluate neural inhibition with BOLD fMRI?</p></disp-quote><p>The term insulinergic inhibition is based primarily on our neural and behavioral findings showing (a) reduced food preference, and (b) reduced BOLD signal under insulin compared to placebo. This fits strikingly with data in rodents showing insulinergic inhibition of neural activity in eating-relevant mesolimbic systems (e.g., Stuber and Wise, Nature Neuroscience 2016). Of course, we are unable to differentiate direct or indirect inhibitory effects of insulin, but we believe that our current results, together with our previous data and animal findings, support this “inhibitory” interpretation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
