Here, we show that <italic>Rela</italic> (encoding a canonical NF-κB subunit) ablation in K14<sup>+</sup> corneal epithelial stem cells not only disrupts corneal regeneration but also results in age-dependent epithelial deterioration, which triggers aberrant wound-healing processes including stromal remodeling, neovascularization, epithelial metaplasia, and plaque formation at the central cornea. These anomalies are largely recapitulated in normal mice that age naturally. Mechanistically, <italic>Rela</italic> deletion suppresses expression of Aldh1a1, an enzyme required for retinoic acid synthesis from vitamin A. Retinoic acid administration blocks development of ocular anomalies in <italic>Krt14-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice and naturally aged mice. Moreover, epithelial metaplasia and plaque formation are preventable by inhibition of angiogenesis. This study thus uncovers the major mechanisms governing corneal maintenance, regeneration, and aging and identifies the NF-κB-retinoic acid pathway as a therapeutic target for corneal disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>angiogenesis inhibitor</kwd><kwd>blindness</kwd><kwd>corneal disorders</kwd><kwd>NF-κB</kwd><kwd>retinoic acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0800801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0800803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Baojie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91749201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Baojie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81873679</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Corneal aging is regulated by the NF-κB-retinoic acid pathway and can be delayed by retinoic acid administration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cornea is a transparent organ composed of the epithelial, stromal, and endothelial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yazdanpanah et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nowell and Radtke, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collinson et al., 2004</xref>), with the epithelial basement membrane separating the epithelial and the stroma layers and the Descemet’s basement membrane separating the stroma and endothelial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Medeiros et al., 2018</xref>). While the epithelial layer undergoes constant turnover driven by corneal epithelial stem cells (CESCs), the stromal and endothelial layers are relatively quiescent in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Castro-Muñozledo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Majo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schlötzer-Schrehardt and Kruse, 2005</xref>). Corneal transparency is attributable to the lack of keratin secretion by epithelial cells, the specific arrangement of stromal lamellae, expression of crystallins by keratocytes, and the lack of vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nowell and Radtke, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jester, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yam et al., 2020</xref>). The cornea contributes 65–75% of the eye’s total focusing power and provides a barrier to protect against environmental insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yazdanpanah et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, a clear and healthy cornea is a prerequisite for proper vision.</p><p>As the outermost part of the eye, the cornea is often challenged by external stimuli, including UV radiation, chemicals, traumatic abrasions, or bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nowell and Radtke, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, contact lens usage and eye surgery can also cause corneal injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Toda, 2008</xref>). The damaged corneal epithelial layer is replenished by CESCs, which are mainly located in the limbal region in humans and genetically identified by ABCB2, ABCB5, keratin5/14, or p63 expression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schlötzer-Schrehardt and Kruse, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Notara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cotsarelis et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Iorio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ksander et al., 2014</xref>). Corneal repair often involves inflammation and activation of keratocytes and improper repair may cause epithelial degeneration and dystrophy, scar formation, neovascularization, and the loss of transparency, which affect millions of people worldwide, eventually necessitating corneal transplantation, which is limited by a lack of corneal donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ljubimov and Saghizadeh, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have revealed cross-talks between the stromal and epithelial layers during corneal development and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AbuSamra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dziasko and Daniels, 2016</xref>). Growth factors secreted by keratocytes, particularly Wnt and EGF, promote epithelial cell proliferation via transcription factors such as β-catenin and Pax6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ouyang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McClintock and Ceresa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar and Duester, 2010</xref>). In addition, keratocytes and immune cells also secrete cytokines, such as IL6, to promote epithelial cell proliferation during repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Notara et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, corneal epithelial cells secrete fibroblast growth factors (FGF) to promote stromal cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vauclair et al., 2007</xref>). Still, how corneal epithelial and stromal layers interact under pathological conditions is not well understood.</p><p>Many environmental insults to the cornea are potential activators of NF-κB, which is a central player in the inflammatory response and cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taniguchi and Karin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eluard et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies have reported NF-κB activation in corneal epithelial cells, macrophages, and keratocytes, which is required for cytokine production, corneal regeneration, and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lennikov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). NF-κB activation may promote corneal healing via upregulating the expression of CCCTC-binding factors in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). To further understand the functions of the NF-κB pathway in corneal homeostasis and regeneration, we ablated <italic>Rela</italic>, which encodes a subunit of canonical NF-κB signaling complex, in K14<sup>+</sup> CESCs or keratocytes. While <italic>Rela</italic> ablation in keratocytes did not affect corneal homeostasis or regeneration, <italic>Krt14-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice showed age-dependent deterioration in the epithelial layer at the central cornea, which triggered an aberrant repair response that led to inflammation, neovascularization, epithelial metaplasia, and plaque formation at the central cornea. Interestingly, these corneal phenotypes were largely recapitulated in naturally aged mice, associated with decreased NF-κB activation and RelA expression. Mechanistically, NF-κB positively regulated <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> transcription and retinoic acid (RA) synthesis from vitamin A and that the development of corneal phenotypes in <italic>Rela</italic>-deficient mice or naturally aged mice was largely prevented by RA administration. While vitamin A deficiency is known to cause night blindness, corneal ulcers, and eye development defects, mainly in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fares-Taie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Srour et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yahyavi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verhoeven et al., 2013</xref>), we show for the first time that RA, the metabolic product of vitamin A, is critical in corneal regeneration and aging in mice, implying that RA has the potential to improve corneal health in adult and aged individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Rela</italic> ablation in K14<sup>+</sup> CESCs, but not stromal cells, impairs corneal regeneration</title><p>The ocular surface is constantly exposed to environmental stimuli, many of which are NF-κB activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eluard et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, western blot analysis revealed activation of NF-κB in the corneal tissues of standard housed mice, as indicated by the presence of p-RelA and p-IKKα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed nuclear accumulation of RelA in the central region but not much in peripheral or limbal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Activation of NF-κB signaling was also observed in corneal stromal cells, although to a reduced extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). NF-κB activation was increased in both epithelial and stromal cells after alkaline burn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This finding is consistent with the notion that the basal activity of NF-κB is low but activated during wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) and suggests that NF-κB is involved in corneal regeneration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Rela</italic> ablation in K14<sup>+</sup>corneal epithelial stem cells impaired corneal regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative western blot results showed enhanced activation of NF-κB in corneal samples during regeneration.

Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>), lineage tracing with <italic>Krt14-Cre; ROSA26 <sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> mice showed Tomato<sup>+</sup> labeling of corneal epithelial cells, limbal CESCs, conjunctiva, and meibomian glands, as well as the skin, oral mucosa, and trachea but not intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). The corneas of young <italic>Krt14-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice appeared normal up to 6 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C , D</xref>), suggesting that the canonical NF-κB pathway is dispensable for corneal epithelial development and early postnatal growth. In the mutant mice, expression of K14, a CESC marker, was not affected in central or peripheral cornea or the limbus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting that the genetic manipulation of the <italic>Krt14</italic> or <italic>Rela</italic> locus or <italic>Rela</italic> ablation does not affect K14 expression.</p><p>When 4-week-old <italic>Krt14-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice were subjected to alkaline burn on the ocular surface, severe defects in corneal wound healing were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We used 4-week-old mice to exclude possible effects of corneal growth defects on regeneration as the corneas of <italic>Krt14-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice started to show anomalies at 6 weeks of age. Unlike the controls, the regenerated corneal epithelium lacked a basal layer and epithelial basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Immunostaining revealed the absence of differentiation marker K12, decreased numbers of PCNA<sup>+</sup> proliferating cells, and disrupted Laminin<sup>+</sup> basement membrane at the injury sites, although these anomalies were not observed in the peripheral or limbal epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that <italic>Rela</italic> ablation impairs central corneal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation during regeneration.</p><p>To study the function of RelA in keratocytes, we generated <italic>Prrx1-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. Prrx1 is a marker for mesenchymal stromal cells, and the <italic>Prrx1-Cre</italic> mice have been widely used to study skeletal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Logan et al., 2002</xref>). Our genetic tracing with <italic>Prrx1-Cre; ROSA26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> mice revealed that Prrx1 marked most corneal stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). <italic>Prrx1-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice had a normal corneal structure, and the healing process after alkaline burn injury was normal compared to that of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B, C</xref>). A previous study showed that the deletion of <italic>Ikkb</italic>, which encodes a kinase required for activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, in keratocytes (via <italic>Keratocan-Cre</italic>) impaired corneal repair but not maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). These results suggest that the non-canonical rather than the canonical NF-κB pathway in stromal cells plays a role in corneal regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Rela</italic> ablation causes age-dependent epithelial deterioration at the central cornea</title><p>Further analysis of <italic>Krt14-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice revealed age-dependent changes in corneal structures, including visible plaques at the central cornea by 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Histological analysis showed that the mutant mice had largely normal corneas up to 1.5 months of age. However, at 2 months of age, the mutant mice showed basal cell atrophy at the central cornea, and the degenerative changes expanded to suprabasal cells at the age of 2.5 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). By 3 months of age, the central corneal epithelium had disappeared. In 2-month-old mutant mice, the central cornea had fewer PCNA<sup>+</sup> or p63<sup>+</sup> cells and showed decreased expression of K12 at the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>).

In addition, 1.5 months of RA treatment, starting at 1.5 months of age, prevented thinning and dissolution of the epithelial layer at the central cornea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results suggest that a reduction in RA synthesis mediates the defects in the central cornea caused by <italic>Rela</italic> ablation. Moreover, when we administered RA to 4-week-old <italic>Krt14-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and control mice with alkaline-induced injury, RA-treated mutant mice were able to regenerate the epithelial layer as effectively as normal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>). Note that the peripheral cornea and limbus were not affected by the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Aberrant repair often leads to impaired vision, and under severe conditions, blindness becomes inevitable, and corneal replacement is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Notara et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, a complete understanding of the biology of corneal homeostasis and regeneration is imperative for developing regimens to preserve the cornea and treat cornea-related disorders. In this study, we established NF-κB, which responds to many extracellular stimuli and injury, as a critical regulator of corneal epithelial maintenance and regeneration. While the absence of <italic>Rela</italic> in K14<sup>+</sup> CESCs did not affect corneal development, it caused defective epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation and led to epithelial disruption at the central cornea in a cell-autonomous manner, which triggered inflammatory responses and led to epithelial metaplasia and plaque formation. This study thus uncovered the important mechanisms governing corneal homeostasis and regeneration.</p><p>The findings of our study suggest that centrally located CESCs play a role in corneal homeostasis and regeneration. We showed that activation of NF-κB was stronger in the central cornea than in the limbus. Deletion of <italic>Rela</italic> in K14<sup>+</sup> cells caused thinning and disruption of the corneal epithelium at the central cornea but not the limbus. Subsequently, epidermal fate conversion and plaque formation occurred at the central cornea without affecting limbal CESCs. Furthermore, aging-related corneal phenotypes developed at the central cornea. If limbal CESCs were solely responsible for corneal regeneration, exhaustion of limbal CESCs should have occurred in <italic>Krt14-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. Overall, these findings indicate that central CESCs play an important role in corneal homeostasis and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Majo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nasser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">West, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2010</xref>). The differential responses to <italic>Rela</italic> deletion in the central and limbal CESCs are likely due to their distinct niches as the central cornea is constantly exposed to the external cues including UV lights, infectious particles, chemicals, and dirt and is under different mechanical strains, compared to limbal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nowell et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, we show that <italic>Rela</italic> ablation does not affect other organs/tissues marked by K14 in mice.</p><p>Mechanistically, we showed that NF-κB promoted corneal epithelial progenitor proliferation and differentiation by controlling RA synthesis. NF-κB directly regulated the expression of Aldh1a1, a rate-limiting enzyme in the RA synthesis pathway. Previous studies have shown that RA plays a role in eye development, likely via the Wnt-β-catenin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niederreither and Dollé, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larange and Cheroutre, 2016</xref>), which is involved in corneal stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar and Duester, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nowell et al., 2016</xref>). Vitamin A deficiency in humans causes xerophthalmia, night blindness, corneal ulcers, and other symptoms, especially in children. Our study highlights the importance of RA, a vitamin A metabolite, in maintaining healthy corneas in adults and in preventing corneal aging. RA has been approved to treat skin disorders including psoriasis and acne as well as acute lymphatic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang and Gudas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferreira et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, ablation of <italic>Notch1</italic> in corneal epithelial cells also caused epithelial metaplasia and plaque formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vauclair et al., 2007</xref>). There are a few differences between these two mouse models. The <italic>Notch1-</italic>deficient mice show a loss of meibomian glands and much reduced expression of retinol transporting protein CRBP1 but no thinning or loss of the epithelial layer compared to <italic>Krt14-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. Despite these differences, both models underscore the importance of RA pathway in cornea maintenance and regeneration.</p><p>Notably, RA appears to play an insignificant role in subsequent wound healing events, including epithelial metaplasia and plaque formation. Instead, we showed that stroma-secreted VEGF and/or neovascularization play a causal role in these events. Our findings reinforce the importance of preventing neovascularization in maintaining healthy corneas and suggest that in patients already showing corneal epithelial metaplasia VEGFR inhibitors may help to slow the pathological progression.</p><p>Our findings indicate that NF-κB signaling plays an anti-aging role in mouse cornea. On the other hand, NF-κB activation can increase the expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, which promote inflammation and aging in many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taniguchi and Karin, 2018</xref>). Thus, the activity of NF-κB must be fine-tuned in corneal epithelial cells. What causes the decline in <italic>Rela</italic> expression and activation in aged corneal epithelial cells? As a transcription factor regulating various cellular events, NF-κB is tightly controlled via multiple mechanisms including feedback regulatory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taniguchi and Karin, 2018</xref>). Constant activation of the pathway by pro-aging factors, for example, reactive oxygen species and chronic inflammation, may disrupt the regulatory circuits and lead to reduced expression and activation of RelA. This certainly warrants further investigation.</p><p>In human, although corneal epithelia thinning and keratinization have been observed in the elderly, corneal plaque formation and loss of vision rarely occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blackburn et al., 2019</xref>). One explanation is that aging-related decrease in RA synthesis may be made up for by RA-rich nutrients. Alternatively, age-related corneal problems may be diagnosed early and are treated successfully.</p><p>In summary, this study uncovers the important mechanisms governing corneal epithelium homeostasis, regeneration, and aging, and suggests that the canonical NF-κB-RA pathway may be a target to improve corneal health.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

This knockout results in aberrant wound healing, neovascularization, epithelial metaplasia, and plaque formation in the central cornea. Vitamin A deficiency is known to cause corneal dysfunction defects. Here the authors demonstrate that retinoic acid, a metabolic product of vitamin A, is important for regeneration and aging. The data provided by the authors largely support their conclusions. The main strength of the paper is novelty of demonstrating a RA-related defect in the central cornea but not the limbus. Furthermore, that normal aged corneas in mice have a similar defect to young Rela null mice, both of which are rescued with RA treatment.</p><p>In summary, the Rela KO did not affect corneal development. However, at 4 weeks when wounded with an alkaline burn, compared to control corneas, the Rela null mice demonstrate a loss of K12 and reduced PCNA in the cornea. Furthermore, after 2 months of aging (without injury), Rela null mice displayed large central plaque formation with neovascularization and metaplasia that increased in severity with aging. The limbus was not affected. These data suggest that Rela is required for maintaining corneal homeostasis mainly in the central cornea. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis of the epithelial layers confirmed differentiation of epithelium into epidermis and cell cycle genes supporting excessive proliferation. Furthermore, using a K14-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup>; Tomato mouse, the authors found that the epidermal genes were derived from K14+ cells. RA supplementation rescues the defect. Natural aging of mice demonstrates similar corneal defects to Rela null mice, which are rescued by treatment with RA.</p><p>The article could be strengthened in several ways. For example the interrogation of the importance of the VEGF pathway in plaque formation and metaplasia seems out of place. The authors treat for 6 months with an VEGFR inhibitor, although it does prevent neovascularization and metaplasia, it also prevents epithelial stratification. The analysis of these experiments would need to be clarified. Also, the VEGFR experiments are difficult to assimilate into the overall story and could be removed. In addition, the antibiotic treatment without an infection is difficult to comprehend and coordinate into the overall story. Finally, it would be helpful to propose how aging mouse corneas could compare to human corneal aging and if there is any data on corneal problems solely because of aging in humans.</p><p>Please mention that transparency in the cornea is also from the secretion of crystallins.</p><p>Please reference, limited by a lack of corneal donors, line 18.</p><p>The basement membrane is a critical contributor to the maintenance of epithelial/stromal biology. This should be incorporated into the introduction with references to papers by Steve Wilson, a leader in the basement membrane literature.</p><p>A fairer way to quantify western blot is to take the average of the control (which can then have standard error) and then find the values for experimental/ave control. Even though control will still be 1, it will have incorporated the error into control lanes. For the western in 1a, it would be Control/actin and then experimental/actin divided by ave of control/actin. By setting the control to 1 all error is being eliminated. A small graph might work better.</p><p>Mouse cornea is not fully developed until 6 weeks, the reason for NaOH at 4 weeks is not clear.</p><p>There are many studies on corneal alkaline injury and the role of NFkB, please better reference these studies.</p><p>It would have helpful to stain for scarring markers to understand more about the fibrotic response. There can be little SMA but still a large scar.</p><p>I'm not sure that one can conclude that (page 13 line 20) primary defects are caused by RA deletion and that the later effects are RA independent because these defects are not observed when the RA is supplied earlier.</p><p>Typo figure 7 &quot;tatal&quot;.</p><p>Age-related corneal dysfunction is not really a problem in humans without an underlying disease. Please discuss.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors used a number of approaches in studying the function of NFKB signaling in corneal epithelial homeostasis in control and K14-Cre;Rela<sup>f/f</sup> mice. To generate these mice, Rela<sup>f/f</sup> mice and K14-Cre mice were crossed and the following approaches were used to examine the mice over time and after injury; RNAseq, genetic analysis and lineage tracing, along with more traditional analyses of ChIP, molecular approaches and conventional immunohistochemistry. The authors showed that after an alkali injury there was a decrease in K12 and PCNA in the central cornea, that was not detected in the peripheral and limbal epithelium. Additional experiments supported the observation that the central cornea responds uniquely. When the authors examined the response in the stroma underlying the epithelium, they found that while there was an increase in thickness there was no fibrosis and they speculated that the response was secondary to the epithelium as it was not generated or detected until the epithelial changes occurred. RNA seq data of the cells where Rela was ablated demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in the expression of Aldh1a1 and ChIP verified the presence of the NFKB binding site on the Aldh1a1 promoter.</p><p>Further analyses demonstrated that the abnormal cells were all tomato+ indicating that the cells in the center were derived from K14; however it is not understood why the other K14 labelled cells in the cornea or in basal skin were not affected by RelA deletion. The authors showed that the response could be rescued when corneas were treated with retinoic acid before thinning and plaque development was detected. Conversely, there was no rescue if treated after thinning occurred. The authors also performed confirmatory experiments in vitro and found that cultured epithelial cells that were Rela<sup>-/-</sup> displayed decreased proliferation and K12 and these could also be rescued with retinoic acid. These all indicate that NFKB signaling appears to regulate epithelial homeostasis and that the biological changes are presumably caused by a decrease in the enzyme, Aldh1a1, and can be rescued with exogenous retinoic acid. In addition these indicate that the environment of the central corneal cells is unique and the authors suggest that the stroma plays a major role but their investigation into this question are relatively limited and a mixture of questions are asked. That being said, the study up to this point is extremely interesting and suggests that the pathology is dynamic and &quot;flexible&quot; up until a certain point. While this does demonstrate that the study is not complete, it also suggests that there are many facets to further investigate, most specifically the role of the stroma.</p><p>As mentioned above, the weakness of the study occurred when the authors performed a number of experiments to understand the source of the factor. These included an analysis of expression of VEGF isoforms along with an inhibitor of VEGFR and an antibiotic. Neither of these altered the specific response and so only provided more questions. That being said, a simple ageing study revealed a very interesting observation and that is there was a natural thinning of the corneal thinning by 24 months of age that was similar to that induced by ablation of RelA in the mice. The authors showed that the changes were not detected at 20 months and demonstrated that if mice were treated with retinoic acid at 20 months for four months, they could delayed or inhibit thinning or plaque development.</p><p>The study is quite interesting where a normal ageing study is compared to changes that occur when RelA is ablated. The study indicates that there is a change in the level of enzyme over time and that rescue can occur by administering retinoic acid. It does not explain why the enzyme decreases or is suppressed with age, nor does it describe why it is region specific. The manuscript would be improved by:</p><p>1. Higher magnification of central and peripheral corneal images of the exact time pts where thinning occurs for the different conditions: Rela ablation, alkali burn, ageing in the presence or absence of RA. Digital expansion revealed a certain level of resolution but was not sufficient.</p><p>2. Supplement figures 1 and 2 should go in text to show the regions of the cornea that are affected. They confirm and are important.</p><p>3. Add the data in supplement figure 3 of corneal defects to figure 2 as it rules out a number of questions that occurs while the manuscript is being read and it completes the data.</p><p>4. The experiments on Vegf and antibiotics might fit better in supplement as they did not describe the mechanism.</p><p>5. The summary sentence of the result is weak and similarly for the discussion. It is quite an interesting and complex study and additional explanations should be explored! It appears that the canonical NFKb signaling pathway is a potential target, but it is complex as expression of K12 is not the only predictor as cells that are affected are in the central cornea and not peripheral or limbal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Yu and co-authors details an investigation into the effects of ablating Rela (a subunit of NF-ƙB) in K14+ basal cells then studying how corneas heal after inflicting a chemical wound and the pathology that ensure after a substantial follow-up period.

The authors provide a wealth of data using a wide array of techniques in relations to characterizing the pathways and pathway elements that partake in the interesting phenomenon. This reviewer wondered how specific to the eye this discovery really is, given the mutation is global i.e. it presumably affects all 14+ basal epithelial cells through the body.</p><p>I have several concerns related to the writing of several section, study design, omission or inappropriate controls, animal numbers, statistics and general clarifications that should be addressed to improve the quality and impact of this study.</p><p>1. Introduction, page 4, paragraph 2, lines 7-8: &quot;We hypothesized that NF-ƙB signaling plays important physiological roles in the cornea&quot; Are there prior notifications in the literature that support this proposition? If so, the authors should elaborate and cite the relevant literature.</p><p>2. Introduction, page 4, paragraph 2, lines 8-22: This entire commentary is devoted to rehashing the results of the study. Overall, I felt the Introduction was poorly written because it provided little or no direction as to where the research was heading.</p><p>3. Results, page 6, lines 3-4: This first statement is an example of what is needed in the Introduction. This is to inform the reader of what is to come in the manuscript.</p><p>4. Results, related to Figure 1, lines 7 and 9: &quot;but not much&quot; and &quot;reduced extent&quot; We do not know for certain whether these results are significant or not because they are descriptive. I suggest some form of quantitation be performed.</p><p>5. Results, related to Figure 1, line 10: In reference to 'stromal' cells; what is their phenotype, i.e. are they resident keratocytes or infiltrating inflammatory cells?</p><p>6. Results, related to Figure 1, page 7, lines 1 and 2: &quot;lacked a basal layer and basement membrane&quot; How do the authors reconcile the absence of a BM without having stained for BM components or indeed performing ultrastructural (i.e. EM) investigations?</p><p>7. Figure 1: Please provide the graphical representation for the Western Blot in panel a and the appropriate statistics. In relation to Figure 1 panel b please provide the appropriate data from the isotype controls, this will establish specificity of the Rel A staining. IN relation to Figure 1 panel c. Please provide the quantification and the number of independent replicate this blot represents.</p><p>8. Results, related to Figure 2, line 8: 'Prrx1-cre', perhaps I missed it in my read but was this line ever explained?</p><p>9. Results, related to Figure 2, page 8, paragraph 1: In relation to the K14-Cre Rela<sup>f/f</sup> line are there any aberrations in other organs apart from the eye/cornea after all there are K14+ basal cells that are present in other organs, skin, nasal, oral mucosa, conjunctiva, intestine, etc. I realise that they have investigated the skin of these mice and found not abnormalities (Suppl Figure S5) but how old were these mice compared to those which develop corneal defects?</p><p>10. Results, related to Figure 3, page 8, line 20: &quot;we found stromal cell hyperproliferation, leukocyte infiltration,.….&quot; How were stromal cells marked, and were they activated fibroblasts i.e. myofibroblasts?</p><p>11. Results, page 9, line 12: &quot;which are features characteristic of hyperproliferative skin&quot; One way of confirming the phenotypic switch is to stain for pax6.</p><p>12. Results, related to Figure 3, page 10, paragraph 1: The authors should stain for K14 in wt and their mutant mice to confirm that the expression of this marker is not altered due to the genetic alteration in mutant mice.</p><p>13. Results, related to Figure 4, page 12, paragraph 1, line 8: Is RA synthesis defective in any other ocular tissue of body organ or (again) is this a cornea specific anomaly? The authors should screen other sites.</p><p>14. Results: In relation to Figure 5, none of the observations have been quantified, an effect is assumed based on visual inspection.</p><p>15. Results, related to Figure 6b, page 14, paragraph 1, lines 9-12: Axitinib had multiple affects e.g it 'suppressed epithelial cell metaplasia' In this setting it may have suppressed K1 but did K12 expression did not return. Therefore, what are these epithelial cells lining the cornea? Please identify and please quantify all features displayed in Figure 6b.</p><p>16. Results, related to Figure 7, page 16, paragraph 1: In relation to the data presented in Figure 7 are the naturally aged normal mice non-genetically manipulated (i.e. truly wt) and are they bread on the same background to the mutant mice? If not, this is a major flaw in the study. Did any BV or lymphatics form in the physiologically aged mice that developed corneal lesions and what is the pax6 status of these corneas? Likewise, some quantification of the data presented in panel d is necessary. In the third column of panel d what is vimentin detecting versus the α-SMA?</p><p>17. Results, related to Figure 7: In general, if mutant mice were aged (without wounding) would they develop the same corneal lesions (and in the same proportion of individuals) as their physiologically aged counterparts?</p><p>18. Results, related to Figure 8: In relation to opacity, how was this feature defined and measured. I suggest the authors identify the phenotype of the epithelium covering the cornea after RA treatment (K12/pax6/K14/ etc)</p><p>19. Discussion, general comment: How different is the corneal pathology in Notch mutant mice (see reference 21) compared to the defects that develop in the line being described herein?</p><p>20. Discussion, page 20, paragraph 2, lines 5 and 13: Does the expression of epidermal-specific genes revert to corneal-like genes after RA application? In other words, once cells have committed switch phenotype, are they able to revert back to their original lineage? Likewise, addition of VEGFR inhibitors seems to restore some of the pathological features but can this treatment restore corneal epithelial phenotype? This information is important.</p><p>21.

To generate these mice, Rela<sup>f/f</sup> mice and K14-Cre mice were crossed and the following approaches were used to examine the mice over time and after injury; RNAseq, genetic analysis and lineage tracing, along with more traditional analyses of ChIP, molecular approaches and conventional immunohistochemistry. The authors showed that after an alkali injury there was a decrease in K12 and PCNA in the central cornea, that was not detected in the peripheral and limbal epithelium. Additional experiments supported the observation that the central cornea responds uniquely. When the authors examined the response in the stroma underlying the epithelium, they found that while there was an increase in thickness there was no fibrosis and they speculated that the response was secondary to the epithelium as it was not generated or detected until the epithelial changes occurred. RNA seq data of the cells where Rela was ablated demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in the expression of Aldh1a1 and ChIP verified the presence of the NFKB binding site on the Aldh1a1 promoter.</p><p>Further analyses demonstrated that the abnormal cells were all tomato+ indicating that the cells in the center were derived from K14; however it is not understood why the other K14 labelled cells in the cornea or in basal skin were not affected by RelA deletion. The authors showed that the response could be rescued when corneas were treated with retinoic acid before thinning and plaque development was detected. Conversely, there was no rescue if treated after thinning occurred. The authors also performed confirmatory experiments in vitro and found that cultured epithelial cells that were Rela<sup>-/-</sup> displayed decreased proliferation and K12 and these could also be rescued with retinoic acid. These all indicate that NFKB signaling appears to regulate epithelial homeostasis and that the biological changes are presumably caused by a decrease in the enzyme, Aldh1a1, and can be rescued with exogenous retinoic acid. In addition these indicate that the environment of the central corneal cells is unique and the authors suggest that the stroma plays a major role but their investigation into this question are relatively limited and a mixture of questions are asked. That being said, the study up to this point is extremely interesting and suggests that the pathology is dynamic and &quot;flexible&quot; up until a certain point. While this does demonstrate that the study is not complete, it also suggests that there are many facets to further investigate, most specifically the role of the stroma.</p><p>As mentioned above, the weakness of the study occurred when the authors performed a number of experiments to understand the source of the factor. These included an analysis of expression of VEGF isoforms along with an inhibitor of VEGFR and an antibiotic. Neither of these altered the specific response and so only provided more questions. That being said, a simple ageing study revealed a very interesting observation and that is there was a natural thinning of the corneal thinning by 24 months of age that was similar to that induced by ablation of RelA in the mice. The authors showed that the changes were not detected at 20 months and demonstrated that if mice were treated with retinoic acid at 20 months for four months, they could delayed or inhibit thinning or plaque development.</p></disp-quote><p>We thought that the findings that VEGFR inhibitor could suppress corneal epithelial metaplasia and plaque formation may have some clinical implications. The reason why we did the antibiotics-related study is that we saw open wounds in the cornea of the mutant mice, which would increase the risk of infection. Indeed we see immune cell infiltration in the stroma of the mutant mice was suppressed by antibiotics treatment.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have moved these results into the supplementary data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study is quite interesting where a normal ageing study is compared to changes that occur when RelA is ablated. The study indicates that there is a change in the level of enzyme over time and that rescue can occur by administering retinoic acid. It does not explain why the enzyme decreases or is suppressed with age, nor does it describe why it is region specific.

The summary sentence of the result is weak and similarly for the discussion. It is quite an interesting and complex study and additional explanations should be explored! It appears that the canonical NFKb signaling pathway is a potential target, but it is complex as expression of K12 is not the only predictor as cells that are affected are in the central cornea and not peripheral or limbal.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions.

Some of the features that develop in the mutant mice seem to be recapitulated is a fraction of physicologically aged (normal) mice, implying that this factor is a key regulatory element in supporting corneal homeostasis. The authors provide a wealth of data using a wide array of techniques in relations to characterizing the pathways and pathway elements that partake in the interesting phenomenon. This reviewer wondered how specific to the eye this discovery really is, given the mutation is global i.e. it presumably affects all 14+ basal epithelial cells through the body.</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed a few tissues where epithelial cells are known to be marked by K14 and found that these tissues did not show obvious defects in the knockout mice, indicating that the effect of <italic>Rela</italic> ablation is rather specific to the central cornea.
