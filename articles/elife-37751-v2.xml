spliceosomes. Human spliceosome assembly involves both cross-intron and cross-exon interactions, but how these work together is unclear. We examined in human nuclear extracts dynamic interactions of single pre-mRNA molecules with individual fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes to investigate how cross-intron and cross-exon processes jointly promote pre-spliceosome assembly. U1 subcomplex bound to the 5' splice site of an intron acts jointly with U1 bound to the 5' splice site of the next intron to dramatically increase the rate and efficiency by which U2 subcomplex is recruited to the branch site/3' splice site of the upstream intron. The flanking 5' splice sites have greater than additive effects implying distinct mechanisms facilitating U2 recruitment. This synergy of 5' splice sites across introns and exons is likely important in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37751.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A gene is a segment of DNA that usually carries the information required to build a protein, the molecules responsible for most of life’s processes. This DNA segment is organized in modules, with coding sections separated by portions of non-coding DNA known as introns.</p><p>When a gene is ‘turned on’, it gets faithfully copied into a molecule of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA), which contains the alternating coding and non-coding modules. Before it can serve as a template to create a protein, this pre-mRNA must be processed and all the introns removed by a structure called the spliceosome. If this delicate process goes wrong, inaccurate protein templates are produced that may be damaging for the cell.</p><p>Spliceosomes are precise molecular ‘scissors’ that can recognize where a coding module stops and an intron starts, and then make a snip in the pre-mRNA to remove the non-coding sequence. The spliceosome is a complex molecular machine formed of numerous parts – including one known as U1 snRNP – that must come together. When a pre-mRNA has several introns, a spliceosome assembles anew for each of them.</p><p>Braun et al. designed a new method that allows them to ‘tag’ spliceosomes extracted from a human cell and follow them as they come together. The experiments show that spliceosomes working on different introns in the same pre-mRNA actually help each other out. As one assembles, this helps the spliceosome that processes the neighboring intron to get built. In particular, the U1 snRNPs processing nearby introns collaborate to promote the assembly and activity of the spliceosomes. This teamwork is likely important to guarantee that multiple introns are cut out quickly and accurately.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>spliceosome</kwd><kwd>single-molecule</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>snRNP</kwd><kwd>CoSMoS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM053007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Melissa J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000166/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braun</surname><given-names>Joerg E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 890-2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braun</surname><given-names>Joerg E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Melissa J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM081648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gelles</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Viewing the dynamic interactions of individual spliceosomal subcomplexes with single pre-messenger RNA molecules reveals how nearby flanking splice sites accelerate pre-spliceosome assembly and the splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spliceosomes consist of the U1, U2, and U4/U6.U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and multiprotein Prp19-complex as major building blocks, plus many transiently interacting splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>). This machinery recognizes and assembles stepwise at splice sites (SS) (U1 at 5'SS and U2 at the 3'SS/branch site) to form pre-spliceosomes, which are subsequently remodeled into catalytically active spliceosomes. Pre-spliceosomes can form on multi-intron pre-mRNAs through at least two different pathways. An intron can be recognized a) via cross-intron interactions leading directly to a catalytically active spliceosome, or b) via cross-exon interactions where the exons flanking an intron are first defined, after which cross-intron interactions between adjacent cross-exon complexes lead to spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moldón and Query, 2010</xref>). On human pre-mRNAs, which characteristically harbor multiple long introns and short exons, exon definition predominates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berget, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fox-Walsh et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, splicing is greatly enhanced when a 5'SS is present across the exon downstream of an intron, highlighting the importance of exon definition in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Talerico and Berget, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yue and Akusjärvi, 1999</xref>). Cross-exon pre-spliceosomes can transition into cross-intron pre-spliceosomes, each having a distinct protein composition; the latter can then productively splice the pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiara and Reed, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which cross-intron and cross-exon pre-spliceosomes work together to facilitate pre-mRNA splicing remain unclear. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, where the cross-intron pathway predominates, single-molecule approaches have proven invaluable for elucidating the kinetic pathways and subcomplex dynamics involved in spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Semlow et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Warnasooriya and Rueda, 2014</xref>). Here we developed the tools necessary to implement colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS) in human cell extracts and used this system to investigate the dynamic mechanism of cross-intron and cross-exon cooperation in human pre-spliceosome assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-molecule visualization of spliceosome assembly and function in human cell extract</title><p>We began by investigating whether human nuclear extracts can assemble catalytically-competent spliceosomes on surface-tethered pre-mRNA molecules. To do this, we utilized the pre-mRNA model substrate PIP85A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moore and Sharp, 1992</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We refer to this RNA here as ‘<italic>5i3’</italic> to indicate that, reading in the 5'-to-3' direction, it contains a partial exon, a 5'SS (<italic>‘5’</italic>), an intron (<italic>i</italic>), a 3'SS (<italic>‘3’</italic>), and another partial exon. For this pre-mRNA 20 ± 2% (s.d.) was converted to spliced products after 40 mins in human cell line HEK293 nuclear extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). No spliced products were observed in the absence of ATP, which is required for spliceosome assembly. To monitor splicing of individual <italic>5i3</italic> molecules, we incorporated a green-excited dye into the 5' exon, a red-excited dye into the intron, and biotin at the end of the 3' exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We sparsely deposited this pre-mRNA onto a streptavidin-functionalized glass surface, added nuclear extract and followed green and red fluorescence from single pre-mRNA molecules over time. To exclude pre-mRNAs that lost intron signal due to RNA degradation, we selected only those molecules retaining 5' exon (green) fluorescence at the end of the 40 min experiment. Of these, 1.1 ± 0.7% (s.e.) lost intron (red) fluorescence in a control conducted in the absence of ATP (likely due to photobleaching) whereas 18 ± 4% (s.e.) lost intron fluorescence in the presence of ATP. This single-molecule assay specifically monitors intron release, while the bulk assay measures the second splicing step. Intron release requires an ATP-dependent structural rearrangement of the splicing machinery after the second splicing step, so as expected the lag phase was somewhat longer in the single-molecule assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) than in the bulk splicing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, surface-tethered <italic>5i3</italic> pre-mRNA molecules were spliced with a similar efficiency (17%) to what is observed in solution (20%).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37751.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Observing splicing of the PIP85A (<italic>5i3</italic>) model pre-mRNA (<bold>A</bold>) in bulk (<bold>B</bold>) and single-molecule (<bold>C</bold>) splicing assays.</title><p>Introns and exons are schematized as blue lines and rectangles, respectively, with A indicating the branchpoint.

U1 binding to <italic>5i3</italic> RNA was highly dynamic with many arrivals and departures per active RNA molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>) and a high frequency of short (&lt;50 s) binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and H</xref>). In comparison, progressively fewer <italic>5i3</italic> molecules bound U2 and U5 and the average occupancy of RNAs by these subcomplexes was also progressively lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and I</xref>). Observed binding events were almost entirely RNA-specific; fewer and only short-duration binding events were observed at control ‘no RNA’ locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, the kinetics of human spliceosomal subcomplex binding and dissociation on the cross-intron <italic>5i3</italic> substrate were similar to those observed in CoSMoS experiments on cross-intron RNAs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shcherbakova et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Spliceosomal subcomplex interactions with the cross-exon <italic>3e5</italic> RNA were quantitatively different from interactions with the cross-intron <italic>5i3</italic> RNA. <italic>3e5</italic> RNA molecules exhibited more frequent binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>) and higher mean occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) for all subcomplexes than <italic>5i3</italic> molecules. These differences might be partially explained by the inability of the cross-exon pre-mRNA to form a catalytically active spliceosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), resulting in the greater accumulation of inactive spliceosome assembly intermediates at steady state. Consistent with this idea, U1, U2 and U5 exhibited a higher frequency of long-lived (&gt;50 s) binding events on the splicing-inactive <italic>3e5</italic> RNA than on the spliceable cross-intron <italic>5i3</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In addition, possible differences between <italic>5i3</italic> and <italic>3e5</italic> three-dimensional structures could also alter the kinetics of their interactions with snRNPs.</p><p>We next investigated the effects of SS consensus sequence mutations on U1 and U2 binding dynamics. We restricted alterations to short consensus subcomplex binding sequences to reduce the possibility of the mutations causing large-scale changes in the three-dimensional structures of the RNAs. Functional U2 association with pre-mRNA depends on a polypyrimidine tract and the 3'SS AG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ruskin et al., 1988</xref>). As expected, multiple pyrimidine to purine substitutions within the polypyrimidine tract combined with a 3'SS AG to GG mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) greatly decreased the frequencies of RNA-specific U2 binding events, reducing binding to near-background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). U1 binding, however, was largely unaffected by these mutations, with U1 specific association frequencies and dwell time distributions on <italic>5iX</italic> and <italic>Xe5</italic> RNAs indistinguishable from those on <italic>5i3</italic> and <italic>3e5</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, consistent with previous cross-intron data in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Séraphin and Rosbash, 1991</xref>), human U1 binding is independent of U2 binding in both cross-intron and cross-exon contexts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37751.015</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Interdependence of U1 and U2 binding to cross-intron and cross-exon RNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of <italic>5i3</italic> and <italic>3e5</italic> RNAs without or with polypyrimidine tract and 3'SS mutations (<bold>X</bold>).

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roca et al., 2013</xref>). As expected, this mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) decreased the U1 association rate and eliminated RNA-specific long-duration (&gt;60 s) U1 binding events in both cross-intron and cross-exon contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus long-duration U1 binding events reflect its association with the canonical 5'SS, as reported previously in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larson and Hoskins, 2017</xref>). In contrast, short duration U1 binding events are still present (although reduced in frequency) after 5'SS mutation and may reflect sequence non-specific interactions with the RNA.</p><p>Surprisingly, the 5'SS mutations affected U2 binding even more strongly than U1 binding. In both the cross-intron and cross-exon contexts, elimination of the canonical 5'SS decreased U2 binding frequency to background within experimental uncertainty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Absence of U5 binding to these RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>) confirmed that the mutations abolished the formation of functional pre-spliceosomes. These observations could indicate that observable U2 binding requires the U1 binding to a 5'SS positioned either cross-exon or cross-intron. Alternatively the results could also be explained if the 5'SS mutation indirectly affects U2 binding by affecting the pre-mRNA secondary structure. To exclude the latter possibility, we demonstrated U2 binding to the 5i3 and 3e5 was also eliminated in experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>) in which U1 interaction with the 5'SS was blocked by the addition of a morpholino oligonucleotide antisense to the U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaida et al., 2010</xref>). We conclude that U2 binding to the 3'SS is strongly dependent on U1 binding to a 5'SS either upstream (cross-intron) or downstream (cross-exon). This suggests an ordered human pre-spliceosome assembly pathway in which stable U2 association in the presence of ATP requires prior U1 binding, in contrast to the branched pathway observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shcherbakova et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Synergistic effects of cross-intron and cross-exon 5'SS on pre-spliceosome assembly</title><p>In multi-intron pre-mRNAs, internal exons have 5'SS both upstream and downstream, either or both of which could bind U1 and act to recruit U2 to the 3'SS. In principle, the two U1s could act either independently or synergistically. If there is only one means by which U1 can recruit U2 (e.g., via binding to a single site on U2), the combined effect of two U1s on U2 binding would be at most the sum of their individual actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herschlag and Johnson, 1993</xref>). Such is the case for the activities of multiple SR proteins on splicing efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graveley et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast, if the upstream and downstream U1s can interact with U2 simultaneously, or if they accelerate different steps in the overall U2 recruitment process, their combined effect could be larger, that is, synergistic. Such synergy was previously observed between two distinct sequence elements within a regulated splicing enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lynch and Maniatis, 1995</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the upstream and downstream 5'SS independently or synergistically promote U2 binding, we constructed a pre-mRNA with 5'SS both upstream and downstream of the 3'SS (<italic>5i3e5</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) as well as RNAs with mutations in either one 5'SS (<italic>Xi3e5</italic> and <italic>5i3eX</italic>) or both (<italic>Xi3eX</italic>).

Consistent with the observation that U2 binding in the cross-intron and cross-exon contexts depends on a 5'SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), no U2 binding above background levels was observed for the RNA with no 5'SS (<italic>Xi3eX</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Thus, the 5'SS dependence of U2 binding seen with the longer RNAs was qualitatively similar to that observed on the previously characterized shorter RNAs.</p><p>Striking differences were apparent, however, when we compared the single 5'SS RNAs (<italic>Xi3e5</italic> and <italic>5i3eX</italic>) to the double 5'SS RNA (<italic>5i3e5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The presence of flanking 5'SS both upstream and downstream of the 3'SS dramatically increased U2 recruitment, with the RNA-specific U2 binding event frequency being more than 2.5 times the sum of the frequencies observed when either the upstream or downstream 5'SS was present alone. A similar effect was seen in the U2 occupancy measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), although the occupancy data is more difficult to interpret due to splicing via the cryptic splice site in <italic>Xi3e5</italic>. A much greater than additive effect was also seen when we compared the distributions of the time to the first U2 binding observed on each RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), a metric that is comparatively immune to artefacts from spot detection dropouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedman and Gelles, 2015</xref>).

The experiments reveal that the dynamics of U1 binding to the 5'SS are largely unaffected by the presence of U2 binding sites positioned either downstream (cross-exon) or upstream (cross-intron) of the 5'SS. In contrast, stable U2 binding to the 3'SS is accelerated by a 5'SS situated across either the adjacent intron or adjacent exon. Strikingly, when functional 5'SS are present together at both cross-intron and cross-exon locations, they synergistically promote U2 recruitment.</p><p>The more than additive effect of the flanking 5'SS indicates that U1 employs different molecular mechanisms/interactions across introns and across exons to accelerate U2 recruitment. A simple model that would explain this observed synergy of cross-exon and cross-intron 5'SS on U2 recruitment rate is that cross-exon U1 binding assists in recruiting the splicing factors that form a platform for U2 binding to the upstream 3'SS region, whereas the cross-intron U1-U2 interaction favors a U2 conformation capable of productive branch site engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, left). Across exons, U1 is known to recruit U2AF (U2 auxiliary factor), which recognizes the polypyrimidine tract and 3'SS AG, and physically interacts with other proteins (e.g., SF1, p14, SF3B and SR proteins) required for stable U2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Black, 2003</xref>). Across introns, U1 and U2 can interact via the DEAD-box protein Prp5, the ATPase activity of which promotes a structural change in U2 that makes the branch site recognition sequence more solvent accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu Dayyeh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">O'Day et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). A different and not necessarily mutually exclusive model is that cross-exon and cross-intron U1 interactions could both help form the binding platform for U2, but by interacting with different proteins (e.g., the upstream U1 stabilizes SF1 and the downstream U1 stabilizes U2AF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Black, 2003</xref>). This arrangement would increase the likelihood of U2 encountering a fully assembled binding platform when in a conformation capable of stable branch site engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, right). Other mechanisms for synergy, such as those mediated by effects on RNA secondary structure, are also possible.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37751.032</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Implications of synergistic U2 recruitment for the mechanism of exon and intron recognition.</title><p>The cartoon illustrates how differing modes of U1 action from upstream (cross-intron) and downstream (cross-exon) sites can synergize to promote faster U2 binding when both flanking U1 sites are present.

Such models predict that the presence of a downstream U1 will not affect the lifetimes of stable U2 complexes once formed. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> are consistent with this prediction: both the overall shape of dwell time distributions and the ratios of binding frequency to occupancy are similar for the RNAs with (<italic>5i3e5</italic>: 1.0 ± 0.2 s<sup>−1</sup>) or without (<italic>5i3eX</italic>: 1.3 ± 0.9 s<sup>−1</sup>) the downstream site. Taken together, our data suggest that the synergistic stimulatory effect of the downstream 5'SS on splicing is exerted at the U2 recruitment step and the processes that enable it, not at the subsequent steps of spliceosome assembly and splicing.</p><p>Inappropriate skipping of otherwise constitutive internal exons can occur with exceptionally low frequency (~1 in 10<sup>5</sup> splicing events) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fox-Walsh and Hertel, 2009</xref>). But the molecular mechanisms contributing to this remarkable accuracy were previously unclear. By implementing CoSMoS in extracts from human cells expressing genetically-tagged proteins, we here show that a major contributor to exon inclusion is collaboration between flanking 5'SS. This collaboration dramatically increases the rate of stable U2 recruitment during pre-spliceosome formation. Cross-intron and cross-exon 5'SS synergy on U2 recruitment rate explains how U1 can have such a strong effect on U2 recruitment despite its association with pre-mRNA being much more dynamic than U2. This mechanism is likely crucial for rapid definition of internal exons in multi-intron RNAs, enabling the human splicing machinery to avoid inappropriate exon skipping.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nuclear extract preparation</title><p>Stable HEK293 Tet-On Flp-In cell lines were generated to express fSNAP fusions of U1-70K, U2B'', and Snu114 at near endogenous levels as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Singh et al., 2012</xref>).

RNAs were tethered on the slide surface at a total density of ~0.2–0.5 fluorescent spots per µm<sup>2</sup>. When multiple different RNA species were tethered sequentially, a microscope image was taken after each round of deposition to individually identify the molecules of each RNA species. Splicing reactions (60 µl) were assembled as described for the bulk assays above (but without pre-mRNA) and introduced into individual slide lanes by capillary action and wicking; imaging was initiated immediately after reaction loading.

For experiments with the one color pre-mRNAs and labeled nuclear extracts we acquired sequences of 100 one-second duration frames with 300 μW 532 nm excitation alternating with a single one-second frame with 150 μW 633 nm excitation.

Specifically, this study uses the single molecule CoSMoS approach developed in the Moore and Gelles labs to investigate the role of cross-intron and cross-exon interactions in the binding of the U1 and U2 snRNP; an early step in the assembly of the spliceosome. Many previous studies have demonstrated that in mammalian systems, having binding sites for both U1 and U2 either across an intron or on either side of an exon promotes spliceosome assembly and, ultimately, splicing itself. This has been interpreted to indicate that U1 and U2 interact in a cross-intron or cross-exon manner to promote stable association of one or the other component. Previous studies with CoSMoS have called into question such cooperative assembly of U1 and U2 in yeast; however, here the authors address this question in a mammalian system.</p><p>The experiments are elegantly designed, in the use of consistent sequences in the various constructs and in the analysis of multiple substrate variants on the same slide to ensure all RNAs are experiencing the same conditions. Moreover, the major conclusion – that stable association of U2 is synergistically promoted by both cross-intron and cross-exon interactions with U1 – is well supported. One could ask for additional mutations outside the splice sites as controls (for instance in a <italic>5i3e5</italic> context), but it is unclear that this would really add much to the overall story.</p><p>One conspicuously absent piece of data is the binding of U1 to <italic>3eX</italic> or <italic>Xi3eX</italic>. At least the first of these is critical if the authors are going to conclude that &quot;U2 binding was even more strongly affected by the 5’SS mutations than U1&quot;. It would also be interesting to know how mutation of a single 5’SS in the <italic>5i3e5</italic> context impacts dwell times and frequencies of U1 overall. Finally, the authors also should provide data for the association of U2 with <italic>Xe5</italic>. One might imagine that this mutation doesn't reduce U2 frequency much if it is recruited via interaction with U1. This would be an interesting observation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Braun et al. use single molecule fluorescence microscopy to study the formation dynamics of spliceosomal subcomplex assembly from human cell extracts. The authors measure the binding and dissociation kinetics between U1, U2 and U5 snRNPs and RNAs modelling cross-intron or cross-exon assembly. They use a surface immobilized pre-mRNA PIP81A. The same labs have pioneered the use of yeast cell extracts to study spliceosomal assembly at the single molecule level. Based on their data the authors propose that flanking U1 binding sites synergistically increase the rate of U2 binding.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and the experiments are technically sound. However, some of the conclusions in the manuscript appear to be only weakly supported by the data. In addition, aspects of the RNA change between experiments, making it difficult to make solid conclusions. For example, it is not clear how non-specific binding to non-splice sites affects the observed binding patterns, or how potential changes in secondary/tertiary structures have not been formally ruled out. Based on these issues, I cannot recommend publication of this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form. The conclusions may very well hold, but additional experiments/clarifications are need-ed in order to strengthen the paper.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>- Single molecule splicing assays with mammalian cell extracts is an important step forward in the field, which has been limited to yeast cell extracts for about a decade.</p><p>- The ability to begin addressing the question of cross-intron/exon spliceosomal assembly is important.</p><p>- The approach to monitor multiple RNAs on the same slide and under the same conditions is a strength of the paper.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>- All of the experiments presented here use a no-RNA control. In my mind this is not the best control for these experiments. An RNA with scrambled, modified or re-moved 5' or 3' splice sites should be used as a control instead.</p><p>- It is clear that many of the &quot;short&quot; (&lt;50s) U1 binding events are non-specific. How these events are affecting the observed assembly pathways is an important question that needs to be solved in this manuscript. For example, control experiments with immunodepleted extracts (U1, etc.) could address this.</p><p>- Although <italic>5i3</italic> and <italic>3e5</italic> consist of the same sequence elements the order of the elements could dramatically affect their secondary and tertiary structures. How do the structures of these RNA affect the observed results?</p><p>- An important issue with the <italic>3e5</italic> experiments, is that there is no way to demonstrate that the observed binding events lead to bona fide splicing. Could the binding to these RNAs be completely off pathway?</p><p>- In transcribed pre-mRNAs cross-intron and cross-exon spliceosome assembly will directly compete with each other, the observed higher stability of the cross-exon assembly would suggest that cross-intron assembly would not take place in many instances, potentially leading to aberrant splicing. How do the authors reconcile their results with this?</p><p>- Subsection “Assembly of cross-intron and cross-exon pre-spliceosomes”, last paragraph: A simpler explanation is that the secondary structure of the <italic>Xi3</italic> RNA prevents binding of the U2 sub-complex.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes a set of carefully designed single molecule experiments aimed at understanding spliceosomal component recruitment to introns and exons. The authors analyze U1, U2, and U5 association/dissociation dynamics in the context of an intron-defined pre-mRNA substrate, which can splice, and in the context of an exon flanked by functional splice sites, which cannot splice. The results of U1, U2 and U5 dynamics indicate that binding U1 is independent of U2 binding or of additional U1 binding sites. Interestingly, the data also show that U2 dynamics are significantly influenced by additional U1 binding. It is shown that the non-spliceable construct <italic>3e5</italic> exhibited higher U1, U2, and U5 occupancy when compared to the splicing competent <italic>5i3</italic>. The second major observation is that a downstream 5’SS (<italic>5i3e5</italic>) enhances splicing efficiency and U2 occupancy. When carrying out mutational analyses of <italic>5i3e5</italic>, deleting either 5’SS alone or in combination, the authors observe more than additive effects on U2 occupancy. The authors conclude that the presence of a downstream 5' splice site synergistically promotes U2 recruitment.</p><p>The experiments presented examine in more detail previous observations and they provide novel insights. Several years ago, it was demonstrated that downstream 5' splice sites have a positive effect on in vitro splicing (Chiara and Reed, 1995; Yue and Akusjarvi, 1999). It was argued then that their presence improves splicing much like splicing enhancers do. The present work takes such observations a step further by demonstrating that U2 occupancy is much improved. The manuscript should include a discussion of these previous works.</p><p>The main figures supporting the notion of synergy is Figure 4. Permutations of <italic>5i3e5</italic> were tested, either mutating one of the two 5’SS or both splice sites. Of concern here is the fact that <italic>Xi3e5</italic> (the upstream intronic 5’SS deleted) results in the activation of a cryptic splice site. <italic>Xi3e5</italic> is therefore no longer a substrate without an intronic 5’SS, but rather one that has a weaker intronic 5’SS. It is unclear to what degree the data obtained for this substrate may cloud the conclusions. By design, it was expected that this construct should not splice at all. Rather, the mutation should have rendered the splicing competent cross intron construct into a splicing incompetent cross exon construct, similarly as illustrated in Figure 2. Based on consistency expectations, one would have expected that the <italic>Xi3e5</italic> mutation display similar U2 occupancy as the <italic>3e5</italic> construct in Figure 2 – relatively high or ~4-fold higher than what is observed. Using the authors own arguments for explaining the occupancy difference between the splicing competent and incompetent substrates <italic>3e5</italic> and <italic>5i3</italic> (Figure 2), the low U2 signal of <italic>Xi3e5</italic> could be caused by its undesired splicing activity. This discrepancy needs to be addressed as the entire argument of synergy rests in part on the <italic>Xi3e5</italic> occupancy data point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37751.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We thank all three reviewers for their thorough analysis of our manuscript, and their many insightful and helpful comments.

Long binding event frequencies are similar on <italic>5i3e5, Xi3e5</italic>, and <italic>5i3eX</italic>. Thus, in contrast to what we observe for U2, there is no evidence of 5’SS synergy for U1 recruitment. Based on the data in the manuscript, we expected many of the short binding events to be 5’SS-independent, and <italic>Xi3eX</italic> had a high frequency of short binding events. Despite the fact that these data show the expected results, we feel that some caution is required in interpreting them as we cannot distinguish between the presences of one or two U1's bound to each RNA molecule. In summary, we are happy to show these data here, but because they don't lend themselves to any straightforward conclusions, we prefer to leave them out of the manuscript to avoid unnecessary distraction for the reader.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37751.037</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>U1 binding to four RNA constructs, all measured in the same experiment, analogous to the U2 data in Figure 4.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-37751-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors also should provide data for the association of U2 with Xe5.

Nonetheless, as suggested by the reviewer, the original manuscript also contained controls using RNAs with mutated splice sites. In the revised manuscript, we have now added even more controls of this type. Below is a detailed summary of the mutated splice site controls for experiments observing U1, U2, and U5 snRNPs. This list includes both controls present in the original manuscript and new experiments added in the revised version:</p><p>U2: Control experiments with <italic>5iX</italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and <italic>Xe5</italic> (now added to Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-F) show that mutation of the 3'SS consensus sequences reduce U2 binding to background. This implies that none of the detected binding of U2 is sequence nonspecific. Rather, all observed U2 binding over the no RNA background is 3'SS-dependent. Similarly, experiments with <italic>Xi3</italic> and <italic>3eX</italic> (Figure 3C,D) and <italic>Xi3eX</italic> (Figure 4C) show that mutation of the 5’SS consensus sequence(s) reduce(s) U2 binding to background. This again shows that none of the detected binding of U2 is sequence non-specific, and further reveals that all observed U2 binding over background is 5’SS-dependent.</p><p>U5: We have added new controls (Figure 3—figure supplement 5) showing that mutation of the 5’SS reduces U5 binding to background. This demonstrates that there is no detectable sequence non-specific binding of U5. Rather, as for U2, all detected U5 binding events depend on a 5’SS (presumably as a consequence of U1 binding there).</p><p>U1: Control experiments with <italic>Xi3</italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A-C), <italic>3eX</italic> (now added as Figure 3—figure supplement 3D-F), and <italic>Xi3eX</italic> (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> in response to a comment by reviewer #2) clearly show that long U1 binding events, but not short ones, depend on the canonical 5’SS. This is not surprising, since U1 has additional roles aside from of prespliceosome formation – it is known to interact with proteins that bind the RNA cap structure, with proteins that bind the branch point, and with RNA sequences that diverge from the 5’SS consensus. Presumably most or all of the observed short binding events reflect these other interactions, as our experiments show that these short binding events are largely 5’SS independent. In contrast, the long events require the 5’SS, presumably due to sequence-specific interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is clear that many of the &quot;short&quot; (&lt;50s) U1 binding events are non-specific.

The major point of the manuscript is to establish the synergy of cross-intron and cross-exon interactions in recruiting U2 to the pre-spliceosome. We respectfully suggest that it is not necessary to resolve the role of the short U1 binding events to reach that conclusion from the data. Nonetheless, we have revised the text to explicitly state that some or all of the short events may reflect sequence non-specific interactions of U1 with RNA. It is possible that these short U1 binding events are irrelevant to splicing. Alternatively, it might be that the short events report the formation of interactions (e.g., sequence-non-specific binding) that can assist with the ultimate formation of a stable interaction with the 5’SS. With regard to additional control experiments, it was unclear to us how immunodepletion experiments would resolve this point. Nevertheless, we have now added to the manuscript an experiment in which we prevented specific U1 binding to the 5’SS by preincubating the extract with an antisense morpholino oligo directed at the 5' end of U1 snRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Although 5i3 and 3e5 consist of the same sequence elements the order of the elements could dramatically affect their secondary and tertiary structures.

This greatly reduces (but, we acknowledge, does not entirely eliminate) the possibility that differences in 3D structure might contribute to some of the results.

Furthermore, we are unaware of any basis for the suggestion that there is direct competition between cross-intron and cross-exon spliceosome assembly under conditions where splicing actually occurs. Indeed, it is not even clear that cross-exon and cross-intron complexes utilize the same binding surfaces on U2. The synergy we observe suggests that when a downstream, cross-exon 5’SS is present (i.e., in <italic>5i3e5</italic> vs. <italic>5i3eX</italic>), it greatly promotes both U2 recruitment and eventual splicing of the upstream intron rather than causing competition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Subsection “Assembly of cross-intron and cross-exon pre-spliceosomes”, last paragraph: A simpler explanation is that the secondary structure of the Xi3 RNA prevents binding of the U2 sub-complex.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added data to the manuscript reporting experiments where, rather than preventing U1 binding to the 5’SS by mutating the 5’SS consensus (which, as the reviewer points out, has the potential to alter the secondary structure of the pre-mRNA), we instead prevented U1 binding to the 5’SS by adding a morpholino oligo complementary to U1 snRNA (using the same reagent as Kaida et al., 2010 Nature 468:664-668).

Since the latter contains all of the sequence elements present in the former, the most likely explanation is that there may be some additional secondary structure present in the latter that modestly slows U2 binding. Because of the possibility of such structural alterations (as well as experiment-to-experiment variability), we specifically chose not to compare RNAs of different lengths to reach our conclusions about synergy. Instead we compare RNAs that are otherwise identical except for consensus binding site mutations, using only data collected at the same time in the same sample (that is, under precisely identical conditions). (This point is also discussed in response to comments of reviewer 3, above.) Note that because it measures the <italic>association</italic> rate, the frequency measurement in Figure 4C is not significantly affected by consumption of the complexes resulting from the slow cryptic splicing of <italic>Xi3e5</italic>. The same is true for the time to first binding measurements (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). For these reasons, we base our argument for synergy on these analyses, which specifically tell us about the rate of formation of detectable U2-RNA complexes. That is why we emphasize both in the abstract and in the concluding paragraph of the paper that our data demonstrate synergy in <italic>U2 recruitment</italic> rather than talking about synergy in, for example, stabilization of the pre-spliceosome subsequent to U2 binding.</p><p>In contrast to the frequency data, mechanistic interpretation of the specific occupancy data is more difficult because it is affected by multiple factors, including possibly by cryptic splicing as pointed out by the reviewer.
