soluble Fas ligand (sFasL)-mediated inflammation is regulated via interaction with Fas in vivo. We found that FasL interacts specifically with tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF)10B, also known as death receptor (DR)5. Autoantibody-induced arthritis (AIA) was attenuated in FasL (<italic>Fasl<sup>gld/gld</sup></italic>)- and soluble FasL (<italic>Fasl<sup>Δs/Δs</sup></italic>)-deficient mice, but not in Fas (<italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> and <italic>Fas<sup>–/–</sup></italic>)- or membrane FasL (<italic>Fasl<sup>Δm/Δm</sup></italic>)-deficient mice, suggesting sFasL promotes inflammation by binding to a Fas-independent receptor. Affinity purification mass spectrometry analysis using human (h) fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLSCs) identified DR5 as one of several proteins that could be the elusive Fas-independent FasL receptor. Subsequent cellular and biochemical analyses revealed that DR5 interacted specifically with recombinant FasL–Fc protein, although the strength of this interaction was approximately 60-fold lower than the affinity between TRAIL and DR5. A microarray assay using joint tissues from mice with arthritis implied that the chemokine CX3CL1 may play an important downstream role of the interaction. The interaction enhanced <italic>Cx3cl1</italic> transcription and increased sCX3CL1 production in FLSCs, possibly in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Moreover, the sFasL–DR5 interaction-mediated CX3CL1–CX3CR1 axis initiated and amplified inflammation by enhancing inflammatory cell influx and aggravating inflammation via secondary chemokine production. Blockade of FasL or CX3CR1 attenuated AIA. Therefore, the sFasL–DR5 interaction promotes inflammation and is a potential therapeutic target.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DR5</kwd><kwd>soluble fas ligand</kwd><kwd>CX3CL1</kwd><kwd>arthritis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003625</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI14C1277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Doo Hyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Soluble Fas ligand interacts specifically with tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF)10B, also known as death receptor 5, exacerbating arthritis in a Fas-independent manner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) pathway is a major regulator of cell-mediated apoptosis and immune-privileged status in the eyes and testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellgrau et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Griffith et al., 1995</xref>) and plays a pivotal role in maintaining immune tolerance to autoantigens. Membrane-bound FasL (mFasL) can be proteolytically cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), generating soluble FasL (sFasL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kayagaki et al., 1995</xref>). mFasL is essential for triggering Fas-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O' Reilly et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, sFasL regulates non-apoptotic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seino et al., 1998</xref>) but stimulates apoptosis in fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLSCs) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, mFasL and sFasL have different functions in vivo that are not completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O' Reilly et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>FasL-mediated apoptotic and non-apoptotic cellular pathways regulate biological processes via interaction with Fas. Several studies have demonstrated that sFasL acts as a Fas-dependent chemotactic agent for neutrophils in non-apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ottonello et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seino et al., 1998</xref>), and sFasL levels are increased in patients with autoimmune diseases, graft-versus host disease, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Das et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hashimoto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murayama et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, sFasL may be involved in stimulating inflammation. However, whether sFasL-mediated inflammation is regulated via interaction with Fas in vivo and how this regulates inflammation in various microenvironments remains unclear. We identified a Fas-independent membrane-bound receptor for FasL and investigated its function. In this study, we demonstrate that death receptor (DR)five is a Fas-independent membrane-bound receptor for FasL and that the sFasL-DR5 interaction increases inflammation via the CX3XL1–CX3CR1 axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DR5 is a Fas-independent receptor for sFasL that promotes arthritis</title><p>To investigate the Fas-independent function of FasL in the arthritis model, we injected wild-type (WT), <italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic>, <italic>Fasl<sup>gld/gld</sup></italic>, and <italic>Fas<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice with K/BxN serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ji et al., 2001</xref>). The WT, <italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup>, and Fas<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice developed autoantibody-induced arthritis (AIA), whereas the <italic>Fasl<sup>gld/gld</sup></italic> mice exhibited attenuation of joint swelling and expression of <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Tnfa</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Ccl2</italic>, and <italic>Ccl3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). In addition, anti-FasL antibody, but not anti-Fas antibodies, attenuated AIA and joint pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). K/BxN serum transfer increased sFasL in the synovial fluid of WT and <italic>Fasl<sup>Δm/Δm</sup></italic>, but not <italic>Fasl<sup>Δs/Δs</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). <italic>Fasl<sup>Δs/Δs</sup></italic> and <italic>Fasl<sup>gld/gld</sup></italic>, but not <italic>Fasl<sup>Δm/Δm</sup></italic>, mice exhibited minimal joint swelling and cytokine expression. Administration of recombinant (r) sFasL induced joint inflammation in <italic>Fasl<sup>Δs/Δs</sup></italic> and <italic>Fasl<sup>gld/gld</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). Furthermore, rsFasL injection aggravated joint inflammation in both <italic>Fas<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from WT, but not <italic>Fasl<sup>gld/gld</sup></italic>, mice also induced arthritis in <italic>Fasl<sup>gld/gld</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that sFasL generation in hematopoietic cells might be a possible biological candidate to promote AIA by binding to a Fas-independent receptor. Consequently, we performed affinity purification–mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analyses using human (h) FLSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The results imply that DR5, which is encoded by the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF)10B gene, may be a Fas-independent FasL receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). DR5 was expressed in synovial non-immune cells in mice with AIA, rather than in leukocytes, in mice with AIA. DR5 was also expressed in hFLSCs and was more abundant in joint tissues from patients with rheumatoid arthritis than in tissues from healthy control subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). In addition, biotinylated recombinant hFasL bound to EL4 mouse T cells expressing hDR5. This interaction was blocked by anti–hDR5 antibodies or recombinant human (h) TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Biotinylated hTRAIL bound to EL4 mouse T cells expressing hDR5 but not to those expressing hFas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F–I</xref>). Furthermore, an anti-Fas or anti-DR5 antibody blockade partially inhibited the binding of hFasL–Fc protein to the cell surface of hFLSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Anti-DR5 and Fas antibodies did not show cross-reactivity between human and mouse DR5 and Fas, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). Binding of hFasL–Fc protein to the cell surface was completely inhibited by knockdown of <italic>TNFRSF10B</italic> and <italic>FAS,</italic> but not other TNFRSFs such as <italic>TNFRSF1A</italic> (TNFR1), <italic>TNFRSF10A</italic> (DR4), and <italic>TNFRSF12</italic> (DR3) in the presence of anti-Fas antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). Furthermore, knockout (KO) of the <italic>FAS</italic> or <italic>TNFRSF10B</italic> gene in hFLSCs by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C,D</xref>) decreased binding of biotinylated sFasL to cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and binding was completely abolished in <italic>FAS</italic> and <italic>TNFRSF10B</italic> double knockout (DKO) hFLSCs. Re-expression of DR5 gene in DKO hFLSCs rescued biotinylated sFasL and sTRAIL binding to these cells, whereas biotinylated sFasL, but not biotinylated sTRAIL, bound to DKO cells re-expressing the <italic>FAS</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D,E</xref>). Furthermore, specific binding of DR5 to FasL was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>: 1.23 × 10<sup>−12</sup> M for DR5–FasL versus 6.01 × 10<sup>−13</sup> M for DR5–TRAIL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4F,G</xref>) and immunoprecipitation of lysates from sFasL-treated hFLSCs using anti-DR5 antibodies or anti-His antibodies to His-tagged sFasL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4H</xref>). Meanwhile, rhDR5–Fc protein binding to EL4 cells expressing WT hFasL was inhibited by treatment with recombinant hTRAIL, anti-hDR5, or anti-hFasL antibodies, indicating that DR5 can interact with both mFasL and sFasL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4I–L</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that DR5 is a Fas-independent receptor for both mFasL and sFasL.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Death receptor (DR5) is a Fas-independent receptor for soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) that promotes arthritis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Joint swelling and clinical scores in wild-type (WT), <italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic>, <italic>Fasl<sup>gld/gld</sup></italic>, and <italic>Fas<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice (n = 6 per group).

Preincubation with rhFasL, but not rhTRAIL, decreased rhFasL–Fc protein binding to EL4 cells expressing hFas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>), whereas preincubation with rhTRAIL or rhFasL inhibited rhFasL–Fc protein binding to hFLSCs and hDR5-expressing EL4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F and J</xref>). Incubation with excess sTRAIL or sFasL inhibited the sFasL–DR5 (lanes 2 and 3) and sTRAIL–DR5 (lanes 5 and 6) interactions in hFLSCs treated with low concentrations of sFasL or sTRAIL, respectively. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These findings indicate that TRAIL and FasL compete for binding to DR5. The crystal structures of the FasL/DcR3 (Protein Data Bank: 4 MSV) and TRAIL/DR5 (1D4V and 1DU3) complexes show that FasL forms a trimer similar to other tumor necrosis factor ligands, and DcR3 or DR5 binds to the interface formed by two adjacent FasL or TRAIL monomers stoichiometrically in a ratio of 3:3 (FasL:DcR3 or TRAIL:DR5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cha et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mongkolsapaya et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, superimposition of these two complexes demonstrates that the interactions are similar. To test whether the binding mechanisms of FasL and TRAIL to DR5 are similar, we mutated amino acids in cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) 2 and 3 of DR5, which are critical for the TRAIL–DR5 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast to WT hDR5, the rhFasL–Fc protein did not bind to EL4 cells expressing hDR5 with mutations in CRD2 or CRD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), although the expression levels of WT and mutant hDR5 were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Moreover, rhDR5–Fc protein binding was abolished in EL4 cells expressing mutated FasL, which inhibited the interaction between FasL and DcR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that the regions of DR5 that bind to hFasL overlap with those that bind to hTRAIL and that FasL binds to DcR3 and DR5 by similar mechanisms, although the precise sites of interaction between hFasL and hDR5 remain unclear. Moreover, the sFasL–DR5 and sTRAIL–DR5 interactions induced apoptosis and necroptosis in hFLSCs, but cell death was inhibited by NSCI (caspase three inhibitor) and GSK’872 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase three inhibitor), respectively. FasL-induced apoptosis and necroptosis were partially inhibited in Fas or DR5 gene KO hFLSCs and almost abolished in Fas plus DR5 DKO hFLSCs. These findings indicate that FasL–DR5 and FasL–Fas interactions induce apoptosis and necroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>).

This indicates that sFasL–DR5 interaction-induced apoptosis has little effect on AIA.

In contrast, we demonstrated that DR5 is a Fas-independent membrane-bound receptor for FasL that promotes inflammation. DR5 (TRAIL–R2) is one of the four membrane receptors that bind TRAIL and is expressed in cancer cells and various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). After binding to TRAIL, DR5 recruits an adaptor molecule via death domain interactions and induces the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, resulting in cellular apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). The TRAIL–DR5 interaction also simulates cell activation, maturation, motility, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cullen and Martin, 2015</xref>). Similarly, our experiments showed that the sFasL–DR5 interaction induced apoptosis and non-apoptotic responses in FLSCs, implying that the biological effects of sFasL in vitro and in vivo may be attributable to interaction with either Fas or DR5. Soluble DcR3 also bind to FasL, inhibiting the function of FasL in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pitti et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that endogenous DcR3 attenuates the Th1 response and skews the differentiation of tumor-associated macrophages, whereas DcR3–Fc modulates dendritic cell maturation from CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hsu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tai et al., 2012</xref>). These findings suggest that sFasL-mediated inflammation in mice is attributable to sFasL–DcR3 interaction. However, this is impossible because DcR3 is expressed in humans, but not in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin and Hsieh, 2011</xref>). We suggest that FasL plays both DR5- and Fas-dependent roles in regulating various biological events in vivo, which is a paradigm shift in the biology of the classic Fas–FasL pathway.</p><p>TNFRSF proteins enhance the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in an NF-κB-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cullen and Martin, 2015</xref>). Similarly, sTRAIL treatment or overexpression of DR5 or DR4 induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tang et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tang et al., 2009b</xref>). However, no report has described the effect of DR5 on CX3CL1 production. CX3CL1, which is expressed in endothelial cells and FLSCs, promotes cell survival, adhesion, chemotaxis, and migration via secondary chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nanki et al., 2017</xref>). In our experiments, sFasL–DR5 interaction enhanced <italic>Cx3cl1</italic> transcription and sCX3CL1 protein production by FLSCs in mice and humans, possibly in an NF-κB dependent manner, whereas sTRAIL–DR5 interaction did not. Thus, the sFasL–DR5 interaction, but not sTRAIL–DR5 interaction, is a potent inducer of CX3CL1 expression in FLSCs. Furthermore, sFasL–DR5 interaction-mediated CX3CL1 production by FLSCs triggers the migration and chemokine production of joint leukocytes in a CX3CR1-dependent manner, resulting in joint inflammation. Several studies have demonstrated that sFasL acts as a potent chemotactic agent for human and mouse neutrophils at concentrations incapable of inducing cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ottonello et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seino et al., 1998</xref>). However, our experiments demonstrated that sFasL promoted AIA via its interaction with DR5 by producing mediators, rather than acting as a chemoattractant. Thus, the sFasL–DR5 interaction may be an initiating event that amplifies inflammation via CX3CL1 production through two steps: the CX3CL1-mediated influx of inflammatory cells to target sites and the production of secondary chemokines such as CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL10 by CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> immune cells. Moreover, antibody blockade of FasL or CX3CR1 attenuated AIA in mice, suggesting that sFasL–DR5 interaction and CX3CL1–CX3CR1 axis could be therapeutic targets for controlling inflammation. In several studies, DR5 KO mice exhibited increases in tumor metastases and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Finnberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>), which is difficult to understand whether the sFasL–DR5 interaction stimulates inflammation. However, DR5 and FasL are expressed in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Brien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O'Connell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>), and the sFasL–DR5 interaction likely regulates tumor surveillance and inflammation via a complex signaling network involving various biological effects that require further investigation.</p><p>The sFasL–DR5 and sTRAIL–DR5 interactions similarly induced apoptosis and necroptosis in FLSCs, and the regions of DR5 that bound FasL overlapped with those that bound TRAIL. However, sFasL binds DR5, but not DR4, whereas sTRAIL binds both DR4 and DR5, suggesting that the three-dimensional structures and binding mechanisms of interaction of sFasL and sTRAIL may differ. Therefore, although the effector functions, structures, signal transduction pathways, and downstream mechanisms involved may be similar, the two interactions may exhibit some differences. Furthermore, differences in CX3CL1 production may be attributable to differences in binding affinity, critical amino acids in DR5, or signal strength. Increasing evidence indicates that clustering of death receptors in lipid rafts plays a critical role in optimal DR5-mediated signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Holland, 2014</xref>). Thus, understanding how the sFasL–DR5 interaction is fine-tuned to optimize CX3CL1 expression may be necessary for identifying therapeutic targets to decrease inflammation.</p><p>In contrast to our current results, previous studies found that FasL-mediated apoptosis attenuated joint inflammation in murine arthritis models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guéry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hsu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, FasL may regulate joint inflammation by different mechanisms in different arthritis models, possibly due to the distinct microenvironments of each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ji et al., 2002</xref>). The K/BxN serum transfer model used in our experiments is confined to the terminal effector inflammatory responses induced by the T and B cell-independent deposition of antibodies in the joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ji et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, sFasL-mediated induction of joint inflammation may occur in the effector phase rather than the inductive phase of inflammation, although it is unclear whether this sFasL-mediated regulation is involved in the inductive phase of rheumatoid arthritis, which is dependent on T and B cells. Moreover, we did not investigate the distinct functions of sFasL versus mFasL in joint inflammation and unique functions for mFasL and sFasL may produce divergent inflammatory responses. We found that neither mFasL deficiency nor treatment with a caspase inhibitor substantially affected sFasL-mediated joint inflammation in mice. Perhaps mFasL regulates the function of leukocytes via activation-induced cell death during the inductive phase of rheumatoid arthritis, whereas an sFasL-mediated non-apoptotic mechanism promotes joint inflammation during the effector phase. In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate that DR5 is a Fas-independent membrane-bound receptor for FasL and that sFasL–DR5 interaction promotes inflammation by regulating the CX3CL1–CX3CR1 axis, which enhances production of secondary chemokines by CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> immune cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The KRN TCR transgenic mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kouskoff et al., 1996</xref>) was kindly provided by Dr. Diane Mathis and Dr. Christophe Benoist of Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA) and maintained in a C57BL/6 (B6) background (K/B).

has been known to be activated only by the ligand TRAIL. Moreover, in exploring the contribution of this novel interaction to the pathology of autoantibody inducing arthritis in the mice K/BxN serum-transfer model, you found that soluble Fas ligand can induce via DR5 a functional change – transcription of the cytokine CX3CL1 (Fractalkine) – that does not occur upon triggering DR5 function by TRAIL, nor can it be induced via Fas. The induction of CX3CL1, and the consequent induction of several cytokines by the latter, are shown in your study to make a major contribution to the joint pathology in the K/BxN serum transfer model. Overall, this paper makes an important contribution to our knowledge of the functions served by the TNF family in revealing a novel interaction between members of the TNF ligand and receptor families, with a functional consequence that seems to contribute to the pathology of autoimmune diseases.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;DR5 is a Fas-independent receptor for soluble Fas ligand that promotes inflammation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marcus E Peter (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your manuscript was examined by three expert reviewers and a reviewing editor. They were all highly intrigued by your claimed finding that soluble Fas ligand binds DR5 and activates it. They all consider this finding to be of major importance. However, since during the long time that has passed since the discovery of Fas ligand and DR5 none has reached similar findings and, moreover, some studies seemed to have clearly demonstrated that Fas ligand does not bind DR5 (e.g. Figure 2A in PMID 9373179), they were all also concerned that these findings might be mistaken.</p><p>Each of the reviewers sent me a long list of suggestions of ways by which you may address this concern. To assist you coping with these numerous requests I assembled them in three groups that are presented below: (i) Requests that might involve doing some additional experiments, which must be met in order to allow me considering your paper for publication. (ii) Requests concerning just your way of writing, which must also be met. (iii) Additional requests that I consider to be of secondary importance for the central message of the paper. You might choose either to address these requests or just to delete the data that they concern.</p><p>I would like to assist you as much as I can in publishing your interesting findings, However, I feel just as well compelled to do all that is necessary to exclude any mistake.</p><p>(i) Requests that might involve doing additional experiments, which must be met in order to allow me considering your paper for publication.</p><p>1. Much more detailed information should be provided in the Figure Legends and Methods sections about key results pertaining to the proposed interaction of FasL and DR5.</p><p>In particular:</p><p>(a) Detailed information of the antibodies that were used in vivo and ex vivo should be presented. What clone of monoclonal antibodies was used? What is the evidence for mouse- human cross-reactivity (in case of use of antibody against the one to block the other)? etc.</p><p>(b) The concentrations of all the recombinant proteins and antibodies used should be specified.</p><p>(c) The number of experiments performed (biological n) should be specified.</p><p>(d) The mass spectrometry experiment should be described in much greater detail, for example – for how long was sFasL applied, at what temperature, at what concentration, to how many cells? What does &quot;Fc protein was used as a negative control throughout the process&quot; mean? The list of hits obtained from the AP-MS experiment should be fully presented to allow examining if other TNFRSF members were also identified.</p><p>2. All commercially purchased reagents that have been used in key experiments, e.g. sFasL, FasL-Fc, TRAIL, anti-Fas, and anti-DR5 antibodies must be characterized and validated in order to confirm that their identity and activity are indeed what they are advertised to be.</p><p>3. The specific binding of sFasL to DR5 should be reconfirmed by demonstrating co-immunoprecipitation of the two in endogenous setting, that is to say – using cells that express DR5 at its endogenous levels and using sFaL at concentrations of the recombinant protein that mimic endogenous levels. Assessment of the bioactivity of the ligands should also be done at concentrations of the recombinant protein that are at the range of the endogenous levels.</p><p>4. Knockdown does not fully abolish the expression of a protein, nor can the use of antibodies always allow to fully block its activity. To alleviate the concern that such incomplete effects have led to mistaken conclusions the authors are requested to apply CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout the DR5 and Fas genes instead (which is rather easy to do nowadays). They should then further reconfirm the findings by re-expressing the cDNA for the knocked-out genes. Does the knockout of DR5 eliminate a residual response of Fas deficient cells to FasL? Does re-expression of DR5 in such cells rescue such deficiency?</p><p>5. The assessment of the affinity of binding of TRAIL to DR5 should be presented in a figure.</p><p>6. Specific triggering of cell death by DR5 in response to sFasL should be validated by the use of inhibitors that specifically affect apoptosis and necroptosis.</p><p>(ii) Requests concerning just your way of writing, which must also be met.</p><p>1. The authors begin the abstract by noting that &quot;Fas-independent membrane bound receptor for FasL has not yet been reported&quot;. In the introduction, they argue that &quot;in many studies demonstrating the biological effects of FasL in vitro and in vivo, some of the results have not been confirmed to be Fas-dependent. Thus, it is reasonable to consider the possibility that sFasL may bind Fas-independent receptor in addition to Fas in vivo&quot;. The premise that an alternate receptor for sFasL exists is arbitrary: just because this hasn't been ruled out doesn't qualify it as a valid possibility. There has to be some positive evidence in favor of this specific notion in order to qualify it as a starting point or hypothesis for further studies. Please change this statement accordingly.</p><p>2. Fas lpr mice are not completely negative for Fas. Some tissues actually express wt Fas (PMID: 7528670). That could compound some of the data especially the in vivo data. Please discuss the implications.</p><p>3. An interesting consideration is whether the reported increase in metastases in TRAIL-R k.o mice by the Walczak group could be due to FasL unbound to TRAIL-R driving metastasis through increased binding to Fas. In addition, other reports suggested that TRAIL-R deficiency sensitized mice to inflammation, DSS induced colitis or DEN induced liver cancer (PMIDs: 24117005; 18079962). Again, that seems to be at odds with the activity of DR5 described here to promote inflammation. Please discuss the implications.</p><p>4. Not once do the authors explain to a wider audience what FLSC stands for.</p><p>5. Figure 1G: How many patients/slides were stained? Statistics need to be provided.</p><p>6. Line 104: It should read &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 2C&quot;.</p><p>7. Line 107: It should read &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 2D and E&quot;. 8) Line 133: It should read &quot;Figure 2—figure supplement 1B&quot; instead of Figure S4B.</p><p>8.

Are there any specific mutations that can disrupt this binding? Is the FasL binding site for DR5 related to TRAIL's? Is there homology between the DR5 and Fas binding sites for FasL?</p><p>4. All negative data using inhibitors (e.g. zVAD-fmk) need to be supported by positive control data for the inhibitors, particularly in the in vivo experiments.</p><p>5. The authors should provide evidence that sFasL leads to the assembly of a FADD-containing complex that is dependent of DR5 and not Fas using both murine and human Fas and DR5 KO cells.</p><p>6. sFas and TRAIL are known inducers of cell death, however, in the present manuscript the authors do not take into account this variable and the possible effect that cell death might have in, as an example, selecting for a particular cell population. The in vitro experiments should be validated in the presence of cell death inhibitors. In this regard, the authors mention different modes of cell death without testing for them. If such conclusions are to be drawn than the authors should use specific inhibitors of the difference cell death modalities.</p><p>7. Throughout the manuscript there are several controls missing. While the authors demonstrate the efficiency of deletion of the siRNAs used, it is imperative to assess the abolishment of the signaling that depends on that receptor in the presence of its respective bona fide ligands. This can be achieved by assessing of the formation of the FADD-containing complex by western blot and downstream output of cell death and gene activation.</p><p>8. The western blot presented in figure 3j raises doubt regarding the efficiency of Fas blocking in their experiments. As demonstrated in lanes 7-9 versus lanes 1-3, their blocking antibody for Fas has very little capacity to block sFasL-mediated p-IkBα. The authors should explain this observation and (as specified above) repeat the experiment using KO cells for DR5 and/or Fas.</p><p>9. Regarding the mechanisms of AIA and its dependency on DR5-sFasL engagement the authors should show the levels of CX3CL1 in mFasL KO mice and in sFasKO mice treated with recombinant sFasL.

To show that sFasL-DR5 indeed leads to CX3CL1-induced AIA the authors should add to figure 6 a rescue experiment using sFasL-KO mice and conditionally induce CX3CL1 expression.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the revised version of your manuscript &quot;Soluble Fas ligand drives autoantibody-induced arthritis via binding to DR5/TRAIL-R2&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The manuscript has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.

It implies the existence of previous evidence of such an alternative receptor. There is no such evidence and hence the starting point of the study is still poorly justified. One could change the sentence in the introduction to &quot;whether sFasL-mediated inflammation is regulated via interaction with Fas in vivo has not been demonstrated directly&quot;. Also, the next sentence would make more sense if it started with: &quot;By addressing these questions we identified….&quot;.</p><p>In the abstract the authors claim the following: &quot;Affinity purification mass spectrometry analysis using human fibroblast-like synovial cells (hFLSCs) revealed DR5 as a FasL receptor.&quot; This statement is somewhat misleading. As the authors explain in their reply to the reviewers' comments, the mass-spectrometric analysis of the affinity precipitate they obtained with recombinant FasL-Fc, resulted in the identification of many different proteins as putative interactors with DR5 being one of many. It is therefore not correct to claim that the interaction with DR5 would be specific. In the response to the reviewers' comments the authors state that they &quot;selected DR5&quot; from a list of 29 proteins they found in the IP which contained a transmembrane domain or were expressed as extracellular proteins. Whereas this puts the starting point of the study into question (why did they not pick CD70, another TNFRSF member which they found in the list?), I understand the argument but in view of the reviewers they should stay closer to the data and relate to their findings differently. Something along the lines of the following would probably be more appropriate: &quot;Affinity purification mass spectrometry analysis using human fibroblast-like synovial cells (hFLSCs) identified DR5 as one of several candidates as the elusive Fas-independent FasL receptor. Subsequent cellular and biochemical analysis revealed that DR5 can specifically interact with recombinant FasL-Fc protein, albeit with an approximately 60-fold lower affinity than Fas.&quot;</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Soluble Fas ligand drives autoantibody-induced arthritis via binding to DR5/TRAIL-R2&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>.

They were all highly intrigued by your claimed finding that soluble Fas ligand binds DR5 and activates it. They all consider this finding to be of major importance. However, since during the long time that has passed since the discovery of Fas ligand and DR5 none has reached similar findings and, moreover, some studies seemed to have clearly demonstrated that Fas ligand does not bind DR5 (e.g. Figure 2A in PMID 9373179), they were all also concerned that these findings might be mistaken.</p><p>Each of the reviewers sent me a long list of suggestions of ways by which you may address this concern.

Much more detailed information should be provided in the Figure Legends and Methods sections about key results pertaining to the proposed interaction of FasL and DR5. In particular:</p><p>(a) Detailed information of the antibodies that were used in vivo and ex vivo should be presented. What clone of monoclonal antibodies was used? What is the evidence for mouse- human cross-reactivity (in case of use of antibody against the one to block the other)? etc.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer suggested, we provide detailed information for the antibodies used in our experiments in key resources table. Moreover, we checked cross-reactivity of antibodies between human and mouse by performing functional tests. To address this issue, we stimulated human and mouse cells with human or mouse soluble FasL in the presence or absence of antibodies against human or mouse Fas or DR5, and measured amounts of CX3CL1 in the culture supernatants and apoptosis (Figure 1—figure supplement 3 A-C). Antibodies against human DR5 inhibited CX3CL1 production in human, but not mouse synovial fibroblasts, whereas antibodies against mouse DR5 suppressed CX3CL1 production in mouse, but not human synovial fibroblasts. In addition, antibodies against human DR5 and Fas, but not those against mouse DR5 and Fas, inhibited cell death in human Jurkat cells, whereas antibodies against mouse DR5 and Fas, but not those against human DR5 and Fas, suppressed cell death in mouse spleen T cells. These findings indicate that antibodies against Fas and DR5 do not have cross reactivity between human and mouse Fas and DR5. These data are presented in Figure 1 —figure supplement 3A-C and described in the section of Results as follows: Anti-DR5 and Fas antibodies do not show cross reactivity between human and mouse DR5 and Fas, respectively (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) The concentrations of all the recombinant proteins and antibodies used should be specified.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer suggested, we have described the concentrations of all recombinant proteins and antibodies used in the methods and figure legends of revised manuscript and key resources table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) The number of experiments performed (biological n) should be specified.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer suggested, we provided the numbers of experiments performed in figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) The mass spectrometry experiment should be described in much greater detail, for example – for how long was sFasL applied, at what temperature, at what concentration, to how many cells?

As we described in the Materials and methods section on page 20 and 21, we implemented the in-situ chemical cross-linking method (Mapping protein receptor-ligand interactions via in vivo chemical crosslinking, affinity purification, and differential mass spectrometry, <italic>Methods,</italic> 2012) for identification of Fas-independent FasL receptor. Following the procedure, 20 μg of biotinylated sFasL-Fc protein was incubated with 1×10<sup>8</sup> cells for 2 hours. After incubation, 1 mL of 3 μg/ml of BS<sup>3</sup> (bis- (sulfo-succinimidyl) suberate) cross-linking reagent was added for 30 min at room temperature. Then, we quenched the cross-linking reaction by adding Tris-bis HCl (2 M, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 15 mM and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and biotinylated-sFasL-Fc chemical cross-linked protein complexes were purified by avidin affinity chromatography. As a negative control, we used Fc protein to remove non-specific binding to Fc region which included in our protein of interest, sFasL-Fc protein. In this experiment, all other steps were treated identically to sFasL-Fc protein and Fc protein incubated samples. The purified proteins were separated by 4-12% SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and digested in-gel with trypsin for mass spectrometry analysis. Protein database search of the biologically duplicate experiments resulted in a total of 144 proteins appeared statistically significant (95% peptide thresholds, 99% protein thresholds) in the sFasL-Fc incubated sample compared with the Fc protein incubated sample. Among them, 29 of unique extracellular space or plasma membrane proteins were selected. Although other candidate proteins could potentially be binding partners of sFasL, a TNF-receptor superfamily protein, we selected TNFRSF10B (DR5) as the top candidate of sFasL binding partners. As shown in Figure 1E, peptide sequence information (LLVPANEGDPTETLR and DASVHTLLDALETLGER) of TNFRSF10B (DR5) were accurately assigned. As pointed out, we added a detailed experimental condition in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. All commercially purchased reagents that have been used in key experiments, e.g. sFasL, FasL-Fc, TRAIL, anti-Fas, and anti-DR5 antibodies must be characterized and validated in order to confirm that their identity and activity are indeed what they are advertised to be.</p></disp-quote><p>To validate these reagents, Jurkat T cells were treated with sFasL, FasL-Fc or TRAIL in the presence or absence of anti-Fas or anti-DR5 antibodies and cell death was estimated. sFasL and TRAIL increased cell death of Jurkat T cells, which was inhibited by adding anti-Fas or anti-DR5 antibodies (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and C). Moreover, FasL-Fc increased production of CX3CL1 by human synovial fibroblasts as much as sFasL (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and 1C). These findings indicate that these reagents are validated in terms of functional aspects. These results are presented in Figure 1 —figure supplement 3, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The specific binding of sFasL to DR5 should be reconfirmed by demonstrating co-immunoprecipitation of the two in endogenous setting, that is to say – using cells that express DR5 at its endogenous levels and using sFaL at concentrations of the recombinant protein that mimic endogenous levels. Assessment of the bioactivity of the ligands should also be done at concentrations of the recombinant protein that are at the range of the endogenous levels.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, hFLSCs were pre-treated with recombinant FasL or TRAIL (200 ng/mL, purchased from R&amp;D, 6×His-tagged at N terminus) for 30 min, and incubated with bis (sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS<sup>3</sup>) for cross linking. After then, samples were prepared for immunoprecipitation using ProteoPrep membrane extraction kit (Σ) and immunoprecipitated with anti-DR5 antibody or control IgG, and blotted with anti-FasL, and TRAIL antibody (Figure 1J). On the other hand, to precipitate 6×His-tagged FasL and TRAIL, the samples were also immunoprecipitated with anti-His antibody or control IgG, and blotted with anti-Fas or anti-DR5 antibody Figure 1 —figure supplement 4H. These experiments demonstrated that DR5 bound to both FasL and TRAIL in hFLSCs, which are presented in Figure 1J and Figure 1 —figure supplement 4H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Knockdown does not fully abolish the expression of a protein, nor can the use of antibodies always allow to fully block its activity. To alleviate the concern that such incomplete effects have led to mistaken conclusions the authors are requested to apply CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout the DR5 and Fas genes instead (which is rather easy to do nowadays). They should then further reconfirm the findings by re-expressing the cDNA for the knocked-out genes. Does the knockout of DR5 eliminate a residual response of Fas deficient cells to FasL? Does re-expression of DR5 in such cells rescue such deficiency?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, DR5 (TNFRSF10B) and/or Fas (FAS) genes were knockout in human synovial fibroblasts using CRISPR/Cas9 system (Figure 1 —figure supplement 4C). Upon knockout of DR5 or Fas gene in human synovial fibroblasts, sFasL-mediated cell death (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2B) and FasL-Fc binding to cell surface (Figure 1I) were decreased compared with control synovial fibroblasts. When we performed knockout of both Fas and DR5 genes (double knockout; DKO) in human synovial fibroblasts, sFasL-mediated cell death and FasL-Fc binding to cell surface were reduced more in DKO fibroblasts than in fibroblasts knockout either DR5 or Fas gene (Figure 1I). Furthermore, re-expressing DR5 or Fas in DKO synovial fibroblasts restored sFasL-mediated cell death and FasL-Fc binding to cell surface (Figure 1I). However, sFasL-mediated CX3CL1 production was similarly reduced in DR5 gene KO and DKO human synovial fibroblasts, where it is not altered in Fas gene knockout-cells (Figure 3F). Moreover, re-expression of DR5 in DKO cells restored FasL-mediated CX3CL1 production as much as control cells, whereas that of Fas did not alter CX3CL1 production in DKO cells (figure 3F). Based on these findings, it is confirmed that sFasL binds to DR5 and this interaction increases CX3CL1 production by synovial fibroblasts. Moreover, the concern that incomplete effects of blocking antibodies and knockdown system have led to mistaken conclusions has been alleviated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Upon treatment of hFLSCs with sFasL, apoptosis and necroptosis were increased, which was inhibited by addition of NSCl and GSK’872, respectively (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and 2C). In particular, sFasL-induced apoptosis and necroptosis were decreased in Fas or DR5 gene knockout hFLSCs, which was more decreased in DKO (Fas and DR5 gene-knockout) hFLSC (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and D). These findings indicate that sFasL-DR5 interaction induces both apoptosis and necroptosis in synovial fibroblasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) Requests concerning just your way of writing, which must also be met.</p><p>1. The authors begin the abstract by noting that &quot;Fas-independent membrane bound receptor for FasL has not yet been reported&quot;. In the introduction, they argue that &quot;in many studies demonstrating the biological effects of FasL in vitro and in vivo, some of the results have not been confirmed to be Fas-dependent. Thus, it is reasonable to consider the possibility that sFasL may bind Fas-independent receptor in addition to Fas in vivo&quot;. The premise that an alternate receptor for sFasL exists is arbitrary: just because this hasn't been ruled out doesn't qualify it as a valid possibility. There has to be some positive evidence in favor of this specific notion in order to qualify it as a starting point or hypothesis for further studies. Please change this statement accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer pointed out, we modified and deleted unclear sentences in the abstract and introduction as follows:</p><p>Abstract: The interaction of Fas-independent membrane bound receptor and FasL remains elusive.</p><p>Introduction: However, whether sFasL-mediated inflammation is regulated in a Fas-independent manner in vivo remains elusive and how it regulates inflammation in various microenvironments is unclear.

An interesting consideration is whether the reported increase in metastases in TRAIL-R k.o mice by the Walczak group could be due to FasL unbound to TRAIL-R driving metastasis through increased binding to Fas. In addition, other reports suggested that TRAIL-R deficiency sensitized mice to inflammation, DSS induced colitis or DEN induced liver cancer (PMIDs: 24117005; 18079962). Again, that seems to be at odds with the activity of DR5 described here to promote inflammation. Please discuss the implications.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to appreciate invaluable comment. It is reasonable to consider that sFasL-DR5 interaction might affect various biological events in vivo, including tumor surveillance and inflammation in various organs. Our experiments demonstrated that sFasL-DR5 interaction occurred in the inflamed joint tissue-in particular-synovial fibroblasts, suggesting that this interaction might depend on DR5 and sFasL expression patterns, cell types, and microenvironment status in target tissues. Moreover, the expression of DR5 and FasL has been reported in various cell types, thereby establishing complicated interaction network during various biological events. Thus, it is reasonable that sFasL-DR5 interaction regulates tumor surveillance and inflammation via various ways, which should be investigated further. We discuss this issue in the section of Discussion (page 12 and 13) as follows: In several studies, DR5 KO mice showed enhancement of tumor metastasis and inflammation (Zhu et al., 2014; Finnberg, Klein-Szanto, and El-Deiry, 2008), which appears to be contradictory to inflammatory inducer of sFasL-DR5 interaction. However, the expression of DR5 and FasL has been reported in various cell types (O'Brien et al., 2005; O'Connell, 2000; Yuan et al., 2018), hereby inducing complicated interaction network during biological events, suggesting that sFasL-DR5 interaction regulates tumor surveillance and inflammation via complicated ways, resulting in various biological effects.

We tried to figure out which pathway is activated by sFasL-DR5 interactions and exacerbates joint inflammation. To address this issue, specific triggering of cell death by DR5 in response to sFasL was validated using inhibitors that specifically affect apoptosis or necroptosis. Thus, we used specific inhibitors of apoptosis (NSCI for caspase 3) and necroptosis (GSK’872 for RIPK3). Upon treatment of hFLSCs with FasL, apoptosis and necroptosis were increased, which was inhibited by adding NSCI and GSK’872, respectively. In particular, FasL-induced apoptosis and necroptosis were reduced in Fas or DR5 gene- knockout hFLSCs. Moreover, both Fas and DR5 gene-knockout (DKO) hFLSCs showed minimal apoptosis and necroptosis upon sFasL treatment. These findings indicate that FasL-DR5 interaction induces both apoptosis and necroptosis. We discuss this issue in the section of results (page 7) as follows:</p><p>Moreover, the sFasL-DR5 and sTRAIL-DR5 interactions similarly induced apoptosis and necroptosis in hFLSCs (von Karstedt, Montinaro, and Walczak, 2017; Wiley et al., 1995), which was inhibited by NSCI (caspase 3 inhibitor) and GSK’872 (RIPK3 inhibitor), respectively (Figure 2F and G, and Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-D). Moreover, FasL-induced apoptosis and necroptosis were partially reduced in Fas or DR5 gene-knockout hFLSCs and almost abolished in both Fas and DR5 gene-knockout (DKO) hFLSCs.

You might choose either to address these requests or just to delete the data that they concern.</p><p>1. FasL-Fc is an unnatural construct that (presumably) displays two FasL homotrimers. Rather than using it interchangeably without explanation, the authors should better use just sFasL throughout the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to appreciate reviewer’s reasonable comment. First, to address this issue, we biotinylated recombinant sFasL (bio-sFasL) and used this bio-sFasL for flow cytometry experiments. WT and Fas and/or DR5 KO hFLSCs were incubated with bio-sFasL, washed, and treated with streptavidin (sAv)-PE. Flow cytometry demonstrated that WT hFLSCs were stained with sAv-PE, which was decreased in Fas or DR5 KO cells. Moreover, sAv-PE staining was minimally detected in Fas and DR5 DKO cells compared with WT and single gene KO cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 4D). These results were similar to those obtained from experiments using FasL-Fc, suggesting that FasL-Fc is reasonable reagent to estimate binding between FasL and its receptors such as DR5 and Fas.</p><p>Second, we validated FasL-Fc in terms of functional aspect by measuring sFasL-mediated cell death and CX3CL1 production of hFLSCs (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and 1C). FasL-Fc induced cell death and CX3CL1 production of hFLSCs, which were similar to those induced by sFasL (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3D and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1B and C).</p><p>Taken together, these findings indicate that biological activities of FasL-Fc are similar to those of sFasL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors contrast binding of FasL-Fc to human DR5 with human DR4. What about other TRAIL receptors, and other TNFRSF members? A more complete analysis is called for.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we knock-downed other TRAIL receptors and TNFRSF members in hFLSCs (Figure 1—figure supplement 4B). However, no membrane receptors were bound to FITC-conjugated FasL-Fc except for Fas and DR5 and produced FasL-mediated CX3CL1 except DR5 (Figure 1 —figure supplement 4A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1I). These findings indicate that FasL binds to Fas and DR5, but not other TNFRSF members.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. If FasL binds to DR5, then what specific binding site does it occupy? Are there any specific mutations that can disrupt this binding? Is the FasL binding site for DR5 related to TRAIL's? Is there homology between the DR5 and Fas binding sites for FasL?</p></disp-quote><p>We presented the results to address these questions in previous version of manuscript (page 7) as follows: Pre-incubation of rhFasL, but not rhTRAIL, reduced rhFasL-Fc protein binding to EL4 cells expressing hFas (Figure 2A and Figure 1—figure supplement 2G), whereas pre-incubation with rhTRAIL or rhFasL inhibited rhFasL-Fc protein binding to hFLSCs and hDR5-expressing EL4 cells, indicating that TRAIL and FasL compete for binding to DR5 (Figure 2A and B, and Figure 1—figure supplement 2F and J). Based on crystal structures of the FasL/DcR3 (PDB 4MSV) and TRAIL/DR5 (1D4V) complexes, FasL forms a trimer similar to other TNF ligands, and DcR3 or DR5 binds to the interface formed by two adjacent FasL or TRAIL monomers, resulting in 3:3 stoichiometry (FasL:DcR3 or TRAIL/DR5) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B) (Liu et al., 2016; Mongkolsapaya et al., 1999). Moreover, superimposition of these two complexes demonstrates that most of their interaction determinants are similarly arranged. To test whether the binding mode of FasL and TRAIL to DR5 are similar, we mutated amino acids in cysteine-rich domain (CRD)2 or 3 of DR5, which are critical for the TRAIL-DR5 interaction (Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). In contrast to WT hDR5, rhFasL-Fc protein did not bind to EL4 cells expressing hDR5 mutated in CRD2 or CRD3 (Figure 2D), although the expression levels of WT and mutant hDR5 were similar (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Moreover, rhDR5-Fc protein binding was abolished in EL4 cells expressing FasL mutants, which can inhibit the interaction between FasL and DcR3 (Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). Collectively, these findings indicate that regions of DR5 that bind hFasL may largely overlap with those that bind hTRAIL, and the binding mode of FasL to DcR3 and DR5 is similar, although the precise sites of hFasL and hDR5 interaction remain unclear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. All negative data using inhibitors (e.g. zVAD-fmk) need to be supported by positive control data for the inhibitors, particularly in the in vivo experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we injected mice with zVAD-fmk during AIA and measured cell death of immune cells from joint tissues. Upon injection with zVAD-fmk, the cell death of immune cells was inhibited, indicating that zVAD-fmk acts as caspase inhibitor in vivo. The data are presented in Figure 2 —figure supplement 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors should provide evidence that sFasL leads to the assembly of a FADD-containing complex that is dependent of DR5 and not Fas using both murine and human Fas and DR5 KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>I would like to appreciate reviewer’s reasonable comment on this issue. However, we did not address this issue further because we decided to delete these data in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. sFas and TRAIL are known inducers of cell death, however, in the present manuscript the authors do not take into account this variable and the possible effect that cell death might have in, as an example, selecting for a particular cell population. The in vitro experiments should be validated in the presence of cell death inhibitors. In this regard, the authors mention different modes of cell death without testing for them. If such conclusions are to be drawn than the authors should use specific inhibitors of the difference cell death modalities.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, specific triggering of cell death by DR5 in response to sFasL was validated by the use of inhibitors that specifically affect apoptosis and necroptosis. Thus, we used specific inhibitors of apoptosis (NSCl for caspase 3) and necroptosis (GSK’872 for RIPK3). Upon treatment of hFLSCs with FasL, apoptosis and necroptosis were increased, which was inhibited by adding NSCI and GSK’872, respectively. In particular, FasL-induced apoptosis and necroptosis were reduced in Fas or DR5 gene- knockout hFLSCs (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2B and 2D). Moreover, both Fas and DR5 gene-knockout (DKO) hFLSC showed minimal apoptosis and necroptosis upon FasL treatment (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2B and 2D). These findings indicate that FasL-DR5 interaction induces both apoptosis and necroptosis but minimally effects on AIA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Throughout the manuscript there are several controls missing. While the authors demonstrate the efficiency of deletion of the siRNAs used, it is imperative to assess the abolishment of the signaling that depends on that receptor in the presence of its respective bona fide ligands. This can be achieved by assessing of the formation of the FADD-containing complex by western blot and downstream output of cell death and gene activation.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we knockout DR5 and/or Fas gene in hFLSC using CRISPR/Cas9 rather than assessing of the formation of the FADD-containing complex using western blot. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the expression of Fas and DR5 on hFLSCs after knockout these genes using CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure 1 —figure supplement 4C). Upon knockout of DR5 or Fas gene in human synovial fibroblasts, FasL-mediated cell death and FasL-Fc binding were decreased compared with WT synovial fibroblasts, which were more decreased by both Fas and DR5 gene knockout (double knockout; DKO) cells. FasL-mediated cell death and FasL-Fc binding were restored in DKO synovial fibroblasts by re-expressing DR5 or Fas. Furthermore, sFasL-mediated CX3CL1 production was reduced in DR5, but not in Fas gene knockout human synovial fibroblasts (Figure 3F). DKO cells also showed a reduction of FasL-mediated cell death and FasL-Fc binding like as DR5 knockout cells. Furthermore, re-expression of DR5 in DKO cells restored FasL-mediated cell death and CX3CL1 production, and FasL-Fc binding, whereas Fas re-expression did FasL-mediated cell death and FasL-Fc binding, but not CX3CL1 production. Thus, both knock-down and knockout system demonstrated similar results in terms of FasL-DR5 interaction and its biological effect on CX3CL1 production by synovial fibroblasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The western blot presented in figure 3j raises doubt regarding the efficiency of Fas blocking in their experiments. As demonstrated in lanes 7-9 versus lanes 1-3, their blocking antibody for Fas has very little capacity to block sFasL-mediated p-IkBα. The authors should explain this observation and (as specified above) repeat the experiment using KO cells for DR5 and/or Fas.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to appreciate reviewer’s reasonable comment.

Regarding the mechanisms of AIA and its dependency on DR5-sFasL engagement the authors should show the levels of CX3CL1 in mFasL KO mice and in sFasKO mice treated with recombinant sFasL.

However, TRAIL-Fc protein is not commercially available and it is not easy to generate TRAIL-Fc protein by ourselves due to time and technical limitation. Alternatively, we have addressed this point using biotinylated TRAIL, FasL, and TNF-α by biotinylating recombinant proteins. Our experiments demonstrated that biotinylated human FasL (bio-hFasL) and bio-TRAIL bound to hDR5-transfected EL4 cells. Moreover, bio-hFasL binding was blocked by pre-incubation of cells with recombinant human TRAIL or anti-human FasL antibody. However, an irrelevant protein such as biotinylated human TNF-α did not bind to human DR5-transfected EL4 cells. Furthermore, biotinylated human FasL (bio-hFasL) bound to human Fas-transfected EL4 cells, which was also inhibited by pre-incubation of bio-hFasL with recombinant hDR5.
