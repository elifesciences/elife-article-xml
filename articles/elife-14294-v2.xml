RecJ, a member of DHH family proteins, is the only 5´ nuclease involved in the RecF recombination pathway. Here, we report the crystal structures of <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> RecJ in complex with deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), ssDNA, the C-terminal region of single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB-Ct) and a mechanistic insight into the RecF pathway. A terminal 5´-phosphate-binding pocket above the active site determines the 5´-3´ polarity of the deoxy-exonuclease of RecJ; a helical gateway at the entrance to the active site admits ssDNA only; and the continuous stacking interactions between protein and nine nucleotides ensure the processive end resection. The active site of RecJ in the N-terminal domain contains two divalent cations that coordinate the nucleophilic water. The ssDNA makes a 180° turn at the scissile phosphate. The C-terminal domain of RecJ binds the SSB-Ct, which explains how RecJ and SSB work together to efficiently process broken DNA ends for homologous recombination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14294.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14294.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14294.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA encodes information that cells need to create the molecules and proteins that are essential for life. It is therefore vital that damaged DNA is repaired rapidly and accurately. Some DNA-damaging agents, such as gamma radiation, break both strands of the DNA double helix, which can be fatal to cells if not repaired quickly and accurately.</p><p>One important pathway in charge of repairing such double-strand breaks is called the homologous recombination repair pathway. The first stage of this repair involves cutting away part of one of the DNA strands at the break. This exposes a single-stranded stretch of the partner strand, which can be used for the repair.</p><p>One organism that is highly resistant to having its DNA damaged by radiation is the bacterium <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic>. In this bacterium, an enzyme called RecJ performs part of the first step in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by progressively shortening one end of a DNA strand. Cheng et al. have now used crystallography to look at the structure that RecJ forms when it binds to DNA. This, together with the results from biochemical experiments, revealed how RecJ recognizes where to bind on a broken DNA strand and how it moves along the broken strand along with cutting that strand.</p><p>Further investigations revealed that two other proteins enhance the ability of RecJ to process the ends of broken DNA strands. Cheng et al. also examined the structure that RecJ forms with one of these additional proteins, called SSB. A future goal is to determine how all three proteins co-ordinate with each other to efficiently and accurately repair double stranded breaks in the <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> bacteria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14294.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14294.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>RecF pathway</kwd><kwd>DNA end resection</kwd><kwd>two-metal-ion catalysis</kwd><kwd>RecJ</kwd><kwd>single-strand-DNA binding protein</kwd><kwd><italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015CB910600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Hong</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Ye</given-names></name><name><surname>Hua</surname><given-names>Yuejin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31570058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liangyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31500656</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Ye</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004731</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LR16C050002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Ye</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31210103904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hua</surname><given-names>Yuejin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31370102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hua</surname><given-names>Yuejin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A structural investigation reveals details of the mechanism by which the nuclease RecJ processes DNA ends to repair double strand breaks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most lethal form of DNA damage due to the free DNA ends. DSBs can be repaired by homologous recombination (HR), which requires a pre-aligned homologous sequence prior to ligation. DNA end resection degrades the 5´ strand of a DSB end and is one of the earliest and most important processes in HR repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Symington and Gautier, 2011</xref>). In bacteria DSBs are predominantly repaired by either the RecBCD or the RecF pathways. Compared with the RecBCD pathway, the RecF pathway is highly conserved across eubacteria and shows functional homology in the eukaryotic HR process. For example, RecA resembles yeast Rad51 protein with regard to the catalysis of DNA strand invasion and change reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox and Lehman, 1982</xref>). RecO is capable of annealing single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein-coated ssDNA and facilitates RecA loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kantake et al., 2002</xref>), a property that is shared with the yeast Rad52 protein. The RecBC complex contains both helicase and nuclease activities. In contrast, the RecF pathway requires RecJ, a 5´-3´ exonuclease, together with RecQ helicase and SSB protein to initiate DSB end resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Courcelle and Hanawalt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Handa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morimatsu and Kowalczykowski, 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> is extremely resistant to DNA-damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation, ultraviolet radiation and mitomycin C (MMC). This robustness correlates with its extraordinary DNA repair capabilities, especially DSB repair, which can rebuild a shattered genome within several hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krisko and Radman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Slade et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, RecBC is naturally absent from <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>, whereas the key components of the RecF pathway are present. Disruption of <italic>recF, recO</italic>, or <italic>recR</italic> significantly sensitized the cells to radiation similar as <italic>recA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentchikou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ithurbide et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Satoh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), which suggests that the RecF pathway is the dominant HR pathway in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>. An extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing process prior to DNA recombination contributes substantially to the rapid restoration of an intact genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentchikou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Slade et al., 2009</xref>). It was proposed that RecJ nuclease, which is associated with helicase, rapidly digests the DSB end in a 5´-3´ polarity after DNA damage. The resultant 3′-ssDNA overhang subsequently anneals to the complementary DNA strand via RecA- and RadA-mediated strand invasion, followed by extensive DNA synthesis.</p><p>RecJ orthologs have been found widespread in most eubacteria and archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravind and Koonin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanchez-Pulido and Ponting, 2011</xref>). RecJ was firstly identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> by its effect on recombination that cells lacking both RecBCD and RecJ showed extreme recombination deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lovett and Clark, 1984</xref>). In addition to HR, RecJ is involved in ssDNA gap repair, base excision repair and methyl-directed mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burdett et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dianov et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lovett and Kolodner, 1989</xref>). As a processive nuclease, RecJ only degrades ssDNA in a 5´-3´ direction but not capable of DNA end digestion with a blunt end or 3´-ssDNA overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiao et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, RecJ also showed 'dRPase' activity to incise abasic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dianov et al., 1994</xref>). SSB can interact with RecJ and stimulate its DNA binding and nuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morimatsu and Kowalczykowski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sharma and Rao, 2009</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that the initiation of DSB end resection by coordinated activities of RecJ and RecQ depends on the nature of the DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morimatsu and Kowalczykowski, 2014</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, RecJ nuclease alone is capable of digesting DNA with 5´-ssDNA overhang, whereas RecQ, a 3´-5´ helicase, is required to initiate DNA end resection with a blunt end or 3´-ssDNA overhangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morimatsu and Kowalczykowski, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structures of RecJ orthologue from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (ttRecJ) have been solved in the absence of substrate DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wakamatsu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamagata et al., 2002</xref>). The structure of ttRecJ reveals an O-shaped molecule, which comprises a novel oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold domain. The hole close to the active site is too narrow to accommodate double-strand DNA (dsDNA), suggesting the ssDNA preference of ttRecJ. The nuclease core of ttRecJ consists of a central parallel β-sheet encircled by α-helices. Two catalytic metal ions coordinated by conserved histidine and aspartate residues were observed in the active site. However, in the absence of DNA substrate, the conserved loop region of the nuclease core was disordered.</p><p>Here, we report three crystal structures of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> RecJ (drRecJ) in complex with deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), ssDNA, and the C-terminal region of drSSB protein (SSB-Ct).

These subfamilies share a conserved N-terminal DHH domain that consists of consecutive DHH residues, which give rise to the name this family of proteins. The subfamily 1 group includes RecJ and nanoRNase (RecJ-like protein), a nuclease that degrades short RNA, and has a distinct DHHA1 domain following the DHH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Srivastav et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wakamatsu et al., 2010</xref>).

The subfamily 3 group is defined by the RecJ eukaryotic orthologue CDC45, which has large insertions between the DHH domain and the C-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krastanova et al., 2012</xref>).

The sequence alignment revealed that drRecJ contains all the seven signature motifs of the RecJ family nucleases, which belongs to the DHH (motifs I-V) domain and the DHHA1 domain (motifs VI and VII) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compared with ecRecJ, drRecJ has an additional C-terminal domain that is conserved in the <italic>Deinococcus-Thermus</italic> phylum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine the metal preference, various concentrations of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>were applied to reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast to the degradation of DNA by ecRecJ in a reaction that requires Mg<sup>2+</sup>, both Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> can activate the nuclease activity of drRecJ. However, the drRecJ activity in a reaction buffer containing 10 µM Mn<sup>2+</sup> is substantially higher than that contains 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overwhelming Mg<sup>2+</sup> (10 mM) does not affect the nuclease activity when drRecJ is pre-incubated with Mn<sup>2+</sup> (0.1 mM), which suggests that Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions are employed for drRecJ catalysis. To test the substrate specificity, drRecJ was incubated with different types of synthetic DNA fluorescence-labeled at the 3′ end in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). drRecJ is able to processively digest ssDNA and DNA with a 5´-ssDNA overhang (14 nt overhang) to a single nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, drRecJ cannot resect ssRNA or DNA with a blunt end or 3´-ssDNA overhang (6 nt overhang), which indicates that a free 5´-ssDNA is essential for drRecJ nuclease activity.</p><p>To characterize the RecJ recognition and incision of the DNA substrate, we crystallized three types of drRecJ complexes: wild-type drRecJ complexed with dTMP (complex I), a catalytic inactive mutant (H160A) RecJ complexed with DNA bearing a 5´-ssDNA overhang (complex II), and the ternary complex of RecJ-ssDNA and the SSB-Ct (complex III).

nuclease</title><p>drRecJ contains four domains: an N-terminal DHH domain (residues 49–295), a DHHA1 domain (residues 328–424), an OB fold domain (residues 1–48 and residues 425–532), and an extended C-terminal domain (residues 533–705; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The DHH domain and DHHA1 domain are interconnected by a long linker α-helix (α15; residues 296–327) to form the nuclease core, as previously observed for the structure of ttRecJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamagata et al., 2002</xref>). The overall structure and conformation of the drRecJ complexes can be virtually superimposed on the ttRecJ (PDB code: 2ZXP) with the rmsd value of 1.937–2.307 Å over 476 Cα atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although the DHHA1 domain and OB fold domain can be adequately superimposed, the DHH domain and linker α-helix further shift towards the DHHA1 domain, resulting in a much narrower cleft that accommodates the substrate DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The C-terminal domain shows large movement relative to the nuclease core, which is most likely due to the crystal lattice contacts. Three loops, which are located at the OB fold domain, also show noticeable deviations due to interactions with the substrate DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Above the active site, the β3-α6 loop, which is disordered in the ttRecJ structures, caps the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The C-terminal-most α-helix (α-CT) also becomes ordered in all the drRecJ structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Recognition of the ssDNA (complex II and III) by the drRecJ is mediated by nuclease core and OB fold domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The DHHA1 domain and the DHH domain bind the 5´-upstream region of the ssDNA. The two-metal ion active site in the DHH domain stabilizes the scissile phosphate. Three helices α13, α15 and α16 form a helical gateway, which only permits ssDNA passage. The OB fold domain, located directly at the side of the DNA entrance, interacts with the downstream region of the ssDNA. The C-terminal domain, in contrast, is involved in SSB-Ct binding. These DNA binding properties were confirmed by mutagenesis coupled with nuclease assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Compared with wild-type protein, the nuclease core of drRecJ exhibits a much decreased nuclease activity and processivity on ssDNA, which indicates that the OB fold domain is critical for substrate DNA binding. However, drRecJ lacking the C-terminal domain (ΔCTD) also exhibits reduced nuclease activity, which suggests that the C-terminal domain is possibly involved in OB fold domain orientation.</p><p>As the representative member of the DHH family proteins, the DHH domain of drRecJ consists of α/β repeats, in which five central parallel β-strands (β2 to β6 in drRecJ) are surrounded by α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The order of the parallel β-strands is 21345, which is shared by all the DHH family proteins (e.g., NrnA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Uemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ugochukwu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamagata et al., 2002</xref>). The signature DHH residues (motif III) are located at the end of the fourth strand. The residues at the end of the first and third β-strands and the DHH motif coordinate two catalytic metal ions to form the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The arrangement of the catalytic residues appears to be employed by many other nucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). For example, despite the different topology of the β-strands (32145), the catalytic residues of human flap endonuclease 1 (hFen1) are also located between the end of three central parallel β-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>). As noted above, subfamily 1 and subfamily 2 DHH family proteins have distinct domains next to the DHH domain, which are denoted DHHA1 and DHHA2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both the DHHA1 domain and the DHHA2 domain are structurally similar with a mixed five-stranded central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The topologies of the β-strands, however, are different from DHHA1 (12354, ↑↑↓↑↓) and DHHA2 (12345, ↑↓↓↑↓). In addition, the β1-β2 and β3-β4 strands in the DHHA1 domain have two inserted α-helices (A and B in RecJ and NrnA, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>); in the DHHA2 domain, the α-helices are located between the β2-β3 and β4-β5 strands (bottom two panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In drRecJ, the first (A) α-helix (α16) of DHHA1 is critical to the composition of the helical gateway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which may explain the varying substrate specificity between these two subfamilies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Helical gateway and stacking interactions between DNA and RecJ nuclease</title><p>drRecJ primarily contacts DNA with helix and loop elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In both complex II and complex III structures, a positively charged groove between the DHH domain and the DHHA1 domain was observed to bind 5 nt 5´-upstream ssDNA in the same manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Multiple loops located at the interface between the DHH domain and the DHHA1 domain bind the first two nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, the helical gateway, which is composed of three α-helices, primarily binds the +3 to +5 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Ala substitutions of key residues in the helical gateway (Arg280 in α13; Arg313/Arg314 in α15, and Lys353 in α16) reduce the DNA-binding and nuclease activity with multi-stops at 5–7 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which suggests that the helical gateway is essential for DNA binding and translocation. The interactions between the nuclease core and DNA phosphate groups are primarily formed by a number of Arg, His, and Asn residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>). Notably, four side chain residues form stacking interactions to the 5´-upstream DNA bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Tyr114 and Tyr80 (motif I) interact with the +1 base at the active site. The substitution of deoxyribose sugar with ribose sugar clashes with the Tyr114 residue, which is consistent with the notion that drRecJ nuclease only acts on DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Val224 (motif IV) and Phe269 (motif V) insert between the +2/+3 base and +4/+5 base. Ala substitutions of these two residues also impair the DNA-binding, nuclease activity and processivity of drRecJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14294.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The DNA binding in the RecJ-DNA complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the numbered DNA substrate used for complex II crystallization.

This domain comprises an N-terminal region and a typical OB fold located next to the DHHA1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Five β-strands (β13 to β17) in the OB fold are orthogonally located to form a mixed β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which has a Greek topology (12354) that is identical to the topology of other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bochkareva et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leiros et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raghunathan et al., 2000</xref>). Compared with the canonical OB fold involved in ssDNA binding, the OB fold of drRecJ exhibits certain discrepancies. The L2 loop (β14-β15 loop) is short and the top of the β-barrel is capped by an additional α helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Conversely, the bottom α helix that connects the L3 loop (β15-β16 loop) is absent in drRecJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, a similar structural features were observed in the previously solved drRecO structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leiros et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting the possible coevolution of the RecF pathway. Surprisingly, no direct interaction between the side chain residues and the DNA phosphate group was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>). Two conserved aromatic residues, Tyr496 and Trp517 from the L3 and the L4 loop (β16-β17 loop), with residues (Met494, Arg475 and Val477) between the end of the first three β-strands form the downstream DNA-binding surface, which interacts with the nucleotide bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Ala substitutions of these residues reduce the nuclease activity of drRecJ on both ssDNA and DNA with 5´-ssDNA overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably, Y496A mutant protein exhibits more severely impaired nuclease activity on DNA bearing 5´-ssDNA overhang compared with ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that the OB fold is critical for the drRecJ resection of DNA with 5´-ssDNA overhang.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14294.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The OB fold domain is critical for drRecJ resection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The OB fold domain is shown in rainbow-colored diagrams.

The DNA scissile phosphate in drRecJ-DNA is centered on two Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions and the A site metal ion seems to be in a position on the nucleophile side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The deoxyribonucleioside in complex I occupies almost the same place as the +1 nucleotide observed in drRecJ-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Despite of the slightly movements, the coordination of the two catalytic metal ions is almost identical, except for an additional coordination between the A site metal ion and a water molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). This water molecule is located directly below the scissile phosphate at a distance of 3.3 Å and is a probable nucleophile candidate for the nucleophilic attack. However, the angle between the water, scissile phosphate and 3´-O leaving group is ~115 degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), which explains the inactivity of the drRecJ-DNA complex. This DNA conformation is possibly attributed to the Ala substitution of His160, which most likely serves as the general base essential for catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Alanine substitutions of the conserved His160 and Asp158, which is hydrogen bonded to His160 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,E</xref>), inactivate drRecJ nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), which suggests that the DHH motif is critical for the catalysis. In addition, His397 from β10 undergoes a substantial rotamer change during DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This residue, which is located opposite to the direction of the nucleophilic attack in drRecJ-DNA complex, is hydrogen bonded to the oxygen atom of the scissile phosphate group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Alanine substitution of His397 drastically reduced the rate of the drRecJ-catalyzed reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that this residue may serve as a general acid to protonate the 3´-O leaving group.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The C-terminal domain of RecJ is critical for protein-protein interaction</title><p>Inspection of the complex III electron density map reveals an additional electron density corresponding to the C-termini of the SSB-Ct peptide associated with the drRecJ C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

In contrast, the first two residues (Glu296 and Asp297) of the SSB-Ct appear to be disordered. Three helices α20, α21 and α23 form the SSB-Ct peptide-binding site, which anchors the last SSB-Ct residue (Phe301) in a deep hydrophobic pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The aromatic Phe side chain is packed against Pro553, Pro628 and the side chains of Met557, Val572, Tyr575 and Tyr600 from drRecJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, Asp298 of SSB-Ct forms an apparent ionic bond with the Lys629 side chain, which composes an electropositive patch near the N-terminus of SSB-Ct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Analyses of the conserved DHH domain and the nonconserved DHHA1 domain in drRecJ structures provide insight into the conserved catalysis mechanism but different substrate specificity of these proteins. As a family of proteins, they share the conserved topology of β-strands in the DHH domain, the signature DHH motif at the end of the fourth strand and the catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The core of the DHH domain, which consists of a central five parallel β-strands sandwiched by surrounding α helices, appears to be shared by many other nucleases. The similar Rossmann-like arrangement of the active site suggests that these nucleases may employ similar two-metal-ion catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>The DHHA1 domain in the subfamily 1 group, however, shows distinct features from the DHHA2 domain in the subfamily 2 group. In addition to the different topology of the β-strands, the subfamily 2 group lacks the helical gateway element (α16 inserted between the first two β-strands in DHHA1) as observed in drRecJ. More importantly, the DHH domain of the subfamily 1 group faces the C-terminal three β-strands of DHHA1 to form the DNA binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), whereas the active site of the subfamily 2 group is formed between the DHH domain and the first β-strand of DHHA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In addition, the C-terminal α-helix of DHHA2 caps the active site, resulting in a much narrower cleft that only accommodates the small-size pyrophosphate or polyphosphate. Thus, the relative positions of the DHH and the DHHA1/DHHA2 domain may determine the substrate specificity between these two subfamily groups.</p><p>CDC45, which is in the subfamily 3 group, is a eukaryotic orthologue of RecJ with no nucleolytic cleavage activity but retaining ssDNA binding capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krastanova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petojevic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Szambowska et al., 2014</xref>).

Based on sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction and our drRecJ structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we provide a possible mechanism of CDC45 binding ssDNA. CDC45 exhibits sequence homology to the drRecJ DHH domain, which possesses five conserved motifs. However, three key residues (Asp79, Asp135 and His159 in drRecJ) that coordinate catalytic metal ions are not conserved in CDC45, which is consistent with the inactivation and the absence of metal ion in purified CDC45 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krastanova et al., 2012</xref>). Second, residues that compose the terminal 5´-phosphate-binding pocket (Arg109, Ser371 and Arg373 in drRecJ) are missing in CDC45, which may explain the opposite 3´-5´ DNA binding polarity of CDC45 compared with RecJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Szambowska et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, DNA binding for RecJ is metal ion independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2006</xref>). The residues involved in protein-DNA stacking interactions (Tyr114, Val224 and Phe269 in drRecJ) and the helical gateway (Arg280, R313, R314 and Lys353 in drRecJ) are conserved in CDC45, which suggests that the DNA binding of CDC45 is possibly similar to that of RecJ.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>RecJ substrate recognition, processivity and catalysis</title><p>The structures presented in this study reveal an elegant mechanism for how RecJ binding to DNA initiates DSB end resection in a 5´-3´ direction. First, the terminal of ssDNA is anchored to the 5´-phosphate binding pocket above the active site, which explains the RecJ hydrolyzing DNA with 5´-3´ polarity. This terminal 5´-phosphate-binding pocket appears to be shared by other 5´-3´ exonucleases such as the λ exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), XrnI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jinek et al., 2011</xref>) and RNaseJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Second, the active site encloses a single deoxyribonucleioside, which renders RecJ an exonuclease discriminating DNA over RNA. Third, the entrance to the RecJ active site is guarded by the helical gateway, which prevents dsDNA from entering the active site. Fourth, a number of residues form stacking interactions with every two DNA bases. Biochemically, the end resection by the RecJ nuclease is processive. Alanine substitution of these residues resulted in multiple intermediate digestion bands, which indicates that the protein-DNA staking interactions are required for the mechanism of processivity of the RecJ nuclease. Fifth, the OB fold domain is located on the side of the DNA entrance, which positions the downstream DNA towards the active site.</p><p>It has recently been shown that RecJ alone is able to process DNA with a 5´-ssDNA overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morimatsu and Kowalczykowski, 2014</xref>). Mechanistically, RecJ is required to locally melt dsDNA and bind to the consequential 5´-ssDNA for the resection. Our analyses suggest that both the nuclease core and the OB fold domain contribute to the RecJ resection of DNA that bears a 5´-ssDNA overhang. In addition to the reduced nuclease activity and processivity, the mutation of the key residues involved in nuclease core-DNA interactions showed strong reaction-stops at the ss-dsDNA junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which suggests that the complete processivity is essential for the RecJ resection of DNA with a 5´-ssDNA overhang. On the other hand, the OB fold domain is located at the ss-dsDNA junction. Ala substitution of Tyr496 impaired the nuclease activity against DNA with 5´-ssDNA overhang and ssDNA, but to a lesser extent, which indicates that the OB fold domain is also critical for this type of end resection. Interestingly, stacking interaction between Tyr496 and a purine base appears to be preferred, which may also be important for the dsDNA melting.</p><p>Our drRecJ:DNA and drRecJ:dTMP structures suggest that RecJ nucleases employ the two-metal-ion catalysis observed for many nucleic acid processing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2015</xref>). In summary, after deprotonation, a water molecule serves as the nucleophile poised on the 5´-side to attack the scissile phosphate. After bond breakage, His397, which is located at the opposite side of the nucleophilic attack, stabilizes the 3´-O leaving group. The resultant mononucleotide and one or both metal ions can be directly exported through the exit tunnel (Arg393). The newly exposed 5´-phosphate, which is generated in each cycle of the exonuclease reaction, further translocates into the terminal 5´-phosphate-binding pocket, making the next nucleotide ready for the cleavage. RecJ is able to digest DNA that contains abasic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dianov et al., 1994</xref>); this binding pocket is located right above the active site, which indicates that the attraction of 5´-phosphate to this binding pocket helps to accurately position the scissile phosphodiester bond of the DNA substrate in the active site.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implication for DSB repair in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic></title><p><italic>D. radiodurans</italic> is capable of surviving high doses of ionizing radiation, which shatters its genome into several hundred fragments. The resulting numerous DSBs can be rapidly repaired by its super-efficient RecA-mediated DNA repair system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentchikou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Slade et al., 2009</xref>). The functional RecF pathway is required for the RecA-mediated DSB repair in vivo, as <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> naturally lacks RecB and RecC enzymes. <italic>E. coli</italic> has a minimum of three 5´-3´ exonucleases (RecJ, RecBCD and ExoVII), whereas RecJ is the only 5´-3´ exonuclease in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>, which plays an essential role in DSB end resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lovett, 2011</xref>). In contrast to the use of Mg<sup>2+</sup> for DNA digestion by ecRecJ, Mn<sup>2+</sup> appears to be preferred for drRecJ catalysis. This metal-ion preference may be attributed to the following two properties: First, the ionic radius of Mn<sup>2+</sup> is similar to that of Mg<sup>2+</sup> but with less-rigid coordination requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding, 2000</xref>), making it suitable for His159 coordination. In fact, only one Mg<sup>2+</sup> was observed in crystal form that contains Mg<sup>2+</sup> instead of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (unpublished data), which is consistent with the extremely low drRecJ nuclease activity in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Second, Daly and co-workers noted that <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> contained about 300 times more intracellular Mn<sup>2+</sup> than that in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which plays a critical role in reactive oxygen species detoxification and protein protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daly et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daly, 2009</xref>). Thus, the Mn<sup>2+</sup> preference of drRecJ may also be an example of the evolution adaptation. Indeed, in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>, many enzymes involved in DNA repair (e.g., PolI, PolX) prefer to use Mn<sup>2+</sup> for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinz and Marx, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lecointe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), which indicates that the accumulation of Mn<sup>2+</sup> may also contribute to the robust DSB repair.</p><p>Importantly for the efficient HR, the DSB with different end structures must be promptly processed. Our structures and biochemical data are consistent with the helicase-nuclease coordination end resection mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and suggest that the extended C-terminal domain of drRecJ, which is absent in <italic>E. coli</italic>, is critical for its efficient end resection in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>. The C-terminal domain can enhance the nuclease activity of drRecJ in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which suggests that drRecJ may exhibit a more effective nuclease activity in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>. In addition to ssDNA, drRecJ alone is able to initiate DNA end resection with 5´-ssDNA overhangs processively. Interestingly, drSSB stimulates drRecJ resection of DNA that bears a 3´-ssDNA overhang to a certain extent in vitro, possibly via the direct interaction between the drRecJ C-terminal domain and SSB-Ct, which suggests that drRecJ together with drSSB might be capable of processing this type of DSB end structure in vivo. On the other hand, SSB in <italic>E. coli</italic> recruits RecO protein to ssDNA through SSB-Ct. drRecO does not interact with SSB-Ct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryzhikov et al., 2011</xref>), which suggests the existence of alternative pathway of HR initiation in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>. drRecQ further stimulates the reaction, which indicates that the 3´-5´ helicase activity is also required for the efficient end resection. However, we found no evidence for the direct interaction between drRecJ and drRecQ, which suggests that other redundant helicases (e.g., UvrD) may also assume the unwinding responsibilities in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentchikou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ithurbide et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, we report the crystal structure of drRecJ in complex with SSB-Ct peptide and a DNA substrate representing a DSB end substrate, with 5´-ssDNA overhang placed within the active site, where DSB end resection occurs. These observations reveal the shared and distinctive features of DHH family proteins and enable us to propose a unified mechanism for substrate recognition and the exonucleolytic cleavage activity for RecJ family nucleases. The novel C-terminal domain involved in protein-protein interaction suggests a more effective DSB end resection in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and strain constructions</title><p>Full-length (residues 1-705aa), nuclease-core (drRecJ<sub>core</sub>, residues 48-431aa), C-terminal domain truncation (drRecJ<sub>ΔC</sub>, residues 1-531aa), and C-terminal α helix truncation (drRecJ<sub>Δα-CT</sub>, residues 1-690aa) of drRecJ were amplified by PCR and cloned to the modified pET28a expression vector, pET28-HMT, which contains a fused N-terminal 6×His-tag, a MBP-tag and a TEV protease recognition sequence (His-MBP-TEV) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austin et al., 2009</xref>).

This experiment would determine whether the SSB-RecJ interaction is required for RecJ to resect SSB-covered ssDNA.</italic></p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have tested the resection of SSB-coated ssDNA by WT/Y575A RecJ and WT/Δ-C SSB (please see gel below, added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> in revised version). For wild-type drRecJ, this nuclease activity is enhanced by SSB<sub>WT</sub> (lanes 4-5) but not by SSB<sub>ΔC</sub> (lanes 6-7). In contrast, neither SSB<sub>WT</sub> (lanes 10-11) nor SSB<sub>ΔC</sub> (lanes 12-13) substantially stimulate the RecJ<sub>575</sub> resection of ssDNA to SSB<sub>WT</sub> level. These results are consistent with the drRecJ resection of DNA with a 3′-ssDNA overhang, which indicates that the SSB-RecJ interaction is also required for RecJ to digest SSB-covered ssDNA. A mention to this was made in the revised version text. “For ssDNA, the stimulation is similar to that of the resection of the DNA with a 3´-ssDNA overhang, suggesting that the SSB-RecJ interaction is required for RecJ to resect SSB-covered ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).” The Methods section has been updated as well.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: This experiment is not very good. Although the authors showed that both SSB and RecQ are required for RecJ to resect 3'-overhang DNA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, this result is not consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, where SSB alone stimulated RecJ-mediated resection of 3'-overhang DNA (lanes 4 and 5). The authors should clarify this apparent discrepancy and/or repeat these experiments.</italic></p><p>The “discrepancy” is caused by different concentrations of SSB protein used in the assays (200 nM for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and 100 nM for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), which have been mentioned in the figure legends. Actually, the stimulation of drRecJ-mediated resection of 3′-overhang DNA depends on the SSB concentrations (please see gel below) that high concentrations of SSB protein could drastically stimulate this type of the resection even in the absence of RecQ protein. We think the possible explanation is that high concentrations of drSSB could remove DNA secondary structures (dsDNA) and facilitate drRecJ resection. So, we decided to use relatively low concentration of SSB to conduct the nuclease assays of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> to check the RecQ-effect on the resection. So, in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, the concentrations of SSB were labeled to clarify the different amount of SSB used in the assays. Thank you for this good comment.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1: I have only a few comments to improve the paper. Introduction: Although the RecFOR pathway can mediate recombination at double-strand breaks (DSBs), in E. coli at least it mediates recombination at ssDNA gaps in DNA. The interest is on DSB repair in Deinococcus, because of its radioresistance; however gap recombination should be mentioned briefly.</italic></p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. A mention to this was made in the revised version text and one more reference (Lovett et,al., 1989, PNAS) was cited. “In addition to HR, RecJ is involved in ssDNA gap repair, base excision repair and methyl-directed mismatch repair (Burdett et al., 2001; Dianov et al., 1994; Lovett and Kolodner, 1989).”</p><p> <italic>Introduction, first paragraph: the Han</italic> et al. <italic>2006 paper was the first to show SSB stimulation of DNA binding and hydrolysis for the E. coli protein.</italic></p><p>Sorry for missing such an important reference and it has been cited in the revised manuscript</p><p> <italic>Introduction, fourth paragraph: The Yamagata 2002 structure only showed one metal ion, Mn<sup>2+</sup> (I re-checked this to be sure.) This should be corrected. Sutera</italic> et al. <italic>1999 (J.

However, the second paper published in JBC (Wakamatsu, 2010) observed both two metal ions in the structure.</p><p>The reference about the mutagenesis of conserved motifs by Sutera (J. Bacteriol 181: 6098) was cited in the revised manuscript (subsection “Nucleotide binding site and the catalytic mechanism”). Indeed, these residues are involved in metal ion binding (D79, D81, D83, H159, D223), catalysis (D158, H160, H397) and 5′-phosphate binding (R373). We agree with your point that these mutations mainly impair the RecJ cleavage and the protein can still bind DNA. A mention to this was made in the revised version text (same section). “[…] which is consistent with the results of equivalent mutations in ecRecJ (Sutera et al., 1999).”</p><p> <italic>Subsection “Nucleotide binding site and the catalytic mechanism”: Try80, Try114 should be Tyr80, Try114. These residues are not conserved: Tyr80 is Phe in E. coli and other proteobacteria and the 114 equivalent can be His in some other bacteria. How would this affect the nucleotide binding site?</italic></p><p>We are sorry for the typo and have corrected all the errors in the revised manuscript. For Tyr80 and Tyr114, it is true that these two residues, as you mentioned, are not strictly conserved in all the bacteria. However, the side chains of these residues (Tyr, Phe, His) all contain aromatic rings, which form π stacking interactions (base stacking interactions) with substrate DNA. Thus, these residues have similar side-chain structure and conserved functions, which are critical for the nucleotide binding. In the revised main text, we have deleted the word “conserved”</p><p><italic>Discussion, third paragraph: DNA binding for E. coli RecJ is Mg<sup>2+</sup> independent (again, Han</italic> et al. <italic>2006), so this helps explain how Cdc45 can employ similar DNA binding without the catalytic site.</italic></p><p>Yes, A mention to this was made in the revised version text with this reference cited. “Moreover, DNA binding for RecJ is metal ion independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) (Han et al., 2006).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
