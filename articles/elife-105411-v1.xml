Chimpanzees use tools during foraging, and given the cognitive and physical challenges presented by tool use, tool-use behaviors are potentially at a heightened risk of senescence, though this has never been investigated in wild individuals. Accordingly, we sampled data from a longitudinal video archive that contained footage of wild chimpanzees using stone hammers and anvils to crack hard-shelled nuts (<italic>nut cracking</italic>) at an ‘outdoor laboratory’ over a 17-year period (with focal chimpanzees aging from approximately 39–44 to 56–61 years across this period). Over time, elderly chimpanzees began attending experimental nut-cracking sites less frequently than younger individuals. Several elderly chimpanzees exhibited reductions in efficiency across multiple stages of nut cracking, including taking longer to both select stone tools prior to use and use tools to crack open nuts and consume the associated pieces of kernel. Two chimpanzees began using less streamlined behavioral sequences to crack nuts, including a greater number of actions (such as more numerous hammer strikes). Notably, we report interindividual variability in the extent to which elderly chimpanzees’ tool-use behaviors changed during our sample period – ranging from small to profound reductions in engagement and efficiency – as well as differences in the specific aspects of nut cracking that changed for each individual. We discuss the possible causes of these changes – and recommendations for future research – with reference to literature surrounding the senescence of captive and wild primates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>nut cracking</kwd><kwd><italic>Pan troglodytes</italic> verus</kwd><kwd>western

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Senescence can be understood as a reduction in the efficacy of biological systems with increasing age. In recent decades, the senescence of non-human primates (henceforth primates) has been a point of considerable research interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Colman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Edler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gilleard, 2023</xref>). In part, this is due to the fact that primates offer uniquely translatable models for understanding the nature and evolution of human senescence, given their high genetic, physiological, and behavioral similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Colman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bizon and Woods, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Frye et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lane, 2000</xref>). Accordingly, many parallels between the senescent processes of humans and primates have been uncovered, including in their cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Comrie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gray and Barnes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Herndon and Lacreuse, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lacreuse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lacreuse et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lacreuse et al., 2020</xref>) physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Colman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Colman and Binkley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Didier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lowenstine et al., 2016</xref>), and their resultant behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Havercamp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hozer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Neal Webb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tarou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhdanova et al., 2011</xref>). However, thus far, the majority of these studies have focused on captive populations of short-living species and exploited existing variation in age among individuals to infer the effects of senescence through cross-sectional analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Colman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gray and Barnes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rothwell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tardif and Ross, 2021</xref>). Comparatively, few studies have investigated how senescence influences the behaviors of primates in the wild (with the exception of a handful of examples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fujisawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Newman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Siracusa et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Siracusa et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>), and even fewer employ longitudinal data sampling to understand how senescence leads to changes in the behaviors of specific individuals over time. These studies of wild individuals are highly valuable as they shed light on how aging affects the day-to-day behaviors that primates rely on for survival – conclusions which cannot be easily predicted from studies from captivity, given that patterns of physiological senescence can differ significantly between captive and naturalistic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cole et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Campos et al., 2024</xref>). Further research is therefore required to understand how aging influences the lives of wild primates. This is particularly true for long-living great ape species, which are underrepresented in the existing literature, yet their phylogenetic proximity to humans means that they likely offer the most suitable models for understanding the evolution of the human aging process.</p><p>Of the day-to-day behaviors of great apes, the combined physical and cognitive demands of tool use make it likely to exhibit particular changes with progressive old age. The tool-use behaviors of great apes are highly challenging, requiring tool users to draw upon a wide array of high-level cognitive abilities, including planning and the flexible assembly of actions into goal-directed behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Byrne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Call, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Howard-Spink et al., 2024</xref>); an understanding of causal relationships between objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hayashi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Matsuzawa, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sanz and Morgan, 2010</xref>); as well as knowledge of the physical properties of objects and how to exploit these properties to use tools successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boesch and Boesch, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bril et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sirianni et al., 2015</xref>). Many of these cognitive abilities – including the more specific subcomponents of these abilities, such as motor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lacreuse et al., 2014</xref>), working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Glavis-Bloom et al., 2022</xref>), executive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lacreuse et al., 2020</xref>), and cognitive flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lacreuse et al., 2018</xref>) – have been identified as at risk of senescence in captive living primates; however, never in tool-use behaviors themselves. Moreover, physiological changes including reduced bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Colman and Binkley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lowenstine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nichols and Zihlman, 2002</xref>), muscle wasting (sarcopenia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lowenstine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morbeck et al., 2002</xref>), the development of arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lowenstine et al., 2016</xref>), and reduced visual acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fujisawa et al., 2010</xref>) have been identified in a number of primate species, including within the great apes, which all influence individual strength, dexterity, and accuracy of movement. These findings suggest that tool use could be a domain of great-ape behavior that is at specific risk of senescence; however, it has not yet been possible to address this question due to an absence of long-term data on great ape tool-use behaviors that also include instances of tool use performed by elderly individuals.</p><p>To address this gap in the literature, we used a longitudinal archive of video footage of wild, West African chimpanzees (<italic>Pan troglodytes verus</italic>) using stone tools to crack hard-shelled nuts as part of a decades-long field experiment in a clearing in the Bossou forest, Guinea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matsuzawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sugiyama, 1981</xref>) ('the outdoor laboratory'; see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for information about the experimental set up at the outdoor laboratory).

During nut cracking, a nut is placed on a hard substrate for the chimpanzee population used in this study, this substrate is a portable anvil stone, although at other sites this may be a root or rocky outcrop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boesch and Boesch, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sirianni et al., 2015</xref>), before being struck repeatedly with a hammer stone until the nut is cracked open and the edible kernel inside extracted and consumed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Nut cracking is learnt by chimpanzees at Bossou by the age of 7 years (often between 3.5 and 5 years of age; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Inoue-Nakamura and Matsuzawa, 1997</xref>), and chimpanzees continue to perform this behavior throughout adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matsuzawa et al., 2011</xref>). This extended engagement in nut cracking permits characterization of how individual chimpanzees perform this behavior across their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berdugo et al., 2025</xref>), including during the oldest years of their lifespan. Nut cracking features all of the key elements of tool-use behaviors which we predict will make them likely to senesce with old age, including the need to construct complex object associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hayashi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Matsuzawa, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Matsuzawa, 1996</xref>) to organize and address multiple goals using an extended behavioral sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Howard-Spink et al., 2024</xref>) to select tool objects based on perceived properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boesch and Boesch, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sirianni et al., 2015</xref>), and to combine objects with sufficient dexterity, precision and force and to crack nuts without knocking nuts off the anvil, or smashing interior kernels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bril et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The experimental set-up and behaviors at the outdoor laboratory.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Yo, an elderly female (approximately 51 years old), has placed a coula nut (<italic>Coula edulis</italic>) on an anvil stone and is preparing to strike with the hammer stone.

During this timeframe, we collected longitudinal data on five chimpanzees as they aged from approximately 39–44 years old (end of mid-life) to 56–61 years old (ages which are close to the maximum for wild chimpanzee lifespans; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wood et al., 2023</xref>). Across sampled field seasons, we estimated how readily chimpanzees engaged in nut cracking behaviors using two key metrics: the frequency with which chimpanzees visited outdoor laboratory sites during each field season (compared to a control group of younger individuals between the ages of 8 and 30 years of age), and when present, the proportion of time chimpanzees spent engaging with nuts and stone tools compared to other key behaviors (such as drinking water from an available water point using leaf tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sousa et al., 2009</xref>) and eating oil-palm fruits that are provisioned alongside nuts; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). We also measured how quickly chimpanzees selected stone tools from a central matrix of over 50 stones (a generalized metric of efficiency during tool selection; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>), as well as how efficiently chimpanzees cracked open nuts using stone tools and consumed the associated kernel.</p><p>Overall, with increasingly old age (measured by progressive field seasons), elderly chimpanzees were significantly less likely to visit experimental nut-cracking sites. In comparison, younger individuals (i.e. younger adults and older immatures who had learnt how to crack nuts) exhibited no change over successive field seasons, suggesting that this reduced attendance at experimental nut cracking sites was confined to an elderly, aging cohort of chimpanzees. When present at the outdoor laboratory, two of our five elderly individuals spent substantially less time engaging in nut cracking at older ages, as compared to their behaviors in previous field seasons. Moreover, several elderly chimpanzees took more time to select stone tools in later field seasons than in earlier field seasons, and were also less efficient at using stone tools to crack open oil-palm nuts. Importantly, we detected considerable interindividual variability in the effects of aging on how readily elderly chimpanzees engaged with nuts and stone tools, how quickly they selected tools, and the efficiency with which elderly chimpanzees used tools. Some individuals demonstrated little-to-no change in engagement and efficiency with aging, whereas others experienced significant changes across different aspects of their nut-cracking behavior. We discuss our findings in the context of existing literature for primate aging and hypothesize which factors underpin observed changes in behavior, including cognitive, physiological, and motivational causes, and generate a number of suggested avenues for further study. We also discuss how aging can likely compound existing interindividual differences in the proficiency of socially-learnt technical skills in non-human animals, and discuss how tool use could potentially present a suitable indicator for identifying individuals who are experiencing the effects of profound senescence in the wild.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sampled data</title><p>We sampled five timepoints separated by intervals of 3–5 years (field seasons 1999–2000, 2004–2005, 2008–2009, 2011–2012, and 2016–2017; with each field season referred to hereafter by its initial year). The exact age at which chimpanzees may be considered ‘old’ is a point of continued debate. However, chimpanzees are generally considered to begin entering old age at approximately 40 years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morbeck et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Campos et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Finch and Austad, 2015</xref>), after which survivorship begins to decrease more rapidly than earlier in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wood et al., 2023</xref>). We therefore confined our analysis to individuals who were at least 30 years of age in at least three of the five sampled field seasons. This sample allowed us to collect data longitudinally, beginning with ages where chimpanzees are in the prime of adulthood and spanning into old age. Under these criteria, we were able to include four old-age females (Fana, Jire, Velu, and Yo) and one old-age male (Tua) in our analyses. All five of these individuals were present at Bossou when the long-term research project was established in 1976; as a consequence, their birth years are estimates based on physical growth characteristics at the time of first observation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Given that these estimated birth years range from 1956 to 1961, these individuals are estimated to be between 39 and 44 years old at the start of our sampling window (1999), and therefore are entering the window of ‘old age’. By 2016, estimated ages ranged from 56 to 61 years old, reflecting an age which is near the maximum for wild chimpanzees. All four females were present at Bossou throughout the entire sampled time-frame for our analysis; however, Tua, the only adult male, disappeared in September 2013 (presumed dead). Therefore, data for Tua spans a shorter time frame between the 1999 and 2011 field seasons. As all five focal individuals’ ages are within five years of each other (and therefore similar estimates), we use the progression through field seasons as a proxy for increasing age and treat all individuals as similarly ‘old’ at each field season.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of sampled observations for each focal old-age individual.</title><p>Total time observed includes all time individuals were present in the first 10 encounters of each field season (Observed Encounters).

Correspondingly, a model of attendance rate over successive field seasons (including data across all field seasons) identified a significantly greater decline in attendance rate for the older cohort across successive field seasons as compared to the younger cohort (interaction effect of field season and age-cohort: z=–2.285; p=0.022; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref> for full model output). Conversely, we found no evidence of a decline in attendance rate for chimpanzees in our younger cohort over successive field seasons (z=–1.572; p=0.11). We confirmed the importance of this interaction effect by comparing the fit of the full model with a model lacking the interaction effect between age-cohort and field season (therefore assuming an identical relationship across field seasons for both cohorts) and a null model (which assumed no effect of field season). AIC comparison confirmed that the model which included an interaction effect offered the best explanation of the data relative to model complexity (AIC<sub>Interaction</sub> = 340; AIC<sub>Interaction-removed</sub>=343; AIC<sub>Null</sub> = 376). All four elderly female chimpanzees exhibited attendance rates that were lower in 2016 than in 1999; however, for Tua (the elderly adult male), attendance rates in his earliest and latest field seasons were approximately equal (1999=0.48 encounters/day; 2011=0.5 encounters/day; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Behaviors at the outdoor laboratory</title><p>We measured how the proportion of time each elderly individual spent interacting with nuts and stones when present at the outdoor laboratory changed over successive field seasons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). By 2011, the final year of this analysis (we omitted the use of 2016 for this analysis, see Methods), two old-aged individuals (Fana and Velu) spent substantially less time engaging with nuts and stone tools (% time engaging with nuts and stone tools in each season; Fana: 1999=62.3%; 2011=15.6%; Velu: 1999=51.6%; 2011=5.0%). We did not observe either individual successfully cracking any nuts at the outdoor laboratory in 2011. Most interactions with nuts and stone tools involved scavenging kernels from the ground (produced by other individuals’ nut cracking behaviors), or in the case of Velu, a short attempt to crack open a nut, before ceasing the behavior and feeding from oil-palm fruits. Correspondingly, in 2011, Fana spent more time engaging in ‘Other’ behaviors, such as resting and grooming (+38.3% of total time in 2011 compared with 1999), whereas Velu spent more time eating palm fruits (+35.5%) and drinking water from the water point (+25.8%; note that data for Velu come from a single encounter in 2011, so proportions should be interpreted with caution). Conversely, three individuals spent similar proportions of time engaging with nuts and stone tools when present at the outdoor laboratory (change in % time between 1999 and 2011: Jire = –5.5%; Tua = +6.9%; Yo = +8.9%).

Between 1999 and 2016, we recorded the duration of 108 stone-tool selection events across 49 encounters for the five focal old-aged individuals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>). A mixed-effect model with the year of the field season as both a random intercept and random slope for each individual offered the best explanation for the total variation in the time taken to select tools (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> for a visualization of the random slope model). This model outperformed a null model which assumed no effect of field season (AIC<sub>Year-RandomSlope</sub>=231; AIC<sub>Null</sub> = 234) as well as a model which included a fixed slope for field seasons – and therefore the same aging effect – across all individuals (where models were refit by restricted maximum likelihood to improve the accuracy of random-effect estimation; AIC<sub>Year-Random</sub>=244; AIC<sub>Year-Fixed</sub>=246; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table3 app2table4 app2table5">Appendix 2—Tables 3–5</xref> for model summaries). The best explanation for our data is therefore one where aging has a significant effect on tool-selection time; however, the effects of aging differ between individuals. The random-slope model identified that Yo underwent the greatest increase in stone-tool selection time across sampled field seasons, followed by Fana and then Jire. Velu exhibited relative consistency in the duration of stone-tool selection across field seasons, and the only individual to show a negative relationship between the duration of stone-tool selection and increasing years was Tua.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Duration of stone-tool selection events.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Tool-selection duration times for each old-aged individual.

Similarly, Velu exhibited an increase in the median number of actions used to crack and process each nut between 1999 and 2016, though this effect was milder (+7 actions; +70% change between 1999 and 2016).

For Fana and Jire, we detected a smaller change in the median number of actions used to crack open oil-palm nuts by 2016 (Fana = +2.5 actions; Jire = +3 actions); however, given that these changes are small, it is more difficult to rule out the possibility that they are due to chance fluctuations in samples between years. Additionally, for Fana and Jire, the median number of striking actions performed per nut in 1999 and 2016 was very similar (Jire: +2 strikes; Fana +1 strike).

Across a seventeen-year window, during which chimpanzees aged from 39-44 years to 56–61 years old, elderly chimpanzees began visiting experimental nut-cracking sites less frequently. This change in attendance rate was not observed for younger chimpanzees and was therefore confined to individuals who were approaching their maximum age in the wild. In addition, when present at nut cracking sites, two individuals (Fana and Velu) exhibited a lower engagement with nuts and stone tools in 2011 (the latest field season for this analysis) as compared with their behavior in earlier field seasons. With progressive aging, three individuals took longer to select stone tools (Yo, Fana, and Jire), several individuals took longer to crack open oil-palm nuts and consume all of the kernel, and two individuals (Yo and Velu) cracked and processed oil-palm nuts using a greater number of actions, including more frequent strikes of the hammer stone. Across metrics of engagement and efficiency, we detected interindividual differences in the extent to which nut cracking behaviors changed with progressive aging, including some individuals who exhibited little-to-no change in behavior across the time period sampled (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

However, at progressively older ages, elderly chimpanzees began to visit the outdoor laboratory less frequently. This result was not found for younger chimpanzees between the ages of 8 and 30 years old, suggesting that changes in elderly chimpanzees’ attendance rates were not an artefact of environmental changes over field seasons (which would likely affect both age cohorts similarly).</p><p>In addition, by 2011, two elderly chimpanzees (Velu and Fana) engaged with nuts and stone tools less frequently than they had done during visits to the outdoor laboratory throughout earlier years (although note for Velu, data for 2011 were collected from a single encounter). The possible causes for these changes in attendance rate – and engagement with nuts and stone tools when present at the outdoor laboratory – are manifold. Firstly, physiological changes with aging – such as in metabolism and nutrient requirements – could influence individuals’ dietary preferences, reducing the appeal of nuts as an available food source. Secondly, physical senescence may make visiting nut cracking sites more challenging for elderly individuals, such as through reduced capacity for locomotion. Changes in locomotion have been documented in aging captive apes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Neal Webb et al., 2019</xref>). In the context of wild apes, reduced mobility may further restrict the available area that elderly chimpanzees can traverse during daily ranging, encouraging them to visit foraging patches that are more proximal to their immediate locations than the outdoor laboratory. Chimpanzees habitually plan their routes towards tool-use sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almeida-Warren et al., 2022</xref>); however, the extent to which their doing so changes during old age is unclear. Thirdly, it is possible that tool use may become more challenging due to changes in elderly chimpanzees’ cognitive or physical condition (see latter sections of our discussion), which may reduce the appeal of visiting nut-cracking sites. Fourthly, changes in social association may have influenced the likelihood that elderly chimpanzees visited experimental nut-cracking sites. When experiencing increasingly old ages, many primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Neal Webb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Siracusa et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Campos et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almeling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Machanda and Rosati, 2020</xref>) – and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Siracusa et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rudd et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albery et al., 2022</xref>) – display higher social selectivity and spend a greater proportion of their time either in isolation or in smaller group associations. This social aging arguably may not be senescence per se, but can either be the result of senescent processes (perhaps even exacerbating senescence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Siracusa et al., 2022a</xref>), or may act to benefit individuals experiencing senescence, such as reducing the risk of injury from antagonistic interactions with social partners, or by shielding oneself from contagious disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Siracusa et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Siracusa et al., 2024</xref>). In the context of our study, chimpanzees at Bossou typically arrive at the outdoor laboratory when travelling in groups, and therefore party members may be led to nut-cracking sites by associated conspecifics, rather than through independent choice. Previous research has demonstrated that whilst gregariousness appears to be constant across ages in the Bossou chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schofield et al., 2023</xref>), two old-aged individuals became notably peripheral in social networks constructed using data from the 2011 field season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schofield et al., 2019</xref>) (Yo and Velu; the two individuals we identified as having the lowest attendance rates), indicating that they were more often seen arriving at the outdoor laboratory alone or travelling as a pair. In tandem with the profound reduction in population size at Bossou throughout our study period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Matsuzawa et al., 2004</xref>), changes in social structure may have disproportionately affected elderly chimpanzees, leading to a lower likelihood of visiting the outdoor laboratory alongside – or to regroup with – other community members. Further research is required to link our observed changes in nut cracking engagement to their underlying causes.</p><p>Through the collection of longitudinal behavioral data, we were able to evaluate whether at older ages, chimpanzees perform less streamlined tool-use behaviors. At Bossou, chimpanzees exhibit interindividual variation in nut cracking efficiency; however, within-individual efficiency is stable over the majority of each chimpanzee’s lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berdugo et al., 2025</xref>). To assess for aging effects, we therefore compared behavior in middle and later adulthood for each chimpanzee, permitting signals of aging to be identified using individually bespoke baselines of efficiency. Focal chimpanzees exhibited high efficiency in the first field season (1999), suggesting that we began sampling data before the onset of tool-use senescence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biro et al., 2003</xref> for data on striking efficiency of adults at Bossou, where all adults use approximately 2–4 strikes per oil-palm nut – our focal subset of adults fell within this range in 1999). Of the five individuals included in our study, three individuals took longer to select stone tools over progressing field seasons (Yo, Fana, and Jire), two females showed very small increases in the amount of time taken to crack and process nuts (Fana and Jire), whereas two other females exhibited comparatively dramatic increases in the time taken to crack and process each nut (Yo and Velu). Yo and Velu also exhibited more frequent striking using the hammer stone, and Yo performed additional actions to peel shell away from kernels with her mouth and consumed kernels with a greater number of bites (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> for footage of Yo cracking oil-palm nuts in 1999 and 2016). Our results therefore suggest that there is measurable interindividual variation in the effects of extreme aging on the efficiency of both tool selection and use in wild chimpanzees.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-105411-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Oil-palm nut cracking by Yo in 1999 and 2016.</title></caption></media><p>Our findings mirror reports of interindividual variability in the senescence of cognitive and physiological systems in both captive and wild primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tarou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rothwell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morbeck et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Freire-Cobo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hämäläinen et al., 2015</xref>). Whilst it is outside the scope of our study to determine the precise cognitive, physical, and resultant motivational changes that led to reductions in engagement with tools, rates of tool selection, and the efficiency of tool use, our results can generate predictions about how changes in fine-scale processes may translate into the behavioral changes we have observed with progressive aging. For the chimpanzees that experienced reductions in nut cracking efficiency (as discussed above), these changes could be due to changes in physical strength and dexterity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lowenstine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morbeck et al., 2002</xref>), visual acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fujisawa et al., 2010</xref>), dentition (where tooth decay may render peeling and chewing actions more difficult; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lowenstine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 2024</xref>), or possibly due to changes in cognition relevant to effective tool use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lacreuse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lacreuse et al., 2020</xref>), such as executive functioning or working memory. Changes in tool use behavior may also have emerged to actively compensate for the effects of senescence that are not in themselves specific to tool use; for example, tooth wear and subsequent periodontal disease are common in old-aged chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lowenstine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 2024</xref>). The additional strikes of the hammer stone performed by Yo and Velu to crack oil-palm nuts may have therefore been motivated by the desire to break the kernel into a greater number of smaller pieces, which were easier to peel and consume. This conclusion is somewhat supported by post-mortem data for Velu following her death in 2017, as she exhibited heavy wear patterns on both incisors and premolars and was missing several molars on the lower jaw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Matsuzawa, 2018</xref>). Similarly to tool-using efficiency, the duration of tool selection may have taken longer for several individuals due to difficulties identifying the properties of available stones, perhaps due to changes in perceptual systems (such as poorer vision; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fujisawa et al., 2010</xref>), or cognitive challenges in predicting the properties of objects. Alternatively, longer tool-selection times could have also been due to the need for chimpanzees to weigh up the benefits of specific tool properties (e.g. weight and size), relative to age-related changes in their physical strength and mobility. Bridging the gap between age-related changes in tool-use behavior and changes in cognitive and physiological processes requires further study and would likely benefit from experimental approaches where possible.</p><p>Our study used longitudinal video data collected from a unique, decades-long systematic study of wild chimpanzee tool use, and this video archive likely represents the only currently available data source to study intraindividual variation in chimpanzee nut cracking across the span of decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berdugo et al., 2025</xref>). Moreover, given the exceptionally long lives of several chimpanzees at Bossou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Emery Thompson et al., 2007</xref>), Bossou represents a unique population whose individuals can be readily studied to examine the effects of senescence in the wild at the level of the individual. However, the use of existing video data and time-intensive methods for fine-scaled behavior coding means that our study faced a number of limitations.</p><p>Firstly, we were unable to analyze whether specific ecological variables – such as the availability of different food sources and demographic changes at Bossou – influence aging individuals’ attendance at the outdoor laboratory, as well as at naturally occurring nut cracking sites (see discussion above). Nevertheless, by using the attendance of younger individuals as a control, we were able to identify that the reduction in attendance over field seasons was limited to older individuals, suggesting a specific change in behavior associated with chimpanzees experiencing progressively old age. Further research is needed to understand what factors lead to this reduced engagement with nut cracking at older ages; how aging individuals compensate for calorie loss from reduced nut cracking, and more generally, how aging influences chimpanzees’ foraging behaviors across their entire home range.</p><p>Secondly, we were not able to eliminate all possible ecological explanations for age-related changes in tool-using efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Falótico et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Proffitt et al., 2022</xref>). Some ecological variables were controlled for as part of the experimental set up at the outdoor laboratory. For example, chimpanzees were always tested during similar months of the year in each field season, and were provided with oil-palm nuts at a suitable stage of maturity (and thus of similar hardness). Previous studies at Bossou have also revealed that chimpanzees are able to select nuts that are suitable for cracking, further suggesting that chimpanzees can account for differences in nut quality during tool use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sakura and Matsuzawa, 1991</xref>; although this could also have been affected by aging itself, such as through reduced visual acuity impeding suitable nut selection; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fujisawa et al., 2010</xref>). Whilst it is possible that other ecological factors may influence our results, we believe that inter-seasonal ecological differences are unlikely to fully explain them. Firstly, if differences in chimpanzees’ nut cracking efficiency between seasons were being driven by ecological variation, we predict that this inter-annual variation would be equally present across early and late field seasons. However, contrary to this prediction, nut-cracking efficiency was very similar across early field seasons (and across individuals during these years); changes in efficiency were only detected in later field seasons, when chimpanzees were sampled at older ages. Secondly, if inter-annual differences in ecology rendered nut cracking more difficult in later field seasons, we would expect these ecological changes to affect all individuals similarly. This was also not the case, as changes in behavior differed between individuals – some maintained similar levels of efficiency (such as Fana), whereas other individuals experienced profound reductions in efficiency (such as Velu and Yo). For Yo (the individual with the greatest reduction in tool-using efficiency), the observations that Yo took even longer to crack oil-palm nuts in 2018 (and that Yo also struggled to crack coula nuts in 2011, see Appendices 3 and 4 for further information, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) provide evidence for a directional, individual-specific reduction in nut-cracking efficiency across later years, rather than her efficiency being dictated by ecological variation. We could not provide nut-cracking efficiency data for a cohort of younger adults across field seasons, as there was only one young adult (male) individual at Bossou between 1999 and 2016. An additional younger adult cohort would have been a desirable control group for our study, to complement the long-term efficiency baselines we provide at the level of the individual. For future studies, we believe that the collection of a wider array of ecological data would be valuable for discriminating between explanations with greater confidence and, where possible, future studies should aim to collect long-term data on the behavior of younger adults as additional control groups.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-105411-video2.mp4" id="video2"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Coula nut cracking by Jire, Foaf and Yo in 2011.</title></caption></media><p>Thirdly, as data were collected from video footage, we could not examine how the dimensions of tools and raw material types influenced chimpanzees’ tool-use behaviors over different encounters and across field seasons. Throughout long-term data collection at Bossou, the stone tools available at the outdoor laboratory have been kept as consistent as possible, and chimpanzees select tools with physical properties which likely enhance nut cracking efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Braun et al., 2025</xref>). Indeed, changes in tool-using efficiency may be borne from increasing difficulty selecting appropriate tools with aging. Future studies should gather data on tool properties to support analyses of aging effects in tool use. These studies could be combined with data collection on even more finely grained behaviors of apes when using tools, such as the specific grips used to manipulate objects over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Neufuss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Malherbe et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Fourthly, our study was limited to a small sample size of five aging chimpanzees. This is an inevitability of collecting longitudinal data on long-lived wild individuals who are approaching the ends of their lifespan. Further data is needed – including from other field sites – to establish whether the variation in aging effects we have found generalizes to other individuals and populations (and, where possible, other tool use behaviors).</p><p>Much like human technical skills, the tool-use behaviors of chimpanzees and other great apes are culturally variable behaviors that are acquired through a mixture of social learning and individual practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matsuzawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Inoue-Nakamura and Matsuzawa, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schuppli et al., 2016</xref>). As previously mentioned, prior research on nut cracking behavior at Bossou has revealed that chimpanzees vary in the age of skill acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matsuzawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Inoue-Nakamura and Matsuzawa, 1997</xref>), and the efficiency with which nut cracking is performed across adulthood varies between individuals, yet is stable within individuals over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berdugo et al., 2025</xref>). These differences in individual performance are, in part, likely due to differences in the environments of learners during skill acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berdugo et al., 2024</xref>). Our results expand on these findings to highlight that, whilst chimpanzees at Bossou perform nut cracking behaviors throughout their lives (suggesting that this is an important skill for this population), progressive aging and senescence may exaggerate interindividual differences in the performance of socially learnt skills, as seen in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lindenberger, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Paccagnella, 2016</xref>). Taken as a whole, our results provide further evidence that the cultural behaviors of humans and chimpanzees exhibit marked similarities that extend across their lifetimes, including, for some individuals, a period of technological senescence that can manifest across the oldest years of life. Further research should examine whether similar factors influence senescence of technical skills between humans and apes. This research should include studies that determine whether skill proficiency in early life and adulthood, and the frequency with which skills continue to be performed in later life, influence the rate and likelihood of senescence. Furthermore, debate continues as to whether human behaviors are particularly susceptible to the effects of aging due to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Edler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Finch and Austad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blesa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Emborg, 2017</xref>). Current evidence suggests that the effects of these neurological changes in humans have far more profound impacts on behavior, despite primates sometimes exhibiting similar neuropathological signatures during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Frye et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnsten et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Edler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lemere et al., 2008</xref>). Yet, it is still not clear whether this conclusion comes from a lack of behavioral data on aging in primates. We were not able to collect neurological samples from the chimpanzees in our study and cannot say whether the changes we observed could be associated with such processes (including for Yo, whose more profound senescence renders her the most likely to suffer from neurological decline). However, tool use could offer a suitable domain in which to examine the possible manifestation of such diseases (if present). Field sites should make specific efforts to collect long-term data on behavioral changes with aging – including for tool use – and where possible aim to sample neurological data following the natural deaths of wild, elderly individuals. These data will provide important insights into the underlying causes of human and chimpanzee skill disruption in the contexts of healthy and diseased aging.</p><p>In foraging contexts, multi-object tool-use behaviors are often used to extract energy-rich resources that would not be otherwise accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">King, 1986</xref>). Given the sample size of our study and limitations in the wider ecological data available, it was not possible to identify the influence of tool-use senescence on individual survivability through reduced energy intake. Answering this question would require data on a greater number of tool-use behaviors, spanning across the home range. However, the two females in our study who exhibited limited changes in tool-using efficiency (Jire and Fana) had the longest lifespan after the end of our study, whereas Velu and Yo (who experienced greater difficulty cracking nuts in later years) died comparatively shortly after our sample period. While this sample is too small to make strong claims, this pattern could indicate that the senescence of tool-use behaviors, and the energy-rich foods to which they permit access, can contribute to reduced survivability in the wild. Alternatively, changes in tool-use behaviors could offer a litmus for identifying individuals experiencing profound generalized senescence in the wild, where changes in many physiological and behavioral processes subsequently impact an individual’s survivability. By extension, outside of tool use, our data on individual survivability – alongside previous studies of chimpanzees at Bossou – invites speculation surrounding whether the social relationships of specific individuals may reduce or accentuate the rate and intensity of senescence with progressive aging. In addition to living for a longer period after the final field season we sampled, Fana and Jire enjoyed more central social positions than other elderly females at Bossou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schofield et al., 2019</xref>) and had a greater number of living relatives during the latter field seasons (during which Jire had two mature offspring, and Fana had two mature offspring and two young grandchildren). Given that only eight individuals remained at Bossou by 2016, these familial relationships constituted a significant proportion of the overall community. Further research will provide insight into if and how lifetime sociality and familial success influence the onset and rate of senescence in wild chimpanzees, for example through socially mediated resource acquisition.</p><p>In sum, we demonstrate that the tool-use behaviors of wild chimpanzees can change in old age, and that these changes vary between individuals. Whilst our study is observational, we argue that processes of senescence offer a promising explanation for such changes, particularly in regard to changes in individual tool-using efficiency. Our findings reflect the conclusions of previous studies investigating the cognitive and physiological senescence of primates living in captivity and generate a myriad of further questions about the possible underlying mechanisms of tool-use senescence, as well as more general behavioral aging in wild apes. As questions surrounding aging benefit from longitudinal data – which for many primates require collection across decades – the possibility that such questions will be answered is becoming increasingly more precarious in an age where primates are at a heightened risk of extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Estrada et al., 2017</xref>). The conservation of wild primate populations is paramount for our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of primate aging processes, which may reveal insights into the forces influencing behavioral stability and senescence across the human lifetime.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study site and video archive</title><p>Established in 1976, Bossou (07° 390’ N; 008° 300’ W) is a site of long-term research focused on a small population of wild West-African chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matsuzawa et al., 2011</xref>). Chimpanzees at Bossou possess an extensive repertoire of tool-use behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Humle, 2011</xref>), including nut cracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Matsuzawa, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biro et al., 2006</xref>). For many years, the size of the Bossou chimpanzee community remained relatively stable at around 20 individuals; however, following a flu-like epidemic in 2002 that killed 5 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Matsuzawa et al., 2004</xref>), the population began an irrecoverable decline. At the time of writing (2025), the Bossou community consists of just three individuals.</p><p>Nut cracking by Bossou chimpanzees has been studied for several decades through the use of an ‘outdoor laboratory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Matsuzawa, 1994</xref>; established in 1988; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Open during the dry season of each year (approximately November-February), the outdoor laboratory is a maintained natural clearing in the forest (approximately 7x20 m) where nuts and stones are provided for chimpanzees. These typically consist of oil-palm nuts, <italic>Elaeis guineensis,</italic> which is the only species that occurs naturally at Bossou and thus the only species of nut habitually cracked by these chimpanzees. Oil-palm nuts were sourced from local communities surrounding Bossou, and nuts provided to chimpanzees were generally of suitable maturity for cracking and consumption. In some years, coula nuts, <italic>Coula edulis,</italic> and in 1 year panda nuts, <italic>Panda oleos</italic>, were also provided. Neither coula nor panda nuts occur naturally at Bossou, but both are cracked by chimpanzees at nearby sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biro et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to nuts, chimpanzees are also provided with over 50 stones organized in a square matrix in the center of the clearing at the start of each session (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), as well as a raceme of edible oil-palm fruits (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The outdoor laboratory also features a water point (a hollowed section of a tree trunk; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) from which chimpanzees may extract water for drinking using leaf tools. Chimpanzees visit the outdoor laboratory spontaneously as part of their daily ranging behaviors, and with comparable frequency to other naturally occurring nut cracking sites within the home range at Bossou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almeida-Warren et al., 2022</xref>). Upon arrival at the outdoor laboratory, chimpanzees’ behaviors are recorded by observers using two or three video cameras located behind a screen of vegetation.</p><p>Video data collected at the outdoor laboratory has recently been collated into a longitudinal archive spanning from 1990 to the present day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berdugo et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schofield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bain et al., 2021</xref>). Given the long-term use of the outdoor laboratory to study nut cracking, all chimpanzees were well habituated to the experimental set up by 1999 (the first field season from which data was sampled for this study). The Bossou archive also contains data on the composition of all recorded encounters with groups of chimpanzees at the outdoor laboratory across this timeframe and can be combined with recorded family lineage data (including birth data for individuals born after the establishment of long-term research at Bossou). The Bossou archive therefore presents a novel opportunity for longitudinal analysis of whether and how tool-use behaviors change across the later periods of chimpanzee lifespans.</p><p>We collected and analyzed data on the behaviors of chimpanzees at the outdoor laboratory at Bossou, spanning a seventeen-year period (1999–2016). This 17-year period contains the majority of the available video data collected at Bossou. To balance fine-grained behavior coding (which is highly time intensive) with the need to sample data over an extended time period to capture possible effects of long-term senescence, we aimed to sample field seasons within this time window at 4-year intervals; however, in some years, data was not collected at Bossou (such as during years where disease outbreaks were affecting local communities). In such instances, we sampled the closest field season which likely contained sufficient data for our analyses. Thus, during this period, we sampled data from five field seasons (1999, 2004, 2008, 2011, and 2016).</p><p>Over the years, the outdoor laboratory has operated at two locations in the forest. Between 1999 and 2008, data was only collected at one specific location across the years. However, in 2011, a second clearing was made available to chimpanzees, with an identical experimental set up. In 2011, data was collected in both locations simultaneously. By 2016, all data collection had transitioned to the newer, second location. For the majority of our analyses, we therefore used data from the first location between the years of 1999–2011 and the second location in 2016. For only one analysis (attendance rate, see below), we used data from both the first and second outdoor laboratory location in 2011. All behavior coding in our study was performed using the open-access software BORIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Friard and Gamba, 2016</xref>), with videos viewed on a 59 cm monitor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Attendance</title><p>We recorded the total number of times chimpanzees were encountered at the outdoor laboratory in each field season. An encounter was defined as any instance where one or a group of chimpanzees visited the outdoor laboratory and lasted until all chimpanzees left. If a chimpanzee left the outdoor laboratory and returned before all other individuals had left, it was classed as part of the same encounter. We collected data on the five chimpanzees experiencing increasingly old age, as well as for an additional cohort of all adult and subadult individuals between the ages of 8 and 30 years old. This second cohort of individuals allowed us to evaluate whether changes in attendance rate over progressive field seasons may be due to confounding factors other than senescence, such as changes in environmental food availability or population structure, or changes in the number of experimental nut cracking sites. For our younger cohort of chimpanzees, we used a minimum age of 8 years old, as chimpanzees at Bossou acquire the skill of nut cracking by 7 years of age. For this analysis, we also excluded two adult females (Pama and Nina) who never learnt to successfully crack nuts using stone tools. To evaluate whether progressive aging reduced attendance rates, we constructed a Poisson GLMM with field season as a continuous fixed effect (scaled about the mean), and cohort (above or below 30 years) as a categorical variable. Rates of attendance were estimated using encounters (a count variable) and the inclusion of an offset term in our model (the number of days of the field season). Importantly, we included an interaction term in our model to see whether the relationship between aging across field seasons and attendance rate was more severe for our focal elderly individuals compared with the younger cohort. Individual ID was included as a random intercept to account for repeated measures of the same individual across field seasons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behaviors at the outdoor laboratory</title><p>We estimated whether, over successive field seasons, elderly individuals began spending a greater or lesser proportion of their time engaging in nut cracking when present at the outdoor laboratory, as compared with other commonly performed behaviors. For each elderly individual, we sampled the first 10 encounters of each field season in which they were present (totaling a maximum of 50 encounters per individual across all field seasons). For each encounter, we timed how long individuals engaged in one of four mutually exclusive categories of behavior:</p><list list-type="order" id="list1"><list-item><p><bold>Engaging with nuts and stone tools:</bold> the total amount of time individuals spent interacting with nuts, nut fragments (including shells and kernels), and stones. Coding began when an individual first touched a nut, nut fragment, or stone.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Drinking water:</bold> the total amount of time individuals spent producing leaf tools and drinking from the water point. Coding began when an individual stripped leaves from branches to begin manufacturing a leaf tool to aid in drinking water, or, if reusing a tool that had previously been made and discarded, when they collected the tool and began to approach the water point to drink.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Eating oil-palm fruits:</bold> the total amount of time individuals spent consuming oil-palm fruits from the raceme.

If an individual dropped all relevant items and was idle for at least 1 min, they were considered to be resting, and behaviors were marked as ‘Other’. For field seasons in which individuals did not visit the outdoor laboratory on at least 10 occasions, all available encounters were used. We also recorded the total amount of time each focal individual spent at the outdoor laboratory during each encounter. We calculated the proportion of time individuals spent engaging in each type of behavior across all encounters of each field season (thus, controlling for differences in the total time individuals were observed between years). For this analysis, we omitted any videos collected at the second outdoor laboratory site (including some videos from 2011 and all videos from 2016). We chose to do so as the two sites vary in how accessible they are (with the original site being situated at the top of a steep hill, but the second requiring no climb). This difference in terrain may influence the behaviors of the chimpanzees once arriving at the outdoor laboratory, for example, more time resting following climbing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Stone-tool selection</title><p>We measured the time taken for the old-aged chimpanzees to select stone tools at the central matrix during each of the sampled field seasons. We sampled the first 10 encounters with each individual for each field season. All tool-selection events in these encounters were sampled. We began timing when chimpanzees approached the matrix, and we considered their gaze to be fixed on at least one stone tool. We stopped timing when chimpanzees turned away from the matrix holding all acquired stone tools. We recorded the number of stone tools taken by the focal chimpanzee during each instance of stone-tool selection (a categorical score of ‘one’ or ‘two’ stones). Additionally, we recorded the number of stone tools that had been removed from the stone-tool matrix prior to each stone selection event (including those removed by other individuals, as well as the focal chimpanzee during previous instances of stone-tool selection). We could therefore incorporate into our analysis a metric of how many options were available to chimpanzees during each stone-tool selection event (where higher numbers of previously selected tools indicated a smaller pool of possible choices). We did not sample instances where chimpanzees selected and used tools which were not positioned at the central matrix (i.e. when using tools which had already been transported away from the matrix by other chimpanzees). When modeling tool-selection time over field seasons, both the number of stones that a chimpanzee selected from the central matrix (one or two) and the number of stones previously removed from the matrix were included in our model as fixed effects, to control for additional variation in selection time introduced by these two factors (see Statistical analyses below for more details on GLMM model structures).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Coding discrete actions</title><p>When performing complex technical skills—including tool-use behaviors— experienced apes organize individual actions into more streamlined goal-directed sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Byrne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Howard-Spink et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Inoue-Nakamura and Matsuzawa, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boesch et al., 2020</xref>), and begin to successfully perform behaviors more quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Howard-Spink et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boesch and Boesch, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Neufuss et al., 2017</xref>); however, whether experiencing progressively old age influences this efficiency has not yet been studied.</p><p>To evaluate the efficiency with which focal chimpanzees engaged in nut cracking, we coded the individual, fine-grained actions used by focal chimpanzees when cracking nuts at the outdoor laboratories. We sampled videos chronologically from each sampled field season. Fine-grained action coding was conducted for each individual in each field season until at least 1000 actions had been collected, and included sequences of actions that described the cracking of at least 20 nuts in their entirety. To code sequences of actions, we used an ethogram of 34 manipulations (e.g. ‘Grasp’, ‘Drop’, ‘Strike’) and 6 objects (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref> for full ethogram; all discrete-action coding was performed by one individual: EHS; our ethogram was tested to ensure that it can be applied objectively as part of a previous research project; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Howard-Spink et al., 2024</xref>). The six possible objects included: Hammer, Anvil, Nut, Kernel (the edible interior of a nut), Shell (the inedible exterior of a nut), and Bare Hand (for use when individuals performed an action in the absence of an object, e.g., striking the anvil with bare hand). Stone tools were categorized as ‘Hammer’ or ‘Anvil’ based on how they were used by the individual. If an individual swapped over their hammer and anvil stones, the stones were reassigned accordingly. Thus, stone tools were coded according to their function at any specific point in a sequence. We considered an individual action to be the combination of both the manipulation performed by the chimpanzee and the object being manipulated (e.g. ‘Grasp Hammer’=one action).</p><p>Coding of action sequences started when an individual began interacting with a nut, nut fragment, or stone, and ceased when an individual dropped all relevant objects and either began engaging in an alternative behavior (e.g. grooming, feeding on oil-palm fruits, etc.) or rested for longer than one minute. Actions were coded as discrete events during behavioral observation, and the time of each action was automatically recorded in BORIS.</p><p>The total corpus of actions was parsed into sequences directed at the cracking of individual nuts and the consumption of all associated kernels. Only sequences which described the entire processing of a nut, from acquisition of the nut to complete consumption of the kernel, were included in our analysis. A number of metrics of efficiency were extracted from action sequences directed at individual nuts, which emphasize the speed with which kernels can be acquired and consumed, and the extent to which the actions used to do so reflect a streamlined behavioral sequence:</p><list list-type="order" id="list2"><list-item><p><bold>Total time to crack nuts and consume all kernel.</bold> The total time between the start of the first action and the end of the last action performed on a specific nut, including all actions involving the consumption of kernel and disposal of shell fragments.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Number of actions used to process nuts and consume all kernel.</bold> The total number of actions performed during the cracking of a specific nut, including consumption of kernel and disposal of shell fragments.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Number of unique types of action used to process nuts and consume all kernel.</bold> The number of different types of actions performed by an individual when cracking a specific nut, including all kernel consumption and disposal of shell fragments. This metric is different from [2] as it describes the variety of actions employed, rather than the number; for example, for the action sequence <italic>A,A,B,C,B,C</italic>, where letters denote hypothetical actions<italic>,</italic> the number of actions is six, and the number of unique action types is three {<italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, <italic>C</italic>}.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Number of times the nut was (re)placed on the anvil.</bold> The number of times the nut was placed on the anvil during initial placement, and also all replacements when the nut rolled off the anvil. An understanding of how to orient the anvil and where to place the nut can reduce the likelihood of needing to perform nut replacements. Therefore, fewer nut placements reflect a greater efficiency in nut cracking.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Number of strikes of the hammer stone per nut.</bold> The number of individual strikes of the hammer stone performed on each nut that a chimpanzee cracked.

For attendance rates, tool-selection times, and the metrics of efficiency cracking individual nuts, we used linear and generalized linear mixed-effect models to assess for the effects of age (using the lme4 package; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bates et al., 2015</xref>). Linear mixed-effect models were used in any instance where time was a response variable (time was logged to confer normality); whereas, if a response variable was measured in counts (e.g. number of actions used to crack open a nut; number of encounters over a field season, etc.), we employed generalized linear mixed-effect models using a Poisson distribution. In both instances, the year of the field season (scaled about the mean) was used as a fixed effect, as a proxy for age.</p><p>Our model for attendance data is described above in <bold>Attendance</bold> (we describe this model separately as we modeled the effect of aging in two separate groups – young and old – rather than for specific individuals). For all other metrics, we modeled the effect of aging on focal, elderly chimpanzees by using random intercepts and slopes to evaluate the effect of the increasing year of each field season. Our decision to include a random slope is supported by previous research on captive and wild primates, which suggests that the effects of senescence are highly variable across individuals for a number of physiological and cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tarou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rothwell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morbeck et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Freire-Cobo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hämäläinen et al., 2015</xref>). Across metrics of engagement and efficiency, we compared random-slope models with fixed slope models – which assume that the effect of increasing field season will be the same for all individuals – as well as with null models which fit an intercept across all field seasons (and therefore assumed no effect of aging). This allowed us to evaluate whether the effect of increasing year of each field season influenced chimpanzee behavior, and also whether this effect was variable across individuals. All model comparisons were performed using AIC, where lower scores indicate better fit relative to model complexity. Where necessary, we also included the specific encounter as an additional random intercept (fixed slope) to avoid pseudoreplication from multiple tool-selection events within the same encounter.</p><p>When analyzing metrics of nut cracking efficiency (for which we had a total of seven metrics, see above), we restricted the use of models to describe changes in metrics based on whether, for at least one individual, the median value for a particular field season fell outside the interquartile range of any previous field season. If a model identified that an efficiency metric was changing across field seasons, we used model coefficients to gauge the direction of change for each individual. To estimate the magnitude of change across field seasons, we compared data collected for each individual in the earliest and latest year that they were sampled. We calculated % change as the change in a metric between the last and first field season, divided by the value for the first field season (to scale the change), multiplied by 100 (see associated code).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing, Cosenior Author</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing, Cosenior Author</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Data collection at Bossou has been conducted by different researchers over several decades.

The present study was entirely conducted using existing video data from Bossou (the Bossou Archive), and therefore did not involve collection of additional data from wild chimpanzees.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-105411-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data and code can be accessed through the open science framework: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/uf9za/">https://osf.io/uf9za/</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Howard-Spink</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2025">2025</year><data-title>Data: Old age variably impacts chimpanzee engagement and efficiency in stone tool use</data-title><source>Open Science Framework</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://osf.io/uf9za/">uf9za</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Daniel Schofield for their help in curating the Bossou video archive, as well as Ignacio Juarez Martinez and Alex Mielke for their statistical advice.

There are 6 possible corresponding objects: 1. Nut, 2. Hammer, 3. Anvil, 4. Kernel, 5. Shell, 6. Bare Hand. Codes in italics are used to denote the start and end of observable sequences. Coding commenced when individuals began interacting with stones, nuts, or nut fragments. Coding ceased when individuals began engaging in a new behavior, e.g. play, grooming, eating oil-palm fruits. On the occasions where an individual moved out of clear sight of the video recording, or behavior became obscured by an individual’s body position, sequences were terminated with a ‘Not Visible’ codon and marked as incomplete. This ethogram has been used in previous studies to collect data from the Bossou archive, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Howard-Spink et al., 2024</xref>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Action</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Bite</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Place object in mouth and bite with teeth.

Cracking</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-1"><title>Results</title><p>Three of our focal individuals were observed cracking coula nuts in 2011 (Jire, Tua &amp; Yo). Coula nuts do not occur naturally at Bossou, but are cracked by chimpanzees at other sites across Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boesch and Boesch, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biro et al., 2006</xref>) and have historically been experimentally provided to individuals at Bossou during selected field seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biro et al., 2006</xref>). Of the three individuals who were observed cracking coula nuts in 2011, only Jire was observed also cracking oil-palm nuts in the same year. Coula nuts require somewhat more effort to crack and process than smaller oil-palm nuts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boesch and Boesch, 1983</xref>); however, for two individuals (Jire and Tua), coula nuts were cracked and processed with comparable efficiency to smaller oil-palm nuts (with a slight increase in total time taken, the number of actions and unique action types used, and the total number of strikes of the hammer stone; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3—table 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for corresponding data). On average, Jire took an extra 22.8 s to crack coula nuts compared with oil-palm nuts in 2011. Similarly, Tua took an additional 44.1 s to crack coula nuts in 2011, compared with oil-palm nuts in 2008 (the closest comparison point for Tua, who was not observed cracking oil-palm nuts in 2011).</p><p>Conversely, Yo showed a considerably lower efficiency cracking coula nuts in 2011 compared with her efficiency cracking oil-palm nuts in the previously sampled field season (2008; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>). On average, Yo took an additional 2.63 minutes (+157.9 s; mean duration across oil-palm nuts in 2008 and coula nuts in 2011) to crack open coula nuts, during which Yo performed an average of 78 additional actions to crack the nut and consume all associated kernel (including an additional 23 hammer strikes; measured as using median values for each nut species). For Yo, coula nuts frequently rolled off of the anvil stone, resulting in Yo placing each coula nut on the anvil 11 times prior to successful cracking (median value; in 2008, Yo would place oil-palm nuts on the anvil once per nut). Additionally, Yo exhibited exceptional variability between the number of times she switched out tools during coula-nut cracking (interquartile range = 7.25, for oil-palm nuts in 2008 this was 0), as well as for the number of tool adjustments per coula nut (coula = 4.25, oil-palm=0). Overall, these metrics suggest that Yo found coula-nut cracking in 2011 disproportionately difficult compared with oil-palm nut cracking. This was to an extent which was not mirrored by other individuals of similar ages, as well as compared to her own performance when cracking oil-palm nuts in previous and subsequent years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3—table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11"><title>Discussion</title><p>The disproportionate difficulty that Yo faced cracking coula nuts was surprising given the history of this behavior at Bossou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Matsuzawa, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biro et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike oil-palm nuts, whose trees occur within the home range of the Bossou community, coula nuts are not found at Bossou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biro et al., 2006</xref>). Coula nuts were first introduced to chimpanzees at the outdoor laboratory in 1993, when Yo was the only adult individual to begin cracking coula nuts without engaging in a phase of exploratory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biro et al., 2006</xref>). Other individuals began cracking coula nuts through successive, intermittent presentations of coula nuts across further field seasons (1996, 2000, 2002, 2005). Given that Yo readily engaged in coula nut cracking, it was deduced that Yo was likely an immigrant from the neighboring Yealé population, where both oil-palm and coula nuts are readily available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biro et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, Yo likely has the longest history and greatest experience cracking coula nuts, despite exhibiting such low efficiency in 2011.</p><p>There are numerous hypotheses for why Yo showed a dramatic reduction in efficiency when cracking coula nuts in 2011. It is important to note that, for Yo, data for the cracking of coula nuts in this year came from a single, three-hour long encounter, where Yo spent one hour and 17 min of continuous effort cracking the first 20 coula nuts. It is possible that a short-term effect (such as dehydration, hunger, physical injury) may have inhibited the cognitive processes or physical movements required for streamlined tool action. However, we noticed no obvious signs of physical injury, and Yo spent the majority of the encounter prioritizing nut cracking over both the water point and the more readily available oil-palm fruits. This reduces the likelihood of these hypotheses explaining the observed changes in Yo’s behavior. Alternatively, it may be that the reduced ability to crack coula nuts in 2011 was a product of senescence, a hypothesis which is supported by the fact that Yo also exhibited the largest reduction in efficiency when cracking oil-palm nuts at older ages (which continued to intensify further in later life, past the 2016 field season; see below). Given that coula nuts are larger and rounder than oil-palm nuts (and thus can be more liable to roll off of anvil stones) and have more fibrous outer shells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boesch and Boesch, 1983</xref>), they therefore may require heavier hammer stones, and/or more forceful or elaborate sequences of striking and peeling actions to separate shell from kernel. Physiological senescence – such as reduced strength of dexterity - may have rendered coula nut cracking even more challenging than the cracking of oil-palm nuts, for which Yo was also exhibiting increasing difficulty. Alternatively, cognitive senescence may have also contributed to the additional difficulty Yo faced when cracking coula nuts, where she may have struggled to generate suitable action patterns to crack open a less frequently encountered nut species.</p><p>Given the absence of data for coula nut cracking in earlier years, we emphasize that these conclusions are tentative, and further data collection is required for coula-nut cracking over different field seasons.</p><table-wrap id="app3table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 3—table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of nut cracking and processing metrics for Tua, Jire, and Yo between 2008 and 2016.</title><p>Total time duration is summarized by mean and standard deviation.

We did not, however, include this data in our main manuscript for several reasons.</p><p>Data was collected using camera traps in 2018, which were motion-triggered. These camera traps were only able to capture a limited viewpoint of the outdoor laboratory and did not record encounters continuously. Therefore, estimating the entire party composition during encounters, the behaviors of individuals as they moved around the outdoor laboratory, and the duration of stone-tool selection events were not possible, as individuals were often out of sight for some or all of the behavior. We also could not collect fine-grained action sequence data for the entire behavioral sequence used to crack individual nuts, as there were gaps in the video footage lasting several seconds. Additionally, in 2018, only three elderly individuals remained at Bossou (Yo, Jire, and Fana), and the majority of clear video footage concerning nut cracking was of Yo. All nuts cracked by Yo in this year were oil-palm nuts.</p><p>Whilst the collection of fine-grained action sequence data was not possible, it was possible to record the start and end times of nut cracking sequences aimed at individual nuts using timestamps on video footage. We therefore collected the start and end times of nut cracking sequences performed by Yo. We filtered our data to only include nuts where we could clearly identify the start and end of Yo’s nut cracking behaviors across videos, using the same coding scheme reported in the methods of our manuscript (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table1">Appendix 4—table 1</xref>).</p><p>To calculate a mean duration of oil-palm nut cracking for Yo in 2018, we first found the mean within each encounter, and then calculated a mean across encounters. This blocking was used to compensate for the non-independence of nuts cracked as part of the same encounter. Overall, it took Yo on average 74.2 s to crack each oil palm nut in 2018 (SD = 9.1 s; estimated using the means of each encounter). This was 18.3 s longer than the mean time taken in 2016, meaning that Yo became even less efficient at oil-palm nut cracking in later years. Overall, when comparing the mean duration of oil-palm nut cracking between 1999 and 2018, Yo experienced a +171% change in total time taken (1999=27.4 s; difference between years = +46.7 s).</p><table-wrap id="app4table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 4—table 1.</label><caption><title>Total time taken for Yo to crack oil-palm nuts in 2018.</title><p>Encounter numbers indicate where data was collected for the same encounter.

Although there is a growing body of work on aging in primates, there are three components of primate senescence research that have been underutilized or understudied: (1) longitudinal datasets, (2) wild populations, and (3) (stone) tool-use behaviors. Therefore, the goal of this study was to (1) use a 17-year longitudinal dataset (2) of wild chimpanzees in the Bossou forest, (3) visiting a site for field experiments on nut-cracking. They sampled and analyzed data from five field seasons for five chimpanzees of old age. From this sample, Howard-Spink and colleagues noted a decline in tool-use and tool-use efficiency in some individuals, but not in others. The authors then conclude that there is a measurable effect of senescence on chimpanzee behavior, but that it varies individually. The study has major intellectual value as a building block for future research, but there are several major caveats.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>With this study, Howard-Spink and colleagues make a foray into a neglected topic of research: the impact of the physiological and cognitive changes due to senescence on stone tool use in chimpanzees. Based on novelty alone, this is a valuable study. The authors cleverly make use of a longitudinal record covering 17 years of field data, which provides a window into long-term changes in the behavior of wild chimpanzees, which I agree cannot be understood through cross-sectional comparisons.</p><p>The metrics of 'efficiency' (see caveats below) are suitable for measuring changes in technological behavior over time, as specifically tailored to the nut-cracking (e.g., time, number of actions, number of strikes, tool changes). The ethogram and the coding protocol are also suitable for studying the target questions and objectives. I would recommend, however, the inclusion of further variables that will assist in improving the amount of valid data that can be extrapolated (see also below).</p><p>With this pilot, Howard-Spink and colleagues have established a foundation upon which future research can be designed, including further investigation with the Bossou dataset and other existing video archives, but especially future targeted data collection, which can be designed to overcome some of the limits and confounds that can be identified in the current study.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although I agree with the reasoning behind conducting this research and understand that, as the authors state, there are logistical considerations that have to be made when planning and executing such a study, there are a number of methodological and theoretical shortcomings that either need to be more explicitly stated by the authors or would require additional data collection and analysis.</p><p>One of the main limitations of this study is the small sample size. There are only 5 of the old-aged individuals, which is not enough to draw any inferences about aging for chimpanzees more generally. Howard-Spink and colleagues also study data from only five of the 17 years of recorded data at Bossou. The selection of this subset of data requires clarification: why were these intervals chosen, why this number of data points, and how do we know that it provides a representative picture of the age-related changes of the full 17 years?</p><p>With measuring and interpreting the 'efficiency' of behaviors, there are in-built assumptions about the goals of the agents and how we can define efficiency. First, it may be that efficiency is not an intentional goal for nut-cracking at all, but rather, e.g., productivity as far as the number of uncrushed kernels (cf. Putt 2015). Second, what is 'efficient' for the human observer might not be efficient for the chimpanzee who is performing the behavior. More instances of tool-switching may be considered inefficient, but it might also be a valid strategy for extracting more from the nuts, etc. Understanding the goals of chimpanzees may be a difficult proposition, but these are uncertainties that must be kept in mind when interpreting and discussing 'decline' or any change in technological behaviors over time.</p><p>For the study of the physiological impact of senescence of tool use (i.e., on strength and coordination), the study would benefit from the inclusion of variables like grip type and (approximate) stone size (Neufuss et al., 2016). The size and shape of stones for nut-cracking have been shown to influence the efficacy and 'efficiency' of tool use (i.e., the same metrics of 'efficiency' implemented by Howard-Spink et al. in the current study), meaning raw material properties are a potential confound that the authors have not evaluated.</p><p>Similarly, inter- and intraspecific variation in the properties of nuts being processed is another confound (Falótico et al., 2022; Proffitt et al., 2022). If oil palm nuts were varying year-to-year, for example, this would theoretically have an effect on the behavioral forms and strategies employed by the chimpanzees, and thus, any metric of efficiency being collected and analyzed. Further, it is perplexing that the authors analyze only one year where the coula nuts were provided at the test site, but these were provided during multiple field seasons. It would be more useful to compare data from a similar number of field seasons with both species if we are to study age-related changes in nut processing over time (one season of coula nut-cracking certainly does not achieve this).</p><p>Both individual personality (especially neophilia versus neophobia; e.g., Forss &amp; Willems, 2022) and motivation factors (Tennie &amp; Call, 2023) are further confounds that can contribute to a more valid interpretation of the patterns found. To draw any conclusions about age-related changes in diet and food preferences, we would need to have data on the overall food intake/preferences of the individuals and the food availability in the home range. The authors refer briefly to this limitation, but the implications for the interpretation of the data are not sufficiently underlined (e.g., for the relevance of age-related decline in stone tool-use ability for individual survival).</p><p>Generally speaking, there is a lack of consideration for temporal variation in ecological factors. As a control for these, Howard-Spink and colleagues have examined behavioral data for younger individuals from Bossou in the same years, to ostensibly show that patterns in older adults are different from patterns in younger adults, which is fair given the available data. Nonetheless, they seem to focus mostly on the start and end points and not patterns that occur in between. For example, there is a curious drop in attendance rate for all individuals in the 2008 season, the implications of which are not discussed by the authors.</p><p>As far as attendance, Howard-Spink and colleagues also discuss how this might be explained by changes in social standing in later life (i.e., chimpanzees move to the fringes of the social network and become less likely to visit gathering sites). This is not senescence in the sense of physiological and cognitive decline with older age. Instead, the reduced attendance due to changes in social standing seems rather to exacerbate signs of aging rather than be an indicator of it itself. The authors also mention a flu-like epidemic that caused the death of 5 individuals; the subsequent population decline and related changes in demography also warrant more discussion and characterization in the manuscript.</p><p>Understandably, some of these issues cannot be evaluated or corrected with the presented dataset. Nonetheless, these undermine how certain and/or deterministic their conclusions can really be considered. Howard-Spink et al. have not strongly 'demonstrated' the validity of relationships between the variables of the study. If anything, their cursory observations provide us with methods to apply and hypotheses to test in future studies. It is likely that with higher-resolution datasets, the individual variability in age-related decline in tool-use abilities will be replicated. For now, this can be considered a starting point, which will hopefully inspire future attempts to research these questions.</p><p>Falótico, T., Valença, T., Verderane, M. &amp; Fogaça, M. D.

Specifically, the reviewers raised several points surrounding whether we could exclude ecological variation over years as the explanation of changes with aging, rather than aging itself. Whilst we acknowledge there are limitations to our approach, we provide a comprehensive response to these points highlighting:</p><p>(1) Where ecological variables have been accounted for using controls (including the behaviors of other individuals, or an aging individuals’ behavior at younger ages).</p><p>(2) Where ecological data may be missing, thus a potential limitation to our study, and further data would be beneficial.</p><p>(3) Whether, in light of these limitations, interannual ecological variation offers a likely explanation for the behavioral changes we have identified. We provide an argument that whilst ecological data would be desirable for our study, interannual changes in ecology are unlikely to explain the trends in our data. Additionally, we explain why age-related changes, such as senescence, are more likely to underpin the patterns described in our manuscript.</p><p>Across 1-3, we have made substantial changes to the reporting of our manuscript to ensure that our results are communicated transparently, and conclusions are made with appropriate care. We have also moved all discussion of coula-nut cracking to the supplementary materials, given the points raised by reviewers about the lack of data describing coula-nut cracking in earlier field seasons.</p><p>We hope that these modifications will enhance both the editors’ and reviewers’ assessment of our manuscript, where we have aimed to make careful conclusions that are supported by our available data. Similarly, we have aimed to communicate the importance of our results across fields of research including primatology, evolutionary anthropology, and comparative gerontology, and hope that our research will be of use to further studies within these subfields.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) If possible, include results or a summary of the behaviour of younger adults using stone tools during the same period. It would be helpful to know if they had the same or different pattern to exclude other factors that may influence the tool use (harder nuts in a particular season, diseases, motivation for other foods, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>We include data for other individuals when analyzing attendance. However, we did not collect comparable long-term efficiency data on younger adult individuals for this study. This is, in part, due to the time constraints imposed by long-term behavior coding. Additionally, only one adult was both present at Bossou throughout the 1999-2016 period, and younger than the threshold for our old-age category across these years (thus, the baseline used to compare with older adults would be just one younger adult, thus would not have been useful for characterizing normal variation of many younger adults over time). However, given the longitudinal data we present, we can use data from the earlier field seasons for each elderly focal individual as a personalized baseline control. Previous studies at Bossou find that across the majority of adulthood, efficiency varies between individuals, but is stable within individuals over time (e.g., Berdugo et al. 2024, cited). We detected similar stability in individuals’ efficiency over the first three field seasons sampled in our analysis, where there was very little intra-individual variation in tool-using efficiency. However, in later years, two individuals (Velu &amp; Yo) began to exhibit relatively large reductions in efficiency.</p><p>These results are unlikely to be explained by ecological variation. If there was a change in ecology underpinning our results, we would expect: [1] changes in ecology to also introduce variation in earlier field seasons, and [2] to influence all individuals in our study similarly. As such, if the changes observed in later field seasons were due to ecological changes, they should have caused a reduced efficiency across individuals, and to a similar degree – we did not observe this result, with large reductions in efficiency were confined to two individuals. Moreover, for Yo (the individual who exhibited the largest reduction in efficiency) we found some additional evidence that changes in oil-palm-nut cracking efficiency extended beyond the period we sampled, i.e. they were evident even in 2018, reflecting a long-term, directional reduction in efficiency as compared to earlier years of her life. This consistent reduction in tool-using efficiency over multiple years adds further weight to the hypothesis that changes at the level of the individual were causing reduced tool-using efficiency, rather than our results being underpinned by interseasonal variation in ecology.</p><p>Whilst we agree that our study is limited in the extent to which we can analytically assess ecological explanations for changes in nut-cracking efficiency, we believe that hypothetical ecological changes across field seasons do not predict our results. We now raise both sides of this debate in our discussion, where we outline our limitations (see lines 535-593).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The data from 2011 was scarce, with only one individual having 10 encounters. It would be better to be cautious with this season's results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this limitation raised by the reviewer. Velu and Yo were only encountered a few times in 2011; however, both were encountered more frequently in 2016. For 2011, we did not collect oil-palm nut cracking data for either Yo or Velu. Thus, their change in efficiency was detected by models using data from all other years, regardless of the few encounters in 2011. This sparsity of data may still have influenced our metrics for the proportion of time chimpanzees spent engaging in different behaviors when present at the outdoor laboratory in 2011, particularly for Velu, who was one of the two individuals who exhibited a change in behavior in this year (along with Fana, N = 10 for 2011). We have therefore added a line in our results and discussion highlighting the sparsity of data for Velu when estimating these proportions for 2011 (see lines 255-256 &amp; 410).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor corrections</p><p>(1) The last paragraph of the introduction presents many results, which should be in the results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to keep this section of the introduction.

There are only 5 of the old-aged individuals, which is not enough to draw any inferences about aging for chimpanzees more generally. Howard-Spink and colleagues also study data from only five of the 17 years of recorded data at Bossou. The selection of this subset of data requires clarification: why were these intervals chosen, why this number of data points, and how do we know that it provides a representative picture of the age-related changes of the full 17 years?</p></disp-quote><p>We note that our sample size is limited to 5 individuals. This is an inevitable constraint of analyzing aging longitudinally in long-lived species, as only few individuals will live to old age. We argue that 17 years is a long enough period of study, as in the initially sampled field season (1999) focal individuals are reaching a mature age of adulthood (39-44 years) and begin to age progressively up to ages that are typically considered to be on the extreme side for chimpanzees’ lifespans in the wild (56-61 years). We raise in our methods that whilst it is difficult to determine precisely when chimpanzees become ‘old aged’, previous studies use the age of around 40 years, as from this age survivorship begins to decrease more rapidly (see Wood et al., Science 2023). Indeed, one focal individual (Tua) disappeared during the period of our study (presumed dead), and one other individual died in 2017 (Velu), the year after our final sampled field season. As of 2025, two other focal females have since died, and only one focal individual was still alive at Bossou (Jire, the individual exhibiting the least evidence for senescence over our study period). These observations suggest that we successfully captured data from chimpanzees during the oldest ages of their lives for most individuals in the community. Moreover, the period of 1999-2016 contains the majority of data available within the Bossou Archive, with years before and after this window containing comparably less data. This information is included within our results and methods (see sections 2.1 and 4.1).</p><p>For our earliest field season (1999), it is unlikely that senescence had already had an effect on stone-tool use, as we measured efficiency to be high across all efficiency metrics for all individuals. For example, in 1999, the median number of hammer strikes performed by focal chimpanzees ranged from 2-4 strikes, and this was comparable to the efficiency reported across all adults observed in previous studies at Bossou (Biro et al. 2003, Anim. Cog.). This finding suggests that senescence effects had not yet taken place, allowing us to evaluate whether aging affects efficiency over subsequent field seasons. This point is now included in the manuscript on lines 449-452.</p><p>We sampled at 4-to-5-year intervals to balance the time-intensive nature of fine-scale behavior coding against the need to sample data across the extended 17-year time window available in our study. We limited the final year to 2016 as, in following years, data were collected using different sampling protocols (though, see limited data from 2018 in the supplementary materials). We aimed to keep the intervals between years as consistent as possible (approx. 4 years); however, for some years data were not collected at Bossou, due to disease outbreaks in the region. In these instances, we selected the closest field season where suitable data were available for study (always +/- 1 year). We have provided further clarification surrounding our sampling regime in the methods (see amendments in section 4.1)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With measuring and interpreting the 'efficiency' of behaviors, there are in-built assumptions about the goals of the agents and how we can define efficiency. First, it may be that efficiency is not an intentional goal for nut-cracking at all, but rather, e.g., productivity as far as the number of uncrushed kernels (cf. Putt 2015). Second, what is 'efficient' for the human observer might not be efficient for the chimpanzee who is performing the behavior. More instances of tool-switching may be considered inefficient, but it might also be a valid strategy for extracting more from the nuts, etc. Understanding the goals of chimpanzees may be a difficult proposition, but these are uncertainties that must be kept in mind when interpreting and discussing 'decline' or any change in technological behaviors over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that knowing precisely how chimpanzees perceive their own efficiency during tool use is unlikely to be available through observation alone. However, under optimal foraging theory, it is reasonable to assume that animals aim to economize foraging behaviors such that they maximize their rate of energy intake. Moreover, a wealth of studies demonstrate that adult chimpanzees acquire and refine tool-using skill efficiency throughout their lives. For example, during nut cracking, adults often select tools with specific properties that aid efficient nut cracking (Braun et al. 2025, J. Hum. Evol.; Carvalho et al. 2008, J. Hum. Evol.; Sirianni et al. 2015, Anim. Behav.); perform nut cracking using more streamlined combinations of actions than less experienced individuals (Howard-Spink et al. 2024, Peer J; Inoue-Nakamura &amp; Matsuzawa 1997, J. Comp. Psychol.), and as a result end up cracking nuts using fewer hammer strikes, indicating a higher level of skill (Biro et al. 2003, Anim. Cogn.; Boesch et al. 2019, Sci. Rep.). Ultimately, these factors suggest that across adulthood, experienced chimpanzees perform nut cracking with a level of efficiency which exceeds novice individuals, including across the whole behavioral sequence for tool use, even if they are not aware or intending to do so. Previous studies at Bossou have also highlighted that there are stable inter-individual differences in efficiency of individuals over time (Berdugo et al. 2024, Nat. Hum. Behav.). This pattern of findings allows us to ask whether this acquired level of skill is stable across the oldest years of an individual’s life, or whether some individuals experience decreased efficiency with age. In addition, our selection of efficiency metrics is in keeping with a wealth of studies which examine the efficiency of stone-tool using in apes, thus, we argue that this is not problematic for our study.</p><p>As we stated in our initial responses to reviewers, it is unlikely that tool switching is a valid strategy for tool use, as it is so rarely performed by proficient adult nut crackers (including earlier in life for our focal individuals). Nevertheless, we did not find a significant change in tool switching for oil-palm nut cracking, and this behavioral change was only observed when Yo was cracking coula nuts. As we have now moved discussion of coula nut cracking to the supplementary materials (and tempered discussion of coula nut cracking to emphasize the need for more data) this behavioral variable does not influence our reported results.</p><p>In our discussion, we also highlight how seemingly less efficient actions may reflect a valid strategy for nut cracking. E.g. a greater number of tool strikes may reflect a strategy of compensation for progressive tool wear. This would still reflect a reduced efficiency (e.g. in terms of the rate at which kernels can be consumed), but may perhaps borne for the necessity to accommodate for changes in an individuals’ physical affordances with aging. Thus, we do take the Reviewer’s point into account, but by using an alternative, more likely, example given the available data. We have now emphasized this point in lines 521-527.</p><p>We have also clarified these matters by adding more information into our methods (see lines 798-802 and 828-829), highlighting that we take a perspective on efficiency that reflects the speed of nut processing and kernel consumption, and the number of different behavioral elements required to do so. Our phrasing now explicitly avoids using language that assumes that individuals’ have some perception of their own efficiency during tool use.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the study of the physiological impact of senescence of tool use (i.e., on strength and coordination), the study would benefit from the inclusion of variables like grip type and (approximate) stone size (Neufuss et al., 2016). The size and shape of stones for nut-cracking have been shown to influence the efficacy and 'efficiency' of tool use (i.e., the same metrics of 'efficiency' implemented by Howard-Spink et al. in the current study), meaning raw material properties are a potential confound that the authors have not evaluated.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not collect this data as part of our study. Whilst grip type could be a useful variable to measure for future studies, it is not necessary to demonstrate senescence per se. However, we agree that this could be a fruitful avenue to understand changes in behavior at greater granularity, and have added this as a recommendation for further study. We also now provide a discussion on stone dimensions and materials as part of our limitations (see lines 581-589 for both points).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, inter- and intraspecific variation in the properties of nuts being processed is another confound (Falótico et al., 2022; Proffitt et al., 2022;). If oil palm nuts were varying year-to-year, for example, this would theoretically have an effect on the behavioral forms and strategies employed by the chimpanzees, and thus, any metric of efficiency being collected and analyzed. Further, it is perplexing that the authors analyze only one year where the coula nuts were provided at the test site, but these were provided during multiple field seasons. It would be more useful to compare data from a similar number of field seasons with both species if we are to study age-related changes in nut processing over time (one season of coula nut-cracking certainly does not achieve this).</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved all discussion of coula nuts to the supplementary materials so as to avoid any confusion with oil-palm nuts (see comments from Reviewer 2, and our response). Nut hardness may influence the difficulty with which nuts are cracked, with one of the most likely factors influencing nut hardness being its age: young nuts are relatively harder to crack, whereas older nuts, which are often worm-eaten or can be empty, crack more easily, yet are not worth cracking (Sakura &amp; Matsuzawa, 1991; Ethology). We largely controlled for this in our study, as the nuts provided at outdoor laboratories were inspected to ensure that the majority of them were of suitable maturity for cracking, and we now clarify this control in our methods (see lines 678-680) and when discussing our study limitations (see lines 551-558). In these sections, we also highlight a previous study at Bossou that shows chimpanzees select nuts which can be readily cracked, based on their age (Sakura &amp; Matsuzawa, 1991; Ethology).</p><p>We acknowledge that we are limited in the extent to which we can control for interannual variation in ecology with our available data. However, we highlight why interannual variability is unlikely to fully explain our results (see lines 551-580 and response to comments from Reviewer 1). We also highlight in our limitations section that future studies should (where possible) aim to collect more ecological data to account for possible confounds more rigorously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Both individual personality (especially neophilia versus neophobia; e.g., Forss &amp; Willems, 2022) and motivation factors (Tennie &amp; Call, 2023) are further confounds that can contribute to a more valid interpretation of the patterns found. To draw any conclusions about age-related changes in diet and food preferences, we would need to have data on the overall food intake/preferences of the individuals and the food availability in the home range. The authors refer briefly to this limitation, but the implications for the interpretation of the data are not sufficiently underlined (e.g., for the relevance of age-related decline in stone tool-use ability for individual survival).</p></disp-quote><p>In our discussion, we highlight that multiple aging factors may influence apes’ dietary preferences and motivations to attend experimental (and perhaps also naturally-occurring) nut cracking sites (see lines 397-443 and 542-550). We do not believe that neophobia is a likely driver underlying our results, given that the outdoor laboratory has been used to collect data for many decades, including over a decade prior to the first field season in which data were sampled for our study (now highlighted in lines 692-694). In addition, previous studies at Bossou have determined that the outdoor laboratory is visited with comparable frequency to naturallyoccurring nut cracking sites, which makes any form of novelty bias unlikely (this information is now included in our methods, see lines 397-400, and also 687-689).</p><p>We agree that further information is required about foraging behaviours across the home range to understand changes in attendance at the outdoor laboratory, and have now provided more clarity on this within the limitations section of our discussion 542-550. In our discussion of individual survivability, we state clearly that we cannot make a conclusion about how changes in tool use influence survival with the available data, and assert that this would require data across the home range (see lines 627-638). We agree that future research is needed to assess whether changes in tool use would influence survivability, and also suggest that it may not be survival-relevant; instead changes in tool use with aging may simply be a litmus test for detecting more generalized senescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Generally speaking, there is a lack of consideration for temporal variation in ecological factors. As a control for these, Howard-Spink and colleagues have examined behavioral data for younger individuals from Bossou in the same years, to ostensibly show that patterns in older adults are different from patterns in younger adults, which is fair given the available data. Nonetheless, they seem to focus mostly on the start and end points and not patterns that occur in between. For example, there is a curious drop in attendance rate for all individuals in the 2008 season, the implications of which are not discussed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, when examining the attendance rates of older individuals over sampled field seasons, we used the attendance rates of younger individuals as a control. However, we do not run this analysis using start and end points only. Attendance rates were included in our model across the full range of sample field seasons. However, as the key result here is an interaction term between age cohort (old) and the field season (scaled about the mean), we supplement this significant statistical result with a digestible comparison of attendance rates between the first and last field season, to give a general sense of effect size. We have clarified that all data were used in our model (see line 229, and also the legend for Table 2), and in this section we also provide all key model outputs and signpost where the full model output can be found in the supplementary materials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As far as attendance, Howard-Spink and colleagues also discuss how this might be explained by changes in social standing in later life (i.e., chimpanzees move to the fringes of the social network and become less likely to visit gathering sites). This is not senescence in the sense of physiological and cognitive decline with older age. Instead, the reduced attendance due to changes in social standing seems rather to exacerbate signs of aging rather than be an indicator of it itself. The authors also mention a flu-like epidemic that caused the death of 5 individuals; the subsequent population decline and related changes in demography also warrant more discussion and characterization in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adapted this part of the discussion to make it clear that social aging is not necessarily equivalent to physiological and cognitive aging. We have also clarified in this section the changes in demography at Bossou during our study, which may have further impacted social behaviors (see lines 423-443).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Understandably, some of these issues cannot be evaluated or corrected with the presented dataset. Nonetheless, these undermine how certain and/or deterministic their conclusions can really be considered. Howard-Spink et al. have not strongly 'demonstrated' the validity of relationships between the variables of the study. If anything, their cursory observations provide us with methods to apply and hypotheses to test in future studies. It is likely that with higher-resolution datasets, the individual variability in age-related decline in tool-use abilities will be replicated. For now, this can be considered a starting point, which will hopefully inspire future attempts to research these questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. We have adapted our manuscript to highlight that we agree that it serves a starting point for answering these valuable questions; however, we do feel that we can contribute meaningful evidence that it is likely aging effects underlying the findings in our data (see responses above). We agree with the reviewer that further study is needed to understand these questions in more detail, and have tried to ensure that our conclusions are suitably tempered, and the recommendations for research are heavily encouraged to build on our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Falótico, T., Valença, T., Verderane, M. &amp; Fogaça, M.

As many in the Public Review, the changes in social standing according to age are not necessarily a case of senescence in the very sense of physiological or cognitive changes of the individual. This seems to have had an effect on attendance rates, which then could have been a driver of behavioral changes and even cognitive decline as ostensibly measured by the other variables. The social impact of aging should be mentioned in the Introduction (it is not currently) and the social and physiological/cognitive effects of aging should be separated in the Discussion. You can then discuss more clearly how the former via other behavioral changes can accelerate the latter (or not).</p></disp-quote><p>We take the point raised about social aging. Integrating information about social aging into the introduction was challenging without disrupting the flow of the paper; however, we have included these valuable points in the discussion (see lines 423-443). We now structure this section to clearly distinguish social aging, and discuss how, in tandem with changes in demography at Bossou, it may have influenced rates of attendance to the outdoor laboratory over the years. We do not go into detail about how social aging may interact with physiological or cognitive effects of aging, as we cannot support this with the available data, however we highlight at the end of this paragraph how all of these possible factors require further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the present study, it will either be impossible or impractical to gather data on the yearly ecological conditions, contextualized dietary preferences, individual personalities, etc., so I would not ask that you do so. It is important, however, to temper some of the claims being made in the manuscript about what you have 'determined' about the nature of senescence in chimpanzees and to be more transparent about the limitations and potential confounds when interpreting the data. To avoid repetition, the key points can be found in the Public Review under 'Weaknesses'.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s understanding of the limitations of our study. Some of these factors – such as individual personalities and dietary preferences – are addressed somewhat by our use of long-term data at the level of the individual, particularly in the analyses of efficiency, where we model individuals’ behaviors compared to those in earlier years offers an individuallybespoke control. However, there are other ecological variables of possible importance that we cannot evaluate. We now address several of these points raised by reviewers in the discussion, to ensure transparency of reporting (see limitations section of our discussion, and results to the comments provided by Reviewer 1, and our responses to points raised in the Public Review). We have also tempered some of the phrasing surrounding our conclusions, where we say that this is the first evidence that aging can impact chimpanzee tool use, we also highlight the need for an assortment of further studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the integration of the coula nut-cracking data is not well-executed as it stands. I would recommend that they collect and analyze equivalent behavioral data from the other years where coula nuts were provided. By examining only one season of coula nut-cracking, we cannot contextualize the data to past seasons; there is no sense in comparing one season of coula nut-cracking (i.e., in a sense of efficiency) to roughly contemporary seasons of palm-nut cracking due to, as you describe, differences in physical properties of the nuts. If you are not able to collect the additional data and carry out the requisite analysis, then I would recommend that the coula nut-related sections be removed from the manuscript, so that it does not detract from the logical flow of arguments and distract from the other data, which is more logically-attuned to your research questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this from the main manuscript. We have decided to include the information surrounding coula nut cracking in the supplementary materials, as this information is still relevant to the findings of our study, and may interest some readers. However, we have phrased this information to make it clear that further data is needed to compare coula nut cracking across years.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These criticisms do not subtract from the (potential) value or importance of the work for the field. This is, of course, an important contribution to an understudied topic.
