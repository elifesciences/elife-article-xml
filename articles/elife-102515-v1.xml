(NEPs) undergoes adaptive reprogramming to replenish granule cell progenitors that die. Here, we investigate how the microenvironment of the injured cerebellum changes upon injury and contributes to the regenerative potential of normally gliogenic-NEPs and their adaptive reprogramming. Single-cell transcriptomic and bulk chromatin accessibility analyses of the NEPs from injured neonatal cerebella compared to controls show a temporary increase in cellular processes involved in responding to reactive oxygen species (ROS), a known damage-associated molecular pattern. Analysis of ROS levels in cerebellar tissue confirms a transient increase 1 day after injury at postnatal day 1, overlapping with the peak cell death in the cerebellum. In a transgenic mouse line that ubiquitously overexpresses human mitochondrial catalase (mCAT), ROS is reduced 1 day after injury to the granule cell progenitors, and we demonstrate that several steps in the regenerative process of NEPs are curtailed, leading to reduced cerebellar growth. We also provide preliminary evidence that microglia are involved in one step of adaptive reprogramming by regulating NEP replenishment of the granule cell precursors. Collectively, our results highlight that changes in the tissue microenvironment regulate multiple steps in adaptive reprogramming of NEPs upon death of cerebellar granule cell progenitors at birth, highlighting the instructive roles of microenvironmental signals during regeneration of the neonatal brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Nestin-expressing progenitors</kwd><kwd>NEPs</kwd><kwd>granule cell progenitors</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS092096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joyner</surname><given-names>Alexandra L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS112605-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bayin</surname><given-names>N Sumru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/227294</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bayin</surname><given-names>N Sumru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA08748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joyner</surname><given-names>Alexandra L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGS\R1\231143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bayin</surname><given-names>N Sumru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

An important factor underlying the effectiveness of regenerative responses to an injury is the plasticity of the stem/progenitor cells in a tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>). The degree to which the microenvironment and specific cell types within it provide pro- or anti-regenerative factors is highly context dependent. The neonatal mouse cerebellum has a remarkable capacity to regenerate cells ablated around birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wojcinski et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayin et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman and Anderson, 1971</xref>). Thus, the cerebellum provides an ideal system to study the roles that signals in the microenvironment play in key steps of the repair process in the brain.</p><p>The cerebellum is a folded hindbrain structure that is critical for motor coordination. It also participates in higher-order social and cognitive behaviors through its circuit connections with all other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salman and Tsai, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomlinson et al., 2013</xref>). Compared to the rest of the brain, the cerebellum has protracted development, as its major growth occurs during the first 2 weeks after birth in mice and at least 6 months surrounding birth in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altman and Bayer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rakic and Sidman, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dobbing and Sands, 1973</xref>). This timing of the major growth of the cerebellum makes it susceptible to injury around birth. Indeed, cerebellar hypoplasia is the second leading risk factor for autism spectrum disorders, and cerebellar injury around birth can have devastating outcomes and significant effects on subsequent quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stoodley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to better understand the regenerative processes that allow repair of the cerebellum.</p><p>All the cell types in the cerebellum are derived from two progenitor zones, the embryonic rhombic lip and the ventricular zone that give rise to the excitatory neurons, or the inhibitory neurons and glia, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joyner and Bayin, 2022</xref>). During postnatal growth, the rhombic lip-derived granule cell precursors (GCPs) cover the surface of the cerebellum in a structure named the external granule layer (EGL) and continue to proliferate in a sonic hedgehog (SHH) dependent manner for 2 weeks after birth in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wechsler-Reya and Scott, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McMahon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corrales et al., 2006</xref>). Following their exit from the cell cycle, the granule cells (GCs) migrate inward to form the internal granule layer (IGL). Other SHH-dependent progenitor populations of the neonatal cerebellum are either gliogenic Nestin-expressing progenitors (NEPs) that express SOX2 and generate astroglia (astrocytes and Bergman glia) or neurogenic-NEPs that generate late-born interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayin et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerrato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parmigiani et al., 2015</xref>). Gliogenic-NEPs reside either in the Bergmann glia layer (BgL) intermixed with Purkinje cells and generate Bergmann glia (Bg) and astrocytes, or in the white matter (WM) in the center of the lobules (folds) and generate astrocytes. Neurogenic-NEPs are restricted to the WM and produce interneurons that migrate outward to the outermost molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayin et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Luca et al., 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, when the GCPs are killed upon injury soon after birth, the gliogenic-NEPs in the BgL (BgL-NEPs) undergo adaptive reprogramming to generate GCPs and replenish the EGL via a transitory cellular state that involves upregulation of the neurogenic gene <italic>Ascl1</italic> to promote a glial-to-neural fate switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wojcinski et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayin et al., 2021</xref>). Adaptive reprogramming involves multiple sequential stages starting with increased proliferation of BgL-NEPs, then a fate switch to neuronal progenitors, migration to the site of injury (EGL), and acquisition of a GCP identity. The full repertoire of injury-induced signals that initiate and govern adaptive reprogramming remains to be discovered.</p><p>In the adult brain, numerous cell types communicate and provide a concerted response to injury, including astrocytes, microglia (macrophages of the brain), and stem cells of the neurogenic niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frik et al., 2018</xref>). The timelines of the cellular responses of each cell type to injury – cell death, activation of microglia, reactive gliosis, proliferation, scar formation, and cellular remodeling – have been delineated for specific adult brain injuries, particularly in the cerebral cortex. For example, upon traumatic brain injury, cells release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which act as an inflammatory stimulus and activate microglia that can lead to gliosis, eventually causing neurotoxicity and scarring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Donat et al., 2017</xref>). However, the cellular composition and microenvironment of the early postnatal brain are very different from the adult. In the neonatal cerebellum, microglia are immature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2019</xref>) and are still being generated, and NEPs and GCPs are actively proliferating and producing astroglia and neurons. Therefore, the existing knowledge on how adult brain cells react to injury might not apply to the neonatal cerebellum. For example, in the spinal cord, while neonatal microglia and astrocytes facilitate scarless repair, the same cells in the adult promote scarring upon spinal cord injury in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2020</xref>). It is thus important to study the microenvironment of the neonatal brain during repair to determine what factors promote or inhibit regeneration.</p><p>Dying cells release many factors, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) that activate signaling cascades in neighboring cells. However, little is known about how these signals regulate brain repair, especially during development. The level of ROS during homeostasis is regulated by metabolic processes and typically is increased following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niethammer, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, ROS can directly react with proteins that regulate proliferation, viability, quiescence, differentiation, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bigarella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tan and Suda, 2018</xref>). Thus, ROS are considered key signaling molecules that participate in the crosstalk between progenitor cell fate decisions and metabolic switches in a context- and cell type-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bigarella et al., 2014</xref>). One significant mechanism by which ROS signaling is implicated during inflammatory responses following an injury is through the activation of microglia, which in turn can lead to more ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). This process is critical as it can potentially promote repair. However, the role of ROS signaling during adaptive reprogramming of NEPs following neonatal cerebellar injury remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we first delineate the sequential changes in the microenvironment upon injury (focused irradiation) to the mouse hindbrain at postnatal day 1 (P1). We then demonstrate a requirement for a transient increase in ROS levels at ~24 hr post-injury for cerebellar regeneration. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) analyses revealed increased ROS signaling compared to controls that peaks 24 hr after injury in NEPs, demonstrating that ROS is an acute signal associated with the NEP response to GCP death. A functional role of ROS signaling was established using a transgene (mCAT) that expresses the human mCAT which can reduce ROS levels broadly. Several key steps in adaptive reprogramming were abrogated in mCAT mice leading to reduced replenishment of the EGL and a smaller adult cerebellum. Finally, we show that the density of microglia is reduced at P5 in irradiated mCAT mice compared to controls and provide preliminary evidence that microglia play a role in the step of replenishing the EGL with BgL-derived GCPs during adaptive reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All the mouse experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) (protocol no. 07-01-001).

Indeed, many of the significant GO terms associated with the genes upregulated in gliogenic-NEPs with injury were related to response to irradiation, DNA damage, the p53 pathway, and ROS metabolic processes, whereas many of the significant GO terms associated with the genes upregulated in the nonIR cells at P2 were related to metabolic processes (p-value≤0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>).

Collectively, these results indicate that injury induces significant and overlapping transcriptional changes in NEPs and GCPs. The gliogenic- and neurogenic-NEP subtypes transiently upregulate stress response genes upon GCP death, and an overall increase in ROS signaling is observed in the injured cerebella.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Injury induces changes in NEP chromatin landscape at P2</title><p>We next tested whether GCP death at birth induces changes to the chromatin landscape of NEPs that reflect the altered gene expression observed with scRNA-seq, by performing bulk ATAC-seq on FACS-isolated CFP+ cells from P2 control and injured Nes-Cfp pup cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). P2 was chosen as it is the stage when GCPs contribute the least to the total Nes-CFP+ FACS population and to identify the immediate effects of the injury on NEP chromatin. Analysis of differentially open chromatin showed that injury induces major changes to the chromatin landscape of the NEPs (1168 differentially open regions, adjusted p-value&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>).

However, not all genes in the accessible areas were differentially expressed in the scRNA-seq data. While some of this could be due to the detection limits of scRNA-seq, further analysis is required to assess the mechanisms of how the differentially accessible chromatin affects transcription. Known motif analysis in the regions with increased accessibility upon injury showed enrichment for binding motifs of the JUN/AP1 transcriptional complex (p-value = 10<sup>–14</sup>, % of target sequences with motif = 15%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">Figure 1—source data 5</xref>), which is known to act in response to cellular stress and be activated by ROS. In addition, the DNA binding site for FOXO3, a transcription factor that regulates ROS levels, had increased chromatin accessibility (p-value = 0.001, % of target sequences with motif = 22.41%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">Figure 1—source data 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Filosto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auten and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagenbuchner et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, linkages between the genes in differentially open regions identified by ATAC-seq and the associated GO terms revealed an active transcriptional network involved in regulating cell death and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Furthermore, some of the genes involved in this response, such as <italic>Ppara</italic>, <italic>Egln3</italic>, <italic>Foxo3</italic>, <italic>Jun,</italic> and <italic>Nos1ap,</italic> have been implicated as upregulated with increased ROS levels or involved in ROS signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devchand et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaelin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagenbuchner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Filosto et al., 2003</xref>). In summary, our ATAC-seq data analysis along with the scRNA-seq provides strong evidence that irradiation causes increased ROS signaling in the BgL-NEPs upon GCP death by inducing transcriptional and epigenetic changes within 1 day after injury (P2). In addition, genes related to cell survival and death, cellular stress, and DNA damage are upregulated in NEPs shortly upon injury, possibly as a means to overcome the cellular effects of injury and induce adaptive reprogramming of NEPs to replenish the lost cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Transient increase in cerebellar ROS during apoptosis of GCPs</title><p>To validate that the transient increase in expression of genes associated with cellular stress and ROS signaling is due to an increase in ROS upon cerebellar injury, we quantified ROS levels in whole cerebellum samples using a mitochondrial superoxide indicator (MitoSOX) via flow cytometry.

We first analyzed the astrocyte marker GFAP, since it is generally upregulated soon after brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>). Most astrocytes, including the specialized Bg, express GFAP in the adult cerebellum, but the cells are generated by gliogenic-NEPs during the first 2 weeks after birth in mice. We therefore determined the normal location and timing of initiation of GFAP expression in these cells during postnatal cerebellum development. GFAP was first detected in rare astrocytes at P2 located in the WM below the lobules, with strong expression in all WM astrocytes at P5 and later stages (P8 and P12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>, observed in n=4 mice/stage). In contrast, GFAP expression in astrocytes in the developing IGL and in the glial processes of Bg that project through the molecular layer (ML) and EGL was not detectable until P5 and was much stronger at P8 and P12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Interestingly, after injury at birth, GFAP expression was prematurely upregulated in the WM astrocytes below the lobules at P2 and in the remaining astrocytes at P5, including in the fibers of Bg that extend through the ML and EGL, compared to nonIR cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–H</xref>, observed in n=4 mice/stage). GFAP expression was similar in all glia in both conditions at P8 and P12. These results reveal that astrocytes and Bg react to EGL injury caused by irradiation at P1 by initiating GFAP expression earlier than normal in the deep WM, and then around the IGL and in Bg.</p><p>The macrophages of the brain, microglia, are generated in the early embryo but their main increase in cell number occurs during neonatal development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammond et al., 2018</xref>). We found that nearly all microglia were located in the WM of the cerebellum, and that the density of IBA1+ microglia in the WM increased between P2 (235.1±18.3 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) and P3 (344.3±53.1 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) and then was maintained at P5 (350.4±40.2 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Since the area of the cerebellum is increasing between P2 and P5, active microglia production and/or infiltration must continue to occur between P2 and P5. As expected, after irradiation, the density of microglia in the injured EGL was significantly increased (~3-fold) at P2 but not at P3 or P5 compared to controls (p=0.0331, n=4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L–N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

To reduce the level of ROS, we utilized an mCAT transgenic mouse line that contains an insertion of sequences that expresse the human mCAT in most cells from a <italic>CMV</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schriner et al., 2005</xref>). The transgene is expected to reduce mitochondrial ROS levels in all cells by catalyzing the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, hence protecting the cells from oxidative damage. We confirmed that mCAT protein is expressed throughout the cerebellum using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of cerebellar sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). MitoSOX flow cytometry revealed a significant decrease in ROS in the cerebella of mCAT mice 1 day after irradiation (P2) (p=0.0163, n≥8) and not at P3 or P5 compared to control IR mice and no baseline decrease in ROS at any stage in nonIR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

First, we analyzed the replenishment of the EGL by BgL-NEPs in vermis lobules 3–5, since our previous work showed that these lobules have a prominent defect. Interestingly, we found that although the thickness of the EGL in IR mice of both genotypes was similarly reduced compared to nonIR mice at P5 (p=0.0041 control and p=0.0005 mCAT; n≥4) by P8, the control EGL was a similar thickness to the control nonIR, whereas the thickness of the mCAT IR EGL was significantly reduced compared to mCAT nonIR mice (p=0.035, n=4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). A key regenerative process that contributes to the expansion of the EGL following injury is the migration of BgL-NEPs to the EGL.

Since macrophages and cerebellar microglia are dependent on colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) for their survival, we administered PLX5622, a small molecule inhibitor of CSF receptor 1 (CSFR1), to pups every day from P0 to P5 (PLX treatment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tan et al., 2021</xref>). As expected, IBA1+ cells were significantly decreased in the cerebellum of PLX-treated mice at P5 compared to their controls, both nonIR and IR (p=0.0015 and p=0.0059, n=3 and n=5, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B-E</xref>).

In contrast, the density of SOX2+ cells in the BgL, corresponding to the gliogenic BgL-NEPs, was unchanged in the PLX-treated and control mice, whether irradiated or not, suggesting that the decrease in expansion of BgL-NEPs caused by ROS is not mediated by microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). When mice were treated with PLX from P0 to P8 and allowed to age to P30, we found the cerebellar vermis section area was not decreased in PLX-treated IR mice compared to IR controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>). Thus, reducing the density of IBA1+ microglia/macrophages in neonatal mice reduces the recruitment of Nes-CFP+ cells to the EGL at P5 but does not have a long-term significant impact on regeneration of the cerebellum.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrate that a transient increase in ROS signaling after cerebellar injury to the EGL is critical for adaptive reprogramming and full recovery of cerebellar growth. ROS likely acts as an alarm signal shortly after injury. scRNA-seq at P1–5 and bulk ATAC-seq at P2 of NEPs following targeted irradiation at P1 revealed a rapid increase in transcriptional and epigenetic changes associated with upregulation of ROS and stress-related pathways in NEPs that peaked at P2. A transient upregulation in ROS at P2 was confirmed using flow cytometry and found to correlate with the timing of cell death in the EGL 1 day after irradiation. By reducing mitochondrial ROS levels across all cell types at P2 using an mCAT transgene, we uncovered that ROS is required for several steps of adaptive reprogramming of BgL-NEPs. In addition, we found that microglia are reduced in injured mCAT pups, which is consistent with prior evidence that ROS can trigger immune cell recruitment in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mehl et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, temporary depletion of microglia caused a reduction in the number of NEPs that migrate into the EGL at P5 following injury at P1, but no long-term reduction of cerebellar size. Thus, we identified key transcriptomic and epigenomic changes in cerebellar NEPs upon GCP ablation at birth and discovered roles for the tissue microenvironment, especially ROS and a more limited role of microglia during neonatal cerebellum regeneration.</p><p>scRNA-seq analysis of NEPs from nonIR (P1–3, P5) and nonIR (P2, P3, P5) showed an increase in genes associated with stress responses after irradiation in both the gliogenic and neurogenic subpopulations, but not in the GCPs. Furthermore, an increase in ROS signaling was detected 1 day after injury (P2) in all three lineages. The injury-induced ROS and stress-related gene signatures were not observed in the later P3+5 gliogenic- and neurogenic-NEPs, suggesting that the increase in ROS levels is an early injury-induced signal affecting the NEP transcriptome. Our bulk ATAC-seq data generated at P2 revealed that the open chromatin regions in the IR NEPs were enriched for transcription factor binding motifs related to ROS signaling and stress-induced transcription factors such as FOXO3 and AP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">Figure 1—source data 5</xref>). Thus, cerebellar injury during development induces transcriptional and epigenomic signatures in the NEPs, and ROS signaling could be a key driver of NEP adaptive reprogramming. Our results are in line with other regeneration systems where a temporary increase in ROS is observed upon cell death or injury and is considered to be a DAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niethammer, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, although both gliogenic- and neurogenic-NEPs showed induction of cellular stress-related genes upon injury, upregulation of ROS signaling and related genes appeared greater in the <italic>Hopx</italic>-expressing gliogenic-NEPs that undergo adaptive reprogramming. Whether the upregulation of ROS signaling in the BgL-NEPs is due to BgL-NEPs being in proximity to the dying GCPs after injury or their direct contact due to their radial projections remains to be determined. The ability of BgL-NEPs to respond to GCP death via upregulating ROS signaling and impaired regeneration upon reduction of ROS levels shows that ROS signaling is involved in triggering adaptive reprogramming upon injury.</p><p>The cellular composition of the neonatal cerebellum is dramatically different from the adult. During the early postnatal period, we found that astrocytes in the WM below the lobules are the first to initiate GFAP expression at P2 and that by P5 all astrocytes express a high level of GFAP. In contrast, Bg express a low level of GFAP at P5 and reach a high level by P8. Interestingly, we found that injury leads to an increase in the level of GFAP expression in each type of astroglia compared to controls when they first initiate expression, deep WM astrocytes at P2 and Bg (and all astrocytes) at P5. Once adaptive reprogramming is nearing completion (P8), the GFAP levels remained similar in all astroglia of nonIR and IR cerebella. These results suggest that the neonatal astrocytes respond to injury differently than in the adult where GFAP upregulation is observed immediately after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>), since Bg and astrocytes in the lobules have a delayed response to injury with GFAP not being upregulated for several days. Furthermore, at birth, the microglia have not fully expanded in number in the cerebellum, and previous scRNA-seq showed that the neonatal and adult microglia are transcriptionally distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hammond et al., 2019</xref>). Perhaps neonatal microglia are anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative upon injury in neonates, in contrast to adult microglia, where upon traumatic brain injury, they can inhibit regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Donat et al., 2017</xref>). Collectively, the differences in glial responses to injury in the neonatal cerebellum and adult brain likely contribute to the permissiveness of the neonatal cerebellum to regeneration. Details of the molecular changes that the neonatal cerebellar microglia/macrophages and astrocytes undergo upon GCP injury and their molecular crosstalk with NEPs remain to be determined.</p><p>We demonstrated the significance of ROS activation in the NEP reprogramming process using an mCAT transgenic mouse line in which human catalase (CAT) is expressed in mitochondria, a protein that can lead to a reduction in hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and thus lower ROS. However, in mCAT neonatal cerebella, we found that the percentage of MitoSOX high cells was comparable to control mice under nonIR conditions. Importantly, however, 1 day after irradiation at P1 when the percentage of MitoSOX high cells increases in control IR mice, the mCAT transgene reduces the percentage of MitoSOX high cells, such that it remains at the baseline nonIR mCAT level. Therefore, human CAT expression in mitochondria in this model inhibits the injury-induced increase in ROS levels without affecting the homeostatic production of superoxide. Of possible relevance, in this mouse model, the observed change in ROS levels is likely global, impacting all cell types. The specific impact of increased mCAT in BgL-NEPs or microglia on their recruitment and function after an injury remains to be determined with new cell type-specific tools.</p><p>Our experiments depleting microglia using PLX5622 indicate that microglia/macrophages are involved in the regeneration of the EGL following irradiation. Previous studies have demonstrated a dual role of microglia in promoting and inhibiting regenerative processes within the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Our data support the idea that neonatal microglia are involved in the adaptive reprogramming of NEPs to GCPs by promoting their replenishment of GCPs in the EGL. While the direct mechanisms remain to be discovered, given the small size of the lobules and disruption of the cytoarchitecture after injury, it might be possible for secreted factors from the WM microglia to reach the BgL NEPs. Alternatively, there could be a relay system through an intermediate cell type closer to the microglia. PLX treatment for 8 days after irradiation did not reduce the later growth of the injured cerebellum. One possibility is that after the cessation of PLX administration, regeneration proceeds normally. Additionally, regenerative processes that act in parallel to microglial signaling are likely required.</p><p>Collectively, we have delineated the spatiotemporal cellular changes in the cerebellar glial microenvironment upon ablation of GCPs at birth and highlight ROS signaling as a key stimulator of adaptive reprogramming of NEPs. The details of how DAMP-glia-progenitor crosstalk is orchestrated remain to be untangled. Understanding how microenvironmental responses shape repair processes is a crucial first step toward developing strategies to promote regeneration.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All the mouse experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) (protocol no. 07-01-001).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-102515-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The scRNA-seq data was submitted to ArrayExpress (Accession E-MTAB-13353).

The authors should validate whether Nes and CFP mRNAs are enriched in the sorted cells; if not, they should discuss the potential pitfalls in sampling bias or artifacts that may have affected the dataset, impacting interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous work, we thoroughly assessed the transgene using RNA in situ hybridization for <italic>Cfp</italic>, immunofluorescent analysis for CFP and scRNA-seq analysis for <italic>Cfp</italic> transcripts (Bayin <italic>et al</italic>., <italic>Science Adv</italic>. 2021, Fig. S1-2)(1), and characterized the diversity within the NEP populations of the cerebellum. Our present scRNA-seq data also confirms that <italic>Nes</italic> transcripts are expressed in all the NEP subtypes. A feature plot for <italic>Nes</italic> expression has been added to the revised manuscript (Fig 1E), as well as a sentence explaining the results. Of note, since this data was generated from FACS-isolated CFP+ cells, the perdurance of the protein allows for the detection of immediate progeny of <italic>Nes</italic>-expressing cells, even in cells where <italic>Nes</italic> is not expressed once cells are differentiated. Finally, oligodendrocyte progenitors, perivascular cells, some rare microglia and ependymal cells have been demonstrated to express <italic>Nes</italic> in the central nervous system; therefore, detecting small groups of these cells is expected (2-4). We have added the following sentence (lines 391-394):</p><p>“Detection of <italic>Nes</italic> mRNA confirmed that the transgene reflects endogenous <italic>Nes</italic> expression in progenitors of many lineages, and also that the perdurance of CFP protein in immediate progeny of <italic>Nes</italic>-expressing cells allowed the isolation of these cells by FACS (Figure 1E)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should de-emphasize that ROS signaling and related gene upregulation exclusively in gliogenic NEPs. Genes such as Cdkn1a, Phlda3, Ass1, and Bax are identified as differentially expressed in neurogenic NEPs and granule cell progenitors (GCPs), with Ass1 absent in GCPs. According to Table S4, gene ontology (GO) terms related to ROS metabolic processes are also enriched in gliogenic NEPs, neurogenic NEPs, and GCPs.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer requested, we have de-emphasized that ROS signaling is preferentially upregulated in gliogenic NEPs, since we agree with the reviewer that there is some evidence for similar transcriptional signatures in neurogenic NEPs and GCPs. We added the following (lines 429-531):</p><p>“Some of the DNA damage and apoptosis related genes that were upregulated in IR gliogenic-NEPs (<italic>Cdkn1a</italic>, <italic>Phlda3</italic>, <italic>Bax</italic>) were also upregulated in the IR neurogenic-NEPs and GCPs at P2 (Supplementary Figure 2B-E).”</p><p>And we edited the last few sentences of the section to state (lines 453-459):</p><p>“Interestingly, we did not observe significant enrichment for GO terms associated with cellular stress response in the GCPs that survived the irradiation compared to controls, despite significant enrichment for ROS signaling related GO-terms (Table S4). Collectively, these results indicate that injury induces significant and overlapping transcriptional changes in NEPs and GCPs. The gliogenic- and neurogenic-NEP subtypes transiently upregulate stress response genes upon GCP death, and an overall increase in ROS signaling is observed in the injured cerebella.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors need to justify the selection of only the anterior lobe for EGL replenishment and microglia quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for asking for this clarification. Our previous publications on regeneration of the EGL by NEPs have all involved quantification of these lobules, thus we think it is important to stay with the same lobules. For reasons we have not explored, the phenotype is most prominent in these lobules, that is why they were originally chosen. We edited the following sentence (lines 578-579):</p><p>“First, we analyzed the replenishment of the EGL by BgL-NEPs in vermis lobules 3-5, since our previous work showed that these lobules have a prominent defect.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 1K: The figure presents linkages between genes and GO terms as a network but does not depict a gene network. The terminology should be corrected accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the terminology and added the following (lines 487-489):</p><p>“Finally, linkages between the genes in differentially open regions identified by ATAC-seq and the associated GO-terms revealed an active transcriptional network involved in regulating cell death and apoptosis (Figure 1K).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 1H and S2: The x-axis appears to display raw p-values rather than log10(p.value) as indicated. The x-axis should ideally show -log10(p.adjust), beginning at zero. The current format may misleadingly suggest that the ROS GO term has the lowest p-values.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for the mistake. The data represents raw p-values and the x-axis has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Genes such as Ppara, Egln3, Foxo3, Jun, and Nos1ap were identified by bulk ATAC-seq based on proximity to peaks, not by scRNA-seq. Without additional expression data, caution is needed when presenting these genes as direct evidence of ROS involvement in NEPs.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the text to discuss the discrepancies between the analyses. While some of this could be due to the lower detection limits in the scRNA-seq, it also highlights that chromatin accessibility is not a direct readout for expression levels and further analysis is needed. Nevertheless, both scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq have identified similar mechanisms, and our mutant analysis confirmed our hypothesis that an increase in ROS levels underlies repair, further increasing the confidence in our analyses. Further investigation is needed to understand the downstream mechanisms. We added the following sentence (lines 478-481):</p><p>“However, not all genes in the accessible areas were differentially expressed in the scRNA-seq data. While some of this could be due to the detection limits of scRNA-seq, further analysis is required to assess the mechanisms of how the differentially accessible chromatin affects transcription.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors should annotate cell identities for the different clusters in Table S2.</p></disp-quote><p>All cell types have been annotated in Table S2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Reiterative clustering analysis reveals distinct subpopulations among gliogenic and neurogenic NEPs. Could the authors clarify the identities of these subclusters? Can we distinguish the gliogenic NEPs in the Bergmann glia layer from those in the white matter?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this clarification. As shown in our previous studies, we can not distinguish between the gliogenic NEPs in the Bergmann glia layer and the white matter based on scRNA-seq, but expression of the Bergmann glia marker <italic>Gdf10</italic> suggests that a large proportion of the cells in the <italic>Hopx</italic>+ clusters are in the Bergmann glia layer. The distinction within the major subpopulations that we characterized (<italic>Hopx</italic>-, <italic>Ascl1</italic>-expressing NEPs and GCPs) are driven by their proliferative/maturation status as we previously observed. We have included a detailed annotation of all the clusters in Table S2, as requested and a UMAP for <italic>mKi57</italic> expression in Fig 1E. We have clarified this in the following sentence (lines 383-385):</p><p>“These groups of cells were further subdivided into molecularly distinct clusters based on marker genes and their cell cycle profiles or developmental stages (Figure 1D, Table S2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) In the Methods section, the authors mention filtering out genes with fewer than 10 counts. They should specify if these genes were used as background for enrichment analysis. Background gene selection is critical, as it influences the functional enrichment of gene sets in the list.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, the approach used has been added to the Methods section of the revised paper. Briefly, the background genes used by the <italic>goseq</italic> function are the same genes used for the probability weight function (<italic>nullp</italic>). The <italic>mm8</italic> genome annotation was used in the <italic>nullp</italic> function, and all annotated genes were used as background genes to compute GO term enrichment. The following was added (lines 307-308):</p><p>“The background genes used to compute the GO term enrichment includes all genes with gene symbol annotations within mm8.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Figure S1C: The authors could consider using bar plots to better illustrate cell composition differences across conditions and replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have included bar plots in Fig. S1D-F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Figures 4-6: It remains unclear how the white matter microglia contribute to the recruitment of BgL-NEPs to the EGL, as the mCAT-mediated microglia loss data are all confined to the white matter.</p></disp-quote><p>We have thought about the question and had initially quantified the microglia in the white matter and the rest of the lobules (excluding the EGL) separately. However, there are very few microglia outside the white matter in each section, thus it is not possible to obtain reliable statistical data on such a small population. We therefore did not include the cells in the analysis. We have added this point in the main text (line 548).</p><p>“As a possible explanation for how white matter microglia could influence NEP behaviors, given the small size of the lobules and how the cytoarchitecture is disrupted after injury, we think it is possible that secreted factors from the white matter microglia could reach the BgL NEPs. Alternatively, there could be a relay system through an intermediate cell type closer to the microglia.” We have added these ideas to the Discussion of the revised paper (lines 735-738).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have previously shown that the mouse neonatal cerebellum can regenerate damage to granule cell progenitors in the external granular layer, through reprogramming of gliogenic nestin-expressing progenitors (NEPs).

However, it would require a set of tools that we do not currently have. We did not have enough PLX5622 to perform addition experiments or extend the length of treatment. Plexxikon informed us in 2021 that they were no longer manufacturing PLX5622 because they were focusing on new analogs for in vivo use, and thus we had to use what we had left over from a completed preclinical cancer study. We nevertheless think it is important to publish our preliminary results to spark further experiments by other groups.</p><p>References</p><p>(1) Bayin N. S. Mizrak D., Stephen N. D., Lao Z., Sims P.
