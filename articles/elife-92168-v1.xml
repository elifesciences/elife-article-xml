(<italic>Bd</italic>). Much has been learned about the roles of amphibian skin-produced antimicrobial components and microbiomes in controlling <italic>Bd</italic>, yet almost nothing is known about the roles of skin-resident immune cells in anti-<italic>Bd</italic> defenses. Mammalian mast cells reside within and serve as key immune sentinels in barrier tissues like skin. Accordingly, we investigated the roles of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> frog mast cells during <italic>Bd</italic> infections. Our findings indicate that enrichment of <italic>X. laevis</italic> skin mast cells confers anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection and ameliorates the inflammation-associated skin damage caused by <italic>Bd</italic> infection. This includes a significant reduction in infiltration of <italic>Bd</italic>-infected skin by neutrophils, promoting mucin content within cutaneous mucus glands, and preventing <italic>Bd</italic>-mediated changes to skin microbiomes. Mammalian mast cells are known for their production of the pleiotropic interleukin-4 (IL4) cytokine and our findings suggest that the <italic>X. laevis</italic> IL4 plays a key role in manifesting the effects seen following cutaneous mast cell enrichment. Together, this work underscores the importance of amphibian skin-resident immune cells in anti-<italic>Bd</italic> defenses and illuminates a novel avenue for investigating amphibian hostâchytrid pathogen interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mast cells</kwd><kwd>chytrid fungus</kwd><kwd>amphibian immunity</kwd><kwd>skin immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2131061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muletz-Wolz</surname><given-names>Carly R</given-names></name><name><surname>Grayfer</surname><given-names>Leon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2147466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grayfer</surname><given-names>Leon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2147467</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rollins-Smith</surname><given-names>Louise A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Enriching amphibian, <italic>Xenopus laevis,</italic> cutaneous mast cells confers protection against <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic> chytrid fungus infections.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Catastrophic declines of hundreds of amphibian species across six continents have been causally linked to the chytrid fungi, <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic> (<italic>Bd</italic>) and <italic>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</italic> (<italic>Bsal</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scheele et al., 2019</xref>).

Effectively combating chytrid infections requires a holistic understanding of amphibian cutaneous immune defenses. Research efforts up to this point have focused on antifungal capacities of amphibian skin-produced antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rollins-Smith, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varga et al., 2018</xref>); commensal antifungal products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woodhams et al., 2023</xref>); antifungal properties of mucus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woodhams et al., 2023</xref>), alkaloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">RodrÃ­guez et al., 2017</xref>), and lysozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grogan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rollins-Smith et al., 2009</xref>); as well as the roles of antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Rooij et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ramsey et al., 2010</xref>). Many of these studies suggest that <italic>Bd</italic> exposure can elicit some immune protection through these mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McMahon et al., 2014</xref>). However, the contribution of skin-resident immune cells to amphibian anti-<italic>Bd</italic> defenses remains almost entirely unexplored.</p><p>Mammalian mast cells serve as sentinels of mucosal and connective tissues, including in barrier tissues like skin, where they maintain homeostasis and regulate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sobiepanek et al., 2022</xref>). Other granulocyte-lineage cells such as neutrophils are generally not found in healthy tissues and only extravasate into sites of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hauser et al., 2023</xref>). Consequently, mast cells are among the first immune cells to recognize and respond to skin-infiltrating pathogens. When activated, mast cells release pre-formed and <italic>de novo</italic>-generated immunomodulatory compounds that may serve to elicit, exacerbate, or ameliorate inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sobiepanek et al., 2022</xref>). One of these mast cell-produced mediators, the interleukin-4 (IL4) cytokine dampens inflammation and promotes tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen, 2023</xref>). Cells bearing hallmark mast cell cytology have been reported across a range of non-mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McNeil et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and St John, 2010</xref>), including amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baccari et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, the principal mast cell growth factor, stem cell factor (SCF, KIT ligand), is required for mast cell differentiation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ito et al., 2012</xref>) and is expressed by all vertebrates examined to date.</p><p>Here, we combine comprehensive <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches to define the roles of amphibian (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>) mast cells during <italic>Bd</italic> infections.

Our findings provide the first in-depth functional analyses of these cells in amphibians and explore their protective mechanisms during chytrid infections. This work presents a unique perspective on the evolution of mast cell functionality and will serve as a new avenue to explore ways to counteract the amphibian declines.</p><p>Mammalian mast cells are potent producers of the pleotropic anti-inflammatory interleukin-4 (IL4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babina et al., 2016</xref>) cytokine, and our findings suggest that this is also true of frog mast cells. In mammals, IL4 also plays roles in tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen, 2023</xref>) and mucus production by intestinal goblet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Redpath et al., 2015</xref>), which aids in the âweep and sweepâ pathogen elimination and may contribute to the maintenance of commensal communities in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drago et al., 2024</xref>). This is consistent with our findings, which suggest that IL4 may be a central means by which frog mast cells confer protection against <italic>Bd</italic> by counteracting <italic>Bd</italic>-elicited inflammation, including minimizing neutrophil infiltration, maintaining skin integrity, and promoting mucus production by skin mucus glands. The outcomes of cytokine signaling are critically dependent on timing, location, and context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Redpath et al., 2015</xref>). This possibly explains why administering rIL4 prior to <italic>Bd</italic> challenge results in significant anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection, whereas treating already infected animals with this cytokine did not reduce fungal loads.</p><p>We anticipate that in addition to IL4 production, frog mast cells mediate the observed antifungal protection through a myriad of additional mechanisms. Indeed, we observed elevated expression of antimicrobial peptide genes in the skins of mock-infected mast cell-enriched frogs 10 days after rSCF administration. The fact that we did not see the same expression patterns following <italic>Bd</italic> challenge could potentially reflect the highly immunomodulatory capacities of this pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rollins-Smith and Le Sage, 2021</xref>). Undoubtedly, frog skin-resident mast cells have evolved to contribute to and modulate skin antifungal antimicrobial peptide production just as <italic>Bd</italic> has more than likely coevolved to target this aspect of amphibian skin defenses.</p><p><italic>Bd</italic> infections caused major reductions in bacterial taxa richness, changes in composition and substantial increases in the relative abundance of <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory bacteria early in the infection. Similar changes to microbiome structure occur during experimental <italic>Bd</italic> infections, such as in red-backed salamanders and mountain yellow-legged frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muletz-Wolz et al., 2019</xref>). In turn, progressing <italic>Bd</italic> infections corresponded with a return to baseline levels of <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory bacteria abundance and rebounding microbial richness, albeit with dissimilar communities to those seen in control animals. These temporal changes indicate that amphibian microbiomes are dynamic, as are the effects of <italic>Bd</italic> infections on them. Indeed, <italic>Bd</italic> infections may have long-lasting impacts on amphibian microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jani et al., 2021</xref>), including the possible establishment of âecological memoryâ, resulting in greater adaptation to subsequent pathogen exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woodhams et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Letourneau et al., 2022</xref>). While <italic>Bd</italic> infections manifested in these considerable changes to frog skin microbiome structure, mast cell enrichment appeared to counteract these deleterious effects to skin microbial composition. It will thus be interesting to learn from future studies how frog mast cells impact skin microbiome ecological memory. Presumably, mast cell-mediated mucus production and preservation of skin integrity stabilizes the cutaneous microenvironment during <italic>Bd</italic> infections, thereby ameliorating the <italic>Bd</italic>-mediated microbiome changes. While this work explored the changes in established antifungal flora, we anticipate the mast cell-mediated inhibition of <italic>Bd</italic> may be due to additional, yet unidentified bacterial, viral, and/or fungal taxa. Intriguingly, while mammalian skin mast cell functionality depends on microbiome elicited SCF production by keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), our results indicate frog skin mast cells in turn impact skin microbiome structure and likely their function. It will be interesting to further explore the interdependent nature of amphibian skin microbiomes and resident mast cells.</p><p>In contrast to the protective effects conferred by mast cell enrichment, enrichment of neutrophils resulted in greater <italic>Bd</italic> burdens on frog skins. This suggests neutrophils may lead to heightened inflammation, which is not protective in the context of <italic>Bd</italic> infections. This is consistent with other studies indicating that robust immune responses may be counterproductive to amphibian anti-<italic>Bd</italic> defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellison et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Savage et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Amphibian skin is much thinner and more permeable than those of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varga et al., 2018</xref>), and as such, arguably represents a more penetrable barrier to pathogens. Because mammalian skin is relatively impermeable, mast cells are absent from healthy mammalian epidermises and are instead found exclusively in their dermal layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cowen et al., 1979</xref>). However, mammalian mast cells may infiltrate the skin epidermal layer during diseases such as dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Imayama et al., 1995</xref>). We have shown here and have observed across several classes of amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hauser et al., 2023</xref>) that mast cells are found in both epidermal and dermal layers. This localization has presumably evolved to support the more intimate contact between amphibian skin and their environments. Considering the importance of amphibian cutaneous integrity to their physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larsen, 2021</xref>), it is likely that skin-resident mast cells coevolved to support skin immunity, physiology, and symbiotic microbiota. Ongoing research continues to reveal functional differences between mammalian connective tissue and mucosa-resident mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">West and Bulfone-Paus, 2022</xref>), and we suspect that there is similarly much to learn about the distinct physiological and immune roles of amphibian epidermal and dermal mast cells.</p><p>Mammalian mast cells are thought to arise from two distinct lineages. Fetal-derived progenitors seed peripheral tissues during the neonatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gentek et al., 2018</xref>) and mature into long-lived connective tissue mast cells (CTMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dwyer et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, inducible mucosal mast cells (MMCs) arise from bone marrow-derived mast cell progenitors (MCps) and are recruited to mucosal tissues in response to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bankova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2018</xref>). The connective tissue mast cells are thought to possess significantly greater levels of heparin than bone marrow-derived mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrera-Heredia et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>in vitro</italic> frog bone marrow-derived mast cells possessed substantially lower heparin content than what we observed in the skin-resident and <italic>Bd</italic>-elicited mast cells. Unlike the mammalian skin, frog skin is both a connective tissue and a mucosal barrier, begging the question of how the frog skin mast cells compare to the mammalian CTMCs and MMCs. It is intriguing to consider that frog skin mast cells observed at steady state, following rSCF-enrichment, and recruited/expanded in response to <italic>Bd</italic>, all had substantial heparin levels. Possibly, the expansion of frog skin mast cell numbers in response to both rSCF and <italic>Bd</italic> is facilitated by skin-resident precursors, explaining the high heparin content observed in these populations. Of course, it is equally possible that amphibian mast cell ontogeny and heparin content are not the same as in mammals. It will be invaluable to further explore the origins, fates, and immune roles of distinct frog skin mast cell lineages and subsets.</p><p>It has become apparent that amphibian host-<italic>Bd</italic> interactions are highly complex and multifaceted and susceptibilities to this devastating pathogen markedly differ across amphibian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scheele et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Rooij et al., 2010</xref>). The findings described here emphasize the importance of skin-resident mast cells for successful anti-<italic>Bd</italic> defenses and demonstrate that these immune sentinels are intimately linked to many aspects of frog skin physiology. Our results indicate that when mast cells are enriched, the ensuing changes in the skin allow for greater resistance to <italic>Bd</italic> infection. Presumably, distinct amphibian species have evolved disparate interconnections between their skin mast cells and their cutaneous defenses, as dictated by their respective physiological and environmental pressures. In turn, these species-specific differences likely dictate whether and to what extent the skin-resident mast cells of a given amphibian species recognize and appropriately respond to <italic>Bd</italic> infections. We postulate that such differences may contribute to the disparate susceptibilities of distinct amphibian species to pathogens like chytrid fungi. Greater understanding of these relationships across distinct amphibian species holds promise of harnessing this knowledge toward possible development of preventative and therapeutic strategies against infectious diseases like chytridiomycosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Outbred tadpoles (NF stage 56â60) and 1-year-old (1.5â2â³), mixed-sex <italic>X. laevis</italic> were purchased from <italic>Xenopus</italic> 1 (Dexter, MI).

While there are commercially available kits and reagents for examining mammalian mast cell granule content, most of these do not cross-react with amphibian counterparts. This is especially true of cytokines and chemokines, which diverged quickly with evolution and thus do not share substantial protein sequence identity across species as diverged as frogs and mammals. We would also like to highlight the fact that several studies suggest that amphibian mast cells lack histamine (Mulero et al., 2007; Reite, 1965; Reite, 1972; Takaya et al., 1967) and serotonin (Mulero et al., 2007; Galli, 1990). While following up on these findings would be possible, we would like to respectfully emphasize that adopting approaches used in mammalian research to comparative immunology work is not always straightforward.</p><p>As we highlight in our manuscript, frog mast cells upregulate their expression of interleukin-4 (IL4), a hallmark cytokine associated with mammalian mast cells (Babina et al., 2016). The additional findings presented in our revised manuscript indicate that mast cells respond to <italic>Bd</italic> by upregulating IL4 expression <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, this suggests that IL4 may be a central means by which frog mast cells confer protection against <italic>Bd</italic>, by counteracting <italic>Bd</italic>-elicited inflammation, including minimizing neutrophil infiltration, maintaining skin integrity, and promoting cutaneous mucus production. Please find that these additional results are presented in Figure 8 and are described in the results and discussion sections of our revised manuscript.</p><p>Our attempts to elicit degranulation of frog mast cells using compound 48/80 have so far not been successful. This may reflect technical issues with assays optimized for mammalian mast cells or biological difference between frog and mammalian mast cells, such as species differences in mas-related G-protein coupled receptors, through which compound 48/80 acts (Hermans et al., 2021). We will continue to explore means to study frog mast cell degranulation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> but also respectfully point out that while degranulation is a feature commonly associated with mammalian mast cells, this is not the only means by which the mammalian mast cells confer their immunological effects. Indeed, our studies suggest that frog mast cell IL4 production may be a key means by which these cells offer anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection.</p><p>Please note that we successfully adopted an avidin staining approach to visualize mast cell heparin content <italic>in vitro</italic> and to evaluate cutaneous mast cell numbers <italic>in vivo</italic> in control and mast cell-enriched, mock- and <italic>Bd</italic>-infected animals. This additional work is depicted in Figure 4 and addressed in the results and discussion sections of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary: In this study, Hauser et al investigate the role of amphibian (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>) mast cells in cutaneous immune responses to the ecologically important pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) using novel methods of <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of bone marrow-derived mast cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> expansion of skin mast cell populations.

Unfortunately, working with a non-mammalian model such as <italic>X. laevis</italic> poses limitations that include lack of knock-out lines for immunology research. Moreover, as mentioned in our manuscript, we do not believe that IL4 is the sole mast cell-produced component responsible for the conferred antifungal protection. We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the limitations of our model system and recognizing the novelty, technical advances, and merits of the work presented in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to their discussion, one open question from the revised manuscript is how a single treatment with rSCF leads to a peak in mast cell numbers and then decline to baseline in mock-infected frogs, while Bd infection either sustains rSCF-boosted mast cells or leads to steady mast cell increase over time in control-treated frogs. Whether this is mediated by endogenous SCF or some other factor remains unexplored.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question that we hope to explore in future studies. We did not see significant differences in skin SCF gene expression at 21 days post <italic>Bd</italic> infection. This does not rule out the possibility that the observed <italic>Bd</italic>-mediated effects to frog skin mast cell composition are not due to changes in skin SCF gene expression at earlier infection times, alone or in combination with other host or pathogen derived factors. We know that other factors are responsible for homing/retention of antimicrobial and immunosuppressive granulocyte subsets within frog skin (Hauser et al., 2020) and we postulate that some of these may be distinct mast cell types. Additionally, <italic>Bd</italic> is known to produce a myriad of immunomodulatory factors (Rollins-Smith and Le Sage, 2021), which may well also directly affect frog skin mast cell composition. Mammalian mast cells are heterogenous and are homed or recruited into tissues by an extensive array of host as well as microbiome-derived components (Halova et al., 2012; West and Bulfone-Paus, 2022).

It is unclear whether and how skin-resident immune cells defend against Bd. Although it is well known that mammalian mast cells are crucial immune sentinels in the skin and play a pivotal role in the immune recognition of pathogens and orchestrating subsequent immune responses, the roles of amphibian mast cells during Bd infections are largely unknown. The current study developed a novel way to enrich <italic>X. laevis</italic> skin mast cells by injecting the skin with recombinant stem cell factor (SCF), a KIT ligand required for mast cell differentiation and survival. The investigators found an enrichment of skin mast cells provides <italic>X. laevis</italic> substantial protection against Bd and mitigates the inflammation-related skin damage resulting from Bd infection. Additionally, the augmentation of mast cells leads to increased mucin content within cutaneous mucus glands and shields frogs from the alterations to their skin microbiomes caused by Bd.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study underscores the significance of amphibian skin-resident immune cells in defenses against Bd and introduces a novel approach to examining interactions between amphibian hosts and fungal pathogens.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the novelty and importance of the work presented in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness of the study is the lack of functional analysis of <italic>X. laevis</italic> mast cells. Upon activation, mast cells have the characteristic feature of degranulation to release histamine, serotonin, proteases, cytokines, and chemokines, etc. The study should determine whether X. laevis mast cells can be degranulated by two commonly used mast cell activators IgE and compound 48/80 for IgE-dependent and independent pathways. This can be easily done <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is also important to assess whether <italic>in vivo</italic> these mast cells are degranulated upon Bd infection using avidin staining to visualize vesicle releases from mast cells. Figure 3 only showed rSCF injection caused an increase in mast cells in naÃ¯ve skin. They need to present whether Bd infection can induce mast cell increase and rSCF injection under Bd infection causes a mast cell increase in the skin. In addition, it is unclear how the enrichment of mast cells provides protection against Bd infection and alternations to skin microbiomes after infection. It is important to determine whether skin mast cells release any contents mentioned above.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for taking the time to review our work and providing us with valuable feedback. We feel that we have successfully incorporated the reviewerâs suggestions into our revised manuscript, thereby improving this work.</p><p>Please note that amphibians do not possess the IgE antibody isotype (Flajnik, 2018).</p><p>To our knowledge there have been no published work assimilating approaches used when studying mammalian mast cell degranulation towards examining amphibian mast cells. While there are commercially available kits and reagents for examining mammalian mast cell granule content, most of these reagents do not cross-react with amphibian counterparts. This is especially true of cytokines and chemokines, which diverged quickly with evolution and thus do not share substantial protein sequence identity across species as diverged as frogs and mammals. Additionally, several studies suggest that amphibian mast cells lack histamine (Mulero et al., 2007; Reite, 1965, 1972; Takaya et al., 1967) and serotonin (Galli, 1990; Mulero et al., 2007). Respectfully, while following up on these findings is possible, we would not consider adopting approaches used in mammalian research to comparative immunology work as easy.</p><p>As noted in our manuscript, frog mast cells upregulate their expression of interleukin-4 (IL4), which is a hallmark cytokine associated with mammalian mast cells (Babina et al., 2016). The additional findings, presented in our revised manuscript indicate that mast cells respond to <italic>Bd</italic> by upregulating IL4 expression <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In turn, our work indicates that IL4 may be a central means by which frog mast cells confer protection against <italic>Bd,</italic> by counteracting <italic>Bd</italic>-elicited inflammation, including minimizing neutrophil infiltration, maintaining skin integrity, and promoting mucus production by skin mucus glands. Please find that these additional findings are presented in Figure 8 of our revised manuscript and are described in the results and discussion sections of the paper.</p><p>Our attempts to elicit degranulation of frog mast cells using compound 48/80 have so far not been successful. This may reflect technical issues with assays optimized for mammalian mast cells or biological difference between frog and mammalian mast cells, such as species differences in mas-related G-protein coupled receptors, through which compound 48/80 acts (Hermans et al., 2021). We will continue explore means to study frog mast cell degranulation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> but would also like to respectfully point out that while mast cell degranulation is a feature most associated with mammalian mast cells, this is not the only means by which the mammalian mast cells confer their immunological effects. Indeed, our additional studies suggest that mast cell IL4 production may be a key means by which these cells offer anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection.</p><p>Please find that we have adopted an avidin-staining approach to visualize mast cell heparin content <italic>in vitro</italic> and to evaluate mast cell numbers <italic>in vivo</italic> in the skins of control and mast cell-enriched, mock- and <italic>Bd</italic>-infected animals. This additional work is depicted in Figure 4 of our revised manuscript and addressed in the results and discussion sections of our revised paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Hauser et al investigate the role of amphibian (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>) mast cells in cutaneous immune responses to the ecologically important pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) using novel methods of <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of bone marrow-derived mast cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> expansion of skin mast cell populations. They find that bone marrow-derived myeloid precursors cultured in the presence of recombinant <italic>X. laevis</italic> Stem Cell Factor (rSCF) differentiate into cells that display hallmark characteristics of mast cells. They inject their novel (r)SCF reagent into the skin of <italic>X. laevis</italic> and find that this stimulates the expansion of cutaneous mast cell populations <italic>in vivo</italic>. They then apply this model of cutaneous mast cell expansion in the setting of Bd infection and find that mast cell expansion attenuates the skin burden of Bd zoospores and pathologic features including epithelial thickness and improves protective mucus production and transcriptional markers of barrier function. Utilizing their prior expertise with expanding neutrophil populations in <italic>X. laevis</italic>, the authors compare mast cell expansion using (r)SCF to neutrophil expansion using recombinant colony-stimulating factor 3 (rCSF3) and find that neutrophil expansion in Bd infection leads to greater burden of zoospores and worse skin pathology.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors report a novel method of expanding amphibian mast cells utilizing their custom-made rSCF reagent. They rigorously characterize expanded mast cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> using histologic, morphologic, transcriptional, and functional assays. This establishes solid footing with which to then study the role of rSCF-stimulated mast cell expansion in the Bd infection model. This appears to be the first demonstration of the exogenous use of rSCF in amphibians to expand mast cell populations and may set a foundation for future mechanistic studies of mast cells in the <italic>X. laevis</italic> model organism.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the breadth and extent of the undertaking that culminated in this manuscript. Indeed, this manuscript would not have been possible without considerable reagent development and adaptation of techniques that had previously not been used for amphibian immunity research. In line with the reviewerâs sentiment, to our knowledge this is the first report of using molecular approaches to augment amphibian mast cells, which we hope will pave the way for new areas of research within the fields of comparative immunology and amphibian disease biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The conclusions regarding the role of mast cell expansion in controlling Bd infection would be stronger with a more rigorous evaluation of the model, as there are some key gaps and remaining questions regarding the data. For example:</p><p>(1) Granulocyte expansion is carefully quantified in the initial time courses of rSCF and rCSF3 injections, but similar quantification is not provided in the disease models (Figures 3E, 4G, 5D-G). A key implication of the opposing effects of mast cell vs neutrophil expansion is that mast cells may suppress neutrophil recruitment or function. Alternatively, mast cells also express notable levels of csfr3 (Figure 2) and previous work from this group (Hauser et al, Facets 2020) showed rG-CSF-stimulated peritoneal granulocytes express mast cell markers including kit and tpsab1, raising the question of what effect rCSF3 might have on mast cell populations in the skin. Considering these points, it would be helpful if both mast cells and neutrophils were quantified histologically (based on Figure 1, they can be readily distinguished by SE or Giemsa stain) in the Bd infection models.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. Please find that we successfully adopted an <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization approach to evaluate neutrophil numbers in the skins of control and mast cell-enriched, mock- and <italic>Bd</italic>-infected animals based on expression of the neutrophil marker, myeloperoxidase (<italic>mpo</italic>; (Buchan et al., 2019)). Please find these results are presented in Figures 6 and 8 of our revised manuscript and addressed in the appropriate sections of our revised paper.</p><p>Our findings suggest that rSCF administration results in the accumulation of mast cells that are polarized such, that they ablate the inflammatory response elicited by <italic>Bd</italic> infection, such as through mechanisms like IL4 production. Mammalian mast cells, including peritonea-resident mast cells, express <italic>csf3r</italic> (Aponte-Lopez et al., 2020; Jamur et al., 2010). For this reason, we used <italic>mpo</italic> expression to visualize neutrophil skin infiltration in Figures 6 and 8 of our revised work. While the <italic>X. laevis</italic> animal model does not permit nearly the degree of immune cell resolution afforded by mammalian animal models, we do know that the adult <italic>X. laevis</italic> peritonea contain a myriad of immune cell subsets. We anticipate that the high kit expression reported by</p><p>Hauser <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020 in the rCSF3-recruited peritoneal leukocytes reflects the presence of mast cells therein.Please find that we have used avidin-staining and <italic>mpo in situ</italic> hybridization to respectively visualize and enumerate mast cells and neutrophils in the skin of control and mast cell-enriched, mock- and <italic>Bd</italic>-infected animals. Indeed, our results show interesting, experimental condition-dependent changes in both the skin neutrophil and mast cell numbers. The results of these additional studies are presented in Figures 4, 6 and 8 of the revised manuscript and addressed in the results and discussions sections of our revised paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Epithelial thickness and inflammation in Bd infection are reported to be reduced by rSCF treatment (Figure 3E, 5A-B) or increased by rCSF3 treatment (Figure 4G) but quantification of these critical readouts is not shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We scored epithelial thickness under the distinct conditions described in our manuscript and presented the quantified data in Figures 5 and 8 of the revised paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Critical time points in the Bd model are incompletely characterized. Mast cell expansion decreases zoospore burden at 21 dpi, while there is no difference at 7 dpi (Figure 3E). Conversely, neutrophil expansion increases zoospore burden at 7 dpi, but no corresponding 21 dpi data is shown for comparison (Figure 4G). Microbiota analysis is performed at a third time point,10 dpi (Figure 5D-G), making it difficult to compare with the data from the 7 dpi and 21 dpi time points. Reporting consistent readouts at these three time points is important to draw solid conclusions about the relationship of mast cell expansion to Bd infection and shifts in microbiota.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for noting this discrepancy. Please find that we have repeated our mast cell-enrichment, <italic>Bd</italic>-challenge studies, examining days 10 and 21 post infection. Our new findings indicate that compared to control animals, mast cell-enrichment does result in significant reduction in <italic>Bd</italic> loads at both 10 and 21 dpi. The difference in Bd loads between r-ctrl and rSCF-treated animals at 10 dpi corroborates the other parameters that are altered between the two treatment groups at this experimental time point.</p><p>Our question regarding the roles of inflammatory granulocytes/neutrophils during Bd infections was that of âhowâ rather âwhenâ these cells affect <italic>Bd</italic> infections. Thus, and because the central focus of this work was mast cells and not other granulocyte subsets; when we saw that rCSF3-recruited granulocytes adversely affect <italic>Bd</italic> infections at 7 days, we did not pursue the kinetics of these observations further. We plan to explore the roles of inflammatory mediators and immune cell subsets during the course of <italic>Bd</italic> infections but feel that these future studies are more peripheral to the central thesis of the present manuscript regarding the roles of frog mast cells during <italic>Bd</italic> infections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Although the effect of rSCF treatment on Bd zoospores is significant at 21 dpi (Figure 3E), bacterial microbiota changes at 21 dpi are not (Figure S3B-C). This discrepancy, how it relates to the bacterial microbiota changes at 10 dpi, and why 7, 10, and 21 dpi time points were chosen for these different readouts (Figure 5F-G), is not discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Please find that our additional studies indicate that compared to control animals, frog skin mast cell-enrichment results in significant reduction in <italic>Bd</italic> loads at 10 dpi. This corroborate our other findings including the observation that at 10 dpi, control animals exhibit reduced microbial richness whereas mast cell-enriched frogs were protected from this disruption of their microbiome. The amphibian microbiome serves as a major barrier to these fungal infections (Walke and Belden, 2016) and we anticipate that <italic>Bd</italic>-mediated disruption of microbial richness facilitates host skin colonization by this pathogen. In turn, we anticipate that frog mast cells are conferring the observed anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection in part by preventing microbial disassembly and thus interfering with optimal <italic>Bd</italic> colonization and growth on frog skins. Please find that we acknowledge and discuss these notions in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The time course of rSCF or rCSF3 treatments relative to Bd infection in the experiments is not clear. Were the treatments given 12 hours prior to the final analysis point to maximize the effect? For example, in Figure 3E, were rSCF injections given at 6.5 dpi and 20.5 dpi? Or were treatments administered on day 0 of the infection model? If the latter, how do the authors explain the effects at 7 dpi or 21 dpi given mast cell and neutrophil numbers return to baseline within 24 hours after rSCF or rCSF3 treatment, respectively?</p></disp-quote><p>Please find that in our revised manuscript, we underlined the kinetics of our animal treatments and <italic>Bd</italic>-infections. In brief, for mast cell-enrichment, animals were injected with r-ctrl or rSCF, challenged 12 hours later with <italic>Bd</italic> and examined after 10 (per reviewersâ suggestions) and 21 days of infection. For neutrophil enrichment, animals were injected with r-ctrl or rCSF3, challenged 12 hours later with <italic>Bd</italic> and examined after 7 days of infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The title of the manuscript may be mildly overstated. Although Bd infection can indeed be deadly, mortality was not a readout in this study, and it is not clear from the data reported that expanding skin mast cells would ultimately prevent progression to death in Bd infections.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this point. The revised manuscript will be titled: âAmphibian mast cells: barriers to chytrid fungus infectionsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hauser et al. provide an exceptional study describing the role of resident mast cells in amphibian epidermis that produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that prevent Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) infection from causing harmful inflammation, and also protect frogs from changes in skin microbiomes and loss of mucin in glands and loss of mucus integrity that otherwise cause changes to their skin microbiomes. Neutrophils, in contrast, were not protective against Bd infection. Beyond the beautiful cytology and transcriptional profiling, the authors utilized elegant cell enrichment experiments to enrich mast cells by recombinant stem cell factor, or to enrich neutrophils by recombinant colony-stimulating factor-3, and examined respective infection outcomes in <italic>Xenopus</italic>.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Through the use of recombinant IL4, the authors were able to test and eliminate the hypothesis that mast cell production of IL4 was the mechanism of host protection from Bd infection. Instead, impacts on the mucus glands and interaction with the skin microbiome are implicated as the protective mechanism. These results will press disease ecologists to examine the relative importance of this immune defense among species, the influence of mast cells on the skin microbiome and mucosal function, and open the potential for modulating mucosal defense.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the utility of the work presented in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A reduction of bacterial diversity upon infection, as described at the end of the results section, may not always be an &quot;adverse effect,&quot; particularly given that anti-Bd function of the microbiome increased. Some authors (see Letourneau et al. 2022 ISME, or Woodhams et al. 2023 DCI) consider these short-term alterations as encoding ecological memory, such that continued exposure to a pathogen would encounter an enriched microbial defense. Regardless, mast cell-initiated protection of the mucus layer may negate the need for this microbial memory defense.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer their insightful comment. We have revised our discussion to include this notion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the description of the mast cell location in the epidermal skin layer in amphibians is novel, it is not known how representative these results are across species ranging in chytridiomycosis susceptibility. No management applications are provided such as methods to increase this defense without the use of recombinant stem cell factor, and more discussion is needed on how the mast cell component (abundance, distribution in the skin) of the epidermis develops or is regulated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Please find that we have added a paragraph to our revised manuscripts to address possible source(s) of skin mast cells and a statement acknowledging that greater understanding of mast cell biology across distinct amphibian species may be used to develop future strategies for management of amphibian diseases.</p><p>We are very thankful to the reviewer for this excellent suggestion but would like to point out that the work presented in our manuscript was driven by comparative immunology questions more than by conservation biology. As such and considering just how little is known about mast cells outside of mammals; we chose not to speculate too much into possible utilities of altering amphibian skin mast cell composition and instead to focus our discussion on the immediate takeaways of the work presented by our paper.</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>Aponte-Lopez, A., Enciso, J., Munoz-Cruz, S., Fuentes-Panana, E.M., 2020.

We combined the content of Figure 4A-C with Figure 5A-C and added data on epidermal thickness under different conditions into this figure; Figure 5 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) If possible, complementing the skin RNA-seq from rSCF treatment in Bd infection with skin RNA-seq from rCSF3 treatment to compare effects on transcriptional programs of barrier function, etc would elevate this study and add additional insights into cutaneous inflammation in the setting of Bd infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We anticipate that the skin inflammation caused by <italic>Bd</italic> infection is not due solely to neutrophil infiltration and artificially altering the frog skin neutrophil content would thus not recapitulate chytridiomycosis progression. We completely agree that it would be valuable to examine barrier functions in control and mast cell-enriched, <italic>Bd</italic>-infected frogs. This is something that we hope to pursue further in future studies but feel that together with our additional findings, we are presenting a significant amount of data to constitute a stand-alone story.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In Figure S1A, analyzing only 3 AMP genes by qPCR is perhaps too focused. As a control, it would be useful to also test some genes known to be functionally important in neutrophil anti-microbial responses, e.g. lyz. Expanding on this experiment by performing RNA-seq on Bd-treated, bone-marrow-derived mast cells and neutrophils would be a great addition to the manuscript and an important resource for future studies in the field. The fact that the use of rSCF (or rCSF3) enables the differentiation of these cells in large numbers of pure populations presents this unique opportunity. Although IL-4 did not end up affecting mucus production, clues to the mediator(s) of this mast cell-dependent effect may be found with unbiased RNA-seq after exposure to Bd.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion but would like to point out that our manuscript is focused on mast cells rather than neutrophils. We also believe that in vitro exposure of leukocytes to <italic>Bd</italic> is not the most physiologically relevant model of what would happen to skin-resident and incoming immune cell subsets, since <italic>Bd</italic> primarily infects top-most keratinocytes. We anticipate that rather than coming into direct contact with the fungus, cells like mast cells and neutrophils are responding to Bd-produced and infected cell-produced products. For this reason, we did not perform RNA-seq analysis of in vitro derived mast cells or neutrophils stimulated with <italic>Bd</italic>. As we develop more <italic>X. laevis</italic>-specific reagents, we hope to revisit the question of infected skin mast cell and neutrophil gene expression profiles but are not in a position to ask these questions at this time.</p><p>This work is also guided by a finite budget, and we feel that together with our significant additional findings described in our revised manuscript, we are presenting a substantial amount of work to constitute a stand-alone story and manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The following are minor edits needed in the text and figure legends:</p><p>Standardize terms such as IL4 instead of il4 or ril4 vs rIL4 throughout.
