pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29213.001</object-id><p>Blood is arguably the most important bodily fluid and its analysis provides crucial health status information. A first routine measure to narrow down diagnosis in clinical practice is the differential blood count, determining the frequency of all major blood cells. What is lacking to advance initial blood diagnostics is an unbiased and quick functional assessment of blood that can narrow down the diagnosis and generate specific hypotheses. To address this need, we introduce the continuous, cell-by-cell morpho-rheological (MORE) analysis of diluted whole blood, without labeling, enrichment or separation, at rates of 1000 cells/sec. In a drop of blood we can identify all major blood cells and characterize their pathological changes in several disease conditions in vitro and in patient samples. This approach takes previous results of mechanical studies on specifically isolated blood cells to the level of application directly in blood and adds a functional dimension to conventional blood analysis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29213.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When you are sick and go to the doctor, it is often not obvious what exactly is wrong — what is causing fever, nausea, shortness of breath or other symptoms. It is important to find this out quickly so that the right action can be taken. One of the first steps is to obtain a blood sample and to count how many of the different blood cells are present in it. This is called a complete blood count, and the information it provides has turned out to be surprisingly useful. A large number of certain white blood cells, for example, can show that the body is fighting an infection. But there might be several reasons why the number of white blood cells has increased, so this information alone is often not enough for a specific diagnosis.</p><p>There are many hundreds of possible tests that can supplement the results of a complete blood count. These might identify bacteria or measure the concentrations of certain molecules in the blood, for example. But which test will give the important clue that reveals the source of the illness? This can be difficult to predict. Although each test helps to narrow down the final diagnosis they become increasingly expensive and time-consuming to perform, and rapid action is often important when treating a disease.</p><p>Can we get more decisive information from the initial blood test by measuring other properties of the blood cells? Toepfner et al. now show that this is possible using a technique called real-time deformability cytometry. This method forces the blood cells in a small drop of blood to flow extremely rapidly through a narrow microfluidic channel while they are imaged by a fast camera. A computer algorithm can then analyze the size and stiffness of the blood cells in real-time. Toepfner et al. show that this approach can detect characteristic changes that affect blood cells as a result of malaria, spherocytosis, bacterial and viral infections, and leukemia. Furthermore, many thousands of blood cells can be measured in a few minutes — fast enough to be suitable as a diagnostic test.</p><p>These proof-of-concept findings can now be used to develop actual diagnostic tests for a wide range of blood-related diseases. The approach could also be used to test which of several drugs is working to treat a certain medical condition, and to monitor whether the treatment is progressing as planned.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>real-time deformability cytometry</kwd><kwd>cell mechanics</kwd><kwd>spherocytosis</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>neutrophil activation</kwd><kwd>leukemia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Alexander von Humboldt Professorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guck</surname><given-names>Jochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR83 and SFB655</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coskun</surname><given-names>Ünal</given-names></name><name><surname>Bornhäuser</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ITN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ranford-Cartwright</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Henriques-Normark</surname><given-names>Birgitta</given-names></name><name><surname>Guck</surname><given-names>Jochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD e.V.)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coskun</surname><given-names>Ünal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006114</institution-id><institution>Sächsisches Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft und Kunst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TG70 AZ 4-7531.60/29/45</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otto</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name><name><surname>Guck</surname><given-names>Jochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tour der Hoffnung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Non-commercial grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stächele</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sonnenstrahl e.V.

Consequently, its analysis yields crucial information about the health status of patients. The complete blood count, the analysis of presence and frequency of all major blood cells, constitutes a basic, routine measure in clinical practice. It is often accompanied by analysis of blood biochemistry and molecular markers reflecting the current focus on molecular considerations in biology and biomedicine.</p><p>An orthogonal approach could be seen in the study of the overall rheological properties of blood. It is evident that the flow of blood throughout the body will be determined by its physical properties in the vasculature, and their alterations could cause or reflect pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lichtman, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baskurt and Meiselman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Popel and Johnson, 2005</xref>). In this context, blood is a poly-disperse suspension of colloids with different deformability and the flow properties of such non-Newtonian fluids have been the center of study in hydrodynamics and colloidal physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lan and Khismatullin, 2012</xref>). Probably due to the dominant importance of erythrocytes, at the expense of sensitivity to leukocyte properties, whole blood rheology has not resulted in wide-spread diagnostic application.</p><p>Focusing on the physical properties of individual blood cells has suggested a third possibility to glean maximum diagnostic information from blood.

These proof-of-concept studies have so far been done on few tens of specifically isolated cells. This line of research has not progressed towards clinical application for lack of an appropriate measurement technique that can assess single-cell properties of sufficient number directly in blood.</p><p>This report aims to close this gap by presenting a novel approach for high-throughput single-cell morpho-rheological (MORE) characterization of all major blood cells in continuous flow. Mimicking capillary flow, we analyze human blood without any labeling or separation at rates of 1000 cells/sec. We show that we can sensitively detect morphological and rheological changes of erythrocytes in spherocytosis and malaria infection, of leukocytes in viral and bacterial infection, and of malignant transformed cells in myeloid and lymphatic leukemias. Readily available quantitative morphological parameters such as cell shape, size, aggregation, and brightness, as well as rheological information of each blood cell type with excellent statistics might not only inform further investigation of blood as a complex fluid. It also connects many previous reports of mechanical changes of specifically isolated cells to a measurement now done directly in blood. As such, it adds a new functional dimension to conventional blood analysis — a MORE complete blood count — and, thus, opens the door to a new era of exploration in investigating and diagnosing hematological and systemic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of morpho-rheological analysis</title><p>In order to establish the normal MORE phenotype of cells found in blood, we obtained venous, citrate-anticoagulated blood of healthy donors, of which 50 µl was diluted in 950 µl of measurement buffer with a controlled elevated viscosity, but without any additional labeling, sorting, or enrichment. The cell suspension was then pumped through a micro-channel not unlike micro-capillaries in the blood vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Brightfield images of the cells, deformed by hydrodynamic shear stresses in the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mietke et al., 2015</xref>), were obtained continuously by RT-DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Otto et al., 2015</xref>) (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). These images revealed distinct differences in overall morphology, brightness, and amount of deformation between all major cell types found in blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). RT-DC further enabled the continuous, real-time quantification of the cross-sectional area and of the deformed shape (see detailed description in Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) of an, in principle, unlimited number of cells at measurement rates of 100–1000 cells/sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For each cell detected and analyzed, an image was saved and the average pixel brightness within the cell determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This single-cell MORE analysis of blood revealed distinct and well-separated cell populations in the space spanned by the three parameters (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Notably, size and brightness alone — parameters not unlike those accessible by light scattering analysis in standard flow cytometers — were sufficient for the identification of the cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), so that deformation, as an additional and independent parameter, was available for assessing their functional changes. The identity of the individual cell populations by size and brightness was established by magnetic cell sorting, controlled by fluorescence immunophenotyping, and subsequent MORE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A key feature is the very clear separation of the abundant erythrocytes (red blood cells; RBCs) from other cells as a result of their much greater deformation and lower brightness. This feature gives access to leukocyte properties directly in diluted whole blood, without the potentially detrimental effects of hemolysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) or other separation steps, which are required for analysis with cell mechanics techniques with lower specificity and throughput, or non-continuous measurement. This aspect contributes to the well-established field of hemorheology the possibility to interrogate mechanical properties of all individual blood cells and to specifically investigate their contribution to the overall blood rheological properties.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29213.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single-cell, morpho-rheological phenotyping of blood.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of whole, diluted blood.

Besides using the lysing solution, the procedure comprises gentle vortexing and two centrifugation steps (200 g for 5 min), which might all affect the cells.

As control, 50 µl whole blood of the same donor was suspended in 950 µl measurement buffer. Comparison of the morpho-rheological features of leukocytes showed that the RBC lysis procedure inverted the relative amounts of lymphocytes and myeloid cells, yielded lymphocytes that were less deformed, and myeloid cells that were larger and more deformed.

Until recently, techniques with sufficient throughput, obviating the need for specifically isolating the relevant cells of interest, which always bears the potential of inadvertent cell change (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), did not exist. In this sense, the mechanical phenotyping of diagnostic changes of leukocytes directly in diluted whole blood is the most transformative application area of MORE analysis. For example, there have been proof-of-concept studies on the mechanical changes associated with activation of isolated neutrophils showing a stiffening, in line with the pronounced actin cortex that is a hallmark of neutrophil activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Worthen et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rosenbluth et al., 2008</xref>). MORE analysis of the in vitro neutrophil activation in blood with the bacterial wall-derived tripeptide fMLP confirmed that neutrophils were indeed less deformed and smaller within the first 15 min post fMLP treatment. Interestingly, the subsequent time-course showed a reversal to more deformed and larger cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations by themselves do not permit a conclusion about a change in cell stiffness, since a smaller size also leads to less stress acting on the cells in the channel, and less deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mietke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mokbel et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we also calculated the apparent Young’s modulus of the cells, which increased from <italic>E</italic> = 742 ± 12 Pa to <italic>E</italic> = 853 ± 20 Pa (mean ±SEM. p=0.009, <italic>n</italic> = 5) during the first 15 min, and then subsequently reverted to values statistically indistinguishable but slightly lower than before stimulation (15–30 min: <italic>E</italic> = 717 ± 9 Pa, p=0.347; 30–45 min: <italic>E</italic> = 719 ± 7 Pa, p=0.117; 45–60 min: <italic>E</italic> = 731 ± 11 Pa, p=0.465).

Blast cells are sequestered by the spleen and new, but immature and likely stiffer, blast cells are being added to the circulation from the bone marrow. There could also be ALL subclones with different morpho-rheological characteristics that respond differently and at different times to treatment. And the final increase in deformation from day 9 to 12 coincides with the addition of cytostatic drugs (vincristine, daunorubicin) to the methylprednisolone treatment. Dissecting this multifaceted response will be aided by adding simultaneous fluorescence identification of the cells in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosendahl, 2017</xref>). Of note, of the conventional biomarkers and techniques that are used in the diagnosis of leukemia (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), only morphological analysis of air-dried Romanowsky-stained blood (or bone marrow) smears is traditionally applied to monitor treatment success in ALL. The response to treatment is one of the most powerful prognostic in vivo markers of leukemia survival. In pediatric ALL the number of blasts at day eight after start of methylprednisolone treatment is predictive of the relapse rate (&lt;1000 blasts/µl of blood: relapse rate 20–30%; &gt;1000 blasts/µl of blood: relapse rate 50–80%). MORE analysis provides at least the same information as conventional morphological analysis, but in a shorter amount of time and with smaller sample sizes required (for a comparison between MORE analysis and conventional biomarkers, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In summary, MORE blood analysis can be used to monitor morpho-rheological effects of chemotherapy and the successful replacement of lymphoblasts with mature lymphocytes in a quantitative manner.

Amongst the latter techniques, RT-DC stands out because it can continuously monitor an, in principle, unlimited number of cells, which enables the direct sensitive assessment of the state of all major cell types found in blood. A volume as small as 10 µl can be analyzed cell-by-cell, with only dilution in measurement buffer to adjust cell density and prevent sedimentation, but no labeling, enrichment or separation, which could otherwise cause inadvertent activation of blood cells. The conventional blood count is extended by information about characteristic, and diagnostic, morpho-rheological changes of the major cell types. Cell mechanics and morphology are inherent and sensitive markers intimately linked to functional changes associated with the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chimini and Chavrier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fletcher and Mullins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kasza et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salbreux et al., 2012</xref>) and other intracellular shape-determining and load-bearing entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rowat et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Munder et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, label-free, disease-specific morpho-rheological blood signatures are a novel resource for generating hypotheses about the underlying molecular mechanisms. The availability of such parameters in real-time, easily combined with conventional fluorescence detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosendahl, 2017</xref>), are the necessary prerequisite for future sorting of morpho-rheologically distinct subpopulations, which then provides a novel opportunity for further molecular biological analysis. Of course, at present, MORE phenotyping provides a sensitive, but not a very specific marker. For example, neutrophil softening could be a signature of different underlying pathological changes. In the future, fuller exploration of the large combinatorial space afforded by the multi-parametric response of the various blood cells, exploiting many additional morpho-rheological parameters in conjunction with machine learning, and inclusion of conventional fluorescence-based marker analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosendahl, 2017</xref>) will further increase the specificity of this approach. Apart from now enabling realistic blood cell research ex vivo close to physiological conditions, delivering for example previously unavailable information about leukocyte activation kinetics, and after further in-depth studies of the phenomena reported here, MORE phenotyping could have a tangible impact on diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of treatment success of many hematological diseases as well as inflammatory, infectious, and metabolic disorders. Beyond blood analysis, MORE phenotyping has the potential to become a standard approach in flow cytometry with many applications in biology, biophysics, biotechnology, and medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Real-time deformability cytometry</title><p>Real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Otto et al., 2015</xref>). For RT-DC measurements, cells were suspended in a viscosity-adjusted measurement buffer (MB) based on 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing methylcellulose. The viscosity was adjusted to 15 mPa s at room (and measurement) temperature, determined using a falling ball viscometer (Haake, Thermo Scientific). Cells in the MB were taken up into a 1 ml syringe, placed on a syringe pump (neMESYS, Cetoni GmbH) and connected via tubing to the sample inlet of the microfluidic chip with a square measurement channel cross section of 20 × 20 µm<sup>2</sup>. The microfluidic chip was made from cured polydimethylsiloxane bonded to a thickness #2 cover glass. Another syringe containing MB without cells was connected to the sheath flow inlet of the chip. Measurements were carried out at a total flow rate of 0.12 µl/s with a sample flow rate of 0.03 µl/s and a sheath flow rate of 0.09 µl/s unless stated otherwise. Different gating settings for cell dimensions could be employed during the measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Images of the cells in the channel were acquired in a region of interest of 250 × 80 pixels at a frame rate of 2000 fps. Real-time analysis of the images was performed during the measurement and the parameters necessary for MORE analysis were stored for all detected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data processing in MORE analysis</title><p>The raw data obtained from RT-DC measurements consisted of the following information of every detected cell: a bright field image of the cell, the contour of the cell, its deformation value, and the cell size as the cross-sectional area of the cell in the image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The deformation was calculated from the convex hull contour of the cell — a processed contour, where all points contributing to concave curvature were removed:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>A</italic> is the area enclosed by the convex hull contour and <italic>l</italic> is the length of the convex hull contour. Therefore, deformation is the deviation from a perfectly circular cell image. It describes the change of the cell’s shape by the hydrodynamic forces in the measurement channel but may also contain pre-existing shape deviations from a sphere, for example for the biconcave, disk-like shapes of healthy red blood cells or strongly activated and polarized neutrophils. Image brightness analysis was carried out using the contour information and the image of the cell. The mean brightness of the cell was determined from all pixel values within the cell’s contour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). With this information the distinction of leukocyte subpopulations was possible in the space spanned by cell size and mean brightness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is worth noting that the absolute value of the resulting brightness was influenced by several experimental conditions such as focus of the image and the thickness of the microfluidic chip. However, this did not affect the quality of the distinction of cells by their brightness. Special care had to be taken when comparing the brightness of different purified leukocyte subpopulations of similar size (like neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes). In order to achieve a situation similar to the diluted whole blood measurement, we used the same microfluidic chip repeatedly after thorough flushing. All brightness values reported were normalized to 100 by the background brightness of the channel. Apart from the initial brightness distinction, in a second step, the root mean square of pixel brightness values was calculated in an area of 9 × 5 pixels (nine in the flow direction, five perpendicular to the flow direction) around the geometrical center of the cell. This information was used to distinguish the relevant leukocyte subpopulations from eventual erythrocyte doublets present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To ensure best validity of the deformation measure based on the area within the cell’s contour and the length of the contour, only cells without prominent protrusions were considered for comparisons based on deformation. A reliable criterion to select those cells was found by comparing the area within the originally detected cell contour and within the convex hull contour. For erythrocytes, the difference of these two areas was limited to 15%. For leukocytes, a suitable limit was found at 5%. For the identification of malaria-infected erythrocytes we used a semi-automated procedure designed to obtain only clearly positive results and to avoid false negatives. The defining property of infected cells was the presence of bright spots within the cells. In a first step, all pixel values outside the cell’s contour were set to 0. In a twice-repeated procedure, the image of the erythrocyte was further reduced by setting all pixel values of the contour pixels to 0 and finding the new contour. This measure was used to eliminate possible bright spots due to fringes at the border of the cell. From this image, the brightness of every pixel of the remaining cell was calculated by taking the mean of the pixel itself and its eight nearest neighbors. The user was then able to set the minimal threshold for this brightness in order to identify a cell as potentially infected. Since higher pixel values are frequently obtained at the rear of the cell (in flow direction) only bright spots within 70% of the cell’s length counted from the front of the cell were considered. As a last criterion, the calculated brightness was compared to the brightness of the cell directly surrounding the bright spot in order to eliminate cases of generally bright cells. For this a mean brightness value was formed from all pixels located within the two rectangular areas spanned from [<italic>k</italic>-3,<italic>l</italic>-1] to [<italic>k</italic>-2,<italic>l</italic> + 1] as well as [<italic>k</italic> + 2,<italic>l</italic>-1] to [<italic>k</italic> + 3,<italic>l</italic> + 1], where <italic>k</italic> is the pixel position of the bright spot in the flow direction and <italic>l</italic> is the pixel position of the bright spot orthogonal to the flow direction. Most of this analysis can be performed with ShapeOut, except for the last aspect of considering details of internal brightness, for which a custom-written Python script was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Blood measurements</title><p>All studies complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and involved written informed consent from all participants or their legal guardians. Ethics for experiments with human blood were approved by the ethics committee of the Technische Universität Dresden (EK89032013, EK458102015), and for human blood and LPS inhalation in healthy volunteers by the East of England, Cambridge Central ethics committee (Study No. 06/Q0108/281 and ClinicalTrialReference <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02551614?term=NCT02551614&amp;rank=1">NCT02551614</ext-link>). Study participants were enrolled according to good clinical practice and recruited at the University Medical Centre Carl Gustav Carus Dresden, Germany, the Biotechnology Center, Technische Universität Dresden, Germany, or Cambridge University Hospitals, Cambridge, UK. Human blood and serum used to culture the malaria parasites was obtained from the Glasgow and West of Scotland Blood Transfusion Service; the provision of the material was approved by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service Committee For The Governance Of Blood And Tissue Samples For Non-Therapeutic Use. Venous blood was drawn from donors with a 20-gauge multifly needle into a sodium citrate S-monovette (Sarstedt) by vacuum aspiration. In case of blood volumes above 9 ml, blood was manually drawn via a 19-gauge multifly needle into a 40 ml syringe and transferred to 50 ml Falcon polypropylene tubes (BD) containing 4 ml 3.8% sodium citrate (Martindale Pharmaceuticals). For RT-DC measurements of blood, 50 µl of anti-coagulated blood were diluted in 950 µl MB and mixed gently by manual rotation of the sample tube. This fixed dilution of 1:20 was the result of optimization series to dilute as little possible, while still enabling the reliable detection of single cell events for both erythrocytes and leukocytes at typical cell densities found in blood. Measurements were typically carried out within 2 hr past blood donation unless stated otherwise. Two different gating settings were employed in the measurement software for erythrocyte and leukocyte acquisition, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For erythrocytes, gates were essentially open allowing cell dimensions in flow direction from 0 µm to 30 µm. The leukocyte gate was set to a size of 5–16 µm in flow direction and &gt;5 µm perpendicular to it. This setting allowed filtering out single erythrocytes and almost all erythrocyte multiples. The leukocyte populations remained unaltered as confirmed in experiments with purified leukocytes at open gate settings. Using the leukocyte gate, the majority of thrombocytes was also ignored as they possess typical diameters of 2–3 µm. A small fraction of very large thrombocytes and microerythrocytes were still found within this gate as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>. Mechanical analysis of these events constitutes an interesting challenge in that they can be detected and counted, but at present not tested for activation via their deformation given their very small size compared to the channel size, which was chosen to accommodate all cells found in blood. Measurements in the leukocyte gate were carried out over a fixed timespan of 15 min (to acquire typically 500 to 3000 leukocytes, depending on donor and disease state), followed by a separate measurement in the erythrocyte gate for a few seconds until data of 5,000–10,000 cells were acquired. Measurements for establishing the normal MORE blood phenotype in healthy human volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and all measurements directly compared to this norm, e. g., blood samples derived from patients, were carried out at a temperature of 30°C. The remaining measurements — fMLP stimulation, LPS stimulation, purified leukocyte subpopulations, malaria infection, and erythrocyte palmitoylation — were carried out at a temperature of 23°C. The viscosity of the MB was always adjusted to 15 mPa s at the different temperatures to keep the acting hydrodynamic stress and, thus, the resulting deformation regimes the same. An MB with the viscosity of 25 mPa s (to slow blood cell sedimentation in the tubing) was used in experiments for comparing the relative cell count results of leukocyte subpopulation by MORE analysis and conventional blood count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

In manual counts of malaria infection in RBCs, statistical analyses were performed using a χ<sup>2</sup> test with Bonferroni correction (adjusted statistical significance for p&lt;0.0125) to compare the numbers of infected and non-infected erythrocytes between erythrocyte samples, except where number of parasite infected cells was zero, in which case Fisher`s exact test was used. The standard deviation for the parasitemia was calculated assuming a binomial random variable as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:msqrt></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>N</italic> is the number of cells counted and <italic>p</italic> is the fraction of infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data availability</title><p>The raw data of all measurements are available from the Dryad Digital Repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Toepfner et al., 2017</xref>).

The morphological features identified by microscopic examination may suggest either lymphoid or myeloid differentiation of leukemic cells, but with the exception of the identification of Auer rods in myeloblasts none of these features is lineage-specific. Sub-clones can be identified by differences in size and morphological features (e. g. cytoplasmatic vacuoles). (2) Cytochemical staining improves the accuracy and reproducibility of lineage assessment and therefore is required for traditional sub-classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) according to the French-American-British (FAB) and WHO criteria. Sudan Black and stains for myeloperoxidase (MPO) to identify myeloblasts and esterase stains like alpha-naphthyl-butyrate to identify monoblasts have remained useful in this regard. Staining must be performed without undue delay as MPO is unstable and becomes undetectable after a week of storage. (3) Immunophenotypic classification is based on identification of cell surface epitopes or cytoplasmatic proteins by fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies. Flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting, FACS) is nowadays widely used as a particularly powerful method because multiparameter analysis offers the advantage of segregating leukemic cells from non-neoplastic cells. Thus, rapid analysis allows to establish the lineage of the leukemia (e.g. myeloid versus lymphoid), its stage of differentiation (e. g. T- versus B-ALL) and facilitates minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring using a leukemia-specific pattern of markers not expressed in that combination on regular blood or bone marrow cells. Notably, some precursor B-cell ALL might be negative for CD45 (leukocyte common antigen) or patients with T-ALL lack TdT or CD34 expression. Although ALL can be classified according to the stage of maturation, the optimal immunologic sub-classification remains a matter of debate. Many ALLs also aberrantly express myeloid-linage associated antigens (mostly CD13, CD33). Therefore the antibody screening panel for acute leukemias must be designed to include at least one very sensitive and one relatively specific marker for each hematopoietic and lymphoid lineage. (4) Molecular (genetic) classification using traditional methods will detect specific cytogenetic and/or molecular abnormalities in 60–80% of ALL and 50–60% of AML cases. The recent advent of whole genome analysis has allowed virtually all acute leukemias to be classified according to specific genetic abnormalities. Markers can be separated into leukemia-specific (e.g. BCR-ABL1; t(15;18)) or leukemic-clone specific (e.g. Ig-heavy chain gene rearrangements, T-cell receptor gene rearrangements). Both are valuable for classification, as prognostic indicators with a defined treatment applied, and are nowadays routinely used for monitoring of MRD by exploiting the high sensitivity of PCR-based amplification of specific gene sequences. The technique is time-consuming and expensive, and usually performed only in reference laboratories. (5) MORE analysis. When compared to these established conventional methods, the advantages of morpho-rheological (MORE) phenotyping are characterized by a very short time for analysis and the minimum amount of blood required. The technique has comparable power with regard to the identification of leukemic cells and the identification of leukemic sub-clones. Its applicability to classify the leukemic lineage (for example by significant differences in size, deformation, and Young’s modulus; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and to detect small numbers of leukemic cells can theoretically be expected and has been shown in single cases already, but still has to be tested and proven in a formal comparison, which is beyond the scope of the present study. Potentially, the rheological features of blast cells might represent additional prognostic biomarkers for leukemic cells (stiffness might correlate to drug sensitivity or refractoriness, or identify a leukemic subclone), which will be the subject of future studies. Morpho-rheological phenotyping, thus, compares very well to established biomarkers for following ALL treatment success.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-29213-supp2-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29213.027</object-id><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-29213-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><sec id="s7" sec-type="datasets"><title>Major datasets</title><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><related-object content-type="generated-dataset" id="dataset1" source-id="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2fk71" source-id-type="uri"><collab collab-type="author">Toepfner N</collab><collab collab-type="author">Herold C</collab><collab collab-type="author">Otto O</collab><collab collab-type="author">Rosendahl P</collab><collab collab-type="author">Jacobi A</collab><collab collab-type="author">Kräter M</collab><collab collab-type="author">Stächele J</collab><collab collab-type="author">Menschner L</collab><collab collab-type="author">Herbig M</collab><collab collab-type="author">Ciuffreda L</collab><collab collab-type="author">Ranford-Cartwright L</collab><collab collab-type="author">Grzybek M</collab><collab collab-type="author">Coskun Ü</collab><collab collab-type="author">Reithuber E</collab><collab collab-type="author">Garriss G</collab><collab collab-type="author">Mellroth P</collab><collab collab-type="author">Normark BH</collab><collab collab-type="author">Tregay N</collab><collab collab-type="author">Suttorp M</collab><collab collab-type="author">Bornhäuser M</collab><collab collab-type="author">Chilvers E</collab><collab collab-type="author">Berner R</collab><collab collab-type="author">Guck J</collab><year>2017</year><source>Data from: Detection of human disease conditions by single-cell morpho-rheological phenotyping of whole blood</source><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2fk71">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2fk71</ext-link><comment>Available at Dryad Digital Repository under a CC0 Public Domain Dedication</comment></related-object></p></sec></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baskurt</surname> <given-names>OK</given-names></name><name><surname>Meiselman</surname> <given-names>HJ</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2003">2003</year><article-title>Blood rheology and hemodynamics</article-title><source>Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis</source><volume>29</volume><fpage>435</fpage><lpage>450</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1055/s-2003-44551</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14631543</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bernard</surname> <given-names>GR</given-names></name><name><surname>Artigas</surname> <given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Brigham</surname> <given-names>KL</given-names></name><name><surname>Carlet</surname> <given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Falke</surname> <given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hudson</surname> <given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Lamy</surname> <given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Legall</surname> <given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Morris</surname> <given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Spragg</surname> <given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="1994">1994</year><article-title>The American-European Consensus Conference on ARDS.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dennis Discher (Reviewer #1); Amy C Rowat (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The editors and reviewers agree that this work is interesting and potentially quite useful however, as your effort is directed at the development of a new technique rather than a discovery with novel conclusions, we feel it will be more appropriately published as a Tools and Resources paper rather than as a Research Article.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Blood cell numbers, sizes, and deformability have been quantified for many decades at the single cell level under normal and numerous diseased conditions for 2-3 decades or more, although throughput for deformation measures is more limited. This manuscript describes a microfluidic approach to the above quantitation, called MORE (cell-by-cell morpho-rheological) analysis, capable of treating around 1000 blood cells/s, from 10 µL drop of blood only, adding deformation information for each cell type. The principle of the method is based on image acquisition by high-speed video-microscopy and post-acquisition image analysis. The method correctly phenotypes different blood cells using both their typical projected area in the constriction as well as their compactness or their deformation. Adding a third parameter for classification represented by the &quot;brightness&quot; of the cells, the authors are successfully able to reproduce most of the classical and simple hematological phenotyping present on the market of automated blood counts without any staining steps. Moreover, the authors provide a comprehensive set of examples from leukemia patients, or malaria infection, bacterial and viral infections as well as donor samples with anti-coagulants.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript is well written, interesting and timely. Its strength is clearly the technology, with an impressive collection of data validating expectations, and only a few key concerns temper enthusiasm. We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors over-use the acronym MORE, in particular in the captions. They should replace these with text that highlights the new biological finding or concept that is learned. Moreover, the authors should highlight what is scientifically new for the well-established field of hemorheology.</p><p>2) Statistical significance and confidence should be clarified at different places.</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> the number of EBV cells is not provided. Also, authors define n as number of independent experiments, does this reflect the number of patients or the same patient cells measured over independent experiments? It would be helpful to show single cell distributions for EBV given the focus of the paper.</p><p>- The authors need to comment on the utility and statistical significance of deformation measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> for the 4-6 patients with AML or ALL, since the deformation data adds little to nothing beyond cell size measurements.</p><p>- Given that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-H</xref> is a time series generated from just one patient, it is at least important to provide measures of statistical significance and confidence. Each datapoint is the median for a given day, and so error bars should be added for each day. An asterisk could be added to each datapoint that differs from the first, or some other scheme. More important, given that this is a new method, some type of daily standard (i.e. normal control) should have been run and shown in parallel with the patient measurements. Knowledge of how this data compare to conventional biomarkers/existing methods for analysis following treatment would be helpful to benchmark RTDC.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref> shows control vs exposed but then data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> also includes infected. The difference and disease relevance of exposed vs infected populations should be clarified for the reader.</p><p>The authors claim the greater deformation reduction of infected cells vs entire exposed population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which may be explained by clearance of stiff cells by the spleen. But if stiffer cells are filtered out by the spleen, this would result in a lower deformation reduction.</p><p>It is unclear why the 2BP and PA treatments were performed. It would be helpful for the reader to clarify the motivation for these treatments as they relate to pf infection.</p><p>4) Subsection “MORE analysis of leukocytes” what is the timepoint of mechanical measurements of activated neutrophils published in the older reports? If measurements were performed at different time points, with different methods that deform cells on vastly different timescales, it does not seem to be a conflict.</p><p>Neutrophils were less deformable after fMLP treatment, but became more deformable and larger at longer time points. Given that 'larger cells of identical stiffness should deform more in RTDC' (subsection “MORE analysis of malignant transformed blood cells”), how can these results show that fMLP cells, which are bigger, are less deformable? If larger cells are deforming more in RTDC (and when deformed by inertial flows as in Gossett et al.), then it is difficult to compare to previous methods.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29213.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors over-use the acronym MORE, in particular in the captions.

We have removed it from all captions, and moderated its use throughout.</p><p>The contribution of our method to the well-established field of hemorheology is that it can provide mechanical data of all individual blood cells directly in whole blood and without prior separation. This permits a much more specific investigation of the individual contribution of each blood cell type to the overall rheological properties of blood, which was not possible so far. We have further emphasized this aspect in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Statistical significance and confidence should be clarified at different places.</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> – The number of EBV cells is not provided.

For both, the number of individual cells measured is stated directly in the legend.</p><p>Generally, “n” is the number of independent measurement repeats. If this specifically means different donors/patients, we now explicitly state this at all relevant places in the manuscript.</p><p>We fully agree that single cell distributions of a typical EBV patient blood measurement were missing, and showing them improves the paper by being maximally transparent. We therefore added exemplary single cell distributions for neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes of a healthy donor and patients with ALI, RTI, and EBV as new Figure 3—figure supplement 4. Please note that in addition to the exemplary distributions shown in the manuscript, all raw data – underlying the further processed plots, which only contain the medians for clarity – are available as TDMS files upon request, and can be analyzed by the open source software ShapeOut. This has now been stated explicitly in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors need to comment on the utility and statistical significance of deformation measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> for the 4-6 patients with AML or ALL, since the deformation data adds little to nothing beyond cell size measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>The diagnostic utility of the morpho-rheological analysis of leukemia patient blood is foremost the identification of unusual cell populations (immature blast cells) in whole blood (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B,C</xref>), which will be useful to aid and supplement initial diagnosis. Once identified by appropriate gating, it is then possible to also consider their mechanical properties (deformation vs. size plots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This is at present primarily aimed at establishing a connection to the established field of cancer cell mechanics, which so far mostly deals with solid tumors. The few experiments done on leukemic cells were only possible either for immortal cell lines or for specifically isolated cells (see relevant references in text). Our results confirm the composite picture emerging from these previous studies — that both lymphatic and myeloid blast cells are stiffer (!) than their healthy counterparts — for the first time in real patient samples and without prior isolation. We realize that the description of these results might have been unclear and confusing, referring to how much cells should have deformed or not at the same or different sizes. Enabled by recent progress in the numerical modeling of cell deformation in narrow channels (see Mokbel et al., 2017), we can now also calculate the apparent Young’s modulus of leukocytes. This was not possible before with the analytical model (Mietke et al., 2015) as leukocytes were too small and/or too deformed to be captured by the model. We have now added isolelasticity lines between 0.55 kPa and 1.1 kPa to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> for better parameterization of the deformation-size space and in order to stress the mechanical difference between ALL and AML blast cells compared to the leukocyte subtypes of the norm, as well as compared to each other. In addition to the existing panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, which compares deformation and cell size of ALL blasts with lymphocytes as well as AML blasts with neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils, a new panel was added comparing the apparent Young’s moduli of these cells, including their statistical significance. The methods section was extended to describe the calculation of Young’s moduli and the main text was changed accordingly to clarify the statement about the mechanical differences. We hope that this addresses the reviewers’ point, but want to stress that the main focus of this manuscript is not the detailed mechanical characterization of individual cells (which we now have added for specific examples upon the reviewers’ request) but the identification of patterns visible in the deformation-size scatter plots — the morpho-rheological fingerprint — to identify disease conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Given that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-H</xref> is a time series generated from just one patient, it is at least important to provide measures of statistical significance and confidence. Each datapoint is the median for a given day, and so error bars should be added for each day. An asterisk could be added to each datapoint that differs from the first, or some other scheme. More important, given that this is a new method, some type of daily standard (i.e. normal control) should have been run and shown in parallel with the patient measurements. Knowledge of how this data compare to conventional biomarkers/existing methods for analysis following treatment would be helpful to benchmark RTDC.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a measure of confidence for each individual data point shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> would be useful and appropriate. However, simply adding error bars to the median points or calculating a statistical significance of the difference between two data points is unsuitable for the following reasons:</p><p>i) As one data point of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> is the median of a population of 1,000 to 13,000 cells measured, this value is highly precise. Error bars displaying the standard error of the mean (or equivalent) would disappear behind the median symbols as the relative error is always less than 1% (and in most cases much less than 1%) in both directions – cell size and deformation. Furthermore, displaying the error bars as standard deviation would not add information about either confidence of statistical significance. This would only add information about the spread of the individual populations, information that can also be found in the actual distributions shown in panels E to G, and it would make panel H difficult to read.</p><p>ii) For the same reason of very well defined populations with thousands of underlying data points, any difference between two measurements will always be highly significant. As an example, the measurements of day 7 and day 8 (which are the two points closest to each other in this panel) are statistically significantly different both in cell size and deformation with a p value &lt; 10<sup>–4</sup>. This shows very clearly the unprecedented power of the technique, say compared to AFM measurements. The sheer number of measurements taken makes any difference significant.</p><p>Instead, and as also suggested by the reviewers, a normal standard for the reliability of a sample measurement would be more important and relevant. While we do not have measurements of normal control samples taken on the same days as the patient samples, we did perform extensive control measurements for the stability and reliability of the method (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). These can be used to obtain a confidence region for a single measurement. This confidence region takes into account the behavior of a certain cell type and the variation between repeated measurements of the same donor on a technical level (such as sample handling) and on the biological level as well. Such confidence regions can be calculated from the repeated measurements of the two donors displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>. Panels G-I were added to this figure which show the 68% and 95% confidence regions of a single experiment for neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. The confidence region for lymphocytes was then used and added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> at four data points (day 1, 4, 8, and 12) in order to allow for a better judgment of the degree of the change during the evolution of this time course, and at the same time to preserve the legibility of the figure.</p><p>Conventional biomarkers and existing methods for the analysis of leukemia are the following:</p><p>1) Morphological analysis – of air-dried Romanowsky (Wright, Wright-Giemsa, or May-Grünwald- Giemsa)-stained blood or bone marrow smears. The morphological features identified by microscopic examination may suggest either lymphoid or myeloid differentiation of leukemic cells, but with the exception of the identification of Auer rods in myeloblasts none of these features is lineage-specific. Subclones can be identified by differences in size and morphological features (e. g. cytoplasmatic vacuoles). The time required for analysis comprises 1 – 2 hrs. Amount of material required: 100 µl. The costs are relatively low (estimate: 5 €).</p><p>2) Cytochemical staining – improves the accuracy and reproducibility of lineage assessment and therefore is required for traditional sub-classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) according to the French-American-British (FAB) and WHO criteria. Sudan Black and stains for myeloperoxidase (MPO) to identify myeloblasts and esterase stains like α-naphthyl-butyrate to identify monoblasts have remained useful in this regard. The time required for analysis comprises 1 – 2 hrs. Staining must be performed without undue delay as MPO is unstable and becomes undetectable after a week of storage. Amount of material required: 100 µl. The costs are relatively low (estimate: € 5 – 10).</p><p>3) Immunophenotypic classification – is based on identification of cell surface epitopes or cytoplasmatic proteins by fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies. Flow cytometry (FACS analysis) is nowadays widely used as a particularly powerful method because multiparameter analysis offers the advantage of segregating leukemic cells from non-neoplastic cells. Thus, rapid analysis allows to establish the lineage of the leukemia (e.g. myeloid versus lymphoid), its stage of differentiation (e. g. T- versus B-ALL) and facilitates minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring using a leukemia-specific pattern of markers not expressed in that combination on regular blood or bone marrow cells. Notably, some precursor B-cell ALL might be negative for CD45 (leukocyte common antigen) or patients with T-ALL lack TdT or CD34 expression. Although ALL can be classified according to the stage of maturation, the optimal immunologic sub-classification remains a matter of debate. Many ALLs also aberrantly express myeloid-linage associated antigens (mostly CD13, CD33). Therefore, the antibody screening panel for acute leukemias must be designed to include at least one very sensitive and one relatively specific marker for each hematopoietic and lymphoid lineage. Amount of material required: 100 µl – 1ml. The method can require 1 – 4 hrs of time. The costs have to be considered depending on the quantity of antibodies used (estimate: € 100 – 500).</p><p>4) Molecular (genetic) classification – using traditional methods will detect specific cytogenetic and/or molecular abnormalities in 60 – 80% of ALL and 50 – 60% of AML cases. The recent advent of whole genome analysis has allowed virtually all acute leukemias to be classified according to specific genetic abnormalities. Markers can be separated into leukemia-specific (e.g. BCR-ABL1; t(15;18)) or leukemic-clone specific (e.g. Ig-heavy chain gene rearrangements, T-cell receptor gene rearrangements). Both are valuable for classification, as prognostic indicators with a defined treatment applied, and are nowadays routinely used for monitoring of MRD by exploiting the high sensitivity of PCR-based amplification of specific gene sequences. The technique is time-consuming (1 – 10 days) and expensive (estimate: € 500 – 5,000) and usually performed only in reference laboratories.</p><p>As outlined in table 1 below, when compared to these established conventional methods the advantages of morpho-rheological phenotyping are represented by a very short time for analysis and the minimum amount of blood required. The technique has comparable power with regard to the identification of leukemic cells and the identification of leukemic sub-clones. Its applicability to classify the leukemic lineage (for example by significant differences in size, deformation, and Young’s modulus; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and to detect small numbers of leukemic cells can theoretically be expected and has been shown in single cases already, but still has to be tested and proven in a formal comparison, which is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>Table 1: Comparison of conventional markers of leukemia with MORE analysis</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"> <bold>Issue of</bold> <break/> <bold>analysis</bold> <break/><bold>Metho-</bold> <break/><bold>dology</bold></td><td valign="top">Identifi-cation of leukemic cells</td><td valign="top">Identification of leukemic subclones</td><td valign="top">Classifi-cation of leukemic lineage</td><td valign="top">Lower limit for detection of MRD</td><td valign="top">Amount of material required</td><td valign="top">Time required for ana-lysis</td><td valign="top">Est. cost of ana-lysis <break/>[€]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Morpho-logical analysis</bold></td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Only if based on morpho-logical differ-rences</td><td valign="top">Uncertain</td><td valign="top">1 / 1x10<sup>2</sup></td><td valign="top">100 µl</td><td valign="top">1 – 2 h</td><td valign="top">5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Cyto-chemical</bold> <break/><bold>staining</bold></td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">1 / 1x10<sup>2</sup></td><td valign="top">100 µl</td><td valign="top">1 –2 h</td><td valign="top">10</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>FACS analysis</bold></td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">1 / 5x10<sup>3</sup> <break/>– 1x10<sup>4</sup></td><td valign="top">100 – 1000 µl</td><td valign="top">1 – 4 h</td><td valign="top">100 – 500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Molecular analysis</bold></td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">1/ 1x10<sup>4</sup> <break/>– 1x10<sup>6</sup></td><td valign="top">5 – 10 ml</td><td valign="top">1 – 10 days</td><td valign="top">500 – 5000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>MORE analysis</bold></td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Possible, but not yet formally tested</td><td valign="top">Possible, but not yet formally tested</td><td valign="top">10 µl</td><td valign="top">30 min</td><td valign="top">20</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Abbreviations: FACS Fluorescence activated cell scanning; MRD minimal residual disease; MORE morpho-rheological</p><p>Response to treatment is one of the most powerful prognostic “in vivo” markers of leukemia survival. In pediatric ALL the number of blasts at day 8 after start of methylprednisolone treatment is predictive of the relapse rate (&lt; 1,000 blasts/µl of blood: relapse rate 20 – 30%; &gt;1,000 blasts/µl of blood: relapse rate 50 – 80%). As only the morphological analysis is used to monitor the effects of methylprednisolone treatment in ALL over the first 12 days at present, MORE analysis provides at least the same information about the treatment success in a shorter amount of time and with smaller sample sizes required. Potentially, the rheological features of blast cells might represent additional prognostic biomarkers for leukemic cells (stiffness might correlate to drug sensitivity or refractoriness, or identify a leukemic subclone), which will be the subject of future studies. Morpho-rheological phenotyping, thus, compares very well to established biomarkers for following ALL treatment success. We have added a short statement summarizing these aspects in the revised manuscript and appended the comparison table as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref> shows control vs exposed but then data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> also includes infected. The difference and disease relevance of exposed vs infected populations should be clarified for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, which helps us clarifying the experimental procedure. What we call “exposed” is the RBC sample with vital <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasites present in the sample. Of all the RBCs, only a small percentage of cells is actually infected by a parasite (the percentage of infected cells is called parasitemia and given in percent). This is true for both our in vitro experiment, as well as the disease-relevant situation in vivo (even though parasitemias in vivo are usually smaller than used here). So, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> actually shows the distribution of deformation and size in an exposed population (exposed cells shown as blue dots), with the few infected cells (identified by the white image feature shown in the inset) labeled by the red dots. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> then shows the analysis of median deformation of all control (black, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), exposed (blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and actually infected (red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) cells over the 46h course of the experiment. We have relabeled the x-axis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> (and of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) as “incubation time” (rather than “time post infection”) and modified the main text, the figure caption, and the methods description to make the difference between exposed and infected clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim the greater deformation reduction of infected cells vs entire exposed population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which may be explained by clearance of stiff cells by the spleen. But if stiffer cells are filtered out by the spleen, this would result in a lower deformation reduction.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valuable remark. The apparent contradiction can be resolved by pointing out that our experiments were done in vitro and we did not analyze blood actually taken from malaria patients. The comment about removal of stiffer cells by the spleen then relates to the extrapolation of our in vitro results to the situation in vivo. We have clarified the sentence in the main text to avoid confusion and we are looking forward to investigating hemorheological changes of in vivo parasitemia and thereby further assess the diagnostic value for patients with malaria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear why the 2BP and PA treatments were performed. It would be helpful for the reader to clarify the motivation for these treatments as they relate to pf infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We realize that the 2BP and PA experiments had not been well motivated. Reduced membrane-cytoskeleton interactions have previously been correlated to elliptocytic RBCs and resistance to P.f. infection (Chishti et al., 1996). The characteristic biconcave morphology of RBCs can be chemically altered by the use of 2-bromo-palmitate (2BP), an efficient inhibitor of palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) (Lach et al., 2012). 2BP is commonly used to inhibit palmitoylation of proteins, but it should be also pointed out that it is an analogue of palmitic acid (PA) and as such will readily partition into the membranes. Since it is used at relatively high concentrations (100 µM), it might significantly change the biophysical properties of the membranes, where it accumulates. To discriminate between these two effects, we used palmitic acid, which similarly to 2BP will accumulate in the membranes, but will not inhibit protein palmitoylation. In this respect our data clearly point out that RBC protein palmitoylation and not accumulation of the “fatty acids” in the membranes, is critical for the infectivity of P. f. We have altered the main text to clarify the rationale for these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “MORE analysis of leukocytes” what is the timepoint of mechanical measurements of activated neutrophils published in the older reports? If measurements were performed at different time points, with different methods that deform cells on vastly different timescales, it does not seem to be a conflict.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, a very valuable comment. We have looked for the times when the effect of fMLP stimulation was determined in the older reports. In Worthen et al., 1989, treatment with fMLP was for 30 sec at different concentrations, but the time of measurement is not reported. As 30–80 cells were manually measured with a cell poker it has to be assumed that the duration of the experiment covered the entire timescale assessed in our experiments (0–60 min). Similarly, in Rosenbluth et al., 2008 neutrophils were exposed to 10 ng/mL fMLP for 5 min, but it is not reported how much later the measurements were taken. Both these studies reported a stiffening. The only other study we are aware of that reported a softening was Gossett et al., 2012. However, neutrophils were stimulated for 45 min so the initial stiffening the other reports (and we) find might have been missed. In addition, also the fMLP concentration of 10 µM used by Gossett at al. is rather high and non-physiological, and renders neutrophil incapable of depriming. These points, in addition to the fact that the different methods probe cells on vastly different timescales as the reviewers correctly state, the different modes of testing (see Ravetto et al., 2014), and the potentially different levels of pre-activation due to isolation of neutrophils from whole blood necessary for previous techniques (see also new results added in response to one of the minor comments below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) render the perceived conflict, as stated in the original manuscript, insubstantial.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Neutrophils were less deformable after fMLP treatment, but became more deformable and larger at longer time points. Given that 'larger cells of identical stiffness should deform more in RTDC' (subsection “MORE analysis of malignant transformed blood cells”), how can these results show that fMLP cells, which are bigger, are less deformable? If larger cells are deforming more in RTDC (and when deformed by inertial flows as in Gossett et al.), then it is difficult to compare to previous methods.</p></disp-quote><p>A very good point. We had not been careful enough in only describing cells as more or less “deformed” and accidentally slipped in “deformable” here. As stated above, we can now actually calculate the apparent Young’s modulus of these cells and take the combined change of size and deformation into account. Indeed, there is first a significant increase in Young’s modulus for the first 15 min, which then drops back to slightly below the initial value (even though the difference to before is not significant). Considering this, and the previous point, we have now removed any mention of a seeming conflict between previous results, and instead describe in more detail the actual time-resolved mechanical changes taking place during the first hour of neutrophil activation, which has never been reported before.</p></body></sub-article></article>
