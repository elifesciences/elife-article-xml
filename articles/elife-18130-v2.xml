In the modular voltage-gated ion channels the central ion-conducting pore is surrounded by four voltage sensing domains (VSDs). Here, the energetic coupling is mediated by interactions between the S4-S5 linker, covalently linking the domains, and the proximal C-terminus. In order to characterize the intrinsic gating of the voltage sensing domain in the absence of the pore domain, the Shaker Kv channel was truncated after the fourth transmembrane helix S4 (Shaker-iVSD). Shaker-iVSD showed significantly altered gating kinetics and formed a cation-selective ion channel with a strong preference for protons. Ion conduction in Shaker-iVSD developed despite identical primary sequence, indicating an allosteric influence of the pore domain. Shaker-iVSD also displays pronounced 'relaxation'. Closing of the pore correlates with entry into relaxation suggesting that the two processes are energetically related.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18130.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18130.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18130.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells in the heart and other muscles rely on electrical signals to coordinate their activity. They generate these electrical signals by controlling the movement of ions across the membrane that surrounds each cell. Proteins called ion channels in this membrane form pores that allow particular types of ions to pass through. The opening and closing of the pores is tightly controlled so that electrical signals are only generated at specific times.</p><p>The Shaker Kv channel is an ion channel that allows potassium ions to pass through the membrane. This protein is made of several modules including one called the voltage sensing domain, which senses changes in the electrical voltage across the membrane to open or close the pore module. However, it is not clear how voltage sensing domain and pore influence each other’s structure and behaviour. To address this question, Zhao and Blunck investigated how the voltage sensing domain behaves in animal cells when the pore module is absent.</p><p>Zhao and Blunck show that, in the absence of the pore module, the voltage sensing domain becomes an ion channel that allows protons and other positively-charged ions to pass through the membrane. Further experiments reveal this new channel opens at a voltage when the main Shaker Kv channel is usually closed. This may result in small leaks of ions across the membrane that cause long-lasting changes in the timing, intensity and number of electrical signals in cells and organs. The findings of Zhao and Blunck suggest that different modules of ion channels influence each other more than previously thought.</p><p>The next steps following on from this work are to explore how the voltage sensing domain channels open and close in more detail and to examine how the pore module influences this behaviour. Investigating whether similar leaks occur in the voltage sensing domains of other ion channels may aid research into some inherited heart or neurological disorders where the channels are cut short between the voltage sensing domain and the pore module.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18130.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18130.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>voltage sensor</kwd><kwd>potassium channel</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>voltage-clamp fluorometry</kwd><kwd>mode-shift</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-136894</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blunck</surname><given-names>Rikard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DG- 327201-2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blunck</surname><given-names>Rikard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-102689</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blunck</surname><given-names>Rikard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDMC-CREATE postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Expression of the isolated voltage sensing domain significantly alters its structural conformation as well as its gating kinetics, indicating the importance of studying the biological assembly in its entirety.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage-gated ion channels play a fundamental role in a wide range of physiological processes, including the generation and propagation of electrical signals in excitable cells and muscle tissues, neurotransmitter release in pre-synaptic nerve endings, and maintaining cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hille, 1978</xref>). They comprise four subunits of each six transmembrane segments (S1–S6), which are assembled into two functionally distinct parts: a central ion-selective pore formed by the combined S5 and S6 segments of four domains, surrounded by four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) formed by the four helices S1–S4. S4 is considered the principal component of voltage sensing because it contains positively charged residues that are periodically aligned at every third position. The first four arginines (R1-R4) of S4 sense and interact with the surrounding electric field, and move the S4 outward during depolarization and inward during hyperpolarization in a combination of translation, rotation and tilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faure et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vargas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012</xref>).

The notion that the VSD acts as an independent module is further supported by proteins where the VSD is linked not to a pore domain but instead to a cytosolic enzymatic domain such as the voltage-sensitive phosphatase of <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> (Ci-VSP). It was possible to carry out structural studies on isolated voltage sensor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakrapani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>), and the VSD of Ci-VSP has been shown to function in the absence of the phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Labro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murata et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, the voltage-gated proton channels (Hv) lack a separate pore domain altogether such that its VSD is directly responsible for proton permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>). In view of the modular nature of voltage-gated ion channels, VSDs have been considered in structure function studies largely as their own entity with energetic coupling to the pore domain, and they have been directly compared to other VSD-containing proteins such as Ci-VSP and Hv channels. We do not know, however, how possible restraint forces from the pore domain may have obscured conformational changes during VSD activation.</p><p>Prolonged depolarization has been shown to reconfigure VSDs of numerous voltage-gated proteins into a stable ‘relaxed’ state, resulting in a hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage dependence of both pore closure and return of the VSD to its resting position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haddad and Blunck, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuzmenkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruening-Wright and Larsson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villalba-Galea et al., 2008</xref>). Relaxation or mode shift has been shown to be influenced by the state of the pore domain; it was observed to be correlated with slow C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuello et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Männikkö et al., 2005</xref>) and pore stabilization in the open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haddad and Blunck, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, mode shift also developed in Ci-VSP, which does not possess any pore domain, suggesting relaxation to be an intrinsic property of the VSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Labro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villalba-Galea et al., 2008</xref>).

However, the conformational changes related to relaxation remain unknown.</p><p>To gain insights into the gating mechanisms of the Shaker potassium channel VSD as an independent structural and functional unit, we generated a Shaker channel pore deletion mutant, the Shaker isolated voltage sensor domain (Shaker-iVSD). In Shaker-iVSD any conformational changes would not be affected any longer by the energetic load or by structural constraints imposed by the pore domain.

Oocytes, expressing Shaker-iVSD and labeled with TMRM, exhibited clear fluorescence signals two days after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and d</xref>). The time course of the normalized fluorescence change did not alter during activation in the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> but deactivation was slowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and d</xref>). Accordingly, also the fluorescence voltage (<italic>FV</italic>) relation remained unaltered. While the activation kinetics and <italic>FV</italic> remained unaltered, the relative fluorescence change was diminished with increasing Zn<sup>2+</sup>-concentration similar to the decrease in current amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and e</xref>). A reduced relative fluorescence change indicates that immobilization of the voltage sensor by Zn<sup>2+</sup> caused the current decrease. Fluorophores attached to voltage sensors immobilized by Zn<sup>2+</sup> would still contribute to the total fluorescence intensity (F) but would no longer be displaced and thus not display a voltage dependent change (dF). Accordingly, the relative fluorescence change dF/F would be lower. This was further validated by the reduction in gating currents with addition of Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In Hv1 channels, histidines at position H140 and H193 have been shown to be responsible for the Zn<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takeshita et al., 2014</xref>). These histidines are positioned at the entry to the gating pore, right above the positively charged arginines of the S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) and would thus prevent proton conduction through the pore. While the histidines are not conserved in Shaker-iVSD, H140 and H193 align with F280 and E335, respectively. F280 unlikely coordinates a Zn<sup>2+</sup>, this role is more likely taken over by either D277 or E283. The lower affinity of glutamate and aspartate might be responsible for the lower sensitivity of Shaker-iVSD to Zn<sup>2+</sup>, as we find ~40% of the current still at 20 µM, at which Hv1 is already fully blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takeshita et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Wild type Shaker channels are stabilized in the closed state by external (300 µM) Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boland et al., 1994</xref>). In Shaker-iVSD, this would reflect the conducting state. However, the addition of external Zn<sup>2+</sup> to Shaker-iVSD did reduce and not increase the current at −90 mV, suggesting that either binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> caused the voltage sensing domain to adopt its ‘native’ conformation (i.e. the non-conducting one in the full Shaker channel) or that the Zn<sup>2+</sup> directly blocks the ion permeation pathway. The position of D277/E283 and E335 – corresponding to H140 and H194 – support the notion that the ion permeation follows the pathway through the gating pore like in Hv1 and ω-currents.</p><p>To corroborate this finding, we substituted D277 with histidine (D277H) and tested the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity. (Unfortunately, the double mutant D277H-E335H did not express sufficiently.) The voltage dependence of opening of Shaker-iVSD-D277H was shifted to more hyperpolarized potentials (V<sub>½</sub> = −99 mV). While the kinetics were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g–h</xref>). When blocking the currents with Zn<sup>2+</sup>, we found that the channel showed a 40-times higher affinity to Zn<sup>2+</sup> with an IC50 of 0.15 µM versus 6 µM for Shaker-iVSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>), confirming the pathway through the gating pore in the central voltage sensor domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Kinetics of the iVSD channel</title><p>The development of ionic current in the absence of a pore domain shows that the Shaker-iVSD adopts a different conformation than the voltage sensing domain in the complete channel protein.

We determined the <italic>FV</italic> relationships for Shaker-iVSD for holding potentials between −90 mV and +90 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Just like wild type Shaker channels, the <italic>FV</italic> relations were shifted to more hyperpolarized potentials when holding at depolarized potentials. The shift of the <italic>FV</italic> relations was more pronounced in Shaker-iVSD, shifting by −95 mV compared to −31 mV shift of Shaker-W434F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The <italic>FV</italic> relations of Shaker-iVSD were continuously shifted to more hyperpolarized potentials at more depolarized holding potentials and did not saturate within the tested holding potentials. Unfortunately, holding at more extreme potentials did not yield reliable data since the oocytes did not remain stable for sufficiently long time. In Shaker-W434F, the shift already saturated at a holding potential of −30 mV.</p><p>The much more pronounced mode shift in the isolated voltage sensor versus the complete Shaker channel indicated that the Shaker-iVSD requires much stronger hyperpolarization to return to its resting position when lacking the pore domain. We were interested in comparing the time course for entering the mode shift of Shaker-iVSD with the development of the ionic current. We applied pre-pulses of increasing duration from a holding potential of 0 mV to −90 mV, followed by a series of test pulses, determining the relative fluorescence change. For Shaker-iVSD, the resulting curve was mono-exponential with a time constant of 452 ms, whereas recovery from relaxation occurred in double-exponential fashion with time constants of 36 ms and 279 ms for Shaker-W434F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c–e</xref>). The mode shift coincided temporally with the onset of the ionic current in Shaker-iVSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>), indicating that the permeation pathway, although open in both resting and activated state, closes during relaxation of the voltage sensing domain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The voltage sensing domain of the Shaker Kv channel altered its behaviour significantly when expressed in the absence of the pore domain. The voltage dependence is much shallower than the voltage dependence of Shaker-WT and it is evident from the development of cation conduction that the voltage sensing domain assumes a different structural conformation than in the full-length channel. The shallower voltage dependence is probably related to a dispersion of the electric field in the voltage sensor; with the 'hydrophobic plug' or 'gating charge transfer center' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tao et al., 2010</xref>) no longer intact, the electric field will be less focussed and thus diminish the effective valence of the gating transition. There are two possible explanations for the rearrangements, (i) the missing interaction with the pore domain leads to a different, energetically more favourable state of the entire voltage sensing domain, or (ii) uncoupling from the pore domain allows the voltage sensor to continue its normal gating movement and enter a deeper resting state not accessible in the wild type. If the second case were true, the deactivation kinetics (i.e. here: return to 0 mV) should remain unaltered, but we observed significant slowing of deactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). More importantly, activation of the voltage sensor, monitored by the fast fluorescence change, did not close the ion conduction pathway: the activation kinetics when holding at −90 mV (<italic>resting</italic>), measured via fluorescence, were fast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), and the current did not reduce during a 250 ms-pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). iVSD thus leaves the conducting state only very slowly, whereas entering is significantly faster albeit slower than the gating kinetics of wild type Shaker channels.</p><p>The effects can be explained by a simple model for entering the relaxed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>), where both the <italic>resting</italic> and <italic>activated</italic> state are conducting, whereas the <italic>relaxed</italic> state is non-conducting. We can assign the fluorescence changes to the fast transition from <italic>resting</italic> to the <italic>activated</italic> state. The current vanishes when entering the <italic>relaxed</italic> state, but this transition is silent in the fluorescence changes. This model is supported by the temporal correlation between relaxation (mode-shifting) and the opening of the iVSD-channel from a holding potential of 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Our data do not exclude the possibility that additional states exist. Channel closing and relaxation, although linked, do not necessarily have to be identical transitions, or an <italic>activated-relaxed</italic> state as suggested by Bezanilla and co-workers is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Labro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villalba-Galea et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The permeation path is likely to be similar to those described for the ω-currents and Hv1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Starace and Bezanilla, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tombola et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takeshita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tombola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Musset et al., 2011</xref>). This notion is supported by the block through Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) as the location of the involved residues are positioned at the entrance to the gating pore.</p><p>In the case of the proton and ω-currents passing through the Shaker voltage sensing domain, it is suggested that the cations follow the path normally taken up by the arginines in S4 responsible for the gating charges. In both cases, the arginines were replaced either with histidines or cysteines. In the activated wild type Shaker, these arginines are coordinated by acidic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vargas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Long et al., 2005a</xref>); more specifically, the second, third and fourth cationic residues in S4, R3 (R368), R4 (R371) and K5 (K374), are coordinated by the acidic residues E247, E283 and E293, respectively, according to the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Long et al., 2007</xref>). This coordination is likely transferred to R1 (R362) and R2 (R365) in the transition to the resting state when the S4 assumes its ‘down’ position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vargas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Starace and Bezanilla, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In Hv1 channels in resting position, similarly, R3 (R208) is coordinated by the aspartate D112, responsible for the proton selectivity in these proton channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takeshita et al., 2014</xref>). The major difference between the voltage sensors of Shaker and Hv1 are an abundance of basic and acidic residues pointing towards the common interface, respectively. In Shaker, we can therefore assume that every acidic residue in the core of the VSD remains coordinated to an arginine whereas, in Hv1, D112 likely becomes uncoordinated in the activated position because the fifth positive charge in S4 is missing. D112 can then act as the selectivity filter facilitating proton transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takeshita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Musset et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In Shaker-iVSD, no residue in the core of the VSD has been mutated, indicating that the salt bridges between R1-R6 and the acidic residues of S1-S3 must have been broken by a different conformational change. At this time, it would be purely speculative to specify which salt bridge would be responsible without further information or a high-resolution structure.</p><p>We can, however, link gating of the Shaker-iVSD channel to relaxation of the VSD. Relaxation or mode shift is the displacement of the voltage dependence of charge movement and conductance to more hyperpolarized potentials upon prolonged holding at hyperpolarized potentials. Relaxation has been linked to C-type inactivation, stabilization of the open state, length of the S3-S4 linker and N-terminus in different constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haddad and Blunck, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuzmenkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruening-Wright and Larsson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villalba-Galea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Priest et al., 2013</xref>). While the S3-S4 linker and the N-terminus (T1 domain) rest intact and may still influence relaxation, in the absence of the pore, neither C-type inactivation nor open state stabilization may have an influence. In the resting and activated state, Shaker-iVSD forms a cation-selective pore whereas this pore is closed in the relaxed state, indicating that the acidic residues responsible for the cation pore are no longer accessible either by reorientation or coordination with a basic residue. Alternatively, relaxation might stabilize the ‘native’ conformation of the voltage sensing domain.</p><p>The conformational changes of the voltage sensing domain in the absence of the pore domain might be minor, but the development of a cation pore and the much slower kinetics in spite of the same primary sequence indicates that the stabilizing effects of the pore domain are essential for the native function. Stabilization might include direct protein-protein contacts between the voltage sensing domain and S5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li-Smerin et al., 2000</xref>), in the coupling region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batulan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wall-Lacelle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haddad and Blunck, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muroi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catterall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bezanilla, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Labro et al., 2008</xref>) or between voltage sensing domain and pore at the outer surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petitjean et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lainé et al., 2003</xref>). Stabilization might also be evoked by the energetic interaction between the domains for instance the missing coupling or cooperativity between subunits.</p><p>In the construct used here, we removed the pore region and the C-terminus whereas the N-terminal tetramerization (T1)-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 1992</xref>) is still present. The T1-domain is responsible for the correct assembly of Kv tetramers and can tetramerize in the isolated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kreusch et al., 1998</xref>). It is therefore possible that the Shaker-iVSD are held together in the cytosol by the T1-domain. While this leaves the possibility that the voltage sensors interact with each other, the higher sensitivity of D277H to zinc block indicates that this interaction is not responsible for the formation of the permeation pathway. The position of D277H suggests that the ions pass through the gating pore in the center of the VSD as discussed above.</p><p>The system as a whole will have a different energy landscape than the isolated domains, which becomes evident in the very different voltage ranges causing relaxation in Shaker-W434F and –iVSD. In most cases, these effects cannot be strictly separated. Although interpretation is facilitated when domains of macromolecules are considered separate entities with energetic interactions, it is essential when interpreting macromolecular structure function relations or structures of isolated domains to keep in mind that the final assembly does not necessarily behave like the sum of its components and might adopt a different conformation.</p><p>The fact that simply removing the pore domain of the Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel leads to a voltage-gated cation channel suggests that the structural link between Kv and Hv channels might be closer than previously thought. If the phenomenon of a cation leak for the isolated voltage sensor is conserved also in other voltage-gated ion channels, it might be responsible for disease development in truncation mutants downstream of S4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>The wild-type background Shaker H4 channel cDNA with inactivation peptide removed (IR, Δ6–46) in a pBSTA vector was used as a template for all mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batulan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 1991</xref>).

fluorescence changes of Shaker-iVSD and –W434F by pulsing from 0 mV to −90 mV for various durations (5–5000 ms) before applying a series of test pulses using the cut-open oocyte voltage-clamp technique.</p><p>For Shaker-iVSD, the V<sub>1/2</sub> values of the <italic>FV</italic> curves as a function of the pre-pulse duration to −90 mV were obtained by fitting each curve to a single Boltzmann function. For Shaker-W434F, <italic>FV</italic> curves were fitted with double Boltzmann functions, and the resulting distribution was a superposition of two Boltzmann curves representing the <italic>FV</italic> relation at a holding potential of 0 mV (<italic>FV</italic><sub>0 mV</sub>) and the mode-shifted <italic>FV</italic> relationship when pre-pulse duration at −90 mV ≥ 1000 ms (<italic>FV</italic><sub>−90 mV</sub>). The fractional amplitudes of FV<sub>−90 mV</sub> component are shown as a function of pre-pulse duration.</p><p>All the fluorescence, gating, and ionic current measurements were analyzed using a combination of Analysis software (Department of Anesthesiology, University of California, Los Angeles) and SigmaPlot for Windows version 12.5 (SPS, Chicago, IL, USA). Data reported throughout the text and figures are reported as mean ± SEM.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Mireille Marsolais for technical support and Georges A Haddad for generating the initial construct.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Kenton J Swartz (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is Baron Chanda (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript describing the discovery that deletion of the pore domain of the Shaker Kv channel has a profound influence on the behavior of the remaining S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains. Remarkably, this deletion causes the remaining four voltage-sensing domains to conduct cations over a wide range of voltages where fluorescence experiments show that the sensors fluctuate between resting and activated states, and that the conduction pathway only closes as the sensors enter the relaxed state that predominates at positive voltages. The permeation pathway appears to be relatively non-selective, and the authors estimate the selectivity sequence as H<sup>+</sup>&gt;Na<sup>+</sup>=K<sup>+</sup>&gt;NMDG<sup>+</sup>. Deletion of the pore-domain also has a profound influence on the energetics of voltage-sensor activation, causing a decrease in the valence of <italic>FV</italic> relations by about 5-fold. The manuscript is well-written and the data support most of the conclusions the authors advance. That the pore has such a substantial impact on the voltage sensors is really quite surprising, and we think the work is appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is confusion about how the proton current measurements were made and what solutions were used. The authors state that they used NMDG-MES plus HEPES in most of their solutions. Is MES short for methanesulfonic acid, a commonly used anion in gating current measurements, or is it 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, a common pH buffer? If it is the former, HEPES would be a good choice for neutral pH measurements, but would not be optimal for more acidic or basic pH measurements. Also, most labs studying proton currents use the appropriate buffers at high concentration. The authors should clarify and justify their choice of buffers, and it would be ideal if they could make confirmatory measurements using appropriate buffers for the different pH measurements. The authors state that the currents in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> are leak subtracted using P/4 and those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> are unsubtracted. However, for the ion selectivity measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the legend states that currents are leak subtracted, but does not specify how. It will not be trivial to accurately quantify and subtract leak currents in those experiments and we could imagine rather large errors depending on how subtraction was done. Finally, as the conductance measured is not very proton selective, it would be more appropriate to use 'cation' channel instead of proton channel in the title and elsewhere.</p><p>2) The experiments with Zn seem quite complicated could be interpreted in multiple ways. In the Results section, the authors state: &quot;A reduced relative fluorescence change indicates that immobilization of the voltage sensor by Zn caused the current decrease. Fluorophores attached to voltage sensors immobilized by Zn would still contribute to the total fluorescence intensity but would no longer be displaced and thus not display a voltage dependent change (dF). Accordingly, the relative fluorescence change dF/F would be lower.&quot; We would expect stabilization of a state to shift the <italic>FV</italic> rather than diminishing dF/F. Of course it could be that Zn produces a huge shift beyond what can be measured. But other things could be going on too. Perhaps Zn simply blocks the permeation pathway (as is invoked on the next page), and Zn binding might modify quench TMR fluorescence. The author's conclusion may be correct, but would like to hear a clearer presentation of the Zn results and what they mean. It would also be helpful if the fluorescence data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> was presented with and without normalization so the reader could evaluate the actual data and see whether Zn only effects dF or alternatively might also be affecting F.</p><p>3) Given the data that are presented, there is a nagging concern that the expressed construct may not be the direct source of the currents measured. It would be ideal for the authors to do additional experiments to rule out the contribution of some endogenous channels. It is possible that the isolated voltage-sensing domain associates or modulates the conductance of the endogenous channel (minK like effect- see Wang and Goldstein, 1995 Neuron) rather than forming a channel on its own. The zinc experiments address those concerns to some degree but zinc is also non-specific and will inhibit many channels with exposed cysteines or histidines. We suggest that the authors attempt to express their construct in mammalian cells and also to introduce Cys residues at positions in S4 where reaction with MTS reagents could inhibit the currents measured. We are not asking for an extensive set of new experiments, but would like additional support for the main conclusion of this paper.</p><p>4) The main purpose of the paper is to investigate the VSD conformational changes associated with channel activation when the pore domain is missing. Ideally, this could be achieved by studying the behavior of the VSD in isolation. The Shaker-iVSD construct is truncated soon after the VSD, but still contains the N-terminal tetramerization domain (T1D, Li et al. Science 1992, Shen et al. Neuron 1993). While the T1D is not always necessary to induce tetramerization of the full-length channel (Tu et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1996), it forms tetramers on its own (Kreusch et al. Nature 1998), and could potentially induce VSD oligomerization in the absence of transmembrane segments S5 and S6. Knowing the oligomeric state of Shaker-iVSD can inform on whether the observed ion conduction and changes in activating transitions are the direct result of the uncoupling from the pore domain or the result of a supramolecular assembly that the VSDs are forced to adopt when the pore domain is not there. Although determining the oligomeric state of the present construct may not be straightforward, it would be good for the authors to discuss this issue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18130.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) There is confusion about how the proton current measurements were made and what solutions were used.

We think that this is exactly what is happening here, and we therefore called it “immobilized”.</p><p>However, the reviewers are also correct that the effects could be explained if binding of Zn to iVSD had two effects: 1) blocking on the permeation pathway and 2) removal of the quenching effect. In this case, both effects could potentially originate from different proteins as long as both effects bind Zn with the same affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Zn itself did not quench fluorescence as we did not observe a significant decrease in the total fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> top).</p><p>We added a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), showing the reduction of the gating currents upon addition of Zn. If the effect of Zn on iVSD would merely be prevention of fluorescence quenching, the gating currents should not have been effected. However, the gating currents reduce like the current and the fluorescence traces indicating that indeed voltage sensor movement is impaired.</p><p>We also showed with histidine-mutants (see 3 below) that the currents originate from iVSD further supporting our interpretation.</p><p>We added the non-normalized fluorescence traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, as well as the histidine mutants. We also altered the text to explain the interpretation more in detail.</p><p><italic>3) Given the data that are presented, there is a nagging concern that the expressed construct may not be the direct source of the currents measured.

The observed effects were the same, indicating that the currents do originate from iVSD itself and not endogenous currents of the oocytes.</p><p>We made a histidine mutation in iVSD mimicking the HV1 channels and significantly increased the sensitivity of the Zn block. The voltage dependence of the currents was also shifted to more hyperpolarized potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-I</xref>). If the currents were originating from other channels, mutating iVSD would not have such a profound effect on the current. Unfortunately, the double mutant D277H-E335H did not express sufficiently.</p><p><italic>4) The main purpose of the paper is to investigate the VSD conformational changes associated with channel activation when the pore domain is missing.

Although determining the oligomeric state of the present construct may not be straightforward, it would be good for the authors to discuss this issue.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we added a discussion of the possible role of the T1 domain to the manuscript (Discussion, ninth paragraph). We also mentioned its possible influence on development of relaxation (Discussion, seventh paragraph).</p><p>We are currently in the process of determining the oligomeric state of iVSD since it might form oligomers even in the absence of the T1 domain. This would be beyond the scope of the current manuscript, though. However, just like Hv1 channels, we do not think that an eventual oligomerization would be responsible for development of the permeation path. The D277H mutant shows that permeation occurs through the gating pore.</p></body></sub-article></article>
