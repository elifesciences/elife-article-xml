a polymyxin B (PMB)-induced PmrAB two-component system appears to be a dominant phenomenon in PMB-resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>. PMB-resistant variants and many clinical isolates also appeared to produce outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses revealed that upregulation of the <italic>pmr</italic> operon and decreased membrane-linkage proteins (OmpA, OmpW, and BamE) are linked to overproduction of OMVs, which also promoted enhanced biofilm formation. The addition of OMVs from PMB-resistant variants into the cultures of PMB-susceptible <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and the clinical isolates protected these susceptible bacteria from PMB. Taxonomic profiling of in vitro human gut microbiomes under anaerobic conditions demonstrated that OMVs completely protected the microbial community against PMB treatment. A <italic>Galleria mellonella-</italic>infection model with PMB treatment showed that OMVs increased the mortality rate of larvae by protecting <italic>A. baumannii</italic> from PMB. Taken together, OMVs released from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> functioned as decoys against PMB.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Wrapped in a thick, protective outer membrane, <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> bacteria can sometimes cause serious infections when they find their way into human lungs and urinary tracts.

The incidence and prevalence of multidrug-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (MRAB), which are resistant to various antibiotics including sulbactam and tigecycline, threaten the effective prevention and treatment of MRAB-related infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brauers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsan and Klompas, 2010</xref>). The broad-spectrum β-lactam carbapenem antibiotics, such as imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem, are mainly used to treat severe MRAB infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Papp-Wallace et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). Unfortunately, studies have reported the spread of MRAB clonal complex 92, which contains the <italic>blaOXA-23</italic> gene encoding a carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antunes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>). Mobile genetic elements, particularly <italic>ISAba I</italic> upstream of the <italic>blaOXA</italic>-type genes, allow <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains to transmit the antibiotic resistance (AR) gene to other bacteria and the environment through horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahador et al., 2015</xref>). Carbapenem-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (CRAB) is a top-priority pathogen, for which new antibiotics or combination therapies are desperately needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shlaes and Bradford, 2018</xref>). Lack of an efficacious treatment for MRAB and CRAB infections has caused a reversion to initial treatments involving drugs that are considered dated now, such as colistin and polymyxin B (PMB), despite the adverse effects of these drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Velkov et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Polymyxins are cationic polypeptide antibiotics that specifically kill Gram-negative bacteria by binding to the bacterial outer membrane (OM). These last-resort antimicrobial agents interact with the negatively charged lipopolysaccharide (LPS) components of the OM by displacing positively charged ions, such as Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Consequently, the integrity of the cell membrane is impaired, leading to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jeannot et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moffatt et al., 2019</xref>). Modification of lipid A in LPS by <italic>pmrCAB</italic> and <italic>arnBCADTEF</italic> gene products, which are modulators of the bacterial OM surface charge and permeability, is generally recognized as a primary mechanism of resistance to polymyxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Trent et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olaitan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jeannot et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>pmrCAB</italic> and <italic>arnBCADTEF</italic> operons regulated by a PmrAB two-component system modify lipid A by adding 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-arabinose (LAra4N) and phosphoethanolamine (PetN), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kline et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arroyo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelletier et al., 2013</xref>). Activation of the <italic>arnT</italic> operon (<italic>arnBCADTEF</italic>, also called as the <italic>pmrHFIJKLM</italic> operon) adds LAra4N groups to lipid A only in several Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli, Yersinia pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic>, but not in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> or <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Trent et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinha et al., 2019</xref>). Because <italic>A. baumannii</italic> lacks the genes for the biosynthesis of LAra4N, it uses PetN addition as the main polymyxin-resistance mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerson et al., 2019</xref>). In PMB-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, the mutant PmrB protein is autophosphorylated, consequently phosphorylating the cytoplasmic transcriptional regulator PmrA. Phosphorylated PmrA then upregulates the PetN transferase PmrC and prevents PMB binding to lipid A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cannatelli et al., 2014</xref>). These modifications in lipid A decrease the negative charge of the cell membrane, reducing the membrane-binding affinity of PMB. Consequently, the cell is protected from the PMB-mediated disruption of its membrane and survives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Trimble et al., 2016</xref>). In some <italic>A. baumannii</italic> clinical isolates, expression of the <italic>eptA</italic> gene is activated by the adjacent <italic>ISAba I</italic> sequence, and the gene product PmrC homolog contributes to PMB resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Trebosc et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>E. coli</italic> producing outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) can survive in the presence of PMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manning and Kuehn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kulkarni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Gram-negative bacteria release OMVs with diameters of 20–400 nm to their environments. These vesicles are composed of phospholipids (PLs), outer membrane proteins (OMPs), and LPSs or lipooligosaccharides (LOS), but also contain periplasmic proteins and cell wall components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roier et al., 2016a</xref>). Modulation of peptidoglycan (PG) cross-links is associated with membrane stability and rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwechheimer and Kuehn, 2015</xref>). Approximately one-third of the alpha-helical OM lipoprotein Lpp (also known as Braun’s lipoprotein) anchored to the outer cell membrane are covalently cross-linked with PGs through connection between C-terminal lysine residue of Lpp and the diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP) site of PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dramsi et al., 2008</xref>). Reduction in Lpp production disrupts the cross-linkage of PG on the membrane, thereby significantly contributing to the formation of OMVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wessel et al., 2013</xref>). Differential expression of OM protein A (OmpA), which is a β-barrel porin that non-covalently interacts with the meso-DAP site of PG, can modulate OMV excretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwechheimer and Kuehn, 2015</xref>). Many mutant studies have shown that the absence of inner membrane (IM) proteins, such as the Tol component of the Tol-Pal system and NlpA, can enhance OMV production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernadac et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Toyofuku et al., 2015</xref>). Production of OMVs is also facilitated by a high periplasmic turgor pressure, which occurs when misfolded proteins, nucleotide fragments, or PG debris accumulate in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, in <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, OMVs are also released by PLs that accumulate on the OM when the PL transporters of the VacJ/Yrb ABC transport system (also known as the Mla system) are not produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roier et al., 2016b</xref>). Changes in membrane fluidity and rigidity, determined by the compositions of acyl chains and head groups of PLs, affect OMV production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mashburn-Warren et al., 2008</xref>). The proportion of saturated fatty acids appears to be higher in OMVs than in cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgarten et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In pathogenic bacteria, these spherical OMVs formed by various routes can have many different physiological functions, including biofilm formation, cell–cell communication, secretion of virulence factors, and survival under antibiotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Toyofuku et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnington and Kuehn, 2016</xref>). OMVs have attracted interest as putative vaccine agents or vehicles for drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jan, 2017</xref>). They can reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics and other bactericidal agents, thereby posing a serious threat to the treatment of bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koeppen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jan, 2017</xref>). For example, the OMVs of β-lactam-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> are enriched with proteins involved in degrading β-lactam antibiotics in comparison with those of susceptible bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, OMV supplementation of microbial cultures increases the microbial resistance to antimicrobial peptides. Similarly, hypervesiculating mutants show increased resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manning and Kuehn, 2011</xref>). OMVs from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> are known to possess various virulence factors such as OmpA, proteases, phospholipases, superoxide dismutase, and catalase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>). However, it is unclear whether <italic>A. baumannii</italic> can gain polymyxin resistance or confer such resistance onto its bacterial community through hypervesiculation. Here, the genomes and OMV-producing phenotypes of experimental evolution PMB-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> cells were analyzed alongside other clinical isolates as well as the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> ATCC 17978 strain. Our multi-omics data and mutational studies suggested that OMVs functioned as decoys for PMB in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. Accordingly, these vesicles can protect not only the OMV producer, but also the entire bacterial community from the bactericidal effects of PMB.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OMV secretion and enhanced biofilm formation</title><p>PMB-resistant strains were generated by exposing wild-type cells (Lab-WT; minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], 2 μg/mL) to increasing concentrations of PMB. Consequently, strains that had 2-fold (MIC, 4 μg/mL) and 64-fold (MIC, 128 μg/mL) higher PMB resistance than Lab-WT were generated (low and high PMB resistance, PMR<sup>Low</sup> and PMR<sup>High</sup>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The PMR<sup>High</sup> strain had a lower growth rate (1.386 ± 0.17 h<sup>−1</sup>) than both Lab-WT (2.081 ± 0.92 h<sup>−1</sup>) and PMR<sup>Low</sup> (1.985 ± 0.86 h<sup>−1</sup>) strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Expression analyses of the <italic>pmrC</italic> gene, which encodes a PetN transferase in the absence of PMB, showed 1.2- and 4-fold higher expression in PMR<sup>Low</sup> and PMR<sup>High</sup> strains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The zeta-potential analyses suggested that the average negative surface charge of PMR<sup>Low</sup> and PMR<sup>High</sup> decreased from −27 mV (Lab-WT) to −20 mV and −10 mV, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The reduced surface charge, which is partly due to PmrC-driven incorporation of PetN into lipid A, presumably decreases the initial binding of PMB, a cationic amphiphilic cyclic decapeptide, to the cell surface. Consequently, cells with more PetNs in lipid A acquire resistance to PMB. PmrC-mediated reduction of surface charges was not feasible in PMR<sup>Low</sup> because the expression level of the <italic>pmrC</italic> gene was not significant. These observations could not account for all the reasons underlying the high PMB resistance of PMR<sup>High</sup> strain because short-term (10 min) PMB exposure (4 μg/mL, MIC of PMR<sup>Low</sup>) decreased the surface charge in all tested strains, albeit to different extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, n = 10 per strain). OMV-associated biofilm was measured in the Lab-WT and PMR<sup>High</sup> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). Biofilm formation observed using confocal microscopy with FilmTracer indicated that the PMR<sup>High</sup> strain produced thick and condensed biofilm within 24 hr, and the addition of PMB induced biofilm formation in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Quantification of biofilm formation using the crystal violet assay also indicated that the PMR<sup>High</sup> strain produced more biofilm (twofold higher) than the Lab-WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly, addition of OMVs derived from PMR<sup>High</sup> increased the initial stage of Lab-WT biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). The PMR<sup>Low</sup> and PMR<sup>High</sup> strains were resistant only to polymyxins, but not to the other nine tested antibiotics of different classes, including meropenem, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This PMB-specific phenotype prompted us to confirm hypervesiculation of the PMR-resistant strains through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). OMV production appeared to be twofold higher in PMR<sup>High</sup> than in Lab-WT, and the treatment with 1/2 MIC PMB (1 or 128 µg/mL, respectively) caused increased OMV production as quantified using the lipophilic dye FM4-64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We observed markedly larger and greater production of OMVs in the PMR<sup>High</sup> strain than in our Lab-WT strain using TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

In the PMR<sup>High</sup> strain, the predominant spectrum was also measured at 1490 m/z, followed by 1630 m/z, which is predicted to be the peak when a PetN and a hydroxyl group were attached to the dominant lipid A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). The PMR<sup>High</sup> strain overexpressed <italic>pmrC</italic> (encoding a PetN transferase), which added a PetN to some lipid A molecules, but not all, leading to interference PMB binding to the OM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Raman spectroscopy is used for microbial analysis at a single-cell level since it can rapidly measure the cell components, including lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins, by detecting the inelastic scattering of a molecule irradiated by monochromatic lights. The phenylalanine peak (1001–1004 cm<sup>−1</sup>) appears to be a signature signal for the presence of peptides and proteins in a sample. This phenylalanine peak at 1002 cm<sup>−1</sup> appeared to be similar in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the Raman peak corresponding to PL (at 1334, 1445, and 1666 cm<sup>−1</sup>) increased notably in PMR<sup>High</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The intensity of the other prominent peak at 1243 cm<sup>−1</sup> assigned to an amide III β-sheet was higher in resistant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The numbers of coding DNA sequences (CDSs) in the PMR<sup>Low</sup> and PMR<sup>High</sup> genomes were 3678 and 3762, with mean CDS lengths of 947.5 and 930.2, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Both MUMmer program-based genomic and additional PCR analyses were performed to confirm mutational positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a, b</xref>). No mutation was detected in the promoter (all intergenic) regions of either mutant strain genome. Two chromosomal regions mostly annotated as hypothetical proteins were lost during adaptive evolution of PMR<sup>Low</sup> and PMR<sup>High</sup> strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>).

Our RNA-seq analysis showed that 250 and 166 genes were up- and downregulated, respectively, in PMR<sup>High</sup> in comparison with the Lab-WT strain without PMB exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, 89.16% of all genes showed no change at the transcriptional level. The highly upregulated gene, encoding an aldehyde dehydrogenase (<italic>aldB</italic>), showed a 3.43-fold increase in the PMR<sup>High</sup> in comparison with that in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It is worth noting that dynamic membrane lipid biosynthesis in the PMR<sup>High</sup> might generate long-chain fatty aldehydes that may be recycled through AldB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asperger and Kleber, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishige et al., 2000</xref>). 8 of the 16 most upregulated genes were hypothetical proteins, and the remaining genes were annotated as a glutamin-(asparagin)-ase (<italic>ansB</italic>), poly-beta-1,6-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine <italic>N</italic>-deacetylase (<italic>pgaB</italic>), ribosomal protein (<italic>rpmI</italic>), and an ABC transporter glutamine-binding protein (<italic>glnH</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In particular, the PgaB belonging to the <italic>pgaABCD</italic> operon functions for exopolysaccharide export across the OM. The overexpressed <italic>pga</italic> operon appeared to facilitate the production of PNAG-attached OMVs in <italic>E. coli</italic> through deacetylation of PNAG by the PgaB activity, which resulted in enhanced biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stevenson et al., 2018</xref>). The PMR<sup>High</sup> strain showed upregulation of both <italic>pmrA</italic> and <italic>pmrC</italic> genes encoding a transcriptional regulator and a PetN transferase, respectively, which evidently affects the membrane charge leading to PMB resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, the most downregulated genes except the hypothetical gene were related to two genes encoding the OMPs <italic>ompA</italic> and <italic>bamE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). OmpA, a PG-linked non-specific OM porin, harbors a flexible periplasmic domain that is strongly associated with PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iyer et al., 2018</xref>). Lack of OmpA in the OM is known to promote bacterial OMV production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schwechheimer et al., 2014</xref>). The <italic>bamE</italic>, encoding a β‐barrel assembly machine E, was shown to bind specifically to phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knowles et al., 2011</xref>). Both OmpA and BamE are determinants for cell shape and OM integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ryan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi and Lee, 2019</xref>). Downregulation of both genes may lead to loosening of OM-PG linkages and is associated with hypervesiculation in the PMR<sup>High</sup>. An additional qRT-PCR assay confirmed that the <italic>pmr</italic> and <italic>pgaB</italic> genes showed more than fourfold higher expression, but all membrane-linkage-related genes (<italic>ompA</italic>, <italic>bamE</italic>, <italic>lpp</italic>, and <italic>mlaC</italic>) were downregulated in PMR<sup>High</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Biogenesis of OMV in the PMR<sup>High</sup> was twice as much as that in Lab-WT and further increased under 1/2 MIC PMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To identify the commonly expressed genes in the high OMV production condition, we compared three conditions (Lab-WT + PMB vs. Lab-WT), (PMR<sup>High</sup> + PMB vs. PMR<sup>High</sup>), and (PMR<sup>High</sup> vs. Lab-WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our RNA-seq analyses confirmed that 29 and 12 genes were up- and downregulated, respectively, in the hypervesiculation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). High levels of gene expression involved in stress response and survival were also predominant in the transcriptomic analysis, in which ribosomal proteins (<italic>rplW</italic> and <italic>rplO</italic>) and chaperons (<italic>groL</italic>) were upregulated in the hypervesiculation conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>). The <italic>pgpA</italic> gene encoding a lipid phosphatase was also upregulated, which can dephosphorylate phosphatidylglycerophosphate to form PG, a major constituent in OMVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). Increased levels of PG in the OM induced changes in membrane integrity, causing higher OMV production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sohlenkamp and Geiger, 2016</xref>). Notably, several genes belonging to the <italic>pmr</italic> and <italic>pga</italic> operons are included among the commonly upregulated gene categories, and the commonly downregulated genes included important membrane-associated genes (<italic>mlaC</italic>, <italic>ompA</italic>, <italic>lpp</italic>, and <italic>bamE</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Integration of omics analysis in experimentally evolved strains and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The qRT-PCR assay was conducted in PMR<sup>High</sup> strain compared with Lab-WT.

The commonly identified OMV components harbored several proteins that were noted in our RNA-seq analyses for OMV biogenesis, showing increased production (PmrC, alanine racemase [Alr], and PgaB) and decreased production (OmpA and OmpW, elongation factor Tu [TufB]). Both our RNA-seq and proteomics analyses strongly indicated that simultaneously identified genes and proteins are critical components of OMV biogenesis in both wild-type and PMR<sup>High</sup> strains. Interestingly, <italic>A. baumannii</italic> OMVs also contained many cytoplasmic cargo proteins such as ribosomal proteins and Ef-Tu, similar to the OMVs from other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dallo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deo et al., 2018</xref>). Elongation factor (Ef-Tu), observed in our proteomics analyses, is one of the most abundant proteins (&gt;20%) in bacteria and has a canonical role in translation. However, it is also found on the surface of bacterial OMs, which suggests a possible noncanonical function on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Widjaja et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harvey et al., 2019</xref>). Accumulation of Ef-Tu in the periplasmic space might induce pressure, which promotes blebbing of the OM resulting in OMV secretion although lower level of TufB was detected in PMR<sup>High</sup> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McBroom and Kuehn, 2007</xref>). Reduced expression of OmpA and OmpW leads to diminished linkage between the OM and PG and subsequently causes more OMV generation in the PMR<sup>High</sup>. Our RNA-seq and proteomics data implied that PMR<sup>High</sup> changes the OM surface charge and membrane integrity by altering the expression of many OMV-related genes, which leads to PMB resistance and higher OMV production. Decreased membrane-linkage proteins induce overproduction of OMVs, which is also linked to enhanced biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mutational analyses for OMV production</title><p>OMV production and MIC were measured in all strains, including several Campbell-type and CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Furthermore, when the <italic>pmrB</italic> gene was deleted in Lab-WT, OMV biogenesis was reduced (0.3-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>), indicating that OMV production is impaired in the absence of PmrB.

The protective effect of these PMR<sup>High</sup>-derived OMVs was assessed using the Luria–Bertani (LB) broth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>) and LB agar plate tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), after confirming that additional purified OMVs had no effect on the bacterial growth. Interestingly, supplementation of PMB-containing liquid cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) or agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) with these OMVs could increase the survival of all tested strains except for PMR<sup>High</sup> on agar plates. To visualize direct binding PMB to OMVs, we developed a dansyl fluorophore-PMB, which was synthesized by forming a chemical bond between the primary γ-amines on the diaminobutyric-acid residues of PMB and dansyl-chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soon et al., 2011</xref>). Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images revealed that dansyl-PMB was less bound to PMR<sup>High</sup> cells than Lab-WT cells at their respective PMB MICs (2 or 4 µg/mL) due to the fact that the PmrC-driven lipid A modification of PMR<sup>High</sup> cells decreased PMB binding to OMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The lipid-selective dye (FM4-64) and dansyl-PMB were employed to visualize binding of PMB to purified OMVs of the PMR<sup>High</sup> stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Our data showed that the two dyes exhibited overlapping images, which clearly demonstrated the direct binding of PMB to OMVs. To test whether <italic>A. baumannii</italic> clinical isolates could be protected from PMB through OMV secretion, the linkages between PMB protection rates and OMV production in 40 MDR clinical isolates were assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). The degree of OMV production in each clinical isolate varied. Although direct correlations between the MIC and OMV production could not be identified under our tested conditions due to the same reasons we provided earlier, higher OMV producers could show higher protection rates against PMB in the early stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Particularly, tendency was greater in the six clinical isolates with red-colored area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, addition of PMR<sup>High</sup>-derived OMVs to the growth cultures of five randomly chosen MDR strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i</xref>; F-1025, F-1208, F-1379, F-1410, and F-1629) enhanced the microbial survival in the presence of PMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). PMB MIC tests were performed using four additional Gram-negative bacteria (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> KT2440, <italic>E. coli</italic> K12, and <italic>Acinetobacter oleivorans</italic> DR1) and the protective roles of their OMVs were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

OMV biogenesis was thought to be also linked to the elevated hydrophobicity of the cell surface in <italic>P. putida</italic>, which caused greater biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgarten et al., 2012</xref>). OMVs are known to function as cargoes for many extracellular or intracellular materials such as virulence factors, proteins, DNA, RNA, and signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnington and Kuehn, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the OMVs produced by <italic>A. baumannii</italic> have been shown to have a virulence factor (OmpA) and an antibiotic-resistance factor (AmpC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weber et al., 2017</xref>). OMVs are composed of PLs, OMPs, periplasmic proteins, and LPS; however, the packaging of cytosolic molecules into OMVs remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roier et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jan, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, OMVs released from CRAB could be responsible for the horizontal transfer of the carbapenem-resistance-related gene <italic>blaNDM-1</italic> to carbapenem-susceptible <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatterjee et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> strains had OMs and larger OMVs harboring different lipid compositions under PMB treatment, which might contribute to the low permeability of PMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jasim et al., 2018</xref>). The following factors have been proposed to modulate OMV biogenesis: (i) diminished linkage proteins between OM and PG; (ii) increased turgor pressure due to the accumulation of cellular materials in the periplasm; (iii) modulation of the production of transmembrane proteins; and (iv) changes in membrane fluidity and rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Toyofuku et al., 2015</xref>). The bacterial membranes of Gram-negative bacteria are also constantly modified via two-component systems, including PmrAB, in response to changes in the environment such as metals and PMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsang et al., 2017</xref>). LptA is the periplasmic protein of the LPS transport (Lpt) complex, which bridges the IM and OM, transporting LPS across the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Powers and Trent, 2019</xref>). A recent study has shown that reduced LptA connections lead to overproduction of OMVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Falchi et al., 2018</xref>). Decreased Lpp-PG covalent cross-linking or non-covalent OmpA-PG interactions also enhance the production of OMVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwechheimer and Kuehn, 2015</xref>). Disruption of the Mla complex system, which transports mislocalized OM glycerophospholipids back to the IM, results in hypervesiculation by accumulation of glycerophospholipids in the outer leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamischke et al., 2019</xref>). The Bam complex is an OM complex that mediates the folding and insertion of OM proteins into the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malinverni and Silhavy, 2011</xref>). DolP, a lipoprotein, is known to promote proper folding of BamA, one of the essential subunits of the BAM complex, which might also play a role in OM integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ranava et al., 2021</xref>).

However, it is still not clear how the DNA repair-related <italic>udg</italic> gene is linked to OMV production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Linkage between those deleted regions in evolved strains and OMV biogenesis remains to be investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). It is worth noting that antibiotic-induced genomic alterations including deletions, rearrangements, and amplification have been reported in many laboratory-evolved antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sandegren and Andersson, 2009</xref>). Several laboratory-evolved antibiotic-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains also appeared to carry more than 20 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maeda et al., 2020</xref>).

Norfloxacin-treated <italic>E. coli</italic> had ~11.5 kb deletions possibly through IS1-mediated recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Long et al., 2016</xref>). Deducing a direct link between OMV production and a single OMV-related gene might be an oversimplification because of the multifaceted control of bacterial OMV production; however, our expression analyses clearly demonstrated that the hypervesiculating PMR<sup>High</sup> strain showed reduced expression of many OMV-related genes, which might cumulatively affect OMV production. Several other data have also shown that bacterial OMVs contained IM proteins as well as cytoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nagakubo et al., 2019</xref>). The unusual OMV biogenesis recently identified in a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> model system has clearly shown that OMV production through explosive cell lysis ended up including several cytosolic components of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwechheimer and Kuehn, 2015</xref>).

The in vitro human microbiota experiment clearly showed that the presence of OMVs can modulate the bacterial community under PMB conditions. The reasons underlying our unexpected observation of sensitivity of the Gram-positive <italic>Enterococcus</italic> strains to PMB under anaerobic conditions remain to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Recently, more studies suggested that polymyxins can bind to teichoic acid, which is a negatively charged compound in the OM of Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rudilla et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yu et al., 2020</xref>).

All the strains were grown at 37°C in LB broth with aeration by shaking at 220 rpm. The PMR<sup>Low</sup> and PMR<sup>High</sup> strains were constructed by transferring wild-type cells onto LB agar plates with serially higher PMB concentrations. In total, 3 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> experimentally evolved isolates and 40 clinical isolates were investigated.

The obtained CLSM (Carl Zeiss, Germany) images were analyzed and modified using the Zen 2.1 (Blue edition; Carl Zeiss, Germany) software. LB broth in sterile 96-well microtiter plates (SPL Life Sciences) was inoculated in triplicate with each overnight LB-grown culture and further diluted 1:100 with LB broth. The volume of the cells was determined by converting the OD<sub>600</sub> value of the O/N cells. Uninoculated LB broth was used as the negative control. The microtiter plates were then incubated at 37°C for 24 hr. After removing planktonic cells, the biofilm biomass was stained with crystal violet and solubilized with 95% ethanol (v/v), after which its absorbance was measured at 595 nm. To measure OMVs-induced initial stage of biofilm formation in Lab-WT, cells were grown at 37°C in LB until an OD<sub>600</sub> reached around 0.6 (for 6 hr).

The supernatant was poured off and resuspended in 35 mL of a single-phase Bligh–Dyer mixture (chloroform:methanol:distilled water, 1:2:0.8; v/v). The solution was mixed by inversion and incubated at RT for &gt;20 min to ensure complete cell lysis. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min. LPS will pellet along with proteins and nucleic acids; however, PLs, isoprenyl lipids, and small, hydrophobic peptides remain in the supernatant. The supernatant was discarded. The LPS pellet was washed with 35 mL of the single-phase Bligh–Dyer mixture and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was discarded; 8 mL of mild acid hydrolysis buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5; 1% SDS) was added to the pellet, and it was mixed by pipetting. The solution was sonicated at a constant-duty 2× cycle for a 20 s/burst, with an interval of 5 s between bursts, at 50% output. Then, the sample was boiled in a water bath for 30 min, and the bottles were removed from the water bath and allowed to cool to RT. To extract lipids after hydrolysis, the mixture was formed by adding 9 mL of chloroform and 9 mL of methanol to the SDS solution. Then, the sample was mixed by inversion and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm. The lower phase was extracted into a clean 50 mL conical tube. A second extraction was performed by adding 30 mL of the lower phase from a pre-equilibrated two-phase Bligh–Dyer mixture (chloroform:methanol:DW, 2:2:1.8; v/v) to the upper phase from the previous step. The mixture was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The lower phase was extracted and pooled with the lower phase from the previous step. Then, the pooled lower phase (18 mL total) was washed by adding 34.2 mL of pre-equilibrated two-phase Bligh–Dyer upper phase to create a two-phase Bligh–Dyer mixture (chloroform:methanol:DW, 2:2:1.8; v/v). The solution was mixed and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The lower phase was removed to a clean glass rotary evaporator flask and the sample was dried using rotary evaporation. The lipid sample was added to 1.5 mL of chloroform:methanol (4:1, v/v) in a rotary flask, and ultrasonicated (40 s) to facilitate suspension of lipid from the sides of flask. The lipid A was dried in a nitrogen dryer and transferred to small glass sample vial. The dried sample was stored at 4°C. Lipid A was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the positive-ion mode. The matrix was a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB).

Bacterial growth was monitored at OD<sub>595</sub> at 2 hr intervals for 72 hr. Experiments were performed using bacterial cultures from three independent batches. The bacterial cultures were shaken for 10 s inside the instrument (TECAN) every 10,000 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Analysis of fecal microbiota</title><p>The fecal sample was obtained from a woman aged 25 years, collected in sterilized plastic tubes, and suspended at a dilution of 1/10 in PBS (pH 7.4). The fecal solution (5 mL) was added to an anaerobic bottle, injected with 80% N<sub>2</sub> + 20% CO<sub>2</sub> gas, and sterilized. Subsequently, fecal microbiota (50 μL, 1/100 of the fecal solution) were inoculated and cultured at 37°C. Analysis of bacterial communities revealed whether the protected bacteria depended on the type of OMV in the bacterial community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). PMB (4 μg/mL) and OMVs (25 μL/mL) of equal concentrations were administered daily into the fecal samples suspended in PBS; the sample was stabilized for 3 hr by applying OMVs first, and then treated with PMB and incubated at 37°C for 5 days. Then, total community DNA was extracted using a FastDNA spin kit for soil (MP Biomedicals, USA), and the DNA yield was quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (BioTek, USA). The V3-V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene from the genomic DNA was amplified using the primers 341F (5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">TCGTCGGCAGCGTC</named-content>-<named-content content-type="sequence">AGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG</named-content>-<named-content content-type="sequence">CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG</named-content>-3′) and 805R (5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GTCTCGTGGGCTCGG</named-content>-<named-content content-type="sequence">AGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG</named-content>-<named-content content-type="sequence">GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC</named-content>-3′). The amplified products were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplicons were purified by Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Republic of Korea) and quantified using a Quanti-iT Picogreen dsDNA Assay kit. Equimolar concentrations of each amplicon from the different samples were pooled and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter). All sequencing procedures were conducted by ChunLab. The sequences obtained were compared and classified using the EzTaxon Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ezbiocloud.net">http://www.ezbiocloud.net</ext-link>). The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among the samples were obtained with a taxonomic composition using the CLcommunity program (ChunLab).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including María Mercedes Zambrano as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: John Boyce (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We found that while the work is both novel and very relevant to the field, there were several concerns regarding the interpretation of results and the subsequent claims that make this not suitable for publication. Some of the major issues involve the way in which data was collected and presented (such as MICs, evidence for OMVs, experiments with stool samples, and statistics). Most relevant, however, is the lack of convincing evidence for the role of OMVs in polymyxin resistance, such as polymyxin binding or changes in the LPS, to support the claim for OMV protection in this species.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors explore the role of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> outer membrane vesicles (OMV) in resistance to polymyxin B (PMB). They obtain a laboratory-derived resistant strain that has altered expression of genes involved in OMV biogenesis and produces more OMVs that show protection against polymyxin B both in vitro and in vivo. This includes a MIC increase for several clinical strains and enhanced survival of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> in a Galleria mellonella assay. The results are consistent with the role of OMVs in other bacteria, contribute additional information regarding protection of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> in different experimental conditions, and suggest that OMVs protect by acting as decoys for PMB binding, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear.</p><p>1. The results are interesting, but I am concerned with the specificity of the observations. In the absence of experiments with OMVs from other strains, it is difficult to assess if the results are due to this strain or if OMVs from other strains could also work (such as OMVs from the low and WT strains, the latter used also in the fecal experiment). This is also important in terms of the mechanisms involved. Given the absence of changes in surface charge (zeta potential) when cells are exposed to PMB (Figure 1C, D), what do the authors suggest is the main reason for the observed protective effect on <italic>A. baumannii</italic> cells?</p><p>2. The work with the feline microbiota is confusing and raises many questions, partly because of the complexity of dealing with mixed communities. The results indicate that certain taxa/groups (as identified by peaks) change when PMB / OMVs are administered. Some peaks seem to increase upon treatment with OMVH, while at least one peak increased when treating with OMVW, yet this is not mentioned in the text. How can this be explained? Are there no Gram-negative bacteria in this fecal sample and if so, are these affected or not by PMB/OMVs? While these experiments could suggest that these OMVs affect various cell types, couldn't addition of any antibiotic and any OMVs also trigger changes? It is therefore unclear if the changes, assumed as protection, are specific to these OMVs.</p><p>3. The authors mention binding to PMB as a strategy (eg, Lines 39-40 and Line 278), even though there is no direct evidence provided. It would be best to tone down these claims. It is also unclear how the work leads to the conclusion regarding novel antibiotics and &quot;multifaceted&quot; OMV production (Line 338). Please revise the sentence to more accurately reflect the findings of this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the article submitted to <italic>eLife</italic> by Shin et al., the authors investigate mechanisms of <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> resistance to polymyxin B. They isolate random mutations that occur on the genome as a result if culturing A.b. in media with PMB. They find isolates that have low and high levels of PMB resistance. Whole genome sequencing identifies nearly 20 non-synonomous mutations in different genes. Substitutions in pmrB were common between two isolates. They generate deletion mutants and overexpression genotypes for PmrB, and also contruct deletions in the other genes. The authors move on to characterize PmrB-dependent production of OMVs. The reason for focusing on this gene in favor of the others is not firmly established. The data that follow are not conducted with a sufficient level of rigor to award acceptance to this journal. No statistical analysis is presented. Significance of the data is absent, making the impact of the study very minimal.</p><p>To my knowledge, the work demonstrating the involvement of PmrB in OMV formation for this important pathogen is novel and consistent with recent data that suggest modified LOS molecules might promote or prevent vesicle formation. In general the work is well written and easy to follow conceptually. However, the level of rigor applied to this study falls well short of the requirements for this journal. In its current condition, this article is not of sufficient impact to warrant publication in this journal.</p><p>Data regarding PMB resistance is presented as MICs and growth curve measurements. No bacteriacidal assay is used, which is a major weakness and oversight. The authors report no cfu data for the bacteria that have been treated. The data is over interpreted.</p><p>Measuring effects of PMB on bacterial growth on agar media is technically problematic due to the contact dependent killing activity of PMB.</p><p>No statistics are provided to support significance of the findings.</p><p>The authors do not use appropriate assays to assess whether the particles they are measuring are actual OMVs. Western blots and enzymatic assays for particular proteins that localize or do not localize to the OMV are absent and must be included.</p><p>The authors offer no explanation for why the PMB resistant mutant also acquire multidrug resistance (rif, cat, amp etc.). This line of interrogation is abruptly ended. Do the other mutations contribute to this mechanism?</p><p>The model does absolutely nothing for the paper as it does not even speculate as to how a PmrB modified envelope would cause vesicle formation.</p><p>The experiment where <italic>A. baumannii</italic> OMVs are added to stool samples of a cat is not rationalized sufficiently or conducted in a manner that one could specifically attribute the effects to the OMVs. A more appropriate study would involve a mouse model of disease. <italic>A. baumannii</italic> does not colonize the intestine so the relevance of this model is minimal.</p><p>Fm464 staining to confirm OMV isolation is insufficient to establish that these are actual OMVs. Blotting for OmpA an OM protein and some IM protein would provide stronger support.</p><p>Similarly quantifying the lipid content with FM4-64 is not rigorous as the dye is non-specific.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper describes an analysis of the role of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in polymyxin resistance in <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>. Firstly, polymyxin-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains were selected by growth on increasing concentrations of polymyxin and then genome sequencing showed the presence of a number of mutations. Both resistant strains had two pmrB mutations known to increase PmrC expression and give PEtn addition to LPS. The strains, especially PMRHigh, showed increased OMV production and addition of purified OMVs from this strain could increase polymyxin resistance of other sensitive strains. This is a very interesting paper worthy of further investigation. However, I feel that this paper falls short of showing a convincing role for OMVs in polymyxin resistance in this species. Without further support of presence/absence of PEtn on resistant membranes and OMVs released by the PMRHigh strain, the idea that OMVs are protective seems counterintuitive; if the LPS from this PMRHigh strain has PEtn addition (highly indicated by mutations and PmrC increased expression) then the released OMVs should not bind polymyxin due to the reduced charge. Indeed, it might be expected that OMVs from WT would be more protective as they would bind polymyxin.</p><p>1. Currently, the whole genome sequencing analysis is unconvincing. Firstly, the genome sizes and number of ORFs are quite different between parent and derivative resistant strains. This seems very unusual and is likely due to different success in de novo assembly. It would have been good to use reference assembly against the parent strain as the derivatives should be almost identical. Given the likely problems with assembly, at least a number of the proposed mutations should be checked by PCR and Sanger sequencing.</p><p>2. The two common mutations in PmrB, and the increased expression of PmrC, indicate that polymyxin resistance is likely to be primarily due to PEtn addition to LPS and concomitant reduction in neg charge and polymyxin binding. However, this needs to be shown by LPS MS. Indeed, I think it is essential to look at the LPS structure in both the parent sensitive cells, resistant derivatives and the OMVs from each strain.</p><p>3. Mutation of pmrB in the PMRHigh strain failed to return the strain to fully sensitive, which does argue in favor of PEtn addition not being the primary reason for resistance. However, this would be a clearer experiment if the actual transferase gene (pmrC) was inactivated.</p><p>4. Line 161-163. Wouldn't calculation of surface charge in the presence of polymyxin be confounded by cell death in sensitive strains?</p><p>5. Line 163-165. The fact that both resistant strains were not resistant to other antibiotics suggests in favor of PEtn addition as this is a polymyxin-specific mechanism. Why is this listed as &quot;interesting&quot;.</p><p>6. What is the proposed explanation for the high number of released OMVs in the ftsL mutant but no increase in polymyxin resistance?</p><p>7. Line 22 suggests that, &quot;as expected&quot;, mutations in genes associated with cell wall cross linking such as lpp showed reduced OMV secretion. Isn't this at odds with line 106 which say that reduction in Lpp production disrupts the cross-linkage of PG on the membrane, thereby significantly contributing to the formation of OMVs.</p><p>8. For conclusive assessment of the role of OMVs on altered microbiota, full metagenomic 16s rRNA should be conducted, rather than terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, which does not capture enough diversity.</p><p>9. For Galleria mortality experiments, in my opinion bacterial counts should be determined</p><p>10. In my opinion, for conclusive understanding of the role of OMVs in decoy resistance, polymyxin binding should be assessed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A novel decoy strategy for polymyxin resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The manuscript has improved with the inclusion of new data, but the authors should include more detailed information and take care with the interpretation of some of their results.</p><p>1. Important discussion of other studies is missing, e.g., Jasim et al. about OMVs and polymyxins in <italic>Klebsiella</italic> (PMID: 30103446), or Macdonald et al. about OMVs in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (PMID: 23625841), etc.</p><p>Please include statistical information required to correctly interpret the results.</p><p>2. Line 152: it should be noted that the observed 1.2-fold higher pmrC expression in PMRLow was not statistically significant. Indeed, 1.2-fold increase is below the usual cut-off values used for transcriptomics.</p><p>3. Most of the reported transcriptomics data (e.g. Figure 3B) has no statistics associated with it, so it is not possible to know whether observed differences are significant. Add false discovery rate values or CVs to the fold-change data.</p><p>4. The number of replicates should be noted in the figure legend for all experiments. E.g. for Figure 4. it seems unlikely that there is a statistically significant difference between protein Bradford assay for LabWT and deltapmrB unless there are a large number of replicates here.</p><p>5. The addition of Raman spectroscopy and the specificity of its interpretation are unconvincing.</p><p>Several issues were brought up regarding the transcriptomics (in addition to statistics) and genomics data that require further clarification.</p><p>6. There is no clear explanation for why different SNVs were observed in the transcriptomic data compared to the genomic data. Were these mutations found in a high percentage of the mapped reads?</p><p>7. The rationale for the RNA-Seq experiments is unclear and there were only a few genes dysregulated. Therefore, the value of this experiment is unclear.</p><p>8. The mutations in mRNA are troublesome as e.g., a master regulator of stringent stress response and cell division were affected and it is not clear how this is further linked to OMVs and polymyxins. Many mutations (including master regulators) in the polymyxin-resistant mutant strain could affect the observed phenotypes.</p><p>9. Why do WT and PMR-resistant strains have different genome sizes? A difference of &gt;28 kb and 11 genes sound a lot – what was deleted in these strains specifically? There are also a lot of other important mutations in the PMR high strain that could explain the growth phenotype and this makes the whole data interpretation regarding OMVs questionable.</p><p>10. The CRISPR-Cas9 method needs to be fully detailed in Materials and methods and it should be noted which mutants are from homologous recombination and which from CRISPR.</p><p>Biofilm experiments and interpretations should be further clarified. Please address the following regarding biofilm experiments:</p><p>11. The biofilm data is not convincing and should be quantified for multiple areas. There is no evidence that OMVs are associated with biofilms in this study.</p><p>12. Supplemental Figure 1. Was the increase in biofilm seen due to excess EPS formation or an increase in viable bacteria? Was any sonication done to see if the actual number of bacteria at the timepoint chosen increase in the evolved mutant with PMB?</p><p>13. There are other mechanisms of colistin (polymyxin) resistance seen including transmissible elements such as MCR-1 which encodes a phosphoethanolamine transferase leading to increased positive charge on the membrane. Is it known whether other mechanisms of resistance would also lead to increased OMV formation? If not, it might be good to mention in the discussion about whether the mechanism underlying increased OMV production would be applicable to other forms of polymyxin resistance.</p><p>14. Did the authors determine whether OMVs from other pathogens would result in a similar decoy effect or would this be expected to be specific to polymyxin stimulated OMVs in Acinetobacter?</p><p>15. It is not clear why the authors mention DNA relaxation, but do not really explain how this is linked to whole story.</p><p>16. The document includes a large amount of experimental data that makes it hard to follow and could therefore be improved for clarity. In addition, some of the experimental information is not reflected in the abstract. Finally, authors should take care to avoid speculations.</p><p>– For example, the Results section starts with a speculation about the lower growth rate, which is inappropriate but also makes the reader wonder whether other mutations could be the cause of the growth defect. It becomes clearer reading further when the WGS is described.</p><p>– There is further speculation in the results that should not be there and lots of the results/discussion feel out of context.</p><p>Please clarify some of the figures presented.</p><p>17. Figure 1. Panel D TEM is not particularly quantitative. It is difficult to claim that there a larger number of OMVs in the PMR(high) strain. Was this quantitated visually in some way? If not, it might be helpful to include supplemental TEM images at a lower magnification to help support this claim.</p><p>18. Figure 3B (expression vs genomic position image) should be relative to log base 2 fold-change so that up- and down-regulated genes are on a similar scale.</p><p>19. It would be useful to have a merged image of Figure 5D.</p><p>20. Figure 6 Panel A. This panel is a bit confusing. I am not sure what the number scale at the top of the graph represents versus the number scale at the bottom of the panel. The dots appear blue but the authors mention black dots? I assume these are the dots they are alluding to but this needs to be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66988.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

They generate deletion mutants and overexpression genotypes for PmrB, and also contruct deletions in the other genes. The authors move on to characterize PmrB-dependent production of OMVs. The reason for focusing on this gene in favor of the others is not firmly established. The data that follow are not conducted with a sufficient level of rigor to award acceptance to this journal.

Accumulation of Ef-Tu in the periplasmic space might induce pressure, which promotes blebbing of the OM resulting in OMV secretion (Figure 3C, McBroon and Kuehn, 2007).

Firstly, polymyxin-resistant A. baumannii strains were selected by growth on increasing concentrations of polymyxin and then genome sequencing showed the presence of a number of mutations. Both resistant strains had two pmrB mutations known to increase PmrC expression and give PEtn addition to LPS. The strains, especially PMRHigh, showed increased OMV production and addition of purified OMVs from this strain could increase polymyxin resistance of other sensitive strains. This is a very interesting paper worthy of further investigation. However, I feel that this paper falls short of showing a convincing role for OMVs in polymyxin resistance in this species. Without further support of presence/absence of PEtn on resistant membranes and OMVs released by the PMRHigh strain, the idea that OMVs are protective seems counterintuitive; if the LPS from this PMRHigh strain has PEtn addition (highly indicated by mutations and PmrC increased expression) then the released OMVs should not bind polymyxin due to the reduced charge. Indeed, it might be expected that OMVs from WT would be more protective as they would bind polymyxin.</p><p>1. Currently, the whole genome sequencing analysis is unconvincing. Firstly, the genome sizes and number of ORFs are quite different between parent and derivative resistant strains. This seems very unusual and is likely due to different success in de novo assembly. It would have been good to use reference assembly against the parent strain as the derivatives should be almost identical. Given the likely problems with assembly, at least a number of the proposed mutations should be checked by PCR and Sanger sequencing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for nice comments. We believed that genome sequencing is minor issue for claiming our conclusion because we performed transcriptomic and mutational analyses to understand the roles of several important genes in OMV production. The number of coding DNA sequences (CDSs) was incorrect. We corrected the number in Table S1 and sentences. The difference in the number of CDSs in resistant strains was not significant. Line 227-230: The numbers of coding DNA sequences (CDSs) in the PMR<sup>Low</sup> and PMR<sup>High</sup> genomes were 3625 and 3636, with mean CDS lengths of 930.2 and 947.5 respectively (Table S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The two common mutations in PmrB, and the increased expression of PmrC, indicate that polymyxin resistance is likely to be primarily due to PEtn addition to LPS and concomitant reduction in neg charge and polymyxin binding. However, this needs to be shown by LPS MS. Indeed, I think it is essential to look at the LPS structure in both the parent sensitive cells, resistant derivatives and the OMVs from each strain.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted the MALDI-TOF analysis in agreement with the reviewer opinion</p><p>Figure 2, To determine whether modified lipid A plays an important role in PMB resistance, lipid A was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis in the positive-ion mode.</p><p>Line184-190, The main peak of Lab-WT was measured at 1,490 m/z, corresponding to bis-phosphorylated penta-acylated lipid A (Figure 2A and 2B).

There are other mechanisms of colistin (polymyxin) resistance seen including transmissible elements such as MCR-1 which encodes a phosphoethanolamine transferase leading to increased positive charge on the membrane. Is it known whether other mechanisms of resistance would also lead to increased OMV formation? If not, it might be good to mention in the discussion about whether the mechanism underlying increased OMV production would be applicable to other forms of polymyxin resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>Both MCR-1 gene products and PmrC function as a phosphoethanolamine (PetN) transferase, although the <italic>mcr-1</italic> gene is often located on the plasmid, which was not the case in our strains. Because deletion of the <italic>pmrB</italic> led to reduced OMV production, induction of the <italic>pmr</italic> operon might be linked to OMV biogenesis (Figure 4). However, there is no direct evidence for the linkage between PmrC and OMV formation.
