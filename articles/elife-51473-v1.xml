At every moment, they must select the most relevant or beneficial one, and execute the appropriate behavior. At an elemental level, selection among options to approach or retreat from a stimulus, and to fight or take flight, can impact the very survival of the animal. More generally, selection is an integral aspect of nearly all complex cognitive functions as well as everyday behaviors. Given the critical importance of the selection of one option among many available ones to adaptive behavior, how such competitive selection is implemented in the brain is a fundamental question in behavioral neuroscience.</p><p>In the literature, competitive selection has been considered in a variety of contexts including perceptual categorization, action choice, decision-making and attention. For instance, central to selective attention is the problem of identifying the next target among multiple stimuli to guide behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Knudsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Moore and Zirnsak, 2017</xref>; but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">McMains and Somers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cavanagh and Alvarez, 2005</xref>). Selecting the location of the most salient or the most behaviorally relevant stimulus while ignoring distractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bichot and Schall, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bichot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Ikeda and Hikosaka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">McPeek and Keller, 2004</xref>), and responding to image components that are related to a specific feature but not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">O'Craven et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Mante et al., 2013</xref>) are just a few examples from the literature on selective attention. Central to value-based decision-making is the challenge of choosing the most beneficial option among competing alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>). The choice between a small but immediate reward versus a large but delayed reward, and between sure rewards versus risky (probabilistic) ones with a higher expected value, are two examples of value-based decisions that have been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib194">Roesch and Olson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Kable and Glimcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib220">Strait et al., 2014</xref>). Central to perceptual categorization is the problem of discriminating among competing percepts in the face of potentially ambiguous or noisy sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Hanks and Summerfield, 2017</xref>). The identification of the dominant odor component in a mixture of two (or more) odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Niessing and Friedrich, 2010</xref>), determination of the animal category from an ambiguous visual stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Freedman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib223">Swaminathan and Freedman, 2012</xref>), identification of motion direction in a random dot motion task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Liu and Wang, 2008</xref>), and identification of a song note based on its duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Prather et al., 2008</xref>) are just a few examples from the rich literature on the study of perceptual selection. Lastly, central to action selection is the issue of executing the appropriate motor plan among competing alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Murakami and Mainen, 2015</xref>). The choice between rolling or turning behaviors in fly larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Jovanic et al., 2016</xref>), between freezing versus flight defensive behaviors in mice in response to a threatening stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib214">Shang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib215">Shang et al., 2018</xref>), between grooming and freezing behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Hong et al., 2014</xref>), between swimming to the left versus right in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Koyama et al., 2016</xref>), between feeding versus escape in mollusks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kovac and Davis, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Kristan, 2008</xref>), and between two reaching actions in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Cisek and Kalaska, 2005</xref>) are a few of the many examples studied in the literature.</p><p>Studies of the different forms of competitive selection across animal species have advanced our understanding of many aspects of the neural basis of selection. Prominent among these are the identities of brain areas that are involved in particular selection tasks, the information encoded by these areas in service of selection, and models of how these neural representations may contribute to observed choice behaviors. An emerging view is that despite differences in selection tasks and the brain areas studied, different forms of competitive selection may share key computational principles as well as neural mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib245">Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Freedman and Assad, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Mysore and Knudsen, 2012</xref>). However, several fundamental questions remain unanswered: (i) ‘Exactly what key computations constitute competitive selection?’, (ii) ‘What aspects of the models correspond to which computational goals?’, and more importantly, (iii) ‘How is competitive selection actually implemented within the neural circuits of the relevant brain areas?’ Here, by decomposing selection into a set of well-defined computational building blocks and mapping them onto neural circuit building blocks, we develop a neural circuit framework that can help experimenters answer these questions and elucidate neural circuit mechanisms of competitive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A computational framework for competitive selection based on first principles.</title><p>The computational primitives underlying competitive selection are shown as ‘hidden computations’.

Next, we break down the seemingly monolithic winner-take-all selection into six key computational primitives (section titled ‘Hidden computational features…’). Here, for each computational feature, we describe its conceptual role in the idealized WTA equation, and discuss its applicability to selection problems that have been studied in behavioral neuroscience. We then explore the demands that its execution places on neural circuit architecture and function, and identify specific circuit motif(s) that can implement the computational feature. In this process, we view the literature on selection through the lens of the elemental computation and summarize relevant findings from different species and forms of selection. Because our focus, here, is on questions of biological realization rather than in-principle operation, we draw selectively upon those studies in the literature that inform issues of neural implementation. Next, we combine the individual circuit motifs from the previous section into a mechanistic framework for competitive selection, and link this WTA-inspired framework back to the A2T perspective, thereby closing the loop between them (section titled ‘Feasibility, generality and limitations…’). In addition, we highlight the biological viability of this framework, and also point out that it has several key elements in common with leading models of decision making that have been proposed to account for behavioral as well as neural results in cortical and subcortical brain areas. Based on these, we argue that the proposed neural circuit framework is canonical - one that can serve as a starting point for experimentally uncovering how core computations of competitive selection are implemented by specific neural mechanisms. The final section aids such future efforts by detailing specific predictions that arise from each of the six computational building blocks, as well as approaches to test them experimentally (section titled ‘Experimentally testable predictions’). We conclude with a broad discussion of challenges in investigating the neural circuit bases of competitive selection.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Definitions</title><sec id="s1-2-1"><title>Options</title><p>Stimuli or potential choices available to the animal. For instance, in the case of value-based decision-making, option A may be a stimulus associated with a reward of high magnitude but that arrives with long delay, and option B, a stimulus associated with a reward of low magnitude but short delay.

Competitive selection does not include situations in which just one representation is activated because only a single option is available (for instance, attending to a single target in the absence of any distracters), nor situations in which category boundaries are hardwired through learning stable representations in such a manner that no competition among representations is necessary for the choice.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2-3"><title>Norm of an option</title><p>A quantity that represents the ‘worth’ of an option (or of the attribute being compared).

This term is intended, ultimately, to correspond to a continuous quantity that allows for lawful comparisons along some common scale of comparison. (We note that our use of the term ‘norm’ is not intended to correspond directly to the formal mathematical definition of ‘norm’ on vector spaces.)</p></sec><sec id="s1-2-4"><title>Channel</title><p>Group of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory) involved in representing an option.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Competitive selection as symmetry-breaking: Theory and models</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Theoretical formulations</title><p>Competitive selection, at its core, is a symmetry-breaking process: among several options available to the animal, one is chosen, and all the others (temporarily) rejected. From a theoretical perspective, such symmetry-breaking has been described using several equivalent formulations. It has been described as the detection of the peak in the dynamic representational landscape, in which the heights at different points represent the norms of the different options at any instant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Fecteau and Munoz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib221">Sugawara and Nikaido, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It has also been framed as a form of categorization - the transformation of continuous inputs (here, graded representations of the options) into two discrete output groups separated by a selection or category boundary such that the neural representation of just one of the options passes into the ‘selected’ category, whereas those of the remaining options fall into a second ‘unselected’ one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Freedman and Assad, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Mysore and Knudsen, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Mysore and Knudsen, 2012</xref>). Cast in the language of dynamical systems, different choices have been described as different attractor states of a dynamic ‘energy function’ defined over the space of option attributes, with competitive selection involving the identification of the attractor with the lowest energy given sensory inputs and internal influences at that instant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Machens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Niessing and Friedrich, 2010</xref>). Alternatively, selection can be thought of as the outcome of a template matching process in which either the multiple options are matched to a relevant neural template, or a single option is compared to multiple neural templates, with the one yielding the best match (or lowest error) being the selected option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib189">Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999</xref>); selection in sequential match-to-sample experiments is consistent with this view. Finally, another commonly used description is that competitive selection occurs when the neural representation associated with one of the competing options <italic>first</italic> crosses some functional response threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Ultimately, however, no matter the description, the outcome of symmetry-breaking is that the selected option, and only that one, triggers downstream consequences that culminate in a percept or behavioral output.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Competitive selection: theory and modeling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating the peak-detection formulation of competitive selection.

This class of models accounts for the majority of the theoretical formulations of selection listed above - including peak detection, attractor dynamics, categorization, and error minimizing template matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib189">Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Machens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib245">Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Mysore and Knudsen, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The second class of models takes the accumulation-to-threshold (A2T) approach and accounts explicitly for the theoretical formulation of earliest threshold crossing.

In this model, evidence for the options from noisy or ambiguous sensory inputs is combined into a single accumulator, with the state of the accumulator increasing when inputs provide evidence for one option, and decreasing, when evidence favors the other option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib219">Stone, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Laming, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib185">Ratcliff, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>).

Alternatively, computational units representing each of the competing options accumulate evidence for that option towards an abstract decision threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Roe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib238">Usher and McClelland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bogacz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Furman and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Deco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ditterich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib228">Thura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib259">Xue and Liu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Hanks and Summerfield, 2017</xref>). The option for which the evidence crosses threshold first is designated the ‘winner’ or the selected option. In other words, in the A2T formulation, the temporal primacy of threshold crossing results in symmetry-breaking and triggering of the output corresponding to the selected option. Early computational descriptions, called race models, assumed that evidence for each option accumulated independently of the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib239">Vickers, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib240">Vickers, 1979</xref>), but gave way to later models in which accumulation processes for the different options interacted with one another in an inhibitory manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib226">Teodorescu and Usher, 2013</xref>). In addition, the accumulation of evidence has been described both as a continuous ramping process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib212">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>) and a discrete stepping process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>), although recent work suggest that both processes account equally well for neural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib267">Zoltowski et al., 2019</xref>).

A major feature of A2T models is that they not only account for the choice made (given the inputs), but also account well for the reaction times of the choice responses.</p><p>Although seemingly different, the WTA and A2T classes of models are not conceptually distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib246">Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but rather view selection from two complementary perspectives. A2T models focus heavily on the time-course of evolution of the neural responses that lead to the representational landscape, and handle symmetry-breaking by building into the model, the notion of threshold crossing, albeit without much detail on how the threshold might be set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Churchland and Ditterich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Huk and Meister, 2012</xref>); but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Lo and Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib248">Wei et al., 2015</xref> for multi-area proposals). By contrast, WTA models typically begin with a representational landscape without much detail on how it might be constructed, and focus on implementing symmetry-breaking. Despite the different emphases, the WTA and A2T models are largely isomorphic, with A2T models necessarily producing a categorical choice, and WTA models being compatible with accumulation of evidence over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib242">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib255">Wong and Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib245">Wang, 2008</xref>). This correspondence is not surprising considering that, in reality, both the evolution of neural responses over time (construction of the representational landscape), as well as the application of symmetry-breaking transformations, are crucial aspects of any functional description of competitive selection. Consequently, just as the different theoretical formulations employed to describe competitive selection are conceptually equivalent, so are the two broad classes of computational models used to account for it.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neural support</title><p>Studies of the different forms of selection have used both the WTA and the A2T models to describe observed neural correlates, supporting their interchangeability at the conceptual level.

In the context of perceptual categorization, several studies have interpreted results using A2T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib195">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>), and others using WTA models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib247">Wang and Spelke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Machens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib255">Wong and Wang, 2006</xref>). Finally, studies have examined action selection from both the A2T perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Öztürk, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib229">Thura and Cisek, 2014</xref>) and the WTA perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Cisek, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Koyama et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Thus, there is evidence in neural responses to support aspects of both the WTA as well as the A2T formulations of symmetry-breaking. However, little is known about how either class of models is actually implemented in neural circuitry. For instance, how categorical segregation of inputs is accomplished in the brain has been unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Freedman and Assad, 2016</xref>). Similarly, how the values of selection thresholds are determined, whether they are static or dynamic, and how they are specified in neural circuits, are all unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Huk and Meister, 2012</xref>), despite biologically-grounded proposals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Lo and Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib248">Wei et al., 2015</xref>).

We propose that a key impediment has been the deceptive simplicity of the WTA transformation. Encapsulated in a two-line equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1a</xref>), this seemingly straightforward mathematical transformation is, in fact, composed of six ‘hidden’ computational features that act together to produce <italic>idealized</italic> WTA selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). Briefly, they are: (#1) comparison, (#2) categorical (or sharp) selection boundary, (#3) dynamic flexibility of the selection or category boundary, (#4) ability to select among many (all) viable pairs of options (independent of their identities), (#5) ability to select among multiple (&gt;2) options, and (#6) generation of a unitary output. Each of these computations can place non-trivial constraints on the nature of interactions between the representations of the competing options and on the organization of the underlying neural circuitry. Here, we start with the representation of the options and then, by examining each of the six computational features, delineating their circuit requirements, and highlighting support (if any) from the literature, we attempt to explicitly map competitive selection onto circuit elements.</p><boxed-text id="box1"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><p>First-principles framework for competitive selection: implementation of elemental computations.</p></caption><p>Competitive selection is broken down into six ‘hidden’ computational features (Figure 1), by drawing inspiration from the idealized WTA equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> and Figure 2).

By contrast, neurons and networks typically implement softer (continuous) nonlinearities, that is, ones in which the transition between a low output state and a high output state occurs over a non-zero range of inputs. Second, neural representations possess significant trial-to-trial variability (or noise), and competitive selection transpires over time - from the instant the options are made available to the animal to the instant of expression of the behavioral or perceptual output corresponding to the chosen option. Third, although the six computations are all key parts of an idealized selection process, they may apply to varying extents to different forms of selection behavior, with the ‘comparison’ (#1) and ‘unitary choice’ (#6) features being essential across the board. Nonetheless, as we will see below, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1a)</xref> and the six computational building blocks together serve as a fruitful starting point for constructing a neural circuit framework for competitive selection.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Neural representation of options</title><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Conceptual set-up</title><p>Selection operates upon the substrate of neural representations of the competing options. Therefore, a reasonable requirement for lawful comparisons among options is that their neural representations be encoded along a common scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</xref>), one that embodies the worth, or so-called ‘norm’, of each option (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AB</xref>). The norm can either represent the net contribution of all the attributes of an option that are relevant to the selection process, computed via some weighted combination of those of individual attributes, or can represent just the contribution of a particular attribute that may be being compared at a given instant. To be useful, the norm satisfies two properties. First, it is instantiated in neural activity via a shared or common currency (for instance, firing rate), thereby providing a level playing field for comparisons. Second, the neural encoding of the norm of an option is graded and ordered, with ‘stronger’ neural responses reflecting higher magnitudes of the norm. These properties facilitate the construction of a representational landscape in which each option evokes responses proportional to its norm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We note that there is no requirement for these representations to be encoded in a separate ‘stage’ or neural circuit. Rather, they can be encoded within the neural circuit(s) performing selection, consistent with past suggestions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Cisek, 2012</xref>). Additionally, neither the norm nor its currency are intended to be identical across brain areas or universal across forms of selection. They are ‘local’ notions that ensure a common neural playing field for the comparisons being performed within a brain area at any instant.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Norm of an option.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the norm of an option as a function of its various attributes (colored axes).

The salience of a stimulus arises from its physical properties that ascribe inherent distinctiveness to it, such as visual contrast, speed of motion, auditory intensity (‘loudness’), etc; its behavioral relevance arises from voluntary goals associated with the stimulus such as intention to orient gaze towards it; and history-related influences arise from recent outcomes associated with the stimulus (rewarded or not) or its recent functions (distracter or not). Together, these attributes combine to represent the priority of each stimulus (in the currency of neural firing rate, for instance; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and result in a landscape of stimulus priorities.</p><p>Neurons in several brain areas, such as the frontal eye field (FEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Fecteau and Munoz, 2006</xref>), lateral intraparietal area (LIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bisley and Goldberg, 2010</xref>) and in the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SCid) across vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Fecteau and Munoz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Mysore and Knudsen, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Knudsen, 2018</xref>), have been shown to encode stimulus priority. They exhibit a systematic relationship between firing rate and physical salience of stimuli, and respond more strongly if their preferred stimuli are behaviorally relevant. Responses of these neurons are typically insensitive to stimulus attributes that are not intrinsically salient, such as orientation or color of a visual stimulus, and frequency of an auditory stimulus. Moreover, because neurons in these areas encode sensory space topographically, stimuli (options) at different spatial locations are encoded in different parts of the topographic map. Together this leads to a spatial map of stimulus priority in which the heights (firing rates) at different locations of the map correspond to the priorities of stimuli at those locations.</p><p>In the context of value-based decision-making, options are considered to be associated with a value that depends on various attributes: magnitude of reward, time delay of reward, probability of occurrence, risk, reward expectation, ambiguity, temporal certainty, valence (appetitive or aversive), and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Montague and Berns, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Rangel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Chib et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">FitzGerald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Levy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib261">Yoo and Hayden, 2018</xref>).

The conceptual formulation used to explain behavior and neural correlates in these tasks suggests another possibility for a norm in perceptual choices, namely, a ‘decision variable’. This is an abstract quantity representing at each instant, the strength of evidence in support of one perceptual choice (for instance, dots are moving to the left) versus the other (dots are moving to the right). One instantiation of this formulation involves a decision variable for each option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib237">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Ratcliff et al., 2007</xref>) with the value of each decision variable evolving over time as evidence for that option accumulates. The rate of evolution of each decision variable (i.e., change in the magnitude of the neural response) is proportional to the strength of evidence, thereby satisfying the properties of a norm described above. Neural responses encoding evidence-dependent decision variables have been found in the monkey LIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib195">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>), monkey FEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Kim and Shadlen, 1999</xref>), monkey SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Horwitz and Newsome, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Ratcliff et al., 2007</xref>), monkey basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ding and Gold, 2012</xref>), rodent PPC and PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>) and rodent striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib260">Yartsev et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the context of action selection, the ‘probability of execution’ of each competing motor plan constitutes a plausible norm. Studies that have examined neural activity in the presence of two competing action choices show that neurons in the primary motor cortex of primates exhibit a graded representation of each action plan depending on the probability of their selection/execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bastian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib228">Thura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib229">Thura and Cisek, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Coallier et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, neurons in the primate dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) (and the primary motor cortex) have been shown to track sensory evidence, to be modulated by the probability of execution of the motor plan (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Dekleva et al., 2018</xref>), and to be modulated by a subjective ‘urgency’ parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib229">Thura and Cisek, 2014</xref>). These data are consistent with a neurally encoded variable for each potential action that changes in a graded manner with the likelihood of that action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Cisek, 2007</xref>), thereby providing for a platform for comparing competing action plans. Indeed, when only a single action choice was presented, PMd activity did not scale with the reward associated with that choice, consistent with the idea that PMd activity encodes for probability of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Pastor-Bernier and Cisek, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Thus, there is support from different forms of selection for the representation of competing options in a graded manner that reflects their norm. In many cases, there is additional support for the norm being unidimensional, and for it being encoded in the common currency of neuronal firing rates. This, then, sets the stage for the first step in the computational framework for competitive selection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparison</title><sec id="s3-2-1"><title>Conceptual set-up</title><p>The first crucial computational feature of the WTA operation that must be implemented by neural circuits is comparison among competing options, that is, the ‘&gt;’ operation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-2"><title>Neural circuit requirements</title><p>Comparison among options can be achieved in neural circuits through inhibition.

Because uniform amplification scales up both the mean as well as the standard deviation equally, it does not help improve the discriminability. What is needed instead, is differential amplification, such that responses to options that just straddle the selection boundary are driven apart.

This, however, does not take away from the fundamental issue of how categorical neural representations are produced.

Thus, inhibitory neurons in the owl midbrain implement selection at all pairs of spatial locations in the space map of the optic tectum, and do so optimally by using a small number of high-firing inhibitory neurons that encode space in a multilobed manner such that they are activated in a combinatorial fashion by competing stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Mahajan and Mysore, 2018</xref>).</p></boxed-text><p>In the context of perceptual categorization, the use of different odor mixtures has demonstrated that selection is indeed versatile, capable of occurring among many distinct pairs of options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Niessing and Friedrich, 2010</xref>).

Broadly, a role for inhibition that is dependent on the priorities of the stimuli (rather than just their number) has been suggested as a potential mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Basso and Wurtz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Churchland and Ditterich, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the context of perceptual decision-making, responses of neurons in the monkey parietal cortex have been investigated during a task in which they had to report the direction of a noisy motion stimulus when presented with either two, or four response options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Churchland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Churchland et al., 2011</xref>). Similar to the studies of spatial attention, this study reported a reduction in neural activity in the LIP (and an increase in response variability) when the number of available options increased. Nonetheless, at the time of the decision, neural firing rates were similar, suggesting that the final threshold value for choice may be constant, with the underlying network requiring more evidence and longer time to reach that threshold. In addition, behaviorally, preference reversal and reference effects have been reported in the context of selection among multiple alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Mellers and Biagini, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Roe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib238">Usher and McClelland, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In the context of value-based decision-making, neural responses in the primate LIP to multiple options also show similar reduction in activity with increasing number of options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Louie et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Finally, in the context of action selection, neural correlates in the presence of &gt;= 2 movement options have been examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bastian et al., 2003</xref>).

Because of this diversity, it is unclear which implementational aspects of these models are essential for handling computations underlying selection among multiple stimuli, and which ones are not. Notably, because the models are direct extensions of their two-option counterparts, it would appear that there are no systematic additional constraints that come into play specifically when multiple options, rather than just two, are to be dealt with.</p><p>Recent experimental and modeling work in the barn owl suggest otherwise. Specifically, examination of the flexibility of selection boundaries suggests that additional constraints emerge when selection is generalized to beyond just two options, and that a direct extension of two-option models may be insufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Rajagopalan et al., 2018</xref>). Preliminary results indicate that the core issue may relate to the manner in which inhibition from all other options is combined to affect the representation of each option, and that this may need to be nonlinear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; yellow oval). Notably, this requirement of nonlinearity is consistent with one series of models of multialternative decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bogacz and Gurney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bogacz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib265">Zhang and Bogacz, 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Ability to select among multiple (&gt;2) options, and generation of unitary choice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ability to select among more than two options.

Some open questions are: ‘how does inhibition scale with the number of options?’, ‘how is inhibition from multiple options combined?’, ‘how are floor effects avoided (to ensure that neural responses to the winner stay robust and are not washed out despite inhibition from an increasing number of options)?’, and ‘how do the computational features of flexibility and categorical representations, which have been discussed thus far in the context of two options, continue to be accomplished with &gt;2 options?’.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Unitary output generation</title><sec id="s3-7-1"><title>Conceptual set-up</title><p>Following the flexible and categorical identification of the winner within any set of competing options, the final (and an essential) computational feature of selection involves ensuring that only the winning option, but not any of the others, is capable of triggering an action or percept. This is implicit in the idealized WTA equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1a</xref>), which sets the winning option to a high value but all the non-winning options to zero (by definition).</p><p>From the point of view of neural circuits, this computational feature translates to a slightly less stringent scenario. Neural circuits do need to ensure that the responses to the winning option are above the functional threshold of output-generating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Lo and Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Furman and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Seger and Peterson, 2013</xref>). However, responses to the other options do not necessarily need to be driven to zero, they just need to be weaker than this functional response threshold. (We note, here, that unitary choice formation is essential only at the very final stage in the selection process, just prior to output production, but is not required to occur at any of the previous stages or sites of computation in the brain.)</p></sec><sec id="s3-7-2"><title>Neural circuit requirement</title><p>We propose that this computation can be implemented in neural circuits by incorporating two additional features – by making the gain of the competitive inhibition high, and by coupling that with recurrent amplification of each option’s representation.</p><p>The logic is as follows. Competitive inhibition evoked by each option is required, based on the discussion thus far, to be proportional to that option’s norm, and to produce a donut-like output pattern. If the gain of this inhibition were to be set to a high value, this would have the desired consequence of driving the responses of low-norm options to very low values. However, this raises the potential concern that the high inhibitory gain could cause the losing options to drive the winner’s responses to values that may be too low to be effective for driving output. Conceptually, this concern can be offset with an amplification mechanism that preferentially scales the representation of just the winner. This can be implemented by a bank of recurrent amplifiers, one for each option, positioned such that each amplifier also receives the high-gain competitive inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8BC</xref>). This second feature will facilitate preferential amplification of just the highest-norm option, because the remaining amplifiers in the bank, corresponding to all other options, are powerfully inhibited by the high-gain competitive inhibition.</p><p>The recurrent excitation required by this implementation is a classic mechanism that has been proposed previously for the accumulation of evidence over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Furman and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib245">Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib246">Wang, 2012</xref>). As a result, By virtue of being framed in the WTA perspective, the above computational feature, and all the ones so far, have been discussed nominally as operating on steady-state firing rate responses. On the other hand, responses in neural circuits evolve over time, and animals make decisions under temporal urgency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib188">Reddi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Churchland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib228">Thura et al., 2012</xref>). It is, therefore, important to note that the circuit proposed above is well capable of producing temporally evolving responses seen in the brain, and in A2T models: The recurrent excitation required in this implementation is, in fact, a classic mechanism that has been proposed for the accumulation of evidence over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Furman and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib245">Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib246">Wang, 2012</xref>). (In addition, the non-selective motor urgency signal, which is thought to multiplicatively modulate the sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib228">Thura et al., 2012</xref>), is plausibly accounted for as one of the (many) internal influences that go into building the representations of the options; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.) Therefore, with the proposed circuit mechanism for unitary choices, responses to the competing options are not only separated by the high-gain competitive inhibition, but also accumulate over time because of the recurrent amplification, and do so with asymmetric rates as a result of competitive inhibition impinging on the amplifiers. Consequently, the option with the highest norm is predicted to reach the firing threshold of the downstream ‘output’ neurons first, and to trigger the associated percept or action. An additional advantage of this scheme involving temporal primacy is that it precludes the need for careful tuning of the parameters corresponding to competitive inhibition and amplification (as long as they are within a neurally plausible range).</p><p>Thus, high-gain competitive inhibition together with downstream recurrent amplification can selectively enhance responses to the option with the highest norm while suppressing the responses to all other options, thereby allowing only the option with the highest norm to drive output.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7-3"><title>Neural support</title><p>Numerous studies across the selection literature have demonstrated that the responses to the winning option are higher (or enhanced), whereas those to the losing options are low (or suppressed), as described in the previous sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Freedman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Hernández et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib197">Romo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Freedman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Romo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Freedman and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Mysore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Mysore and Knudsen, 2011a</xref>). However, very little is known about the circuit mechanisms underlying unitary output generation.</p><p>In the context of spatial attention, the so called ‘visuomotor’ and ‘motor’ neurons in the primate FEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Bruce and Goldberg, 1985</xref>) as well as the SCid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Wurtz and Albano, 1980</xref>) are known to exhibit peak activity just before initiation of a saccade towards the motor field of that neuron. Similarly, caudate neurons in the basal ganglia show selective activity to the target of attention even when no overt action was required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcizet and Krauzlis, 2018</xref>). Additionally, a recent primate study suggests that the difference between the activities of right and left SCs serves as a decision variable, which, when it crosses a threshold, results in unitary action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Herman et al., 2018</xref>). This is in line with an earlier model (for perceptual decision-making) in which a multi-area module involving the primate cortex, basal ganglia and the SC was proposed as a means both for detecting threshold crossing (via the cortico-collicular pathway) as well as for threshold setting (via the cortico-caudate pathway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Lo and Wang, 2006</xref>). In all cases, however, the implementational details of the proposed models in neural circuitry are unknown – for instance, the neural circuit mechanisms for comparison across the SCs, the source of recurrent excitation, etc.</p><p>Potential support for the specific implementational scheme that we propose above - namely high-gain competitive inhibition and recurrent amplification, comes from the avian midbrain selection network. Neurons in the avian sensorimotor hub, the OT, receive powerful inhibition from GABAergic neurons in the midbrain tegmentum, called Imc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Marín et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Mysore and Knudsen, 2013</xref>), following a donut-like spatial pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib243">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Mahajan and Mysore, 2020</xref>). In addition, cholinergic neurons in the nucleus isthmi pars parvocellularis serve as point-to-point recurrent amplifiers of activity in the OT of birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Marín et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asadollahi and Knudsen, 2016</xref>) as well as fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Henriques et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, because Ipc neurons are powerfully suppressed by the Imc, the circuit supports asymmetric amplification as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib243">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asadollahi et al., 2010</xref>). Whether and how this Imc-Ipc circuit, which is thought to be conserved across vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Knudsen, 2018</xref>), impacts unitary output generation in behavior is yet to be tested, and similar circuits are yet to be studied in other species/brain areas.</p><p>In the context of perceptual decision-making, studies have demonstrated that unitary choice is triggered immediately after neural firing rates of primate LIP reach a fixed value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Churchland and Ditterich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Hanks and Summerfield, 2017</xref>). The observation that the responses to the losing options are not zero, but remain graded, has led others to propose that the LIP may be feeding its activity to a downstream area that implements unitary choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Gold and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>).

A WTA-like model has been proposed, but the neural implementation is as yet unclear.

There is clear evidence that such a circuit exists in the avian midbrain selection network.

It allows for the deconstruction of a potential selection circuit into core motifs that are associated with specific computations, thereby providing a starting point for the experimental search for neural circuit mechanisms of competitive selection (see section titled ‘Experimentally testable predictions’). By contrast, whereas each of the existing computational models successfully accounts for data from the selection task(s) that it is built to model, it is not always clear why that model works, what circuit elements are essential, and what experiments to design in order to investigate the neural circuit underpinnings of selection in a relevant brain area. Indeed, in some cases, intuition regarding the computational roles of different circuit elements does not appear to be borne out: for instance, it has recently been demonstrated that recurrent amplification as well as feedback inhibition, by themselves, are insufficient to generate categorical selection boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Mahajan and Mysore, 2020</xref>), in contrast to previous conjectures.</p><p>In light of the links to biology and parallels to existing models, the circuit framework proposed here is potentially capable of accounting for the implementation of selection in different tasks and across different brain areas. This will likely involve the use of alternate, but equivalent, implementations of the proposed core circuit motifs as discussed above, and may involve a distributed implementation of the various computational features across processing stages rather than a combined implementation within one so-called selection circuit.

However, it is unclear if firing rate is the only such currency, and if not, the manner in which the subsequent computations are to be implemented is not clear in the current framework. Related to this point, the framework is also agnostic to how the norm comes to be encoded (see also <xref ref-type="box" rid="box4">Box 4</xref>), especially considering recent reports that the norm is not universal and can depend on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Farashahi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib199">Rouault et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Koechlin, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Second, although we discuss six computations in the context of WTA symmetry-breaking, it is possible that they are not all equally important, in general. Comparison and unitary choice, the first and last ‘hidden’ computational features, are likely universal, with the others being useful depending on the nature of the selection task and the animal’s behavioral goals. For instance, categorical neural selection boundaries, though common, may not always be necessary. Similarly, not all selection tasks may require flexibility, with fixed boundaries being not only sufficient, but also necessary in some cases. For instance, in the case of syllable-length identification by songbirds, the goal of the underlying neural circuit is the determination of how the length of a syllable compares to a fixed value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Prather et al., 2008</xref>).

The resulting response curve, called a CRP (competitor-norm dependent response profile), is expected to show a reduction in responses with increasing norm of option B. Characterize the categorization index of this CRP in a manner that takes into account response variability, and evaluate if it is significantly greater than 0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Mahajan and Mysore, 2020</xref>). (b1) Based on the anatomical characterization above, determine if a donut-like motif is operational in the circuit.

It is expected to be substantially lower than before (and potentially not distinguishable from 0). In other words, the responses are expected to be far less categorical without the donut-like motif.

Repeat this measurement in an interleaved manner with one exception: increase the norm of option A to a different (higher value). For each CRP, determine the norm of option B (‘transition’ norm) at which responses drop from a high value to a low value. If this transition norm is coupled to, and shifts with, the strength of option A, the selection boundary is dynamically flexible (no training/plasticity involved; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Mysore et al., 2011</xref>). (b1) With anatomical (as well as functional) characterization of the circuit, assess if feedback inhibition exists between neurons encoding different options. Examine if this feedback pathway is direct (reciprocal inhibition among inhibitory neurons) or indirect (routed through intermediate excitatory neurons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Mysore and Knudsen, 2012</xref>). (b2) Selectively silence feedback inhibition between options (while leaving the inhibitory neurons themselves intact), and repeat measurements of the two response curves in (a). Depending on how the circuit is organized, this may be achieved either by silencing the feedback projections from one channel onto the other (source-side manipulation), or by preventing neurons in one channel from receiving (feedback) inhibition from those of another (recipient-side manipulation). The manipulation is expected to abolish the shifting of the boundary (transition norm) between the two response curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Mysore and Knudsen, 2012</xref>), while leaving intact the response reduction in each curve.</p></sec><sec id="s5-3-3"><title>Significance</title><p>These experiments can reveal dynamically flexible selection boundaries, the presence of direct vs. indirect feedback inhibition between competing options, and also the circuit mechanism underlying flexibility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5-4"><title>Ability to select among many (all) viable pairs of competing options</title><sec id="s5-4-1"><title>Predictions</title><p>(a) Animals are able to select between many different pairs of competing options.

Animals are expected to be able to perform well and consistently. (b1) Within the anatomically identified network relevant to this behavior, identify neurons that drive the inhibition: these can be inhibitory neurons that directly deliver competitive inhibition, or excitatory neurons with long-range connections that deliver inhibition indirectly by driving local inhibitory neurons that largely serve as simple sign-changers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib206">Schryver et al., 2020</xref>). Measure responses of these ‘driver’ neurons to various options (individually), and characterize their encoding preferences.
