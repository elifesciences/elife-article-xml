Here we demonstrate that intestinal epithelium-derived BMP serves as a niche signal for intestinal stem cell (ISC) self-renewal in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult midgut. We find that BMP signaling is asymmetric between ISC and its differentiated daughter cell. Two BMP ligands, Dpp and Gbb, are produced by enterocytes and act in conjunction to promote ISC self-renewal by antagonizing Notch signaling. Furthermore, the basement membrane-associated type IV collagens regulate ISC self-renewal by confining higher BMP signaling to ISCs. The employment of gut epithelia as a niche for stem cell self-renewal may provide a mechanism for direct communication between the niche and the environment, allowing niche signal production and stem cell number to be fine-tuned in response to various physiological and pathological stimuli.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01857.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01857.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01857.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Keeping an organ in top condition requires a steady supply of fresh cells to replace those that are dead or damaged. This is particularly critical for the epithelial cells lining the intestines, which only live for a few days, but are necessary for digesting food. These cells cannot simply reproduce by cell division, so they must be replenished by adult stem cells—adaptable cells that can produce any of the cell types found in a given organ.</p><p>When an adult stem cell divides, two daughter cells are produced. Normally, one of these remains in the stem state, and the other becomes a particular type of cell for use in the organ. Exactly how each daughter cell knows what to become is unclear. However, it is known that in addition to communicating with each other, stem cells also communicate with their immediate surroundings, which is known as a niche. For many processes, the molecules and mechanisms used in niche signaling remain to be discovered.</p><p>The midgut of fruit flies presents a relatively simple stem cell system for study, and has the added advantage that its cells behave in ways that are similar to the cells that make up the intestines of mammals. By developing a method of tracking the two daughter cells of a single stem cell simultaneously, Tian and Jiang have been able to uncover new details about how this niche operates.</p><p>Epithelial cells in the gut produce molecules called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) that influence how bone and many other types of body tissues form. Tian and Jiang have found that two types of BMP are the signals responsible for keeping daughter cells in the stem state. When released from the base of the epithelial cells, BMPs can only travel a very short distance before other proteins trap them. As a result, one of a pair of daughter cells receives a higher level of the signal and remains as a stem cell. This cell then sends a signal to the other daughter cell, telling it to form a specialized cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01857.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01857.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>stem cell niche</kwd><kwd>intestinal stem cell</kwd><kwd>midgut</kwd><kwd>self-renewal</kwd><kwd>BMP</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM061269</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP100561</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31328017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Welch foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The niche signal that ensures stem cells self-renew appropriately has been identified in the midgut of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In adult life, many organs rely on stem cells to maintain their integrity by replenishing lost cells during tissue homeostasis and regeneration, yet the regulatory mechanisms that control stem cell proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation are still not fully understood. Stem cells are thought to reside in specialized microenvironments called niches that produce signals required for stem cell self-renewal and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones and Wagers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Losick et al., 2011</xref>); however, the cellular basis of stem cell niches and the molecular nature of the niche signals have not been well defined in many systems.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> adult midgut has emerged as an attractive system to study stem cell biology in adult tissue homeostasis and regeneration not only because the cell lineage of this tissue is relatively simple and well defined but also because it bears similarities to the mammalian intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casali and Batlle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biteau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang and Edgar, 2012</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> posterior midgut contains self-renewing stem cells located adjacent to the basement membrane (BM) of the midgut epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>). These intestine stem cells (ISCs) undergo cell division and asymmetric fate determination to produce a renewed ISC and an enteroblast (EB). The EB exits cell cycle and differentiates into either an absorptive enterocyte (EC) or a secretory enteroendocrine cell (EE) depending on Notch (N) pathway activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>). Fate determination between the two ISC daughter cells is regulated by N signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bardin et al., 2010</xref>). Immediately after an ISC division, a high level of active Delta (Dl) is retained in the basally localized daughter cell that remains as ISC while the more apically localized daughter cell activates N signaling to become EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>). How asymmetric N signaling between two ISC daughter cells is established has remained poorly understood. A recent study suggested that asymmetric segregation of aPKC could play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goulas et al., 2012</xref>), but additional mechanisms may exist. A previous study suggested that visceral muscle (VM)-derived Wingless (Wg) serves as a niche signal for ISC self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). However, other studies suggested that Wg does not regulate ISC self-renewal but instead regulates its proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cordero et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, it is still unclear whether ISC fate is influenced by an environmental signal(s).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01857.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BMP signaling is required for midgut regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: an ISC lineage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult midguts.

It is very likely that additional pathways are involved in the regulation of midgut homeostasis and regeneration. By carrying out in vivo RNAi screen, we identified components in the BMP pathway as essential regulators of midgut regeneration. Clonal analysis and lineage tracing experiments suggest that BMP signaling regulates ISC self-renewal as well as ISC proliferation and lineage differentiation. We showed that EC-derived Dpp and Gbb act in concert to promote ISC self-renewal by antagonizing N signaling-mediated differentiation. We provided evidence that BMP exists in an apical-basal activity gradient and that BM regulates ISC self-renewal by confining high BMP signaling to ISCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BMP signaling is required for <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut regeneration</title><p>To identify additional genes and pathways that regulate injury-induced ISC proliferation, we carried out in vivo RNAi screen in which candidate genes were knocked down in midgut precursor cells using the <italic>esg-Gal4 tub-Gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> (<italic>esg</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup>) system, in which Gal4 is under the control of a temperature sensitive Gal80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGuire et al., 2004</xref>). 3–5-day-old adult females expressing individual <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> transgenes under the control of <italic>esg</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> were shifted to 29°C for 8 days and fed with tissue-damaging reagents such as DSS or bleomycin for 2 days, followed by immunostaining to examine ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amcheslavsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2013</xref>).

Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Navascues et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Brien et al., 2011</xref>), the majority of twin spots (82%; 90/110) from the control guts contained one multi-cellular clone and one single-cell clone that are derived from asymmetric ISC/EB pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,K–K‴,M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), and only a small fraction of twin spots contained either two multi-cellular clones derived from symmetric ISC/ISC pairs (10%; 11/110) or two single-cell clones derived from symmetric EB/EB pairs (8%; 9/110) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Gain-of-N signaling blocks ISC self-renewal and promotes differentiation whereas loss-of-N signaling leads to excessive ISCs at the expense of EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–A′,F–F′</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>). BMP signaling could inhibit N pathway activity, thereby blocking ISC differentiation. Alternatively, N signaling could promote EB fate by inhibiting BMP pathway activity. To distinguish these two possibilities, we determined the epistatic relationship between BMP and N signaling. In one set of experiments, we expressed a constitutively active form of N (N<sup>ICD</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Struhl et al., 1993</xref>) in precursor cells that also transduced high levels of BMP signaling activity due to the ectopic expression of Tkv<sup>Q235D</sup> or combined expression of Dpp and Gbb.

Interestingly, when expressed in ECs, a GFP-tagged Dpp (Dpp-GFP) was enriched on the basal side of midgut epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,B′</xref>) whereas a control GFP was uniformly distributed along the apical basal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,A′</xref>).

Although a GFP-tagged Gbb (Gbb-GFP) was uniformly distributed along the apical/basal axis when expressed in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A,A′</xref>), coexpression of Dpp redistributed Gbb-GFP toward the basal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B–C′</xref>), suggesting that Dpp and Gbb may physically interact, a notion confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Second, BMP signaling also regulates ISC proliferation because reduction in BMP pathway activity results in ISC overproliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013b</xref>), which is in line with a growth inhibitory role of BMP signaling in mammalian intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haramis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2004</xref>). However, it is controversial whether BMP signaling regulates ISC proliferation cell autonomously or non-cell autonomously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013b</xref>). While Li et al. suggested that BMP signaling protects EC integrity and therefore indirectly regulates ISC proliferation; Guo et al. argued that BMP signaling regulates ISC proliferation in a strictly cell-autonomous fashion. The observations that both <italic>tkv</italic><sup><italic>8</italic></sup> and <italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>1–2</italic></sup> mutant clones caused excessive proliferation of neighboring wild type ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>) and that inactivation of BMP signaling in ECs stimulated ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–E</xref>) clearly support a non-cell autonomous role of BMP signaling. Indeed, inactivation of BMP signaling in ECs stimulated the production of JAK-STAT and EGFR pathway ligands that fuel ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013b</xref>) (our own unpublished observation). Nevertheless, it remains possible that BMP signaling could regulate ISC proliferation through both cell autonomous and non cell-autonomous mechanisms, as appear to be the case for Hpo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karpowicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shaw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Staley and Irvine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2013</xref>). Uncertainty also exists regarding how BMP signaling regulates the growth and proliferation of mammalian intestines. While an early work suggested that BMP signaling acts directly on stem/progenitor cells by antagonizing Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2004</xref>), later studies argued that BMP signaling acts on stromal cells to indirectly regulate stem/progenitor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auclair et al., 2007</xref>). Future studies are needed to clarify the exact role of BMP signaling in the regulation of ISC proliferation.</p><p>In this study, we uncover novel functions of BMP in the regulation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult midgut homeostasis, that is, BMP serves as a niche signal to promote ISC self-renewal. In addition, we find that BMP signaling is also required for appropriate lineage differentiation into mature EC and EE. Several lines of evidence suggest that BMP regulates ISC/EB fate choice rather than simply serving as a growth/survival factor for ISC maintenance. First, loss of BMP signaling in precursor cells resulted in a rapid loss of ISC accompanied by an increase in the number of EB. For example, loss of BMP signaling by either <italic>put</italic> RNAi in precursor cells or <italic>put</italic> null ISC lineage clones produced mostly EB/EB pairs as indicated by cell specific markers as well as by two-color lineage tracing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref>). By contrast, blockage of cell growth/proliferation by inhibiting EGFR pathway or by inactivating dMyc only resulted in a gradual decline in the ISC number; and <italic>Ras</italic> or <italic>dMyc</italic> mutant clones retained the stem cell marker for a long period of time (2–3 weeks) even though they failed to divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2013</xref>). Second, BMP signaling is asymmetric in ISC/EB pairs with the basally located ISCs exhibiting higher levels of BMP signaling activity than the more apically localized EBs. The differential BMP signaling is consistent with BMP pathway activity promoting ISC fate. Third and perhaps the most compelling evidence is that ectopic BMP signaling can promote stem cell fate at the expense of EB fate. For example, gain of BMP signaling either by overexpressing a constitutively active form of Tkv in precursor cells or by misexpressing Dpp and Gbb resulted in the formation of large ISC-like cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K,L</xref>). Furthermore, the twin-spot lineage tracing experiments confirmed that ectopic BMP signaling favors the symmetric self-renewing (ISC/ISC) outcome of an ISC division.</p><p>In seeking for the source of BMP ligands, we were surprised to find that both <italic>dpp</italic> and <italic>gbb</italic> are largely expressed in ECs and their expression patterns are complementary, that is, higher levels of <italic>gbb</italic> mRNA were detected in regions where <italic>dpp</italic> expression is low and vice versa. Low levels of Dpp&gt;GFP expression were detected in ECs along the entire A/P axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) although our RNA in situ hybridization clearly missed low levels of <italic>dpp</italic> mRNA in certain regions. Similarly, our <italic>gbb</italic> RNA in situ probe may have missed low levels of <italic>gbb</italic> expression in the anterior and posterior regions of the midguts. Therefore, it is very likely that Dpp and Gbb are coexpressed in most if not all ECs albeit at different levels in different regions.</p><p>A recent study confirmed that <italic>dpp</italic> is expressed in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2013a</xref>). Although <italic>dpp</italic> expression was also detected in trachea cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013b</xref>) as well as in VM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2013</xref>), inactivation of Dpp from these tissues did not affect ISC maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4F–H</xref>). By contrast, inactivation of either Dpp or Gbb in ECs resulted in stem cell loss phenotype whereas increasing the production of Dpp and Gbb in ECs increased stem cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>). These observations suggest that EC-derived BMP serves as the niche signal for ISC self-renewal although we cannot exclude the possibility that trachea- or VM-derived Dpp could play a minor role. Hence, our study establishes a new paradigm for studying stem cell niche and its regulation because in most other systems, stem cell niches are derived from lineages distinct from the stem cells they support. What then is the advantage of utilizing epithelia as a niche to control ISC self-renewal? We speculate that the employment of midgut epithelia as stem cell niche may provide a mechanism for direct communication between the niche and the environment, allowing the production of niche signal and stem cell number to be regulated in response to various physiological and pathological stimuli. Hence, it would be interesting to explore in the future whether BMP production in ECs is dynamically regulated under various stress conditions where change in the stem cell number has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amcheslavsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biteau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McLeod et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Brien et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our MARCM clone analysis for Tkv shows that loss of Tkv can support the ISC self-renewal, but loss of Sax and Tkv at the same time causes the loss of ISCs. This result suggests that low levels of BMP pathway activity conferred by Sax-Put receptor complex appear to be enough to support ISC self-renewal (although not enough to prevent ISC from overproliferation). On the other hand, our results showed that removal of either Dpp or Gbb resulted in ISC loss, implying that Dpp or Gbb homodimers failed to produce enough BMP activity to support ISC self-renewal. It is not clear why Dpp and Gbb homodimers fail to elicit low levels of BMP pathway activity similar to those transduced by Sax. One possibility is that Dpp and Gbb are produced at much lower levels in the midguts compared to early embryos and imaginal discs so that Dpp and Gbb homodimer concentration may not reach a critical threshold for effective signaling in midgut precursor cells. Second, competition between ECs and ISCs for limited amount of BMP may also restrict the availability of BMP ligands to ISCs. A third possibility is that extracellular Dpp or Gbb homodimers may not be stable in the midguts so that depletion of one ligand might cause concomitant reduction in the levels of the other.</p><p>The finding that ECs are the major source of niche signal also raises an important question of how the apical/basal BMP activity gradient is established. Interestingly, we find that Dpp appears to be secreted preferentially from the basal side of ECs, and that Dpp can form a dimer with Gbb to influence its apical/basal distribution. Furthermore, we obtain evidence that BMP signaling range is restricted by the BM-enriched type IV collagen/Vkg. Because type IV collagen/Vkg can physically interact with Dpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), we propose that basal secretion coupled with BM trapping may establish a steep BMP activity gradient so that basally localized ISC daughter cells receive higher levels of BMP than their more apically localized siblings, resulting in differential BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01857.028</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A working model for how BMP regulates ISC self-renewal.</title><p>Basal/basolateral secretion coupled with basement membrane (BM) trapping sets up an apical-basal BMP activity gradient consisting of Dpp-Gbb heterodimers.

Although it is possible that BMP and N pathways could act in parallel and exert opposing influence on ISC/EB fate choice, we favor a model in which BMP promotes ISC fate by inhibiting N pathway activity because loss of BMP signaling in precursor cells resulted in the ectopic expression of <italic>Su(H)-lacZ</italic>, which is a N pathway activity reporter, whereas gain of BMP signaling suppressed the expression of <italic>Su(H)-lacZ</italic> in precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>). Therefore, we propose that differential BMP signaling sets up a difference in the levels of N signaling activity between the two daughter cells after an ISC division. The initial small difference in the N pathway activity between the apical and basal ISC daughter cells is amplified by N feedback regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axelrod, 2010</xref>): N signaling in the apical cell inhibits Dl expression and Dl accumulation in the basal cell further strengthens N signaling in its apical sibling. Intriguingly, we also found that excessive N signaling could block BMP pathway activity, as indicated by the blockage of pMad staining in precursor cells expressing N<sup>ICD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). We speculate that elevated N pathway activity in the apical ISC daughter cell may attenuate BMP signaling in this cell, forming another feedback mechanism to reinforce EB fate choice. Our model can explain the observations that the absolute levels of BMP pathway activity is not critical for ISC self-renewal since partial loss of BMP signaling did not lead to stem cell loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As long as two ISC daughter cells transduce different levels of BMP signal, the N and BMP signaling feedback loops can amplify the initial small difference, leading to a bistable cell fate choice. A similar mechanism has been postulated to account for the bistable R3/R4 fate determination in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> compound eye, which is regulated by the interplay between Wg/Wnt and N signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper and Bray, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fanto and Mlodzik, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Differential BMP signaling might not be the only mechanism responsible for ISC self-renewal. A recent study revealed that aPKC is asymmetrically inherited by apically localized ISC daughter cells and that aPKC promotes N pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goulas et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, asymmetric segregation of aPKC may dampen BMP signaling response in the apically localized ISC daughter cells, which could contribute to the differential BMP signaling. Future study will determine how BMP signaling inhibits N and how the extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms are integrated to coordinate ISC self-renewal and differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics and trangenes</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Mutant stocks</title><p><italic>put</italic><sup><italic>P</italic></sup>(<italic>put</italic><sup><italic>10460</italic></sup>) and <italic>tkv</italic><sup><italic>8</italic></sup> are genetically null alleles; <italic>dpp</italic><sup><italic>hr56</italic></sup> (temperature-sensitive) and <italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>1–2</italic></sup> are hypomorphic alleles (Flybase). <italic>vkg</italic><sup><italic>K00236</italic></sup><italic>, vkg</italic><sup><italic>197</italic></sup><italic>,</italic> and <italic>Vkg</italic><sup><italic>01209</italic></sup> are hypomorphic alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2008</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Transgenic RNAi lines: <italic>UAS-Tkv-RNAi</italic><sup><italic>105834</italic></sup> (#105834; VDRC); <italic>UAS-Tkv-RNAi</italic><sup><italic>40937</italic></sup> (#40937; BL); <italic>UAS-Sax-RNAi</italic> (#42457; VDRC); <italic>UAS-Put-RNAi</italic> (#107071; VDRC); <italic>UAS-mad-RNAi (</italic>#12635; VDRC); <italic>UAS-N-RNAi</italic> (#28981; BL); <italic>UAS-Dpp-RNAi</italic><sup><italic>S</italic></sup> (#33628; BL); <italic>UAS-Dpp-RNAi</italic><sup><italic>W</italic></sup> (#25782; BL<italic>)</italic>; <italic>UAS-Gbb-RNAi</italic><sup><italic>S</italic></sup> (#34898; BL); <italic>UAS-Gbb-RNAi</italic><sup><italic>W</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballard et al., 2010</xref>); Trangenes: <italic>UAS-Dpp</italic> (#1486; BL); <italic>UAS-Dpp-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Entchev et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roy et al., 2011</xref>); <italic>UAS-Dpp-HA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shimmi et al., 2005</xref>); <italic>UAS-Gbb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khalsa et al., 1998</xref>); <italic>UAS-Gbb-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nahm et al., 2010</xref>); <italic>UAS-N</italic><sup><italic>ICD</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Struhl et al., 1993</xref>) <italic>dad-lacZ</italic> (BL# 10305); <italic>UAS-Tkv</italic><sup><italic>Q235D</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oh and Irvine, 2011</xref>); <italic>Su(H)-Gal4</italic>, <italic>Dl-Gal4</italic>, <italic>Dl-lacZ</italic> and <italic>Su(H)-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>); <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Teleman and Cohen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roy et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>btl-Gal4, how-Gal4, FRT82B ubi-GFP,</italic> and <italic>FRT82B ubi-RFP</italic> (Flybase).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Clone induction and analysis</title><p>Mutant clones for <italic>tkv, put or mad</italic> were generated using the MARCM system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and Luo, 2001</xref>).

In the post review discussion we decided that it is not reasonable to ask you to resolve all the differences experimentally in your manuscript especially since different stocks and conditions are used. However, it is important to point out the differences and the extent to which this manuscript reconciles them. This can be done largely through rewriting the Discussion but perhaps also through small experiments that directly pertain to this manuscript. The primary issues are in the following manuscripts:</p><p>A. Zhouhua Li, Yan Zhang, Lili Han, Lai Shi, and Xinhua Lin. Dev.

Aiguo Tian and Jin Jiang. eLife; Conclusion: Two BMP ligands, Dpp and Gbb, are produced by enterocytes and act in conjunction to promote ISC self-renewal by antagonizing Notch signaling.</p><p>Please use the conclusions above only as a guide to compare and contrast the results pointing to the strengths of your manuscript's strengths (and minor weaknesses that can be addressed in future studies).</p><p>2) The proposal that low level BMP signaling leads to ISC overproliferation is based on 2 experiments: <italic>tkv</italic><sup><italic>8</italic></sup> and <italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>1,2</italic></sup> hypomorph clones, which both develop into bigger than control clones. However additional experiments have also been mentioned that should cause mild inhibition of signaling but that do not elicit the overproliferative response: <italic>Myo</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> <italic>dpp RNAi</italic><sup>w</sup> or <italic>gbb RNAi</italic><sup>w</sup>, as well as <italic>sax RNAi</italic> clones all can cause ISC loss in combination with other treatments (indicating that they do reduced signaling) but on their own have no effect and do not induce mild overproliferation. In light of these results it is difficult to accept that low signaling promotes proliferation and perhaps alternative explanations could account for the <italic>tkv</italic><sup><italic>8</italic></sup> and <italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>1,2</italic></sup> hypomorphs. Given that this point is rather tangential it can be omitted alongside the <italic>tkv</italic><sup><italic>8</italic></sup> and <italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>1,2</italic></sup> data?</p><p>3) The data in support of Dpp/Gbb being basally distributed are weak. An intracellular basal (Golgi-associated) accumulation of Dpp makes no prediction on whether it will be secreted basally or basolaterally. It just reflects the steady-state accumulation of Dpp-GFP in the Golgi (most likely the Gbb distribution reflects steady-state accumulation in the ER instead). The signalling pool is the secreted pool and this is the one that needs to be looked at. The authors would have to perform an extracellular staining of dpp-GFP. It would be interesting to compare the extracellular staining of dpp-GFP in wild-type versus <italic>vkg</italic> mutant, as according to their prediction this should lead to a shift in a less basally distributed ligand. However extracellular staining is probably very challenging in the gut. In the absence of stronger data this statement I think needs to be removed. In any case the basal distribution of Viking alone would be sufficient to allow the authors to propose that BMP becomes basally accumulated after secretion, without invoking basal secretion.</p><p>4) It does not seem that all the data presented support the existence of a Dpp-Gbb heterodimer. The conclusion from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> where Tkv and Sax are inactivated singly or together is that these receptors function redundantly. However, this is not consistent with the later evidence for a Dpp-Gbb heterodimer, as the heterodimer would signal synergistically through a Tkv-Put-Sax complex (Shimmi et al., 05, Cell), where removal of either Tkv or Sax would lead to a loss of signaling synergy. It is not clear why removal of Gbb or Dpp singly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) gives a similar stem cell loss phenotype (suggesting a lack of potency of say Dpp homodimers), yet removal of Tkv or Sax alone does not generate such a phenotype. Moreover, heterodimerisation of BMPs is thought to occur in the ER (Gray and Mason, 90), which is inconsistent with the conclusion from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is that Gbb and Dpp expression is complementary. In contrast, the co-IP and immunostaining suggest Gbb and Dpp interaction. Therefore, I think the authors need to reconcile these different observations.</p><p>5) The way the results are described in places does not make the manuscript easily accessible to non-fly readers. For example, while the cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> is helpful, a version also showing the overall location of these cells (like in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and how this relates to the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> would be better for general readers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> would have benefitted from a better description of the <italic>esg</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> system; and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-I</xref> circling individual cells would be useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01857.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) There seems to be considerable disagreement and confusion in the literature over the details of BMP control of cell-fate and renewal in the intestine.

This can be done largely through rewriting the Discussion but perhaps also through small experiments that directly pertain to this manuscript. The primary issues are in the following manuscripts</italic>:</p><p><italic>A. Zhouhua Li, Yan Zhang, Lili Han, Lai Shi, and Xinhua Lin. Dev.

In addition to detecting <italic>dpp</italic> mRNA in ECs, our RNA in situ probe also detected <italic>dpp</italic> mRNA in tracheal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7–figure supplement 4A</xref>). The <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> driver used in our study expressed <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> (<italic>dpp&gt;GFP</italic>) in ECs whereas the <italic>dpp-lacZ</italic> enhancer trap used in Li et al is only expressed in tracheal cells so it seems that each <italic>dpp</italic> reporter only picks up a subset of endogenous <italic>dpp</italic> expression patterns.</p><p>However, in contrast to Li et al., we did not observed elevated ISC proliferation when <italic>dpp</italic> was knocked down in tracheal cells (data not shown), neither did we observe stem cell loss phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7–figure supplement 4F, H</xref>). By contrast, we observed ISC loss when <italic>dpp</italic> was knocked down in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, H, J</xref>). Consistent with the notion that ECs are the major source of Dpp, our qRT-PCR analysis revealed that Dpp RNAi in ECs using <italic>Myo1A</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> knocked down <italic>dpp</italic> mRNA by ∼70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>) whereas Dpp RNAi in tracheal cells using <italic>Btl</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> only resulted in ∼30% reduction even the same <italic>UAS-Dpp-RNAi</italic> line was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7–figure supplement 4I</xref>). Consistent with ECs being a source of BMP for ISC self-renewal, we found that overexpression of Dpp (+Gbb) in ECs increased ISC number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) whereas overexpression of Dpp either alone or together with Gbb in tracheal cells did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7–figure supplement 4C</xref>, D). Therefore, even though tracheal cells express <italic>dpp</italic>, it seems that Dpp produced by these cells may not reach ISCs effectively.</p><p>B) In agreement with Guo et al., we also observed increased clone size and PH3 positive cells associated with <italic>tkv</italic><sup><italic>8</italic></sup> clone as well as <italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>1-2</italic></sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M, P, U</xref>); however, we found that many PH3 positive cells were located outside <italic>tkv</italic><sup><italic>8</italic></sup> or <italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>1-2</italic></sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that <italic>tkv</italic><sup><italic>8</italic></sup> and <italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>1-2</italic></sup> clones stimulated proliferation of neighboring wild type ISCs non-cell-autonomously. In conjunction with the observations that inactivation of BMP signaling in ECs by knocking down individual BMP pathway components also stimulated ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>) (Li et al., Dev Cell 2013), we think that the overproliferation phenotype associated with <italic>tkv</italic> or <italic>mad</italic> clones is largely due to diminished BMP pathway activity in ECs. It is not clear why Guo et al. did not observe such a non-cell-autonomous effect.</p><p>Using a 1 kb <italic>dpp</italic> promoter Gal4 fusion to drive <italic>UAS-GFP</italic>, Guo et al. observed dpp&gt;GFP expression in visceral muscles (VM) surrounding the midguts. We used a different <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> driver, which has been widely used in the literature, to express <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> and found that dpp&gt;GFP is only expressed in ECs. Our RNA in situ hybridization confirmed that <italic>dpp</italic> mRNA was detected in ECs but not in the VM under normal homeostasis. However, it is possible that our RNA in situ hybridization failed to detect low levels of <italic>dpp</italic> mRNA in the VM. Indeed, we found that Dpp RNAi using a VM-selective Gal4 driver (<italic>How</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup>) resulted in a small reduction of <italic>dpp</italic> mRNA; however, we did not observe ISC loss when Dpp was knocked down in the VM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7–figure supplement 4G-I</xref>).</p><p>C) In agree with our finding, Li and Jasper also found that <italic>dpp</italic> is expressed in ECs using the same <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> driver we used as well as RNA in situ hybridization. However, they did not observe a change in ISC proliferation when <italic>dpp</italic> was knocked down in ECs using NP1-Gal4. They also did not observe ISC overproliferation or loss associated with <italic>tkv</italic> or <italic>mad</italic> mutant clones. The difference in the ISC phenotypes between their results and ours is likely due to the different RNAi lines and mutant alleles used and/or different experimental conditions. Even for the same mutant allele (<italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>1-2</italic></sup> or <italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>12</italic></sup>), different genetic backgrounds might influence the phenotypic outcome. For example, we obtained and analyzed <italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>12</italic></sup> alleles obtained from three different labs and each exhibited different phenotypes ranging from ISC loss to overproliferation (our unpublished results). This difference also reflects the complex and opposing roles BMP signaling plays in the precursor cells and ECs to regulate ISC self-renewal and proliferation.</p><p><italic>2) The proposal that low level BMP signaling leads to ISC overproliferation is based on 2 experiments:</italic> tkv<sup>8</sup> <italic>and</italic> mad<sup>1,2</sup> <italic>hypomorph clones, which both develop into bigger than control clones. However additional experiments have also been mentioned that should cause mild inhibition of signaling but that do not elicit the overproliferative response:</italic> Myo<sup>ts</sup> dpp RNAi<sup>w</sup> <italic>or gbb</italic> RNAi<sup>w</sup><italic>, as well as</italic> sax RNAi <italic>clones all can cause ISC loss in combination with other treatments (indicating that they do reduced signaling) but on their own have no effect and do not induce mild overproliferation. In light of these results it is difficult to accept that low signaling promotes proliferation and perhaps alternative explanations could account for the</italic> tkv<sup>8</sup> <italic>and</italic> mad<sup>1,2</sup> <italic>hypomorphs. Given that this point is rather tangential it can be omitted alongside the</italic> tkv<sup>8</sup> <italic>and</italic> mad<sup>1,2</sup> <italic>data</italic>?</p><p>Our results suggested that ISC loss or overproliferation phenotypes depend on the degree of BMP signaling downregulation and the cell type where BMP signaling is inactivated. Loss but not reduction of BMP signaling in precursor cells resulted in stem cell loss whereas reduction of BMP signaling (likely to a certain threshold) in ECs resulted in ISC proliferation through non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. We think the reason why <italic>tub&gt;Sax-RNAi</italic> and <italic>tub&gt;Mad-RNAi</italic> clones did not over-proliferate by themselves is because <italic>tub-Gal4</italic> driven Sax or Mad RNAi did not cause enough downregulation of BMP signaling. In support of this, we did observe ISC overproliferation when the same <italic>UAS-Mad-RNAi</italic> and <italic>UAS-Sax-RNAi</italic> lines were expressed in ECs using <italic>Myo1A-Gal4</italic>, which is a stronger Gal4 driver than <italic>tub-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>; data not shown). With respect to Dpp knock down in ECs, we also observed a similar dosage effect. Although we did not examine whether <italic>Myo1A</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Dpp-RNAi</italic><sup><italic>W</italic></sup> or <italic>Myo1A</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Gbb-RNAi</italic><sup><italic>W</italic></sup> affect ISC proliferation, we did find that partial knockdown of Dpp by expressing <italic>Myo1A</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Dpp-RNAi</italic><sup><italic>S</italic></sup> for shorter period of time (10 days) resulted in ISC overproliferation (we included this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>). Perhaps the most striking observation that supports the dosage effect is that, although both <italic>tkv</italic><sup><italic>8</italic></sup> and <italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>1-2</italic></sup> single mutant clones exhibited overproliferation phenotype, <italic>tkv</italic><sup><italic>8</italic></sup> <italic>mad</italic><sup><italic>1-2</italic></sup> double mutant clones exhibited ISC loss phenotype (we included this new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3S-U</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The data in support of Dpp/Gbb being basally distributed are weak. An intracellular basal (Golgi-associated) accumulation of Dpp makes no prediction on whether it will be secreted basally or basolaterally. It just reflects the steady-state accumulation of Dpp-GFP in the Golgi (most likely the Gbb distribution reflects steady-state accumulation in the ER instead). The signalling pool is the secreted pool and this is the one that needs to be looked at. The authors would have to perform an extracellular staining of dpp-GFP. It would be interesting to compare the extracellular staining of dpp-GFP in wild-type versus</italic> vkg <italic>mutant, as according to their prediction this should lead to a shift in a less basally distributed ligand. However extracellular staining is probably very challenging in the gut. In the absence of stronger data this statement I think needs to be removed. In any case the basal distribution of Viking alone would be sufficient to allow the authors to propose that BMP becomes basally accumulated after secretion, without invoking basal secretion.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that an intracellular basal (Golgi-associated) accumulation of Dpp makes no prediction on whether it will be secreted basally or basolaterally. We have changed the statement to indicate that the basal intracellular accumulation of Dpp raises a possibility that Dpp might be secreted basally or basolaterally. Because extracellular staining of Dpp-GFP is technically challenging in the gut, we used a basement membrane marker (Integrin) to follow extracellular Dpp-GFP in wild type and <italic>vkg</italic> mutant guts and found that basement membrane localized Dpp-GFP is markedly reduced in <italic>vkg</italic> mutant guts compared with the control guts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8N-Q</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8–figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) It does not seem that all the data presented support the existence of a Dpp-Gbb heterodimer. The conclusion from</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>where Tkv and Sax are inactivated singly or together is that these receptors function redundantly. However, this is not consistent with the later evidence for a Dpp-Gbb heterodimer, as the heterodimer would signal synergistically through a Tkv-Put-Sax complex (Shimmi et al., 05, Cell), where removal of either Tkv or Sax would lead to a loss of signaling synergy. It is not clear why removal of Gbb or Dpp singly (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>) gives a similar stem cell loss phenotype (suggesting a lack of potency of say Dpp homodimers), yet removal of Tkv or Sax alone does not generate such a phenotype. Moreover, heterodimerisation of BMPs is thought to occur in the ER (Gray and Mason, 90), which is inconsistent with the conclusion from</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>is that Gbb and Dpp expression is complementary. In contrast, the co-IP and immunostaining suggest Gbb and Dpp interaction. Therefore, I think the authors need to reconcile these different observations</italic>.</p><p>The study referred to by the reviewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shimmi et al., 2005</xref>) and other studies indicated that Dpp and another BMP ligand Screw (Scw) act synergistically to confer high levels of BMP signaling activity in early embryos as well as in S2 cells by forming Dpp-Scw heterodimers. In addition, both Tkv and Sax are required for transducing high levels of BMP signaling conferred by the Dpp-Scw heterodimers. Consistent with this, we found that Dpp and Gbb also form heterodimers when coexpressed and both of our gain- and loss-of-function studies indicate that Dpp and Gbb act in concert to regulate ISC self-renewal. We did observe greatly reduced BMP signaling in <italic>tkv</italic> mutant clones as indicated by diminished pMad staining (data not shown); however, low levels of BMP pathway activity conferred by Sax-Put receptor complex appear to be enough to support ISC self-renewal (although not enough to prevent ISC from overproliferation). On the other hand, our results showed that removal of either Dpp or Gbb resulted in ISC loss, implying that Dpp or Gbb homodimers failed to produce enough BMP activity to support ISC self-renewal. It is not clear why Dpp and Gbb homodimers fail to elicit low levels of BMP pathway activity similar to those transduced by Sax. One possibility is that Dpp and Gbb are produced at much lower levels in the midguts compared to early embryos and imaginal discs so that Dpp and Gbb homodimer concentration may not reach a critical threshold for effective signaling in midgut precursor cells. Second, competition between ECs and ISCs for limited amount of BMP may also restrict the availability of BMP ligands to ISCs. A third possibility is that extracellular Dpp or Gbb homodimers may not be stable in the midguts so that depletion of one ligand might cause concomitant reduction in the levels of the other.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we show that <italic>dpp</italic> and <italic>gbb</italic> expression patterns are complementary, i.e., higher levels of <italic>gbb</italic> mRNA were detected in regions where <italic>dpp</italic> expression is low and vice versa. Low levels of Dpp&gt;GFP expression were detected in ECs along the entire A/P axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) although our RNA in situ hybridization clearly missed low levels of <italic>dpp</italic> mRNA in certain regions. Similarly, our <italic>gbb</italic> RNA in situ probe may have missed low levels of <italic>gbb</italic> expression in the anterior and posterior regions of the midguts. Therefore, it is very likely that Dpp and Gbb are coexpressed in most if not all ECs albeit at different levels in different regions.</p><p><italic>5) The way the results are described in places does not make the manuscript easily accessible to non-fly readers.
