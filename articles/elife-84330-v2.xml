Most studies on mitochondrial protein import are focused on the core import machinery. Whether and how the biophysical properties of substrate preproteins affect overall import efficiency is underexplored. Here, we show that protein traffic into mitochondria can be disrupted by amino acid substitutions in a single substrate preprotein. Pathogenic missense mutations in ADP/ATP translocase 1 (ANT1), and its yeast homolog ADP/ATP carrier 2 (Aac2), cause the protein to accumulate along the protein import pathway, thereby obstructing general protein translocation into mitochondria. This impairs mitochondrial respiration, cytosolic proteostasis, and cell viability independent of ANT1’s nucleotide transport activity. The mutations act synergistically, as double mutant Aac2/ANT1 causes severe clogging primarily at the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex. This confers extreme toxicity in yeast. In mice, expression of a super-clogger ANT1 variant led to neurodegeneration and an age-dependent dominant myopathy that phenocopy ANT1-induced human disease, suggesting clogging as a mechanism of disease. More broadly, this work implies the existence of uncharacterized amino acid requirements for mitochondrial carrier proteins to avoid clogging and subsequent disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside our cells, compartments known as mitochondria generate the chemical energy required for life processes to unfold. Most of the proteins found within mitochondria are manufactured in another part of the cell (known as the cytosol) and then imported with the help of specialist machinery. For example, the TOM and TIM22 channels provide a route for the proteins to cross the two membrane barriers that separate the cytosol from the inside of a mitochondrion.</p><p>ANT1 is a protein that is found inside mitochondria in humans, where it acts as a transport system for the cell’s energy currency. Specific mutations in the gene encoding ANT1 have been linked to degenerative conditions that affect the muscles and the brain. However, it remains unclear how these mutations cause disease.</p><p>To address this question, Coyne et al. recreated some of the mutations in the gene encoding the yeast equivalent of ANT1 (known as Aac2). Experiments in yeast cells carrying these mutations showed that the Aac2 protein accumulated in the TOM and TIM22 channels, creating a ‘clog’ that prevented other essential proteins from reaching the mitochondria. As a result, the yeast cells died. Mutant forms of the human ANT1 protein also clogged up the TOM and TIM22 channels of human cells in a similar way.</p><p>Further experiments focused on mice genetically engineered to produce a “super-clogger” version of the mouse equivalent of ANT1. The animals soon developed muscle and neurological conditions similar to those observed in human diseases associated with ANT1.</p><p>The findings of Coyne et al. suggest that certain genetic mutations in the gene encoding the ANT1 protein cause disease by blocking the transport of other proteins to the mitochondria, rather than by directly affecting ANT1’s nucleotide trnsport role in the cell. This redefines our understanding of diseases associated with mitochondrial proteins, potentially altering how treatments for these conditions are designed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>protein import</kwd><kwd>clogging</kwd><kwd>Ant1</kwd><kwd>disease</kwd><kwd>mPOS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG063499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xin Jie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG061204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xin Jie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30AG060702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coyne</surname><given-names>Liam P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>project ID 269925409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BE 4679 2/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Missense mutations in the nuclear-encoded adenine nucleotide translocase 1 (Ant1) cause the protein to clog the mitochondrial protein import pathway, to severely inhibit cell growth in yeast, and to cause neurodegeneration and myopathy in mice that phenocopy ANT1-induced human disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are essential organelles responsible for a wide range of cellular functions. To carry out these functions, they are equipped with a proteome of 1,000–1,500 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sickmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pagliarini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morgenstern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morgenstern et al., 2021</xref>). The vast majority of these proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome, synthesized in the cytosol, and sorted into one of the four mitochondrial sub-compartments, namely the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), intermembrane space (IMS), inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), and the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endo and Yamano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chacinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wiedemann and Pfanner, 2017</xref>). The entry gate by which &gt;90% of mitochondrial proteins enter mitochondria is the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex. Therefore, proper function of the TOM complex is paramount for mitochondrial function and cell viability.</p><p>After passage through the TOM complex, specialized protein translocases transport preproteins into the mitochondrial sub-compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endo and Yamano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chacinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wiedemann and Pfanner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Marcos-Lousa et al., 2006</xref>). The import of mitochondrial carrier proteins to the protein-dense IMM is particularly challenging. Molecular chaperones like Hsp70 and Hsp90 target these highly hydrophobic proteins through the cytosol to the Tom70 receptor, which is associated with the TOM complex on the mitochondrial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Young et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhangoo et al., 2007</xref>). After transport through the channel-forming Tom40 subunit of the TOM complex, the heterohexameric small TIM chaperones (i.e. the Tim9-Tim10 complex) transport the preprotein to the carrier translocase of the inner membrane (TIM22 complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koehler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sirrenberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiedemann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Truscott et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Webb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Weinhäupl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ellenrieder et al., 2019</xref>). The carrier translocase is a multisubunit complex that inserts carrier proteins into the IMM in a membrane potential (Δψ)-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sirrenberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kerscher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kovermann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rehling et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Qi et al., 2021</xref>). The central subunit Tim22 integrates carrier proteins into the IMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rehling et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peixoto et al., 2007</xref>). It associates with different partner proteins in yeast and human mitochondria. In yeast, Tim18 and Sdh3 are required for assembly and stability of the carrier translocase, whereas Tim54 tethers the small TIM chaperones (Tim9-Tim10-Tim12 complex) to the translocase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gebert et al., 2011</xref>). In human cells, TIM22 associates with the acylglycerol kinase (AGK) and TIM29, which are both required for full import capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Callegari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vukotic et al., 2017</xref>). Human TIM22 also associates with the TIM9-TIM10 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Qi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Several diseases are associated with mutations directly affecting the protein import machinery of the carrier pathway. For example, mutations in <italic>TIMM8A</italic> have been found in patients suffering Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome/deafness dystonia syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koehler et al., 1999</xref>).

Mutations in another TIM22 complex subunit, AGK, has been associated with the Senger’s syndrome marked by cataracts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and exercise intolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vukotic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mayr et al., 2012</xref>). Clearly, defective protein import is linked to neurological and musculoskeletal diseases. However, whether protein import defects contribute to diseases not directly related to mutations in the core protein import machinery is unclear.</p><p>Here, we show that pathogenic missense mutations in a mitochondrial carrier protein, ADP/ATP translocase 1 (ANT1) or ADP/ATP carrier 2 (Aac2) in yeast, cause arrest of the protein at the translocases during import into mitochondria. This effectively ‘clogs’ the protein import pathway to obstruct general protein import and is associated with muscle and neurological disease in mice. Our findings demonstrate that global protein import is vulnerable to missense mutations in mitochondrial preproteins, and also provide strong evidence that protein import clogging contributes to neurological and muscular syndromes caused by dominant mutations in Ant1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaukonen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Siciliano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Simoncini et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Super-toxic Aac2p mutants dominantly kill cells</title><p>We previously showed that four pathogenic ANT1 variants modeled in the yeast Aac2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) share numerous dominant phenotypes including cold sensitivity, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) instability, a propensity to misfold inside mitochondria, and hypersensitivity to low Δψ conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coyne and Chen, 2019</xref>). We reasoned that if the mutant proteins share a common mechanism of toxicity that drives these phenotypes, then combining mutations into a single protein may enhance toxicity. To test this, we transformed the wild-type M2915-6A yeast strain with centromeric plasmids expressing wild-type, single and double mutant <italic>aac2</italic> alleles, and selected for Ura<sup>+</sup> transformants on glucose medium. We found that transformants expressing <italic>aac2<sup>M114P,A128P</sup></italic> and <italic>aac2<sup>M114P,A137D</sup></italic> formed smaller colonies on the selective medium at 25°C relative to wild-type <italic>AAC2</italic> and single mutant alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

If 5 mmoles per mole of Aac2p<sup>A128P</sup> molecules are bound to Tim22p in vivo, this could theoretically occupy ~85% of Tim22p channels, as Aac2p is present at ~188,000 molecules per cell and Tim22p at just 1100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morgenstern et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, the data suggest that Aac2p<sup>A128P</sup> is stalled at both the TOM and TIM22 complexes during import.</p><p>Genetic and transcriptional analyses provided additional support for a clogging activity associated with Aac2p<sup>A128P</sup>. First, we observed that <italic>aac2<sup>A128P</sup></italic>-expressing cells are sensitive to genetic perturbation to the carrier import pathway. <italic>TOM70</italic> and <italic>TIM18</italic> are two non-essential genes directly involved in the import of mitochondrial carrier proteins such as Aac2, serving as an import receptor at the TOM complex and a component of the TIM22 complex, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Young et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>). We found that meiotic segregants combining <italic>aac2<sup>A128P</sup></italic> expression with <italic>tom70Δ</italic> or <italic>tim18Δ</italic> form barely visible microcolonies at 30°C on glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>). It was recently proposed that Tom70p’s primary function is to recruit chaperones to the mitochondrial surface to prevent proteotoxicity in this protein-dense region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backes et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, deletion of <italic>TOM70</italic> may affect <italic>aac2<sup>A128P</sup></italic> cells by two mechanisms: first, by further reducing carrier protein import and subsequently by impairing cytosolic proteostasis in the context of mitochondrial preprotein overaccumulation in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Next, we wondered whether the cellular response to acute Aac2p<sup>A128P</sup> expression could be indicative of protein import stress. To test this, we surveyed expression levels of a panel of genes known to be upregulated by clogging the TOM complex. These experiments were performed in the BY4742 strain background, in which expression of <italic>aac2<sup>A128P</sup></italic> is incompatible with mtDNA loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), thus minimizing any transcriptional effects secondary to mtDNA loss.

Like in yeast, combining missense mutations in Ant1 dramatically reduced steady-state protein levels, suggesting impaired ANT1 biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Most strikingly, the level of ANT1<sup>A114P,A123D</sup>, equivalent to the yeast Aac2p<sup>A128P,A137D</sup>, is only 2.2% of the wild-type. Three lines of evidence suggest that ANT1<sup>A114P</sup> and ANT1<sup>A114P,A123D</sup> obstruct protein import into mitochondria. First, immunoprecipitation of ANT1<sup>A114P</sup>-HA demonstrated that the mutant protein has increased interactions with components of both TOM and TIM22 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>), as observed with its yeast ortholog Aac2p<sup>A128P</sup>. A meaningful immunoprecipitation of Aac2p<sup>A128P,A137D</sup>-HA was precluded by the extremely low-level accumulation of the mutant protein. Second, protease protection assay demonstrated that 42% and 52% of total ANT1<sup>A114P</sup> and ANT1<sup>A114P,A123D</sup> proteins are exposed on the OMM, whereas the wild-type ANT1 is protected from proteinase K digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>). This is consistent with in vitro import studies of the Aac2p variants in yeast mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>). Third, proteomics demonstrated that mitochondrial proteins accumulate in the cytosol of <italic>SLC25A4 <sup>p.A114P</sup></italic> and <italic>SLC25A4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic> -transfected cells, compared with wild-type Ant1-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

In this report, we have uncovered the first example of naturally occurring missense mutations in an endogenous mitochondrial protein causing toxic protein import clogging.

The data supports a model in which import clogging kills yeast cells and contributes to muscle and neurological degeneration in mice.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mitochondrial protein import can be clogged by a mutant mitochondrial preprotein</title><p>The mitochondrial carrier protein family is the largest of the transporter families and has highly conserved domain and sequence features across all eukaryotes. Their import into mitochondria is unique in that they assume partially folded conformations called ‘hairpin loops’ that place adjacent hydrophobic α-helices antiparallel with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Marcos-Lousa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiedemann et al., 2001</xref>). There are three ‘hairpin loop’ modules per carrier preprotein that transit through the Tom40 β-barrel in a loop-first topology, such that the C- and N-termini initially remain exposed to the cytosol. This leaves little wiggle room for the carrier preprotein considering the Tom40 β-barrel can only accommodate the width of up to two α-helical segments at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiedemann et al., 2001</xref>). To get through the Tom40 β-barrel pore, the hydrophobic hairpin loops are thought to be guided by an array of hydrophobic patches on the inside of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shiota et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araiso et al., 2019</xref>). It is in the hydrophobic α-helices of the ADP/ATP translocase ANT1 (Aac2p in yeast) that dominant pathogenic mutations are found, which introduce either a proline or an aspartic acid (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Here, we show that these mutations cause the protein to arrest at or in the TOM complex, thereby partially obstructing general protein import. There are multiple potential mechanisms. First, as the mutations introduce a proline or aspartic acid into the hydrophobic α-helix, it may simply be loss of the necessary hydrophobic interaction with the inner surface of the Tom40 β-barrel pore. Another possibility is that the hairpin loop structure is disrupted such that it becomes too wide to fit through the narrow pore. This may be particularly relevant for the proline mutants which would introduce a kink into the α-helix. A third possibility is that mutant ANT1/Aac2p is not impaired in transit through the pore, but instead is inefficiently chaperoned by the small TIM chaperones in the IMS, leading to ‘backpressure’ in the pathway. Interestingly, carrier preproteins appear to form partial α-helical secondary structures while bound to the Tim9-Tim10 chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Weinhäupl et al., 2018</xref>). Future work will be essential to rigorously decipher between these potential mechanisms of clogging.</p><p>The data strongly suggest that double mutant Aac2p preferentially clogs the TOM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation of single mutants Aac2p<sup>A128P</sup> and ANT1<sup>A114P</sup> showed increased association with both the TOM and TIM22 complexes. We interpret these data with caution, as it would be unexpected that single mutants would clog at multiple locations. However, it is possible that hairpin loops and/or hydrophobic α-helices are crucial for interaction with both complexes. As the precise mechanism of import and IMM insertion by the TIM22 complex remains unresolved, it would be premature to speculate on potential clogging mechanisms.</p><p>One of the most surprising observations of this study was the extreme toxicity of the double mutant clogger proteins that arrest at the TOM complex. The deleterious stressors downstream of clogging are likely to be multifactorial and include respiratory defects and cytosolic protestatic stress via mPOS. While it is possible that general proteostasis is perturbed by Aac2p<sup>A128P,A137D</sup> saturating proteolytic machinery, our data suggest this is unlikely. The IMM-associated AAA protease Yme1p (and not the proteasome) appears to be a major proteolytic pathway for clogged Aac2p<sup>A128P,A137D</sup>. That genetic deletion of <italic>YME1</italic> is well tolerated in yeast cells suggests that loss of Yme1-based proteolysis does not underlie toxicity of <italic>aac2<sup>A128P,A137D</sup></italic> expression. We propose that clogging of the TOM complex is the primary mechanism of Aac2p<sup>A128P,A137D</sup>-induced protein import defects and the ensuing cell stress. Importantly, the former is strongly supported by in vitro experiments showing that Aac2p<sup>A128P,A137D</sup> is defective in translocating through the TOM complex in fully energized, wild-type mitochondria.</p><p>In the context of low Aac2p<sup>A128P,A137D</sup> levels in cells (just 4.7% of wild-type), it is important to note that the ADP/ATP carrier is one of the most abundant proteins in mitochondria, outnumbering the Tom40 pore-forming protein by almost an order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morgenstern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pfanner et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, if ~70% of the reduced level of Aac2p<sup>A128P,A137D</sup> is actively clogging TOM complexes, this would still occupy ~30% of the Tom40 channels, which may have a considerable effect on general protein import. This reflects the central importance of proper TOM complex function to mitochondrial and cell homeostasis, and also provides physiological justification for the existence of multiple pathways dedicated to unclogging the TOM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mårtensson et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It will be interesting to determine whether and how Yme1 plays a general role in quality control of the TIM22 import pathway.

Second, mitochondria from <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mouse muscle are able to exceed the maximal respiration rate of wild-type mitochondria when complex II is stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that one functional copy of Ant1 is sufficient to support high respiratory rates without compensatory increase in other Ant isoforms (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8s1sdata1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8s2sdata1">Figure 8—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2F</xref>). This is in stark contrast to <italic>Slc25a4</italic> knockout, which displays a &gt;30% reduction in complex II-based respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Graham et al., 1997</xref>). Third, the transcriptional profile in <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ skeletal muscle is entirely distinct from that in <italic>Slc25a4</italic> knockout mice, suggesting different underlying mechanisms of muscle dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>). Fourth, Ant1 likely functions as a monomer, making a dominant-negative mechanism of adenine nucleotide transport unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pebay-Peyroula et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ruprecht et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kunji and Ruprecht, 2020</xref>). Finally, the yeast equivalent of Ant1<sup>A114P,A123D</sup>, Aac2p<sup>A128P,A137D</sup>, is catalytically inactive yet clearly exerts toxicity even in conditions where <italic>aac2Δ</italic> cells are healthy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Taken together, the evidence is clear that dominant <italic>SLC25A4</italic> mutations cause gain-of-function phenotypes in patients, <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p. A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mice and yeast models.</p><p>In this study, we elucidated a candidate molecular mechanism of dominant Ant1-induced disease using yeast, human cells, and a novel mouse model. We found that pathogenic ANT1 mutations modeled in yeast’s Aac2p cause the protein to clog global mitochondrial protein import leading to respiratory defects, cytosolic proteostatic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>), and loss of cell viability. Combining two mutations into a single Ant1 protein drastically enhanced clogging activity, which tightly correlated with toxicity. We extensively characterized one such ‘super-clogger’ variant, Aac2p<sup>A128P,A137D</sup>, and found that the main clogging site shifted to the TOM complex, providing an explanation for the increased toxicity. Protein import clogging was strikingly consistent in transfected human cells, as ANT1<sup>A114P</sup> and ANT1<sup>A114P,A123D</sup> (ortholog of yeast Aac2p<sup>A128P,A137D</sup>) physically associated with the TOM and TIM22 complexes, was exposed on the outside of intact mitochondria, and caused mitochondrial protein retention in the cytosol. Even in mice, Ant1<sup>A114P,A123D</sup> expression correlated with retention of mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol despite minute levels of the mutant protein, presumably due to degradation. Finally, we found that <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mice phenocopy ANT1-induced autosomal dominant progressive external opthalmoplegia (adPEO) patients, as <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mice exhibit mild OXPHOS defects, partially COX-deficient myofibers, moderate myofiber atrophy, and muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaukonen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Komaki et al., 2002</xref>). The low-penetrant neurodegeneration in <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mice may also reflect human disease process, as a neurodegenerative phenotype has been reported in an adPEO patient carrying the <italic>SLC25A4 <sup>p.A114P</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Simoncini et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these data strongly argue that protein import clogging contributes to adPEO in humans, despite <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic> not directly genocopying a particular clinical condition. We do note, however, that additional contributory mechanisms and even <italic>SLC25A4</italic> deficiency cannot be completely excluded without in vivo rescue experiments.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that pathogenic mutations in a mitochondrial carrier protein can cause clogging of the protein import pathway, which induces multifactorial cellular stress and correlates with cell toxicity and disease in mice. These findings uncovered a vulnerability of the mitochondrial protein import machinery to single amino acid substitutions in mitochondrial inner membrane preproteins. There are 53 carrier proteins in human mitochondria that have highly conserved domain organization both within and across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Palmieri et al., 2011</xref>). Mutations altering conformational elements involved in protein import, such as hairpin loops, are likely strongly selected against during evolution. Those persisting in the human population would affect protein import and cause disease, as exemplified by the dominant pathogenic mutations in <italic>SLC25A4</italic>.</p><p>Our work provides just a first glimpse into the amino acid requirements of mitochondrial carrier proteins to maintain compatibility with the mitochondrial protein import machinery. Future work will be crucial to systematically evaluate the amino acid requirements first within ANT1/Aac2p, and then across entire carrier protein family. It will also be important to determine which specific interactions with protein import components are affected by different mutations. Overall, these efforts may enable the prediction of pathogenic mechanisms of future variants of uncertain significance as they arise with more exome sequencing of human patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Key resources table - see Appendix 1.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast growth conditions and genetic manipulation</title><p>Yeast cells were grown using standard media.

Two unique restriction sites, <italic>Asc</italic>I and <italic>Asi</italic>SI, were also introduced into the 3’ end of the second loxP site to allow insertion of the <italic>Slc25a4</italic> mini-cDNA containing the A114P and A123D knock-in mutations as well as the His-tag at the carboxyl terminus.</p><p>The <italic>Slc25a4</italic> mini-cDNA was prepared by fusion PCR using primers with sequences overlapping different exons. The mini-cDNA contains <italic>Asc</italic>I and <italic>Asi</italic>SI unique restriction sites in the 5’ and 3’ end, respectively, together with 254 bp of intron 1 sequence together with the splice acceptor followed by exon 2 with the two mutations, exons 2 and 4, and 70 bp of 3’ downstream sequence. The mini-cDNA was cloned into pSK+ and sequenced to confirm its identity prior to insertion into the <italic>Asc</italic>I and <italic>Asi</italic>SI sites in the targeting vector. The final targeting vector was then linearized by <italic>Not</italic>I digestion, purified, and resuspended in PBS at 1 mg/µL for electroporation into ES cells derived from F1 (129Sv/C57BL6j) blastocyst. Targeted ES clones were identified by long-range nested PCR using Platinum HiFi Taq (Invitrogen).</p><p>Chimeric animals were generated by aggregation of ES cells with the CD1 morula. Chimeric males were bred with ROSA26-Flpe female (Jackson Labs stock no: 009086) to remove the PGKnew cassette and generate F1 pups with <italic>Slc25a4</italic> floxed allele. Positive pups were identified by PCR genotyping using primer Lox gtF (5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">ATCCATCTCAAAGGCAAACG</named-content>-3’) and Lox gtR (5’- <named-content content-type="sequence">AAATTCCCTGCAGGCTTATG</named-content>-3’) to detect a fragment of 364 bp specific to the 5’-Lox site and a fragment of 270 bp specific to the wild-type allele. A heterozygous floxed male was bred with Hprt-Cre female (Jackson Labs stock no: 004032). The same primers were used for genotyping knock-in mice, with the 270 bp band present only with the knock-in allele, and no band produced from a wild-type locus with lacking loxP sites. The mixed background heterozygous knock-in (i.e. <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p. A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+) male mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6NTac females (Taconic Catalog no: B6-F) for seven generations before experiments were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Mouse histology</title><p>For spinal cord histology, mice were sacrificed by isoflurane overdose, followed by intracardial perfusion with PBS followed by PBS+4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Perfused mice were soaked in PBS+4% PFA overnight at 4°C, and then spinal cord was dissected and cryopreserved with increasing concentrations of sucrose in PBS. Tissue was then embedded in OCT and snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane on liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Tissue was sectioned at 8 μm with a cryostat (Leica) and sections stained with Cresyl Violet Stain Solution according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Abcam) or used for indirect immunofluorescence. For the latter, tissue was blocked with 10% horse serum and then incubated with rat monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody (Invitrogen) overnight at 4°C. After rinsing the tissue was incubated with fluorescently conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody (ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA).</p><p>For muscle histology, the soleus muscles were quickly dissected and fresh-frozen in 2-methylbutane on liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Tissue was cryosectioned at 10 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin using standard procedures. Feret’s diameter of myofibers was determined using ImageJ software; all soleus myofibers from a single muscle section per mouse (n&gt;340 fibers per mouse) were quantitated by a blinded observer. For SDH-only staining, sections were air-dried, incubated at 37°C for 45 min in SDH medium (0.1 M succinic acid, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7, 0.2 mM phenazine methosulfate, +1 mg/mL NBT added fresh), drained, fixed in 10% formalin, rinsed well with water, and mounted in water soluble mounting medium. For sequential COX/SDH staining, sections were air-dried, incubated in cytochrome <italic>c</italic> medium (0.5 mg/mL 3’3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, 75 mg/mL sucrose in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with freshly added cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and catalase at 1 and 0.1 mg/mL, respectively) at 37°C for 1 hr, followed by a quick wash in water and SDH staining as described above. Abnormal COX/SDH-stained fibers were scored manually from decoded images of whole soleus sections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>For electron microscopy, <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mice and littermate controls were processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Massa et al., 2004</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused intracardially with PBS initially, followed by fixative (1% PFA, 1% glutaraldehyde, 0.12 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.1, and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Perfused animals were refrigerated overnight, and CNS tissues were dissected the next day and processed for TEM. The samples were examined with a JOEL JEM1400 transmission electron microscope and images were acquired with a Gaten DAT-832 Orius camera.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Bioenergetic analysis</title><p>For mitochondrial respiration experiments, the mice were sacrificed by decapitation via guillotine without the use of CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation or anesthetic. Skeletal muscle mitochondria were isolated and respiration measured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia-Cazarin et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, after mitochondria isolation by differential centrifugation, oxygen tension was measured using an Oxygraph Plus oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments) in 0.5 mL experimental buffer containing 150 μg mitochondria in a temperature-controlled 37°C chamber. For complex I measurements, glutamate and malate were added for a final concentration of 5 and 2.5 mM, respectively. For complex II measurements, rotenone was added before succinate, for final concentrations of 5 μM and 10 mM, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Protease protection assay of mouse skeletal muscle mitochondria</title><p>For protease protection assay, skeletal muscle mitochondria were isolated as for bioenergetic analysis with slight modifications, including the addition of 1 mM PMSF in the homogenization buffer, and resuspending mitochondria in a modified isotonic buffer lacking BSA (75 mM sucrose, 215 mM mannitol, 1 mM EGTA in 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4). Eighty μg aliquots were treated with the indicated concentrations of proteinase K (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature and quenched with 5 mM PMSF on ice for 10 min. Where indicated, mitochondria were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. Laemmli buffer was ultimately added to the samples such that the final protein concentration was ~40 μg mitochondria per 15 μL, which was the amount loaded onto the SDS-PAGE gel for western blotting. Such high protein amounts were required for detection of Ant1<sup>A114P,A123D</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>BN-PAGE</title><p>Snap-frozen mouse skeletal muscle mitochondria isolated for bioenergetic analysis were used for BN-PAGE. Protein complexes were solubilized with digitonin at a 4:1 detergent:protein ratio and loaded into native PAGE gel (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer’s instructions. For western blotting, gels were washed in 2% SDS followed by standard electrophoretic transfer to a PVDF membrane. Following transfer, membrane was fixed with acetic acid and dried followed by standard western blotting techniques.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Mouse skeletal muscle sub-cellular fractionation</title><p>Five biological replicates of wild-type and <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup>/</italic>+ muscle samples were fractionated to obtain cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions using differential centrifugation, as follows. One-hundred mg Quadriceps muscle was rapidly dissected and immediately placed in ice-cold PBS. Muscle was minced, centrifuged for 1 min at 500×<italic>g</italic>, and resuspended in 1 mL buffer STM (250 mM sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> plus HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitors added fresh). Tissue was homogenized in a 2 mL Dounce homogenizer (0.15–0.25 mm clearance) with two strokes using a bench top drill press set to 570 rotations per minute. Homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 800×<italic>g</italic> twice, and the pellets were discarded after both spins. To obtain the mitochondrial fraction, supernatant was centrifuged for 11,000×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Mitochondrial fraction was washed twice in STM and frozen for further analysis. Meanwhile, the supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 21,000×<italic>g</italic> twice to remove any contaminating mitochondria from the cytosolic fraction, although this may not completely eliminate mitochondrial proteins trapped in small mitochondria-derived vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Mouse skeletal muscle cytosolic and mitochondrial protein digestion, labeling, cleanup, and fractionation</title><p>Skeletal muscle cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were then processed separately for multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry as follows. Samples were buffer exchanged on a 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff filter (Amicon 3k Ultracel) using four additions of 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 (Thermo). Following a Bradford assay, 50 µg of each cytosolic fraction was taken for digestion using an EasyPep Mini MS sample prep kit (Thermo, A40006). To each buffer-exchanged sample, 70 µL of lysis buffer was added followed by 50 µL of reduction solution and 50 µL of alkylating solution. Samples were incubated at 95°C for 10 min, then cooled to room temperature. To each sample 2.5 µg of trypsin/Lys-C protease was added and the reaction was incubated at 37°C overnight. TMT reagents were reconstituted with 40 µL ACN and the contents of each label added to a digested sample. After 60 min, 50 µL of quenching solution was added, consisting of 20% formic acid and 5% ammonium hydroxide (vol/vol) in water. The labeled digests were cleaned up by a solid-phase extraction contained in the EasyPep kit, and dried by speed-vac. The 10 cytosolic fractions were dissolved in 50 µL of 30% ACN and 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in water, combined, and dried again.</p><p>Following an LC-MS experiment to check digestion and labeling quality of the pooled samples, these were fractionated using a Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (part # 84868), per the manufacturer’s instructions for TMT-labeled peptides. In brief, samples were dissolved in 300 µL of 0.1% TFA in water and applied to the conditioned resin. Samples were washed first with water and then with 300 µL of 5% ACN, 0.1% triethylamine (TEA) in water. The second wash was collected for analysis. Peptides were step eluted from the resin using 300 µL of solvent consisting of 5–50% ACN with 0.1% TEA in eight steps. All collected fractions were dried in a speed-vac.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>LC-MS/MS for TMT-labeled samples</title><p>Dried fractions were reconstituted in 50 µL of load solvent consisting of 3% ACN and 0.5% formic acid in water.

The column was maintained at 50°C with a column oven (Sonation GmbH, PRSO-V2). The peptides were separated using a 135 min gradient consisting of 3–12.5% ACN over 60 min, 12.5–28% over 60 min, 28–85% ACN over 7 min, a 3 min hold, and 5 min re-equilibration at 3% ACN. The column was connected inline with an Orbitrap Lumos (Thermo) via a nanoelectrospray source operating at 2.3 kV. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent top speed mode with a cycle time of 3 s. MS<sup>1</sup> scans were collected from 375 to 1500 m/z at 120,000 resolution and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. HCD fragmentation at 40% collision energy was used followed by MS<sup>2</sup> scans in the Orbitrap at 50,000 resolution with a 105 ms maximum injection time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Database searching and reporter ion quantification</title><p>The MS data was searched using SequestHT in Proteome Discoverer (version 2.4, Thermo Scientific) against the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> proteome from Uniprot, containing 50,887 sequences, concatenated with common laboratory contaminant proteins. Enzyme specificity for trypsin was set to semi-tryptic with up to two missed cleavages. Precursor and product ion mass tolerances were 10 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively. Cysteine carbamidomethylation, TMT 10-plex at any N-terminus, and TMT 10-plex at lysine were set as a fixed modifications. Methionine oxidation was set as a variable modification. The output was filtered using the Percolator algorithm with strict FDR set to 0.01. Quantification parameters included the allowance of unique and razor peptides, reporter abundance based on intensity, lot-specific isotopic purity correction factors, normalization based on total peptide amount, protein ratio based on protein abundance, and hypothesis testing (ANOVA) for individual proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>Grip strength measurements</title><p>Grip strength measurements were performed using Bio-CIS software connected with the Grip Strength Test Model GT3 according to the manufacturer’s protocol for forelimb-only measurement using the grid (BIOSEB).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Benoît Kornmann as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hilla Weidberg (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The differentiation of the loss-of-function and gain-of-toxicity phenotypes associated with mutant AAC2 expression are well separated in the yeast models. However, the evidence supporting the specific contributions of gain-of-toxicity phenotypes in mammalian cell culture and mice expressing mutant ANT1 is less convincing. Please provide additional evidence to support the importance of gain-of-toxicity, as opposed to loss-of-function phenotypes induced by mutant ANT1 overexpression in these models.</p><p>2) The impact of ANT1/AAC2 mutant expression on biological processes including cytosolic/mitochondrial proteostasis, integrated stress response signaling, and phospholipid regulation should be expanded in a revised manuscript.</p><p>3) Please expand on the discussion regarding the mechanistic basis for clogging of mitochondrial protein import channels, as outlined in the reviewer comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors evaluate the potential for destabilizing, missense mutations in ANT1 to 'clog' the mitochondrial protein import pathway and promote pathologic mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of disease. Initially using a yeast system, they show that two independent mutations in the yeast ANT1, AAC2, obstructs protein import into the mitochondria monitoring import both in vitro and in yeast. They go on to show that mutant AAC2 is degraded by the IMM AAA+ protease YME1 in yeast, consistent with this protein being clogged in the import pathway and being partially accessible within the IMS. They then go on to demonstrate that expression of mutant ANT in HeLa cells similarly appears to similarly impair import. Finally, they generate a mouse model expressing a 'super-clogger' ANT containing two mutations linked to impaired import in yeast/cells. Using these mice, they show that expression of this superclogger impairs mitochondrial protein import, disrupts mitochondrial function, and promotes age-dependent mitochondrial myopathy phenotypes.</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that highlights the potential for 'clogging' of import channels by mutant proteins to promote mitochondrial dysfunction in disease. One of the challenges with this study is deconvoluting potential loss-of-function phenotypes associated with reductions in ANT1/AAC2 from gain-of-toxicity phenotypes linked to import clogging. This was addressed primarily in yeast, showing that phenotypes associated with overexpression of mutants (e.g., reduced growth on glucose media). The experiment showing that yeast AAC2 clogs import was also convincing including both in vitro and in vivo characterization, although it isn't clear why the proteomic experiments were performed with acute expression of A128P instead of the 'superclogger' double mutant. The extension of this work to mammalian cells and then mice is also admirable. However, the quality of characterization does begin to decline when moving into mammalian models. For example, there is no clear evidence that observed phenotypes can be attributed to gain of toxicity instead of loss of function in mammalian cells and mice. There are similarities to yeast, but this needs to be better defined. Lastly, I have questions related to the mouse model, such as how do these phenotypes compare to KO animals and why were homozygous mice used in some situations and heterozygous mice used in others.</p><p>Ultimately, the strengths of this manuscript lie in the yeast work. While the expansion into cells and mice is admirable, those characterizations are a bit weaker. I do think that it would be useful to allow authors an opportunity to address these concerns with additional experimentation and revision of the text, and I do think with additional characterization this manuscript would be of interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1. Does yme1 deletion increase interactions between mutant AAC2 and TOM subunits? One would expect that stabilizing the mutant protein should show even larger increases in interactions with the import complex.</p><p>2. It isn't clear to me why the MS experiments described in Figure 4 weren't performed with the double mutant 'superclogger', especially as this one showed the most interaction with TOM40 in Figure 2. I assume this is because the double mutant has lower levels, but regardless, one would expect that the double mutant would show larger recovery of cytosolic chaperones, TOM subunits, and TIM23 subunits. Could the authors explain their choice here? They claim that the A128P mutant blocks import of HSP60 in Figure S2B, which is fair, but it doesn't appear to do that in Figure 2H. Further, A128P doesn't seem to induce the same phenotypes as the double mutant 'superclogger' (e.g., Figure 1C). If the phenotypes are observed with A128P, what is the relevance of these increased interactions with import pathway? How can this be linked to import clogging? I guess the argument is linked to the acute expression in this experiment, but it isn't clear to me.</p><p>3. The transition into human cells is intriguing, but lacks some of the same necessary characterization performed in yeast. It would be useful to confirm that ANT1 mutants are causing gain of toxicity and not loss-of function by performing similar experiments in HeLa cells deficient in ANT1 to that performed in yeast growing cells in normal media or respiratory media, etc.</p><p>4. Along the same lines, as #2 above, it isn't clear to me why the authors probed interactions between A114P and TOM/TIM22 instead of the double mutant. If issues are coming with clogging, then one could expect that recovery of TOM/TIM22 subunits would be increased in double mutant purifications independent of expression levels of this mutant.</p><p>5. I don't understand how clogging of the TOM complex could lead to substrate specificity in mammalian cell models. Could the authors expand on that? I don't think it needs to be solved in this paper, but it is important to provide some context around this point.</p><p>6. ANT1-deficient mice have been generated and induce mitochondrial defects in muscle. How do the phenotypes observed in heterozygous mice expressing the 'superclogger' compare to the knockout mice? The authors indicate that the increase in maximal respiration observed at 9 months indicates that the observed phenotypes are independent of ATP/ADP transport, but this needs to be better characterized. Chronic changes could account for this.</p><p>7. It isn't clear to me why the authors use the homozygous mice to evaluate clogging in vivo, while the hets were used for all of the phenotypes. If the goal is to demonstrate phenotypes are linked to clogging, then why wouldn't the authors evaluate clogging in the context of the same mice used for phenotyping? What happens to the homozygous mice from a phenotypic perspective? One would expect it is worse considering the larger impact on 'clogging'.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are some caveats to this work that I summarize below. After these points are largely addressed the study is well suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specific points</p><p>1. The abstract states &quot;We propose that secondary structures of mitochondrial preproteins play an essential role in preventing clogging and disease&quot;. While it is tempting to generalize the authors' findings, this statement is not supported by presented data or discussion.</p><p>2. When describing Figure 1C, the authors state that cells co-expressing aac2 A128P, A137D and AAC2 &quot;form petites at much higher frequency…&quot;. They should provide actual numbers and include quantification to support this statement.</p><p>3. Figure 4A. Why is the Aac2p A128P mutant toxic at 25C but not at 30C? This observation is basically left unexplained.</p><p>4. Does mutant Aac2p/ANT1 expression affect mitochondrial phospholipids?

The experiments convincingly show that Aac2/Ant1 mutants clog TOM. However, the possibility that the mutants cause other type of stress, such as aggregation in the mitochondria or toxic accumulation in the cytosol, is not excluded. Therefore, the connection between clogging and the observed phenotypes is correlative and not necessarily causative. In fact, expression of Aac2 mutant in yeast deleted of Tom70 was synthetic lethal. As Tom70 is required for the entry of Aac2 to mitochondria and the TOM channel, this result might suggest that the Aac2 toxicity is caused by a cytosolic and not mitochondrial population of the mutant. The authors conclusion that this genetic interaction supports the clogging activity is thus unclear.</p><p>It will be helpful to clarify: 1. Were all mice phenotypes excluded in Ant1+/- mice? 2. Is it possible that some of the phenotypes, such as neurodegeneration, are due to a cytosolic burden caused by the Ant1 mutant, or misfolding of this mutant in the mitochondria, rather than TOM clogging?</p><p>As the evidence are still correlative the authors should tone down their conclusion and emphasize that the other possibilities were not excluded.</p><p>2. Do Aac2/Ant1 variants clog TOM, TIM22, or both? Including hypotheses in the discussion session could be helpful. In particular in regards to stabilization of mutant aac2 in yme1 deletion and not in proteasome impaired conditions, which demonstrated that Aac2 is degraded in the IMS and raises the possibility that the degradation is coupled to association with TIM22.</p><p>3. The involvement of Yme1 in Aac2's degradation is novel and exciting but not very well developed. Does mutant Aac2 interact with Yme1? Does Yme1-medaited degradation require interaction of mutant Aac2 with small TIMs? Does it require interaction with TIM22? Does Yme1 has a role in degrading other type of mitochondrial cloggers, such as Cyb2DHFR?</p><p>The above might be beyond the scope of the manuscript but could be at least raised in the discussion. In addition, Yme1-mediated degradation was shown using overexpression of Aac2A128P,A137D mutant. It would be beneficial to show stabilization of overexpressed Aac2A128P and Aac2A137D single mutants as well.</p><p>4. Figure S5- An empty vector control is missing to confirm that the overexpression of wild type Aac2 has no effect. The time frame of induction between the RPN4, HSP82, SSA3, SSA4 and CIS1 is very different. Addition of time points between 4h and 24h could clarify this issue.</p><p>5. Figure 7I- lines 317-8- &quot;Moreover, Smac also appears to be more sensitive to proteinase K in Ant1A114P,A123D/Ant1A114P,A123D mitochondria, while Mdh2 and Tim23 does not (Figure S7I-K).&quot; Smac is not the only protein that seems to be sensitive to proteinase K: a. Mdh2 levels are decreased as well as its size (appears as a smaller band), b. Tim23 levels seems lower as well, although its signal is oversaturated. A quantification of all proteins +/- protease could test whether they are less sensitive to the protease than Ant mutants. Same applies to Figure 5D.</p><p>The authors added the following helpful comment: &quot;While this could indicate instability or partial rupture of the OMM in mutant mitochondria, it could also be a result of clogging and imply that clogging does not affect all mitochondrial preproteins equally. Consistent with this concept, our experiments in yeast showed minimal effects of clogging on Ilv5, a mitochondrial matrix protein, in contrast to Hsp60 (Figure 1E; 2H-I).&quot; I agree with this conclusion and add that Tim23 is a TIM22 substrate and might be more sensitive to clogging of TIM22.</p><p>6. Figure 7G- The cytosolic fraction was collected after a relatively low speed centrifugation and might contain more than soluble proteins. For example, if the Ant1 mutants induce mitophagy or formation of MDVs, such structures might contain small mitochondrial fractions that could be detected as &quot;cytosol&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84330.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The differentiation of the loss-of-function and gain-of-toxicity phenotypes associated with mutant AAC2 expression are well separated in the yeast models. However, the evidence supporting the specific contributions of gain-of-toxicity phenotypes in mammalian cell culture and mice expressing mutant ANT1 is less convincing. Please provide additional evidence to support the importance of gain-of-toxicity, as opposed to loss-of-function phenotypes induced by mutant ANT1 overexpression in these models.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this important point regarding loss- vs gain-of-function mechanisms. To provide additional evidence to support gain-of-toxicity of Ant1<sup>A114P,A123D</sup> (encoded by <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>), we profiled the transcriptome of <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mouse skeletal muscle, reasoning that if loss-of-function played a major role in Ant1<sup>A114P,A123D</sup>-induced pathology in mice, then the transcriptional signature should resemble that of <italic>Slc25a4</italic> knock-out mice (Morrow et al., 2017). <italic>Slc25a4</italic> knockout mouse muscle show a robust increase in the myokines <italic>Fgf21</italic> and <italic>Gdf15</italic> by up to 50-fold and 12-fold, respectively (Morrow et al., 2017). <italic>Fgf21</italic> was not even detected in two of four <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ samples despite a sequencing depth of ~30 million reads/sample. <italic>Gdf15</italic> was reduced by 25% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.77). Pathway analyses of significantly upregulated genes in <italic>Slc25a4</italic> knockout muscle showed robust enrichment for genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Morrow et al., 2017). Using the same statistical tests and cutoffs, we didn’t find a single OXPHOS gene significantly upregulated in <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ muscle (see Data S6). <italic>Pgc-1</italic>a, the transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, was upregulated by 2.46-fold in <italic>Slc25a4</italic> knockout muscle but unchanged in <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+. Again, using the same statistical cutoffs and enrichment analysis software, we compared the top 25 most enriched pathways in significantly up- and down-regulated genes, and found only a single pathway of the 50 per genotype overlapped (Figure 8—figure supplement 2G). Clearly, the transcriptional signature of <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ skeletal muscle is entirely distinct from <italic>Slc25a4</italic> knockout, excluding the possibility that loss of Ant1 function is the major pathomechanism in <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mice.</p><p>Other comparisons with <italic>Slc25a4</italic> knockout mice are illuminating as well. Respirometry of mitochondria isolated from <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ skeletal muscle showed a significant increase in maximal respiration rate when complex II is stimulated (Figure 6). As we noted in our original manuscript, this indicates that one functional copy of Ant1 is sufficient to support high respiratory rates, arguing against ADP/ATP transport as a limiting factor. What we failed to note in our original manuscript is that this is not observed in <italic>Slc25a4</italic> knockout mice; in fact, complex II-based respiration is reduced by &gt;30% in <italic>Slc25a4</italic> knockout mice (Graham et al., Nature Genetics, 1997). We have now added this to the manuscript along with additional observations that strongly argue against loss of Ant1 function as a primary driver of <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ muscle phenotypes.</p><p>Additional clinical context may be informative as well, and we have clarified this point in the revised manuscript. Patients heterozygous for dominant <italic>SLC25A4</italic> mutations, such as p.A114P, exhibit clinical features that are not present in patients with homozygous loss of ANT1 function, such as neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric phenotypes (Deschauer et al., 2005; Echaniz-Laguna et al., 2012; Kashiki et al., 2022; Kaukonen et al., 2000; Napoli et al., 2001; Palmieri et al., 2005; Siciliano et al., 2003; Simoncini et al., 2017; Thompson et al., 2016; Tosserams et al., 2018). This strongly implies gain-of-function toxicity in patients. Moreover, some <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mice undergo frank neurodegeneration ending in paralysis and death within 2-3 weeks of symptom onset, while there are no neurological features of <italic>Slc25a4</italic> knockout mice. This is, in and of itself, a gain-of-function phenotype.</p><p>The transition to mammalian cell culture was intended to biochemically test if mutant ANT1 clogs protein import like yeast Aac2p. From this perspective, the original manuscript clearly demonstrated biochemical gain-of-function phenotypes, i.e. mutant ANT1 accumulation at the import machinery, mutant ANT1 being exposed on the outer membrane, and mitochondrial proteins accumulating in the cytosol. These biochemical phenotypes cannot reasonably be expected to result from loss of ANT1 function. We also note that total ANT levels (including ANT1, ANT2 and ANT3) can be drastically depleted in human cell culture without severely affecting OXPHOS or cell viability (Lu et al., 2017).</p><p>However, we absolutely agree with the broader point that at this stage we cannot completely exclude some contribution of haploinsufficiency in the context of clogging. We have adjusted our language in the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The impact of ANT1/AAC2 mutant expression on biological processes including cytosolic/mitochondrial proteostasis, integrated stress response signaling, and phospholipid regulation should be expanded in a revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>– To assess the impact on cytosolic proteostasis, we performed detailed analyses on the cytosolic proteome from both mammalian cell culture and mouse skeletal muscle, which showed modest increase in proteostatic stress signaling and chaperones, respectively. These data suggest possible cytosolic proteostatic stress. The data can be found in Figure 5H, Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-B, and Figure 8—figure supplement 1A-B.</p><p>– To assess the impact on mitochondrial proteostasis, we performed BN-PAGE analysis and found that, in mice, the respiratory complexes, respiratory supercomplexes, and Tim23 complex are minimally affected in <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mouse muscle mitochondria (Figure 8—figure supplement 1C-E). This suggests no severe effect on proteostasis on the inner mitochondrial membrane. We also performed quantitative proteomics on mitochondria isolated from mouse muscle (Figure 8—figure supplement 1F). While the mitochondrial proteome was overall minimally affected, we did observe a general increase in the levels of mitochondrial chaperones and proteases (Figure 8—figure supplement 1), suggesting there is at least a low level of mitochondrial proteostatic stress.</p><p>– To assess the impact on the integrated stress response (ISR), we performed western blot analysis of eIF2a and also performed RNA sequencing of <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mouse skeletal muscle, as described above. We found no evidence of ISR activation (Figure 8—figure supplement 2A-C).</p><p>– To explore the impact on phospholipid homeostasis, we used yeast genetics to test whether cells defective in cardioipin (CL) (<italic>pel1D</italic>) and/or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis (<italic>psd1D</italic>) are hypersensitive to expression a super-clogger <italic>aac2</italic> variant. Indeed, we found that expression of <italic>aac2<sup>A128P,A137D</sup></italic> strongly inhibited the growth of cells in both genetic backgrounds (Figure 4—figure supplement 3G-H). The data are consistent with previous observations that CL and PE facilitate mitochondrial protein import (Becker et al., 2013; Gebert et al., 2009). Alternatively, mitochondrial protein import clogging may affect phospholipid homoeostasis, which synergizes with <italic>pel1D</italic> and <italic>psd1D</italic> to cause cell lethality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please expand on the discussion regarding the mechanistic basis for clogging of mitochondrial protein import channels, as outlined in the reviewer comments.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded discussion on the mechanistic basis for clogging in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors evaluate the potential for destabilizing, missense mutations in ANT1 to 'clog' the mitochondrial protein import pathway and promote pathologic mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of disease. Initially using a yeast system, they show that two independent mutations in the yeast ANT1, AAC2, obstructs protein import into the mitochondria monitoring import both in vitro and in yeast. They go on to show that mutant AAC2 is degraded by the IMM AAA+ protease YME1 in yeast, consistent with this protein being clogged in the import pathway and being partially accessible within the IMS. They then go on to demonstrate that expression of mutant ANT in HeLa cells similarly appears to similarly impair import. Finally, they generate a mouse model expressing a 'super-clogger' ANT containing two mutations linked to impaired import in yeast/cells. Using these mice, they show that expression of this superclogger impairs mitochondrial protein import, disrupts mitochondrial function, and promotes age-dependent mitochondrial myopathy phenotypes.</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that highlights the potential for 'clogging' of import channels by mutant proteins to promote mitochondrial dysfunction in disease. One of the challenges with this study is deconvoluting potential loss-of-function phenotypes associated with reductions in ANT1/AAC2 from gain-of-toxicity phenotypes linked to import clogging. This was addressed primarily in yeast, showing that phenotypes associated with overexpression of mutants (e.g., reduced growth on glucose media). The experiment showing that yeast AAC2 clogs import was also convincing including both in vitro and in vivo characterization, although it isn't clear why the proteomic experiments were performed with acute expression of A128P instead of the 'superclogger' double mutant. The extension of this work to mammalian cells and then mice is also admirable. However, the quality of characterization does begin to decline when moving into mammalian models. For example, there is no clear evidence that observed phenotypes can be attributed to gain of toxicity instead of loss of function in mammalian cells and mice. There are similarities to yeast, but this needs to be better defined. Lastly, I have questions related to the mouse model, such as how do these phenotypes compare to KO animals and why were homozygous mice used in some situations and heterozygous mice used in others.</p><p>Ultimately, the strengths of this manuscript lie in the yeast work. While the expansion into cells and mice is admirable, those characterizations are a bit weaker. I do think that it would be useful to allow authors an opportunity to address these concerns with additional experimentation and revision of the text, and I do think with additional characterization this manuscript would be of interest to the readership of eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments. Regarding the loss vs gain-of-function phenotypes, please see the discussion above. We agree with the reviewer that the extent of characterization in the mammalian systems is less than that in yeast, but note that the original manuscript did contain substantial data from mammalian cells (11 panels of data and 1 data file) and our novel mouse model (31 panels of data, 1 data file, and 2 movies).

Does yme1 deletion increase interactions between mutant AAC2 and TOM subunits? One would expect that stabilizing the mutant protein should show even larger increases in interactions with the import complex.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent question. The interaction between mutant Aac2p and Yme1p is complex. With acute, inducible expression of mutant Aac2p (as in Figure 3), we would expect that yme1 deletion would increase Aac2p’s association with the TOM complex as suggested by the reviewer. However, deletion of Yme1p does not increase levels of chronically expressed Aac2p<sup>A128P</sup> (Liu et al., 2015), and actually leads to the general reduction in the biogenesis of wild-type carrier proteins (Kumar et al., 2023). The mechanistic details of Yme1p-based proteolysis of mutant Aac2p and potential anti-clogging activity will be important areas for future research but may be beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It isn't clear to me why the MS experiments described in Figure 4 weren't performed with the double mutant 'superclogger', especially as this one showed the most interaction with TOM40 in Figure 2. I assume this is because the double mutant has lower levels, but regardless, one would expect that the double mutant would show larger recovery of cytosolic chaperones, TOM subunits, and TIM23 subunits. Could the authors explain their choice here?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, we elected not to pull down double mutant Aac2p for mass spectrometry of co-eluted proteins because of the extremely low protein accumulation. From a technical standpoint, this experiment is unlikely to yield any interpretable information. First, co-IP experiments with wild-type Aac2p/ANT1 is notorious for yielding a large number of proteins, many of which are likely associating nonspecifically due to the protein-dense, two-dimensional environment of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Claypool et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2017). Given this high background in wild-type Aac2p/ANT1, reducing the level of the protein &gt;20-fold will even further reduce the signal-to-noise ratio. Second, the sensitivity of mass spectrometry compounds this problem. In our experiment, the control samples lacking a HIS tag still reliably eluted &gt;1,500 proteins, hence our workflow to eliminate this increased noise, as shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B. In our view, repeating this experiment with the double mutant is unlikely to be helpful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They claim that the A128P mutant blocks import of HSP60 in Figure S2B, which is fair, but it doesn't appear to do that in Figure 2H.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2H, expression of the mutant is from a centromeric vector and cells were grown in minimal selective medium against plasmid loss. Growth in minimal medium is expected to globally reduce protein synthesis and alleviate cytosolic proteostatic stress (mPOS). In addition, in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, the mutant <italic>aac2</italic> allele is expressed from a galactose-inducible promoter and the cells were grown in complete medium. We expect that the latter has higher expression of the mutant protein, which could also contribute to increased effect on protein import. However, we note that pre-Hsp60p does accumulate at steady state when mutant <italic>aac2</italic> is integrated into the genome and cells were grown in compete medium (Figure 2G), which may be most physiologically relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, A128P doesn't seem to induce the same phenotypes as the double mutant 'superclogger' (e.g., Figure 1C). If the phenotypes are observed with A128P, what is the relevance of these increased interactions with import pathway? How can this be linked to import clogging? I guess the argument is linked to the acute expression in this experiment, but it isn't clear to me.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding lack of severe phenotype of single mutants in Figure 1C: First, W303 is well known to be particularly tolerant to many mitochondrial insults, including single mutant <italic>aac2</italic> mutants (Wang et al., 2008a). Second, and perhaps relatedly, <italic>aac2</italic> mutants are rho-zero lethal in non-W303 strains, meaning these mutants cannot survive the loss of mtDNA. Thus, to (1) increase the probably that the strain is viable, and (2) allow us to observe the effect on mtDNA stability, we chose to integrate the double mutant into the W303 background.</p><p>The single mutants (including A128P) are highly toxic in M2915-6A background, which is the background in which we observed Aac2p<sup>A128P</sup> accumulation at the translocase complexes (Figure 4). A more in-depth explanation of the strain-dependent effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on cell viability can be found in our response to Reviewer 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The transition into human cells is intriguing, but lacks some of the same necessary characterization performed in yeast. It would be useful to confirm that ANT1 mutants are causing gain of toxicity and not loss-of function by performing similar experiments in HeLa cells deficient in ANT1 to that performed in yeast growing cells in normal media or respiratory media, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, severe depletion of all ADP/ATP transporter isoforms is surprisingly very well-tolerated by in mammalian cells in culture, even in regards to bioenergetics (Lu et al., 2017). The implication of this finding is that a very low level of ADP/ATP carriers is sufficient to support OXPHOS, which is surprising but consistent with our bioenergetic data from <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mice. In our view, performing CRISPR knockout of <italic>SLC25A4</italic> in HeLa cells followed by respiratory growth assay would have a limited contribution to the overall message of the manuscript, especially considering the considerable evidence of gain-of-toxicity and substantial bioenergetic characterization already present in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Along the same lines, as #2 above, it isn't clear to me why the authors probed interactions between A114P and TOM/TIM22 instead of the double mutant. If issues are coming with clogging, then one could expect that recovery of TOM/TIM22 subunits would be increased in double mutant purifications independent of expression levels of this mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the above explanation (response to #2) explaining our decision not to immunoprecipitate Ant1<sup>A114P,A123D</sup>, which accumulates to just 2.2% of the wild-type level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I don't understand how clogging of the TOM complex could lead to substrate specificity in mammalian cell models. Could the authors expand on that? I don't think it needs to be solved in this paper, but it is important to provide some context around this point.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question. The data in this study suggest that there is substrate specific TOM complex clogging in both yeast and mammalian models. One likely contributor is the observation that the Tom40 b-barrel pore contains several distinct protein paths (Araiso et al., 2019; Shiota et al., 2015). Thus, although the pore is narrow, it is certainly conceivable that some protein paths are more affected than others. This explanation has been added to the manuscript (Lines 469-471).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. ANT1-deficient mice have been generated and induce mitochondrial defects in muscle. How do the phenotypes observed in heterozygous mice expressing the 'superclogger' compare to the knockout mice? The authors indicate that the increase in maximal respiration observed at 9 months indicates that the observed phenotypes are independent of ATP/ADP transport, but this needs to be better characterized. Chronic changes could account for this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not making the phenotype comparison clearer in the original manuscript. A more rigorous comparison can be found above (in response to Essential Revisions) and in the revised manuscript (Figure 8—figure supplement 2G as well as an expanded Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It isn't clear to me why the authors use the homozygous mice to evaluate clogging in vivo, while the hets were used for all of the phenotypes. If the goal is to demonstrate phenotypes are linked to clogging, then why wouldn't the authors evaluate clogging in the context of the same mice used for phenotyping? What happens to the homozygous mice from a phenotypic perspective? One would expect it is worse considering the larger impact on 'clogging'.</p></disp-quote><p>We bred a small number of homozygous mice to detect and characterize the low-abundance mutant protein, which is otherwise overwhelmed by the wildtype in heterozygous mice (Figure 8A-E). We deliberately refrained from phenotypic characterization of homozygous mice because the A123D mutation in Ant1<sup>A114P,A123D</sup> renders the protein unable to transport ADP/ATP (see (Palmieri et al., 2005), which was corroborated in Figure 1C). Thus, disentangling gain-of-function vs loss of function in homozygous mice would be impossible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are some caveats to this work that I summarize below.

With subsequent studies (Wang and Chen, 2015) and now the discovery of import clogging, it is likely the cold-induced reduction in membrane potential synergizes with clogging to further reduce protein import and challenge cytosolic proteostasis with the accumulation of mitochondrial precursors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

However, we did not observe this in transfected human cells, where mutant ANT1-transfected cells are essentially indistinguishable from wild-type (Response Figure 1). This suggests that IMM complexes in immortalized human cells may be less susceptible to mutant ANT1 relative to yeast.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Mutant ANT1 does not drastically affect the assembly state of TIM22 complex, the TOM complex, or respiratory Complex I in HeLa cells.</title><p>(A-C) BN-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis of isolated mitochondria from transfected HeLa cells.

Does expression of mutant ANT1 induce integrated stress response (ISR) and whether some of the cytotoxic effects observed could be mitigated by ISR inhibition?</p></disp-quote><p>This is another very interesting question. As shown in the revised manuscript, we rigorously evaluated whether the ISR is activated in <italic>Slc25a4 <sup>p.A114P,A123D</sup></italic>/+ mice and found no evidence to support this (Figure 8—figure supplement 2A-F). The data suggest that clogging with Ant1<sup>A114P,A123D</sup> is a unique and/or potentially mild stressor in vivo given the highly efficient degradation of the protein, as suggested by extremely low mutant protein accumulation (Figure 8A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Would treating mice with pharmacological inhibitors of protein import (e.g. MitoBloCK-1) phenocopy the effects of mutant ANT1 expression? This would strengthen the present study and ascertain generality of the proposed model.</p></disp-quote><p>Treating mice with MitoBloCK-1 would be an extremely exciting experiment. We predict that its effect in vivo would largely depend on its bioavailability and tissue distribution, and may be unlikely to replicate the effects of mutant Ant1 because Ant1 expression is largely restricted to the muscle, heart and central nervous system. Given this caveat, the likely result of a distinct phenotype in MitoBloCK-1-treated mice would not provide much valuable information on the clogging model. Nevertheless, it could provide additional hypothesis-generating observations (which tissues are most susceptible to protein import defects and why?) so we thank the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The experiments convincingly show that Aac2/Ant1 mutants clog TOM. However, the possibility that the mutants cause other type of stress, such as aggregation in the mitochondria or toxic accumulation in the cytosol, is not excluded. Therefore, the connection between clogging and the observed phenotypes is correlative and not necessarily causative. In fact, expression of Aac2 mutant in yeast deleted of Tom70 was synthetic lethal. As Tom70 is required for the entry of Aac2 to mitochondria and the TOM channel, this result might suggest that the Aac2 toxicity is caused by a cytosolic and not mitochondrial population of the mutant. The authors conclusion that this genetic interaction supports the clogging activity is thus unclear.</p><p>It will be helpful to clarify: 1. Were all mice phenotypes excluded in Ant1+/- mice? 2. Is it possible that some of the phenotypes, such as neurodegeneration, are due to a cytosolic burden caused by the Ant1 mutant, or misfolding of this mutant in the mitochondria, rather than TOM clogging?</p><p>As the evidence are still correlative the authors should tone down their conclusion and emphasize that the other possibilities were not excluded.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We completely agree that we cannot exclude all possible mechanisms by which mutant Aac2p/ANT1 might be toxic, and have toned down our conclusion and emphasized our openness to other possibilities in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We also apologize for not making our working model clear in the manuscript. We expect that import clogging has far-reaching consequences, both intra- and extra-mitochondrial. Particularly in the cytosol, we absolutely expect that one of the effects of protein import clogging would be toxic mitochondrial protein accumulation and aggregation, which could include mutant Aac2p/ANT1 “waiting in the traffic jam”. This would be coherent with a model of clogging-induced toxicity.</p><p>With that said, there are some key experiments that argue against predominant cytosolic aggregation of mutant Aac2p/ANT1 independent of clogging. First, in our in vitro import experiments, the mutant proteins have increased association with the TOM complex, suggesting they are properly delivered to the mitochondria surface (Figure 2E-F). Second, we were unable to detect an increase in mutant Aac2p levels when using harsh solubilization conditions on whole cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C), suggesting the protein is not aggregated in the cytosol or mitochondria. We were similarly unable to extract any potentially aggregated quadruple mutant ANT1<sup>A90D, L98P,A114P,A123D</sup> from transfected human cells (Liu et al., 2019). Thus, we think it’s unlikely that cytosolic aggregation of mutant Aac2p/ANT1 in the absence of clogging is a major mechanism of toxicity.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for her careful thinking regarding the genetic interaction between mutant <italic>aac2</italic> and <italic>tom70D</italic>. We would like to clarify that Tom70p is not required for the entry of Aac2 into mitochondria and, surprisingly, deletion of <italic>TOM70</italic> and its paralog <italic>TOM71</italic> only reduce Aac2p biogenesis by ~50% (Backes et al., 2021). Tom20p and Tom22p serve as receptors for carrier proteins in the absence of Tom70p (Steger et al., 1990; Yamano et al., 2008). In this case, the mutant Aac2 would still be able to engage in clogging. Interestingly, it was recently proposed that Tom70p’s primary function is to recruit chaperones to the mitochondrial surface to prevent proteotoxicity in this protein-dense region (Backes et al., 2021). Thus, deletion of <italic>TOM70</italic> may affect <italic>aac2<sup>A128P</sup></italic> cells by two mechanisms: first, by further reducing carrier protein import and second by impairing cytosolic proteostasis in the context of pre-existing mitochondrial protein overaccumulation in the cytosol (Wang and Chen, 2015).</p><p>Regarding intramitochondrial protein aggregation, this was actually our original hypothesis for the mechanism of toxicity of double mutant Aac2p based on the aggregating properties of the mutant proteins in isolated mitochondria (Liu et al., 2015). However, we found no evidence of severe proteostatic stress on the inner mitochondrial membrane in the mammalian cells or mice, as discussed above.</p><p>Unfortunately, we are unable to exclude all phenotypes in <italic>Slc25a4<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice as we do not possess this mouse model. However, we do note that a neurodegenerative phenotype has never been reported in <italic>Slc25a4<sup>+/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Slc25a4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice despite &gt;25 years of characterization by Doug Wallace and colleagues. Likewise, a myopathy has never been reported in <italic>Slc25a4<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, consistent with normal clinical, biochemical and pathological features in heterozygous loss of function humans (Echaniz-Laguna et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Do Aac2/Ant1 variants clog TOM, TIM22, or both? Including hypotheses in the discussion session could be helpful. In particular in regards to stabilization of mutant aac2 in yme1 deletion and not in proteasome impaired conditions, which demonstrated that Aac2 is degraded in the IMS and raises the possibility that the degradation is coupled to association with TIM22.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion and have clarified our thoughts in the discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The involvement of Yme1 in Aac2's degradation is novel and exciting but not very well developed. Does mutant Aac2 interact with Yme1? Does Yme1-medaited degradation require interaction of mutant Aac2 with small TIMs? Does it require interaction with TIM22? Does Yme1 has a role in degrading other type of mitochondrial cloggers, such as Cyb2DHFR?</p><p>The above might be beyond the scope of the manuscript but could be at least raised in the discussion. In addition, Yme1-mediated degradation was shown using overexpression of Aac2A128P,A137D mutant. It would be beneficial to show stabilization of overexpressed Aac2A128P and Aac2A137D single mutants as well.</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent questions for future investigation and we have added some of these ideas to the discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure S5- An empty vector control is missing to confirm that the overexpression of wild type Aac2 has no effect. The time frame of induction between the RPN4, HSP82, SSA3, SSA4 and CIS1 is very different. Addition of time points between 4h and 24h could clarify this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clearer in the figure legend; this has been corrected. The strains used in Figure 4—figure supplement 3B-F (formerly Figure S5B-F) have a chromosomally integrated copy of wild-type and mutant <italic>aac2</italic> driven by the GAL10 promoter from the <italic>trp1</italic> locus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 7I- lines 317-8- &quot;Moreover, Smac also appears to be more sensitive to proteinase K in Ant1A114P,A123D/Ant1A114P,A123D mitochondria, while Mdh2 and Tim23 does not (Figure S7I-K).&quot; Smac is not the only protein that seems to be sensitive to proteinase K: a. Mdh2 levels are decreased as well as its size (appears as a smaller band), b. Tim23 levels seems lower as well, although its signal is oversaturated. A quantification of all proteins +/- protease could test whether they are less sensitive to the protease than Ant mutants. Same applies to Figure 5D.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree, there does seem to be some sensitivity of TIM23 and MDH2 to proteinase K, but this is the case in wild-type mitochondria. and there is no difference between wild-type and mutant mitochondria. We have quantified all proteins +/- protease, relative to untreated, and there is no difference between wild-type and mutant samples. We moved these data from supplemental to a main figure to consolidate the data (Figure 8E-H).</p><p>Similarly, in Figure 5D, there is some level of sensitivity to proteinase K even in wild-type ANT1-transfected cells. For example, the mitochondrial matrix protein TFAM is reduced in each proteinase K-treated sample with or without swelling. This likely represents physical disruption of a fraction of mitochondria during isolation. We controlled for this by normalizing the ANT1-HA level to the level of TFAM. We appreciate the reviewer’s keen eye in this regard.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors added the following helpful comment: &quot;While this could indicate instability or partial rupture of the OMM in mutant mitochondria, it could also be a result of clogging and imply that clogging does not affect all mitochondrial preproteins equally. Consistent with this concept, our experiments in yeast showed minimal effects of clogging on Ilv5, a mitochondrial matrix protein, in contrast to Hsp60 (Figure 1E; 2H-I).&quot; I agree with this conclusion and add that Tim23 is a TIM22 substrate and might be more sensitive to clogging of TIM22.</p><p>6. Figure 7G- The cytosolic fraction was collected after a relatively low speed centrifugation and might contain more than soluble proteins. For example, if the Ant1 mutants induce mitophagy or formation of MDVs, such structures might contain small mitochondrial fractions that could be detected as &quot;cytosol&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This caveat has been added to the manuscript.</p><p>References:</p><p>Araiso, Y., Tsutsumi, A., Qiu, J., Imai, K., Shiota, T., Song, J., Lindau, C., Wenz, L.S., Sakaue, H., Yunoki, K.<italic>, et al.</italic> (2019).
