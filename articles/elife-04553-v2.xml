are not well understood. Its highly conserved central helix (CH) directly binds the ternary SNARE complex and is required for all known CPX functions. The adjacent accessory helix (AH) is not conserved despite also playing an important role in CPX function, and numerous models for its mechanism have been proposed. We examined the impact of AH mutations and chimeras on CPX function in vivo and in vitro using <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The mouse AH fully restored function when substituted into worm CPX suggesting its mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. CPX inhibitory function was impaired when helix propagation into the CH was disrupted whereas replacing the AH with a non-native helical sequence restored CPX function. We propose that the AH operates by stabilizing CH secondary structure rather than through protein or lipid interactions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04553.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04553.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04553.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The nervous system sends information around the body in the form of electrical signals that travel through cells called neurons. These signals cannot pass across the small gaps—called synapses—that separate neighboring neurons. Instead, when electrical signals reach the synapse, chemicals called neurotransmitters are released across the gap and trigger an electrical signal in the next neuron.</p><p>Neurotransmitters are stored within neurons in small envelopes of membrane known as synaptic vesicles. They are released when the vesicles fuse with the membrane that surrounds the neuron. This fusion process must be tightly controlled to ensure that information is passed between the neurons at the right time.</p><p>Complexin is a small protein that controls vesicle fusion by binding to a group of proteins called the SNARE complex. It contains two structured sections called the central helix and the accessory helix, which are both important for vesicle fusion. The central helix is able to bind to the SNARE proteins, and it has the same sequence of amino acids—the building blocks of proteins—in all animals. However, the sequence of amino acids in the accessory helix varies widely across different animals and it is not clear whether it performs the same role in all of them.</p><p>Radoff et al. studied complexin in the nematode worm <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and found that when its accessory helix is replaced with the amino acid sequence from the mouse one, it can still properly control vesicle fusion. Indeed, complexin can still work properly when its accessory helix is replaced with an artificial protein helix that has a similar shape.</p><p>These experiments suggest that the overall structure of the accessory helix is more important than its exact sequence of amino acids. Radoff et al. propose that its role in vesicle fusion is to stabilize the structure of the central helix to allow it to bind to the SNARE proteins. The next challenge is to understand how vesicle fusion is prevented when complexin binds to the SNARE proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04553.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04553.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>complexin</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>SNARE</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM095674</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dittman</surname><given-names>Jeremy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001447</institution-id><institution>Rita Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>188423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dittman</surname><given-names>Jeremy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-AG019391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eliezer</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS085214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Jihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A deeply conserved feature of complexin's secondary structure underlies its inhibitory function despite poor primary sequence conservation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Precise control of synaptic vesicle fusion at the presynaptic terminal endows a nervous system with the means to regulate functional synaptic connectivity. Although many of the molecules required for neurotransmitter exocytosis are known, the mechanisms by which this process is regulated are less well understood. The core machinery of the fusion process is composed of the neuronal SNAREs (VAMP2, syntaxin 1, and SNAP-25) along with several SNARE-binding proteins such as synaptotagmin, Munc13, and Munc18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sudhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sudhof, 2013</xref>). These proteins are highly similar in sequence and function across species, reflecting the deep conservation of synaptic transmission. Complexin is another essential SNARE-binding protein, and genetic ablation of complexin profoundly impacts neurotransmitter release and its regulation in all synaptic preparations studied to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hobson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vaithianathan et al., 2013</xref>). Mammals possess four isoforms of complexin, and deletion of the two broadly expressed isoforms (mCpx1/2) is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). This small cytoplasmic protein possesses an alpha-helical SNARE-binding domain known as the central helix (CH), which is broadly conserved among metazoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pabst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bracher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brose, 2008</xref>). The CH domain of mCpx1 is flanked on its N-terminus by a stable alpha helix called the accessory helix (AH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pabst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>), and this domain has subsequently been shown to play an inhibitory role in mammalian, fly, and nematode synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xue et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trimbuch et al., 2014</xref>). However, the primary sequence of the AH domain is poorly conserved, and its secondary structure has only been investigated in rodent complexin. A wide variety of models for AH function have been proposed including direct binding to SNAREs or other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giraudo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kummel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bykhovskaia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2014</xref>), electrostatic interactions with membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trimbuch et al., 2014</xref>), and direct effects on the CH and its SNARE binding through secondary structure interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Do all of these mechanisms contribute to AH domain function? If the AH domain binds specifically to another protein, why is it so poorly conserved relative to the CH domain?</p><p>To investigate the mechanism of AH action and its conservation across phylogeny, we examined the AH domain structure and function in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> mCpx1/2 ortholog CPX-1 using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. While worm and mouse AH domains are two of the most divergent among published complexin sequences, the two domains could be exchanged without impairing function in vivo. Further, the recombinant worm AH formed a highly stable alpha helix in solution similar to the mouse AH. Abolishing the hydrophobic character of the worm or mouse AH domain had little effect, whereas disrupting helix stability and invasion of helical structure into the CH severely impaired complexin inhibitory function. Moreover, replacing the AH with an artificial helical sequence fully restored inhibitory function. Remarkably, this sequence was functional despite large differences in length, charge, and hydrophobicity, indicating that these properties are not critical for AH function. These experiments indicate that the principal role of the AH domain is to nucleate and propagate helical structure into the CH domain, and this function is conserved across evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis of the structure and function of the worm AH domain</title><p>A region of the alpha helical domain of mouse complexin binds tightly to the assembled SNARE bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), positioned in the groove formed by synaptobrevin and syntaxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bracher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). This so-called ‘central helix’ (CH) is deeply conserved across phylogeny (76% identity between mammals and nematodes), whereas the adjacent helical sequence corresponding to the mouse accessory helix (AH) is much more heterogeneous, with only 20% identity between mammals and nematodes based on the 18 residues N-terminal to CH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To compare AH function in mouse and worm, we first established whether the worm complexin protein CPX-1 possesses a stable helical region adjacent to its CH analogous to mouse complexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pabst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bracher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Computational predictions based on amino acid sequence indicated a highly stable helical region including 30 residues between P37 and G66 encompassing the AH and half of the CH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Munoz and Serrano, 1997</xref>). This domain was confirmed to be helical by solution-state NMR spectroscopy on recombinant full-length worm CPX-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Snead et al., 2014</xref>) as well as on a truncated version lacking its C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), validating the computational predictions for this protein. The stable helical structure of the AH domain is predicted to be deeply conserved across phylogeny based on the analysis of complexin sequences in 16 diverse metazoan species from seven phyla ranging from <italic>Trychoplax</italic> to human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1–2</xref>). Thus both mouse and worm complexin possess a stable alpha helical domain N-terminal to the CH despite sharing little sequence homology, and this is likely to be a universal feature of complexin.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04553.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The worm AH domain forms a stable helix and this structure is deeply conserved across phylogeny.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon diagram of the mammalian complexin-SNARE crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>) using PDB code 1KIL.

All transgenic rescue experiments reported in this study utilized a functional CPX-1::GFP fusion protein, and transgene expression was monitored by imaging neuromuscular junction (NMJ) fluorescence in living intact animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wragg et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Loss of CPX-1 caused a 12-fold increase in the rate of spontaneous fusion in the absence of external calcium at cholinergic NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hobson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wragg et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Rescue with full-length CPX-1 completely restored the basal synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion rate (3.3 ± 0.9 Hz for wild type, 2.7 ± 0.5 Hz for FL rescue) whereas rescue with the ΔAH<sub>short</sub> variant only partially reversed the increased rate of spontaneous fusion (39.8 ± 6.2 Hz for <italic>cpx-1</italic>, 20.8 ± 5.6 Hz for ΔAH<sub>short</sub> rescue). Thus CPX-1 retained a limited ability to inhibit fusion in the absence of the AH domain. In all cases, the muscle miniature EPSC amplitude was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with the neuronal expression of CPX-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>cpx-1</italic> mutants exposed to the cholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb paralyzed more rapidly than wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hobson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wragg et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with the NMJ recordings, rescue with ΔAH<sub>short</sub> or ΔAH<sub>long</sub> only partially restored wild-type sensitivity whereas full-length CPX-1 completely rescued aldicarb sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The helix-breaking proline in position 37 is shared by all of the published nematode genomes, so the short AH domain is a common feature of this phylum.

Taken together, these structural and functional results demonstrate that, despite the lack of sequence conservation between worm and mouse AH, the worm AH domain comprises a highly stable alpha helix that plays a major role in CPX-mediated inhibition of spontaneous SV fusion.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04553.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The worm AH contributes to CPX-1 inhibition of spontaneous vesicle fusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two deletions within the worm AH domain were used: <italic>ΔAH</italic><sub><italic>short</italic></sub> (35–49, <italic>red</italic>) and <italic>ΔAH</italic><sub><italic>long</italic></sub> (30–50, <italic>aqua</italic>).

Comparing AH domain properties in 16 species across seven phyla, three conserved features were apparent: a region of hydrophobic residues along the helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), stable helicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and high negative charge density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). One recent model of AH function proposes that an interaction between the hydrophobic AH residues and the tSNARE complex prevents full SNARE assembly thereby inhibiting SV fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kummel et al., 2011</xref>). To test this model in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, several hydrophobic residues in the AH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) were replaced with the charged residue, glutamate (<italic>h</italic>→E) and this CPX-1 variant was expressed in <italic>cpx-1</italic> mutants. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, the AH(<italic>h</italic>→E) was fully functional in the absence of all hydrophobic side chains. Moreover, the short mouse AH chimera was also functional even when its hydrophobic residues were replaced with glutamates. Similar observations have been reported at the fly NMJ using mouse Cpx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). These findings indicate that hydrophobic residues in the AH domain do not play a critical conserved role in complexin function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Impact of secondary structure on AH domain function</title><p>Previous studies on mouse complexin suggested that the helical structure of the AH domain is important for stabilizing the CH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pabst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>) and for the inhibitory function of mCpx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xue et al., 2007</xref>), but the reason for this requirement remains unclear. While several potential roles for the AH in mediating protein–protein interactions have been proposed, the AH may simply serve to nucleate and propagate helical structure into the CH region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>), but this idea has never been tested. To explore this possibility, a helix-breaking proline was inserted into the AH domain (R43P), and the effects on AH domain secondary structure of a recombinant truncated form of the mutant protein missing its C-terminal domain (ΔCT) were examined by NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, because conversion from random coil to alpha helix is a highly cooperative process, helicity in the CH domain is also predicted to decrease for the R43P mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Munoz and Serrano, 1997</xref>). Indeed, decreased NMR carbon secondary shifts were observed throughout the AH and extending well into the CH domain, confirming decreases in both nucleation and propagation of the helical conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy provides another measure of overall alpha helical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greenfield and Fasman, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saxena and Wetlaufer, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rohl and Baldwin, 1997</xref>). Absorption at 222 nm was monitored in recombinant ΔCT protein while titrating in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), a co-solvent known to stabilize alpha helices in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelson and Kallenbach, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Segawa et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shiraki et al., 1995</xref>). The increase in alpha helical structure with increasing concentration of TFE can be used to measure the stability and cooperativity of alpha helix formation. While some of the cooperativity arises from coordination of multiple TFE molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berkessel et al., 2006</xref>), intramolecular propagation of helical structure will also contribute. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the R43P variant displayed a lower propensity for helix formation with a lower cooperativity, consistent with both decreased helix nucleation and propagation, as also evident from both the computational predictions and the NMR data. In living worms, inserting a proline into the AH domain completely eliminated AH function since the CPX(R43P) rescue was indistinguishable from the ΔAH<sub>short</sub> rescue in both electrophysiological (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>) and behavioral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) assays of synaptic function.

Three predictions arise from this hypothesis: First, there should be a direct correlation between helical stability and inhibitory function. Second, disruption of helix propagation into the CH domain should impair CPX inhibition. And third, replacement of the AH with a non-native alpha helical domain should functionally substitute for the endogenous AH sequence and stabilize the CH domain.</p><p>The first prediction was examined by creating a series of CPX variants predicted computationally to feature decreasing helical stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Helical stability dropped monotonically as the residue at position 43 changed from R → V → F → P. Notably, the predictions also indicate a parallel decrease in the helicity of the CH helix, consistent with the nucleation/propagation hypothesis. This AH series was expressed in <italic>cpx-1</italic> mutants, and rescue was quantified using aldicarb sensitivity. Supporting this hypothesis, transgenic animals expressing this series of CPX-1 variants display a level of aldicarb sensitivity that mirrors the helical stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). To test the second prediction, helical propagation was blocked by inserting a Gly–Gly (GG) between the AH and CH domains. Because glycines destabilize helical structure, GG insertions are expected to disrupt helical propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Neil and DeGrado, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blaber et al., 1993</xref>) as supported by the computational predictions of AH and CH helical content. Rescue of <italic>cpx-1</italic> mutants with the GG variant demonstrated that insertion of a GG between the AH and CH was equivalent to deleting the entire AH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This disruption is not due to a shift in the orientation of AH domain hydrophobic residues (a consequence of inserting two residues) since inserting three glycines produced a similar loss of function (data not shown).

CD spectroscopy of TFE titrations on recombinant CPX-1(ΔCT) containing the 7-turn helix revealed that this variant is more helical than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The increased helicity values could arise because 24 residues of the CPX-1 AH were replaced with 30 residues of helical EAAK repeat, so a larger fraction of the whole polypeptide will necessarily be helical. As an independent measure of helical stability, we compared the helix-coil equilibrium constants derived from TFE titrations and found that the 7-turn polypeptide forms a more stable helix than wild-type CPX-1 (17.9% for 7-turn vs 32.4% for wild type). Thus, the 7-turn artificial alpha helix provides a stable helical substitute for the endogenous AH domain irrespective of its increased length. Additionally, the 7-turn construct displayed a lower apparent cooperativity than wild-type CPX-1 (2.8 for 7-turn vs 5.6 for wild type), but the true cooperativity of the 7-turn polypeptide was underestimated since it was quite helical even at 0% TFE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Surprisingly, the 7-turn helix fully rescued both aldicarb sensitivity and suppression of spontaneous fusion at cholinergic NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). Moreover, the AH(7-turn) sequence is electrostatically neutral overall, yet it fully restored CPX inhibition. Therefore, the conserved negative charge density of the AH domain was not essential for CPX inhibition. In fact, the charge density of the rescuing transgenes used in this study generally did not correlate with their function in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

It is not clear if these functions are always present in different species and whether they share the same underlying mechanisms. The results of this study indicate that although the AH domain is poorly conserved at the primary sequence level, at least some of its underlying inhibitory function and mechanism is preserved between species. Disruption of helix nucleation and propagation from the AH to the CH prevents CPX-mediated inhibition of spontaneous vesicle fusion. Furthermore, CPX-1 retains some inhibitory function in the absence of the AH but not in the absence of the CH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with the idea that inhibition derives from the CH. While the primary sequence of the CH is evolutionarily conserved in parallel with its SNARE binding partners, only the helical stability of the AH is retained across phylogeny. Thus, the various proposals of AH protein–protein interactions and electrostatic repulsion effects are not fundamental requirements of CPX inhibitory function at the synapse.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Evolution of complexin</title><p>Why compare complexins from multiple divergent species? Several features of the AH domain appear to be conserved across more than half a billion years of evolution based on the species examined here, so an evolutionary comparison provides insight into critical aspects of the underlying mechanisms. Beyond their primary sequence, the two most striking conserved features of the AH domain are its high negative charge density and the distribution and orientation of its hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 1–2</xref>). Although the deep conservation of charge density and hydrophobic moment suggests that they play a role in complexin function, the inhibition of spontaneous fusion does not require either feature in worm (this study) and hydrophobicity is superfluous in fly as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). Perhaps other roles of complexin utilize these properties. In contrast to charge and hydrophobicity, a stable helix is both deeply conserved and required for complexin inhibitory function. How conserved is helicity vs primary protein sequence? The SNARE-binding central helix is the defining motif of complexin homologs based on primary protein sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pabst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brose, 2008</xref>). Two of the most distantly related complexin genes reported belong to the placozoan <italic>Trichoplax adherens</italic> (<italic>Ta</italic>) and the ctenophore <italic>Mnemiopsis leidyi</italic> (<italic>Ml</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flicek et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the CH domains of these representatives of basal animal phyla, share 44% identity with the human Cpx1 CH. However, whereas the AH domain of <italic>Ta</italic> shares 40% identity with the human AH domain, there is only 10% sequence conservation between <italic>Ml</italic> and human AH domains. The predicted AH and CH structures for human and <italic>Ml</italic> both contain extended regions of stable helix propagation similar to worm, whereas <italic>Ta</italic> is predicted to have only a modest degree of stable helical structure on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This provides an evolutionary example of how primary sequence and helicity do not necessarily change in parallel in the AH domain. A speculative explanation for the noticeable increase in AH domain helical stability progressing from ctenophore (36%) to worm (54%) to mammal (&gt;80% in human) is the higher body temperatures of warm-blooded animals compared to soil- and marine invertebrates. Helical stability is highly dependent on ambient temperature, so the higher body temperatures of mammals and many other vertebrates may necessitate more stable helical sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Privalov, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scholtz and Baldwin, 1992</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Models of AH mechanism</title><p>Inhibition by complexin depends on the integrity of its AH domain in all studies where this domain has been examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giraudo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chicka and Chapman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giraudo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kummel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). Several models for AH-domain function have been proposed over the past few years. Based on the unusual stability of the helical structure of the AH motif noted in early studies of the complexin-SNARE complex, the AH has been speculated to nucleate and propagate helical structure into the SNARE-binding CH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Several groups have proposed that the AH domain of mouse Cpx1 competes with the C-terminal region of VAMP2 for a binding site on the tSNAREs thereby preventing full SNARE assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giraudo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). The AH is also thought to mediate an intermolecular interaction between neighboring SNARE complexes, and this <italic>trans</italic> Cpx/SNARE array was proposed to underlie complexin-mediated inhibition based on in vitro assays of membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kummel et al., 2011</xref>). A recent study examining the <italic>trans</italic> Cpx/SNARE array model in the fly NMJ found that mutations expected to disrupt the hydrophobic interaction between the AH domain and the tSNAREs did not impair inhibition of spontaneous SV fusion in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2014</xref>) in agreement with the hydrophobic residue substitutions used in the present study. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, another model conjectures that the AH domain can form a tight complex with the SNARE bundle and can also stabilize a partially-assembled state by binding directly to the C-terminal region of VAMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bykhovskaia et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to these AH-SNARE interaction models, electrostatic repulsion between the AH domain and membranes has been suggested to be inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trimbuch et al., 2014</xref>). Thus a broad range of models and features have been put forward to describe AH domain function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>How does the AH domain function?</title><p>Our results suggest that the mechanism of AH function is deeply conserved and relatively independent of the primary protein sequence, hydrophobicity, length, or net charge density, inconsistent with models that rely on specific AH-protein interactions or electrostatic AH-membrane interactions. However, the mechanistic effect of stabilizing the CH domain remains unclear. An appealing model is that a stabilized CH alpha helix interacts more efficiently with the assembling SNARE bundle thereby promoting the SNARE interaction required for complexin inhibition. Indeed, CH binding to SNAREs is reduced in the absence of the AH in mouse Cpx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xue et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, the CH domain could interact with an as yet unidentified synaptic protein, and this binding would then require stabilization by the AH. The models based on hydrophobic AH interactions or electrostatic contributions are not supported by the experiments described here, but these mechanisms may be more prominent in other species. Alternatively, the high negative charge and hydrophobic moment of the AH domain may be relevant for other complexin functions. Nevertheless, our data indicate that the nucleation and propagation function of the AH domain is universal for proper complexin function across species. Further exploration of the CH and its binding partners is required for a detailed mechanistic understanding of complexin inhibitory action at the synapse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>Animals were maintained at 20°C on agar nematode growth media seeded with OP50 bacteria as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3a">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

To calculate the percent helicity and Cα shifts, only the residues corresponding to the protein constructs were entered into Agadir.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers. We are very happy to say that your work has been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>This is a nice study in which the authors address the role of the accessory helix in the protein complexin. Previous work showed that the central helix mediates binding to the surface of the neuronal SNARE complex, and this interaction is essential for function in regulated exocytosis. Numerous studies have also shown that the accessory helix, localized N-terminally directly adjacent to the central helix, is also required for function but the mechanism is controversial. In particular, the discussion is dominated by a model that suggests a direct competitive binding of this helix to a partially assembled SNARE complex, preventing zippering of synaptobrevin. Here the authors use an elegant combination of genetic rescue experiments in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and structural methods to show that for function of the accessory helix all that is required is a helical structure of this domain, with no requirement for a specific sequence, charge density, or overall hydrophobicity. The experiments are elegant and compelling, and in my opinion the work settles a rather long-standing controversy in the field. The authors are very cautious in their Discussion (evidently, they are aware of strongly opinionated colleagues in this field), but I would like to encourage them to be more explicit. The data and conclusions make it highly unlikely that the accessory helix functions by another specific protein-protein interaction. The findings will make a splash as they challenge and dismiss, one-by-one, essentially all theories on complexin function that have been put forward so far (hydrophobic/electrostatic protein interactions...). The authors are to be congratulated on such a nice study.</p><p>[Editors’ note: minor issues and corrections have not been included, so there is not an accompanying Author response.]</p></body></sub-article></article>
