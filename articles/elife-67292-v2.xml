The cellular biology of GAPs and how these divergent processes are balanced and regulated by goblet cells remains unknown. Using high-resolution light and electron microscopy, we found that in mice, GAPs were formed by an acetylcholine (ACh)-dependent endocytic event remarkable for delivery of fluid-phase cargo retrograde into the trans-golgi network and across the cell by transcytosis – in addition to the expected transport of fluid-phase cargo by endosomes to multi-vesicular bodies and lysosomes. While ACh also induced goblet cells to secrete mucins, ACh-induced GAP formation and mucin secretion were functionally independent and mediated by different receptors and signaling pathways, enabling goblet cells to differentially regulate these processes to accommodate the dynamically changing demands of the mucosal environment for barrier maintenance and sampling of lumenal substances.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells in the gut need to be protected against the many harmful microbes which inhabit this environment. Yet the immune system also needs to ‘keep an eye’ on intestinal contents to maintain tolerance to innocuous substances, such as those from the diet. The ‘goblet cells’ that are part of the gut lining do both: they create a mucus barrier that stops germs from invading the body, but they also can pass on molecules from the intestine to immune cells deep in the tissue to promote tolerance. This is achieved through a ‘GAP’ mechanism. A chemical messenger called acetylcholine can trigger both mucus release and the GAP process in goblet cells.</p><p>Gustafsson et al. investigated how the cells could take on these two seemingly opposing roles in response to the same signal. A fluorescent molecule was introduced into the intestines of mice, and monitored as it pass through the goblet cells. This revealed how the GAP process took place: the cells were able to capture molecules from the intestines, wrap them in internal sack-like vesicles and then transport them across the entire cell.</p><p>To explore the role of acetylcholine, Gustafsson et al. blocked the receptors that detect the messenger at the surface of goblet cells. Different receptors and therefore different cascades of molecular events were found to control mucus secretion and GAP formation; this explains how the two processes can be performed in parallel and independently from each other.</p><p>Understanding how cells relay molecules to the immune system is relevant to other tissues in contact with the environment, such as the eyes, the airways, or the inside of the genital and urinary tracts. Understanding, and then ultimately harnessing this mechanism could help design of new ways to deliver drugs to the immune system and alter immune outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group

gastrointestinal tract is an expansive surface exposed to lumenal contents containing innocuous substances from the diet and potentially harmful microbes and their products. Underneath and within this epithelium lies the largest collection of immune cells in the body. It has long been appreciated that the gastrointestinal immune system is not ignorant of the lumenal contents, and in the healthy state gut lumenal contents are sampled to induce adaptive immune responses, characterized by T cell-mediated antigen-specific tolerance. How substances from the lumen are encountered by, or delivered to, the immune compartment is a central concept in mucosal immunity that is incompletely understood, but fundamentally underlies how the immune system can mount tolerogenic responses to substances encountered in this potentially hostile environment.</p><p>Goblet cells (GCs) are specialized intestinal epithelial cells that have a well-established role in innate immunity through secretion of mucins and maintenance of the mucus layer. The mucus layer provides a first line of defense against physical and chemical injury and protects against pathogen invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim and Ho, 2010</xref>). GCs also produce and secrete biologically active products that contribute to innate immunity by promoting epithelial restitution, inhibiting intestinal nematode chemotaxis, and stabilizing the mucus layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johansson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taupin and Podolsky, 2003</xref>). Recently, a new role for GCs in intestinal immunity was identified; the ability of GCs to form GC-associated antigen passages (GAPs), which deliver lumenal substances to lamina propria antigen presenting cells to generate antigen-specific T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knoop et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knoop et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knoop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knoop et al., 2017b</xref>). The potent GC secretagogue acetylcholine (ACh) induces GAP formation in the homeostatic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knoop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that GAP formation and mucus secretion can be induced by the same stimulus. However, GAP formation and the delivery of lumenal substances to the immune compartment are closely regulated to prevent inflammatory responses to gut bacteria and dietary antigens in settings where the secretion of mucus to maintain the barrier is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knoop et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knoop et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kulkarni et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, in response to the same stimulus, GCs perform two, but apparently opposing, central roles in intestinal immunity.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that GAPs form by an endocytic event capturing fluid-phase cargo and often follow secretory granule exocytosis. But in contrast to the fate of fluid-phase endocytosis seen in adjacent enterocytes, GAPs traffic a substantial portion of fluid-phase cargo across the epithelial barrier by transcytosis for capture by underlying phagocytic cells. Further, we find that while ACh induces both mucus secretion and GAP formation in GCs, these processes are not functionally linked and can be performed independently or in parallel to meet the needs of the changing lumenal environment in the small intestine and colon. Together these observations suggest that GAP formation may have evolved as a cell-type specific and specialized endocytic pathway emerging from the basic exocytic machinery of GCs to sample and deliver luminal substances to the mucosal immune system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GAP formation is a fluid-phase endocytic process dependent on PI3K, actin polymerization, and microtubule transport</title><p>To elucidate the cellular mechanism underlying GAP formation and function, we studied the intestines of mice 1 hr after administration of fluorescent dextran to the gut lumen. The appearance of GAPs on two-photon in vivo imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and on wide-field fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) of the small intestine (SI) suggested that the GC cytoplasm was filled with lumenal substances (marked by fluorescently labeled dextran), consistent with passive diffusion of dextran into the cytosol through apical membrane tears following ACh-induced mucus granule secretion. To better understand this process, we examined GAPs using super-resolution microscopy approaches. The appearance of SI GAPs by structured illumination microscopy (SIM) revealed that the cytoplasm of GCs forming GAPs was not completely filled with the fluorescent luminal cargo, rather the luminal solute tracer was contained within a network of vesicular appearing structures located predominantly at the periphery of the cell and extending from apical to basolateral cell surfaces, but largely excluded from the region where mucin granules are contained within the theca. Notably, in places, the luminally administered ovalbumin (OVA) was also observed in vesicular appearing structures contained within Itgax<sup>YFP+</sup> mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) located beneath the epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The vesicular patterns observed suggested that GAPs were formed by an active endocytic process that delivered fluid-phase cargo across the epithelial barrier to the lamina propria. Indeed, blockade of endocytosis by the dynamin inhibitors Dyngo 4a and dynasore strongly attenuated GAP formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Inhibition of actin and microtubule polymerization using cytochalasin D and colchicine, respectively, and inhibition of phosphoinositide three kinase (PI3K) using LY294002 also resulted in a significant reduction in GAP formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>), as did inhibition of the microtubule motor proteins dynein and kinesin using ciliobrevin D and dimethylenastron (DMEA) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>). These treatments did not adversely affect epithelial integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–H</xref>). Thus, GAPs appear to represent a fluid-phase endocytic pathway capable of delivering lumenal solutes across the cell by transcytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clague et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gottlieb et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thyberg and Stenseth, 1981</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Goblet cell associated antigen passage (GAP) formation is an active endocytic process dependent on actin polymerization, microtubule transport, and phosphoinositide three kinase (PI3K).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Intravital two-photon imaging, (<bold>B</bold>) wide-field fluorescent imaging, and (<bold>C</bold>) super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging of the small intestine (SI) of CX3CR1<sup>GFP</sup> (green) or Itgax<sup>YFP</sup> (green) reporter mice following luminal administration of 10 kDa tetramethylrodamine (TRITC)-dextran (red) or Texas Red-Ovalbumin (OVA; red).

These dyes become fluorescent when incorporated in membranes, and the endocytic capacity of a cell and the intracellular fate of the endocytic vesicles can be studied by evaluating the subcellular localization of FM 1–43FX stained membranes. Lumenal administration of FM 1–43FX resulted in intracellular staining of a subset of GCs, with a staining pattern similar to that of endocytosed dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To evaluate whether endocytosed dextran localized to newly endocytosed membrane structures within the same cell, FM 1–43FX and 10 kDa dextran-Alexa647 were co-administered into the SI lumen and the intracellular staining pattern was evaluated by confocal microscopy. We observed a similar staining pattern of dextran-Alexa647 and FM 1–43FX within the same cell having GC morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), further supporting that GAP formation represents an endocytic process. In addition to observing intracellular FM 1–43FX staining and dextran uptake by GCs, we also observed uptake of lumenal dextran by surrounding intestinal epithelial cells. However, the pattern and morphology of dextran-containing endosomes in absorptive cells differed from those in GCs. In GCs (asterisk; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and upper panel insets), dextran-containing structures were observed throughout the cell, whereas in adjacent epithelial cells, likely enterocytes (arrows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and lower panel insets), a punctuated pattern of FM 1–43FX staining and dextran uptake was observed localized to the apical cytoplasm. In adjacent epithelial cells, we also observed co-localization of dextran-containing vesicles and the early endosome marker EEA1 (arrows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), but EEA1 staining was not apparent in the endocytic vesicles of adjacent GCs.

The remaining datasets as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of dextran incubated tissues were used as to confirm the model.

Shuttling of endocytosed cargo to endo-lysosomal structures as well as the TGN is consistent with models of fluid-phase endocytosis and their trafficking in most cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maxfield and McGraw, 2004</xref>), and the specialized need for compensatory endocytosis required by secretory cell types like GCs to recycle large amounts of membrane back into the secretory pathway (i.e., TGN) after exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Engisch and Nowycky, 1998</xref>). Notably the endocytic vesicles in GCs forming GAPs did not stain positive for EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), a marker of early endosomes, or the late endosome marker Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but did in some cells stain positive for the lysosome marker LAMP-1 and the TGN marker TGN46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). To explore if the endosomes of GAPs could be related to membrane retrieval following secretory granule exocytosis, we examined the location of the secretory granule protein Rab3D that has been shown to be retrieved and redistributed to the TGN following regulated secretion in GCs and pancreatic acinar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jena et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valentijn et al., 2007</xref>). We found that in GCs forming GAPs, Rab3D co-localized with areas of dextran uptake, while in GCs not forming GAPs, Rab3D was localized to the secretory granules within the GC theca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A similar staining pattern was observed when evaluating the localization of the secretory granule protein VAMP8 in GCs forming GAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results could be consistent with GAP endosomes forming as a result of membrane recycling after secretory granule exocytosis, which was supported by findings of dextran localizing to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-positive vesicular structures in GCs forming GAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, unlike absorptive intestinal epithelial cells where transcytosis is largely restricted to receptor-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fung et al., 2018</xref>), the GCs forming GAPs appeared to deliver fluid-phase cargo into the transcytotic pathway, as evidenced by dextran-containing vesicles closely adjacent to the basolateral membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In some cases, dextran-containing cargo was observed at a fusion point of GCs and adjacent cells in the lamina propria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>), which is consistent with the transfer of luminal cargo taken up by GAPs to lamina propria MNPs we observed by SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Elevated levels of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can either be obtained by Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores or activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the plasma membrane triggering influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, we explored the source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> needed to drive CCh-induced increase in GAP formation and mucus secretion in the SI and distal colon. Our results showed that the CCh-induced mucus secretory response was reversed by chelation of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (EGTA) as well as by chelation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (BAPTA-AM) in the SI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B and E–H</xref>) and in the distal colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C–F</xref>), indicating that the CCh-induced mucus secretory response is dependent upon influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and possibly also dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from these intracellular stores occurs via three different pathways mediated by the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP3), cyclic ADP ribose (cADPr), and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), each acting on IP3 receptors (IP3R), ryanodine receptors (RyR), and two pore channels (TPC), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calcraft et al., 2009</xref>). To explore the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores in the CCh-induced mucus secretory response and GAP response, we inhibited these signaling pathways; IP3R using xestospongin C (Xesto C), cADPr using 8-Br-cADPr, and NAADP using trans-Ned-19 (T-Ned-19), and evaluated the effects on CCh-induced mucus secretion and GAP formation. In the SI villus, despite the CCh secretory response being reversed by chelation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, none of the respective inhibitors reversed the CCh-induced secretory response, suggesting possible redundancy in the signaling pathways inducing this response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, F and I-K). The CCh-induced mucus secretion was dependent on NAADP, but independent of IP3R or cADPr in the SI crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, F and I-K) and distal colon crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, D and G-I). The GAP response was on the other hand dependent on NAADP and cADPr but independent of IP3R in the SI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, D, F and I-K) and distal colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, D and G-I). Since the GAP response was shown to be dependent on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we evaluated the location of the ER within GCs forming GAPs. Immunostaining of tissue sections using the ER marker Calnexin showed positive staining throughout the GC, with the exeption of the theca. The ER was observed in close proximity to the dextran at the apical, lateral, and basal sides of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the CCh-induced mucus secretory response involves release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> via NAADP-mediated pathways and influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, while the GAP response involves release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> via NAADP- and cADPr-mediated pathways but is not dependent upon influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Furthermore, the finding that CCh-induced GAP formation occurred in the absence of CCh-induced mucus secretion in tissues treated with the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator EGTA, suggests that the role of mAChR1 in driving the CCh-induced increase in GAPs occurs independently of its role in inducing mucus secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ACh-induced GAP formation and mucus secretion can occur in parallel in the same cells</title><p>The findings that CCh-induced GAP formation can occur in the absence of CCh-induced mucus secretion, and that CCh-induced mucus secretion can occur in the absence of GAP formation could either be interpreted as the two processes being induced in separate populations of GCs or that they can occur in parallel in the same GCs but are not functionally linked or dependent upon each other. To explore this question, we evaluated the effect of CCh on the theca area, as a surrogate for mucus secretion, in GCs forming GAPs (epithelial cells staining positive for WGA/UEA1 and tetramethylrodamine [TRITC]-dextran) and in those not forming GAPs (epithelial cells staining positive for WGA/UEA1 but negative for TRITC-dextran). We observed that CCh induced a significant decrease in the average theca area of GCs forming GAPs at all three locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), indicating that GCs forming GAPs also respond to CCh with accelerated mucus secretion. The secretory response was also seen as a shift in the size distribution of the theca area in all three locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–D</xref>). The CCh-induced decrease in theca area was reversed by EGTA at all three locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>), showing that GCs forming GAPs respond to CCh with a mucus secretory response mediated by influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Similar to these findings, GCs in the SI villus and crypt that did not form GAPs in response to CCh responded with a decrease in the average theca area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) and a shift in the size distribution of the GCs theca, which was reversed by EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> and G), consistent with these GCs also responding to CCh with a mucus secretory response mediated by influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In contrast, distal colon GCs not forming GAPs did not respond to CCh with a reduction in the average theca area or a shift in the theca size distribution, and EGTA had no effect on either average size or the size distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and H</xref>). Given our prior observation that GCs in the distal colon are more likely to completely empty in response to CCh, this suggests that GCs in the distal colon that did not form GAPs, but responded to CCh with accelerated mucus secretion, completely emptied their theca and were lost to our analysis of the theca size.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Carbamylcholine (CCh) induced mucus secretion and goblet cell (GC)-associated antigen passage (GAP) formation can occur in parallel within the same GC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average theca area of GCs forming GAPs in vehicle, CCh, and CCh + EGTA treated mice.

However, the observation that inhibition of CCh-induced mucus secretion did not affect the ability of GCs to form GAPs suggests that the large exocytic event driving CCh-induced mucus secretion is different from the exocytic event preceding GAP formation. In aggregate, these results demonstrate that activation of select muscarinic receptor subtypes and their respective downstream signaling pathways allows GCs to respond to ACh with either GAP formation and antigen uptake, mucus secretion, or with both processes in parallel.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The intestinal epithelium is faced with the complex task of acting as a semi-permeable barrier allowing efficient nutrient absorption and controlled exposure of the immune system to lumenal antigens to sustain immune tolerance, while at the same time limiting contact with harmful agents that pass through the gastrointestinal tract. GCs have long been appreciated for their role in barrier function via production and secretion of the mucus layer that covers the intestinal surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johansson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van der Sluis et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, the role of GCs in intestinal homeostasis has expanded to include participation in adaptive immune responses to lumenal substances via sampling and delivery of lumenal antigens to lamina propria antigen presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knoop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDole et al., 2012</xref>). How GCs balance these seemingly opposing tasks and the cellular mechanisms underlying lumenal antigen sampling were largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that GCs acquire lumenal substances via an endocytic event that efficiently delivers fluid-phase cargo not only to lysosomes, MVBs, and the TGN, but also into the transcytotic pathway allowing the capture of lumenal substances by underlying cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Such transcellular transport of lumenal solutes was not observed in adjacent enterocytes, and appears to be a feature specific to intestinal secretory cells and potentially linked to retrieval of secretory granule membrane. We cannot exclude that transcellular transport of luminal substances captured by fluid-phase endocytosis in enterocytes occurs to some degree, but if so, the efficiency of such transport must be low as expected for fluid-phase endocytic cargo in enterocytes, and below the level of detection in our assays.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of acetylcholine (ACh)-induced mucus secretion and goblet cell-associated antigen passage (GAP) formation in intestinal goblet cells.</title><p>In response to exogenous ACh, intestinal goblet cells respond with an accelerated mucus secretory response mediated by muscarinic ACh receptor 1 (mAChR1), and/or induction of fluid-phase bulk endocytosis of secretory granule membrane (GAP formation) mediated by mAChR4 in the small intestine (SI) and mAChR3 in the distal colon. The endocytic vesicles containing luminal fluid-phase cargo are shuttled through the cell for degradation, membrane recycling, and transcytosis to be acquired by lamina proporia mononuclear phagocytes (LP-MNPs). Using separate mAChRs, Ca<sup>2+</sup> pools and signaling pathways for the processes of ACh-induced GAP formation and ACh-induced mucus secretion allow these processes to occur independently or in parallel within the same goblet cell forming the basis of how goblet cells can differentially regulate when to maintain the mucus barrier and when to deliver luminal substances to the immune system.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67292-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Endocytic retrieval of secretory granule membranes has been shown to occur in various secretory cells including neurons, enterochromaffin cells, pancreatic acinar cells, and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Henkel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stevenson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wen et al., 2012</xref>) and is linked to membrane recycling and regulation of the secretory capacity of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stevenson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wen et al., 2012</xref>). The general consensus regarding exocytosis – endocytosis coupling in secretory cells is that during primary exocytosis, the process where one granule at the time is inserted into the plasma membrane, inserted membranes have to be retrieved to enable subsequent rounds of exocytosis and to restore plasma membrane structure. However, during compound exocytosis, the process where multiple secretory granules fuse with one another and release their content through a common secretion pore, large volumes of membrane retrieval are not necessarily required to sustain secretion as individual secretory granules are not inserted directly into the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2017</xref>). Our previous studies demonstrate that not all GCs form GAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knoop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDole et al., 2012</xref>), that GAP formation is not required to maintain the mucus barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kulkarni et al., 2020</xref>), and our current findings that blockade of GAP formation does not inhibit mucus secretion, indicate that GAP formation cannot be required to maintain mucus secretion or the mucus barrier. Though compensatory endocytosis must exist following secretion in GCs, to balance membrane trafficking, the fate of these endocytic vesicles does not necessarily intersect with the GAP pathway. Rather, we suggest that GAPs represent a specialized endocytic pathway enabling enhanced and regulated transcellular transport of gut lumenal solutes across the epithelial barrier by transcytosis. We consider it likely the GAP pathway evolved from adaptations to the secretory and membrane recovery machinery specific to this highly secretory cell type.</p><p>Despite the associations between GAP formation and mucus secretion, our results demonstrate that ACh-induced GAP formation and mucus secretion are not functionally linked or dependent upon one another. Rather we found that they are regulated by separate muscarinic receptors and intracellular signaling pathways – allowing them to be performed independently or in parallel in the same cell. These observations provide further evidence that the exocytic events driving ACh-induced mucus secretion can be different from that preceding GAP formation. In spinal cord neurons, exposure to high concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> triggers neurotransmitter release paralleled by endocytic retrieval of secretory granule membrane and uptake of high molecular weight substances from the extracellular environment. Similar to our observations demonstrating that inhibition of CCh-induced mucus secretion did not affect CCh-induced GAP formation, inhibition of K<sup>+</sup> evoked exocytosis did not affect K<sup>+</sup>-induced endocytic retrieval of secretory granule membrane. The intact endocytic response in response to elevated K<sup>+</sup> levels was shown to be mediated by retrieval of previously fused secretory vesicles, thus, although elevated K<sup>+</sup> triggered secretory granule exocytosis, retrieval of previously fused granules was enough to sustain the uptake process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neale et al., 1999</xref>). Applied to our data this would suggest that in situations when ACh-induced mucus secretion does not occur; an intact GAP response can be maintained via retrieval of previously fused secretory granules inserted into the plasma membrane during a previous exocytotic event. In addition to secreting mucus in response to secretagogues such as ACh, GCs secrete mucus constitutively resulting in continuous insertion of secretory granule membrane into the apical membrane to be retrieved in response to ACh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliver and Specian, 1990</xref>). Further support in favor of the two processes being functionally separate, ACh-induced mucus secretion is initiated at the center of the GC theca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Specian and Neutra, 1980</xref>), while GAPs initiate along the lateral apical surface of the cell and progress basally. This spatial separation of the two processes may imply that GAPs primarily form by retrieval of secretory granules released during steady state, which in contrast to ACh-induced exocytosis are supplied by granules transported along the outer borders of the theca and released at the apical lateral sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliver and Specian, 1990</xref>). Alternatively, ACh may induce multiple endocytic events, some originating from retrieval of secretory granule membrane, and others originating from endocytosis of the plasma membrane.</p><p>Despite our findings of muscarinic receptor subtype-specific regulation of ACh-induced GAP formation and mucus secretion, muscarinic receptor antagonists are known for their receptor subtype promiscuity, and difficulties in assessing differences in in vivo metabolism of antagonists warrant caution when assessing the relative contribution of the respective receptor subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bozkurt and Sahin-Erdemli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erosa-Rivero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lazareno and Birdsall, 1993</xref>). Nonetheless, in support of these results, we also find that the CCh-induced GAP response and the mucus secretory response use different pools of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and different second messenger systems. Furthermore, the fact that the two processes can be performed separately supports a model of regulation by separate mechanisms. In lacrimal gland acinar cells, exposure to low concentrations of ACh was shown to increase fluid-phase endocytosis by 80% while protein release was increased only by 40%. In contrast, exposure to high concentrations of ACh was shown to increase protein release by 80%, while endocytic retrieval was increased by 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gierow et al., 1995</xref>), demonstrating that, similar to what we observe in intestinal GCs, in lacrimal acinar cells, ACh-induced exocytosis and endocytosis can, at least to some degree, occur separately. The intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration needed to trigger endocytosis has been shown to be lower than that needed to trigger exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marks and McMahon, 1998</xref>). This may explain why in the steady state, ACh acting on mAChR4 in the SI and mAChR3 in the distal colon induces GAP formation (endocytosis) without an apparent effect on mucus secretion (exocytosis); and yet in response to exogenous administration of high concentrations of ACh, which could trigger a larger increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, GCs respond with both mucus secretion and GAP formation.</p><p>When evaluating the frequency of GAPs along the SI crypt villus axis, we observed that villus GCs formed GAPs at a higher frequency when compared to crypt GCs both during steady state and in response to CCh. Crypt GCs on the other hand responded to CCh with a stronger mucus secretory response resulting in complete emptying of a subset of GCs and partial emptying of the remaining GCs, which is in accordance with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phillips, 1992</xref>). These results indicate that in the SI, in response to ACh, villus GCs preferentially perform antigen uptake and delivery to the immune system, while crypt GCs have the capacity to secrete large volumes of mucus when needed. Baseline mucus secretion has been shown to be higher in the SI villus as compared to the crypts which may explain why baseline GAP formation is more prevalent in SI villus GCs as there would be more membrane to retrieve to form GAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schneider et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In GCs, mAChR4 signaling (the pathway regulating GAP formation in the SI and proximal colon) is inhibited by activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which in the proximal colon can occur by GC intrinsic sensing of gut microbial products via Toll-like receptors or by the presence of EGFR ligands in the SI and colon lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knoop et al., 2015</xref>). The benefit of mucus secretion not being functionally linked to GAP formation is apparent in the proximal colon where both steady-state and CCh-induced GAP formation are inhibited, while baseline and CCh-induced mucus secretion remain intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ermund et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knoop et al., 2015</xref>). Overriding the inhibition of mAChR4 signaling to allow GAPs to form in the proximal colon has the undesired outcome of bacterial translocation across GAPs and induction of inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knoop et al., 2016</xref>). A further example of the importance of controlling GAP formation is that during enteric infection with <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, mAChR4 signaling and GAP formation in the SI is inhibited to prevent lumenal antigen delivery to the immune system and limit inflammatory T cell responses to dietary antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kulkarni et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, functional uncoupling of ACh induced mucus secretion from GAP formation, the usage of different mAChRs to perform mucus secretion and GAP formation, and the ability to regulate mAChR4 signaling in GCs, underlies the ability to control when and where GAPs are formed and are essential in maintaining intestinal health.</p><p>Although the focus of the present study was to explore the cellular basis of ACh-induced GAP formation, the ability of GCs to acquire lumenal substances is not restricted to activation of muscarinic receptor signaling and additional ligands and receptors activating cADPr production, such as IL13, have been demonstrated to induce GCs to take up lumenal substances in some settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noah et al., 2019</xref>). This raises the possibility that other ligands, whose receptors are expressed by GCs and induce cADPr production, may likewise induce GCs to acquire lumenal substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deshpande et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tliba et al., 2004</xref>). While it is becoming apparent that physiologic ACh-induced GAP formation supports antigen-specific T cell responses and tolerance to the lumenal content, the functional consequences and downstream events resulting from GC uptake of lumenal substances induced by other stimuli remain to be explored.</p><p>In summary, our results define the basis by which GCs sample lumenal antigens for delivery to the immune system and how this process is balanced with mucus secretion within the same cell. Our observations indicate that GCs have evolved a pathway of fluid-phase endocytosis that efficiently serves the transcytotic pathway for non-specific uptake of lumenal substances that are sampled by sub-epithelial phagocytic cells. Compared to neighboring enterocytes, the fluid-phase endocytic GAP pathway of GCs is remarkable for its efficient transport of lumenal substances across the epithelial barrier. Perhaps GAPs evolved from an endocytic system originally used in secretory cell types to recycle secretory granule membranes, but adapted to ensure that during situations when the lumenal environment is toxic for antigen sampling, the GC can suppress GAP formation while retaining its ability to secrete mucus for maintenance of the mucus barrier. In total, our observations reveal the basis by which GCs perform the function of lumenal antigen delivery to the immune system, and provide mechanistic insights into how the critical roles of barrier maintenance and antigen delivery are achieved within the same cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The age of the mice ranged between 7 and 12 weeks, and animals were randomly assigned to the respective experimental groups. All animal procedures and protocols were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Washington University School of Medicine (Animal Welfare Assurance number: A-3381–01) and the Swedish animal welfare legislation and approved by the Swedish Laboratory Animal Ethical Committee in Gothenburg (Ethical permit ID number: 5.8.18-11053/2019).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Method details</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Reagents and treatments</title><p>The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, telenzepine, and 4-DAMP (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) were administered i.p. at a dose of 550 µg/kg, 30 min prior to intraluminal injection of 10 kDa lysine fixable TRITC-dextran (12.5 mg/ml) (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA). Tropicamide (Tocris, Minneapolis, MN) was administered at a dose of 100 µg/kg s.c. 20 min prior to intraluminal injection of TRITC-dextran, and every 20 min during the 60 min incubation period. CCh (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was administered s.c. at a dose of 125 µg/kg, 5 min following intraluminal injection of TRITC-dextran. FM 1–43FX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was administered intraluminal at a dose of 50 µg/ml, followed by 1 hr incubation.

Intravital preparation of the SI was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDole et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, a vertical midline incision was made through the skin and peritoneum revealing the SI. To label GAPs, a mixture of 10 kDa TRITC-dextran (10 mg/ml), and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (10 mg/ml) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was injected intraluminal into the jejunum, followed by 20 min incubation. To image the luminal surface, a 10 mm incision was made to the dextran-containing intestinal segment. Large fecal particles were removed with care using a blunt forcep, and smaller particles were left in place to avoid disrupting the mucus layer and the epithelium. Imaging was performed with the intestine remaining within the peritoneal cavity. The tissue was excited using a Chameleon XR Ti: sapphire laser tuned to 890 nm (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). Images were acquired using a custom-built 2P microscope running ImageWarp software (A&amp;B Software, New London, CT).

Tissues were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and 6 μm sections were prepared. Sections were stained with fluorescein conjugated WGA (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or fluorescein conjugated UEA1 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to identify GCs in the SI and distal colon, respectively, and stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) to identify the nucleus. Sections were imaged using an Axioskop 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY) or a Nikon n-SIM super-resolution microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). Obtained images were evaluated using AxioVision, and Imaris, respectively. GAPs were identified as TRITC-dextran filled WGA<sup>+</sup> (SI)/UEA1<sup>+</sup> (distal colon) epithelial cells measuring approximately 20 µm (height) × 5 µm (diameter) traversing the epithelium and containing a nucleus and were enumerated as GAPs per villus/crypt cross section in the SI, and GAPs per crypt cross section in the distal colon.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Quantification of mucus secretion</title><p>Mucus secretion was quantified using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) by measuring the area of the WGA<sup>+</sup> (SI) or UEA1<sup>+</sup> (distal colon) GCs theca, and expressed either as GC theca area in µm<sup>2</sup> or as the total mucus content per villus/crypt cross section, quantified as the sum of all WGA<sup>+</sup>/UEA1<sup>+</sup> GC theca areas, divided by the area of the villus/crypt cross section, expressed as percentage.

To evaluate the FM 1–43FX staining pattern in GCs forming GAPs, FM 1–43FX and dextran-Alexa647 was administered into the SI lumen simultaneously. After 1 hr the mice were sacrified and tissue processes as described above. Tissue sections were stained with DAPI to identify the nucleus and imaged using an LSM700 Axio Examiner Z1 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY). Acquired images were analyzed using Zen (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY) and Imaris (Bitplane, Belfast, Great Britain) software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Tissue specimens were washed in cold PBS, fixed in 10% formalin buffered saline for 2 hr, followed by incubation in 30% sucrose overnight. Tissue specimens were embedded in optimal tissue cutting medium and 6-µm-thick section were cut. Sections were rinsed in PBS followed by antigen retrieval in 0.05% citraconic anhydride (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), permeabilized in 0.05% Triton X-100 or 0.05% saponin (TGN46) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), washed in PBS, and blocked in 5% goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Sections were incubated with primary antibodies toward EEA1, Rab7 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), Lysozyme, TGN46 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), Rab3D (Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany), LAMP1, Calnexin (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), or VAMP-8 (gift from Prof Burton Dickey, University of Texas) at 4°C overnight, rinsed with PBS and incubated with goat anti rabbit or goat anti chicken Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at room temperature for 1 hr. Sections were counterstained with DAPI and imaged using an Axioskop 2 microscope, an LSM700 Axio Examiner Z1 confocal microscope, or an LSM900 with Airyscan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY).

Tissue specimens were embedded in optimal cutting medium, frozen, and 6 µm thick sections were cut. Cut sections were washed in PBS, followed by single molecule in situ hybridization of Chrm1 (probe: 483441-C2), Chrm3 (probe: 437701), or Chrm4 (probe: 410581-C2) according to manufacturer’s instructions RNAscope fluorescent reagent kit v2 (ACD, Bio-Techne, Abingdon, United Kingdom) visualized with Opal-570 (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA) or CF488A Tyramine (Biotium, Fremont, CA). Following the RNAscope protocol, tissue sections were stained with a primary antibody against Epcam (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at 4°C overnight followed by incubation using a Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33528 and a subset of SI sections were stained with Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated WGA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and a subset of distal colon sections were stained with FITC conjugated UEA1 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to visualize GCs. Images were obtained by an LSM700 Axio Examiner Z1 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>FIB-SEM and TEM</title><p>Lysine fixable biotinylated 10 kDa dextran (10 mg/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was administered into the SI of ketamine/xylasine anesthetized mice. After 1 hr, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), followed by fixation in 4% PFA overnight. Tissues were transferred to cold PBS, embedded in 2% agarose, and sectioned using a vibratome; 100 µm thick sections were rinsed in PBS, exposed to glycine, followed by rinsing in PBS and permeabilized in 0.05% saponin. Permeabilized sections were rinsed in PBS, exposed to streptavidin-HRP (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and exposed to Ni-DAB (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS for 10 min, followed by exposure to Ni-DAB in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10 min, rinsed with PBS and fixed overnight in 2% glutaraldehyde. Stained tissue specimens were embedded in resin and evaluated using a Zeiss Crossbeam 540 FIB-SEM equipped with a GEMINI II and a Capella Ga-Liquid Metal Ion Source (Ga-LMIS) column (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY). The milling process was set to 10 nm generating a dataset of ~1200 SEM images encompassing the volume of a GC. The acquired dataset was analyzed by Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For the 3D visualization, organelles were manually traced and identification of the respective organelles and dextran-containing organelles was performed using Functional Ultrastructure: Atlas of Tissue Biology and Pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pavelka and Roth, 2010</xref>). For evaluation using TEM, 50 nm sections were cut from the resin embedded tissues and sections were evaluated using a JEOL JEM-1400 120kV TEM (Jeol USA Inc, Peabody, MA). TEM sections were used to further confirm FIB-SEM findings. In the evaluated sections, 23 GCs stained positive for dextrain-containing organelles. Of these, 12 cells stained positive in the TGN, 4 cells stained positive in MVBs, 2 cells stained positive in lysosomes, and 11 cells stained positive in vesicular structures. The positive organelles were identified as structures with a clearly darker color as compared to unstained structures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Data is presented as mean ± standard error or the mean.

Using FIB SEM and a fluid phase tracer they provide a 3D model of the structure of a goblet cell including identification of key parts of the trafficking pathway. By TEM they also provide evidence of vesicle uptake by underlying cells. Using pharmacological inhibitors, they provide the first evidence of differential machinery for independent regulation of GAP formation separate from the exocytic machinery necessary for mucin granule exocytosis. They conclude that GAP formation is a transcytosis process based on endocytosis at the edge of the apical side of the goblet cell (in an EEA1 independent manner) followed by trafficking throughout the cytoplasm before exocytosis at the basal side.</p><p>This is a convincing study providing good evidence of related but separately regulated endocytic and exocytic processes to mediate important physiologically and pathologically relevant functions.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The major strength of the manuscript is the in vivo imaging aspects in mice. These provide analysis of the phenomena in situ, adjacent to the appropriate associated gut cells, enterocytes etc. It also allows analysis of the phenomena in discrete sections of the intestinal tract. The quantification of phenomena is robust, careful and thorough and appropriately statistically powered.</p><p>The study provides good evidence for differences in regulation of GAP formation vs mucin granule exocytosis both in terms of their activation by muscarinic receptors and the downstream signalling from extracellular and intracellular calcium stores. This supports the conclusion that both of these phenomena although related can be differentially controlled. The rationale for the necessity for separate pathways existing is well thought out and logical.</p><p>The FIB SEM electron microscopy analysis with labelled streptavidin provides a clear and striking delineation of the trafficking route. It convincingly highlights all the structures the authors noted and supports the assertion that a transcytosis route provides a means to safely sample fluid phase material from the gut lumen.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>The experiments rely largely on pharmacological interventions to monitor the formation of GAPs and to pick apart the differential regulation of GAP formation vs mucin secretion. These agents will impinge on many intracellular pathways occurring in the cell making effects on GAP formation and mucin secretion potentially both direct and indirect.</p><p>Images of the effect of some of the drugs and chemicals on goblet cells as they undergo GAP formation and mucin release are likely to be informative as to the direct or indirect nature of the exposure. If an arrest of trafficked dextran is noted at certain points on the surface of the goblet cell, or at discrete points within the cell following dynamin, actin or microtubule inhibition this would indicate more specifically the point at which these pieces of molecular machinery are required. Although exposure of the inner surface of the gut to EGTA is likely to interfere with traffic of Calcium from an extracellular source it is also likely to disrupt intracellular junctions which may have gross and potentially indirect effects.</p><p>The article is very well written, clear and the subject matter is important.</p><p>It would be helpful to include more images to support the quantification of the affects you note in Figure 1D. Such images might shed light on the specific role of the inhibited pathways, if for example dextran labelled pools accumulate near the surface, Golgi etc. It will also provide a better idea as to how the drug treatments are more broadly affecting the cells in question.</p><p>The volume electron microscopy images shown in figure 2 are striking. A movie might help give an idea as to how well the segmentation of the em images fits with the rendered images shown, it might also provide better context to the arrangement of the structures in the goblet cell. Are labelled vesicles present towards the edge of the cell? Are there examples of vesicles elsewhere perhaps in amongst the mucin granules? Also, is it possible to catch endocytic structures forming at the apical edge of the cell as posited.</p><p>Additional markers of the endocytic pathway associated with GAP formation would also be beneficial.

We have observed vesicles containing lumenal tracer at the apical edge of the GAP as shown in Figure 1C, and in the ultrastructural model. We have not captured the initial event of GAP formation in these studies, in part due to the experimental setup evaluating tissue sections one hour after administration of lumenal tracers, and in part because our studies focused on goblet cells definitively forming GAPs, identified by complete filling with lumenal tracer, as opposed to goblet cells potentially endocytosing lumenal substances via other pathways or outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional markers of the endocytic pathway associated with GAP formation would also be beneficial.

Since the inception of this project four years ago, our thinking on the cellular basis of GAP formation has evolved significantly, as reflected by this work and paralleled by the reviewer’s comment. We too were surprised that GAP formation and secretion were induced by the same stimulus, ACh, and while the processes of secretion and membrane retrieval are inherently linked, GAP formation and ACh induced mucus secretion are not functionally linked or dependent upon each other, and yet can occur in the same cell. We interpret our observations to indicate that GAP formation evolved as an additional, and redundant, pathway of membrane recovery that is specialized to deliver luminal substances to the transcytotic pathway. In other work we have observed that while exogenous ACh (analogues) can augment GAP formation, ACh is generally not limiting for GAP formation and GAP formation is largely regulated by inhibiting AChR responsiveness in goblet cells. Incorporating these observations would suggest that goblet cells evolved in an efficient manner to use an available stimulus and the machinery of a highly secretory cell to perform two related but independent tasks allowing them to independently maintain the barrier and/or perform surveillance of the luminal contents. However, we would note that goblet cells may be heterogeneous in their functions, which will require additional studies to dissect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Rab3D (Figure 2C, D) as well as VAMP8 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D) staining that has been added to the revised manuscript. These markers co-localized with dextran in the lateral and supranuclear portions of goblet cells forming GAPs, but do not extend to vesicles at the basolateral region, suggesting that Rab3D and VAMP8 marks fates of vesicles containing luminal substances proximal to the transcytosis event. The transcytosis fate of the vesicles occurring when GAPs form is supported by the FIB-SEM studies in Figure 2 on page 10, including the TEM images in Figure 2F and G, and the super resolution microscopy in Figure 1C on page 7, which are as granular as these approaches allow. These studies along with prior work demonstrating that LP-APCs acquire both luminal substances and goblet cell proteins from GAPs (McDole et al., <italic>Nature</italic>, 2012) have led us to conclude that the GAP vesicles are transcytosed. However, we acknowledge this concern and are cautious with our interpretation of events at the basolateral surface of GAPs resulting in the transfer of lumenal substances, which will require further studies to fully comprehend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Indeed, the authors have used sophisticated in vivo imaging techniques. However, they did not show the processes of dextran internalization in vivo or any time-dependent changes, which did not seem to fully use the technology's potential. In addition, some images were fuzzy, and no structures can be identified.</p></disp-quote><p>In prior work we have demonstrated GAP formation using in vivo two photon imaging of live anesthetized mice. These time lapse images demonstrate that GAPs form from the apical to basolateral surface through the acquisition of luminal substances (McDole et al. <italic>Nature</italic>, 2012). However, these studies suffer from the relative low resolution of two photon microscopy that led to the initial incorrect assumptions regarding GAP formation. All studies in this manuscript were performed in vivo and analyzed on fixed tissue sections, with the exception of Figure 1A which is an image from in vivo two photon imaging. As noted previously, the inhibitors used in this study act on GAP formation at early stages, and therefore did not allow us to evaluate intermediate events. In addition, the focus of these studies was on the process of GAP formation, as opposed to events at the apical or basolateral surfaces, so we chose to evaluate tissues after one hour of incubation with luminal dextran, a time point which we have previously observed that most GAPs are fully formed. Further, we acknowledge that the definition of a GAP is delivery of luminal substances to the basolateral surface, and as such delineation of early GAP events vs. other endocytic events recovering membranes, which the literature indicates exists to maintain the secretory potential of highly secretory cells, would be very difficult. In summation, we agree with the reviewer’s comments and acknowledge this limitation, however we believe this work is a solid step forward to delineating GAP formation from other processes in goblet cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. No mention of the blue labels in Figure 1, which I presumably to believe to be nulceus. If that is true, I wonder why red OVA puncta were in the middle of blue nucleus (Figure 1C).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize and have corrected this in the revised version of the manuscript. Figure 1C represents a 3D projection of a z-stack such that the red puncta may be overlaid upon the nucleus. Further it is worth noting that nuclei are not smooth, as can be seen in the FIB-SEM reconstructions and the red puncta may be interspersed between folds of the nucleus. Thus, the red puncta are located near but not in the nucleus. We have added information regarding this in the revised manuscript page 8 line 170.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In addition, in Figure 1H, the authors claimed little overlapping between dextran and EEA1. However, structures highlighted by the arrows seem to be dual labeled with both markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. The dual labeling is observed in the enterocytes adjacent to the goblet cells but not in the goblet cells. The text page 6, lines 145-146 have been revised for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors have stated that they have obtained four cells underwent FIB-SEM imaging and used one as the example and the left as the replicates to confirm. I would suggest that they shall have some critera/quantifications that are indeed confirmed by the data not shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We obtained four complete renderings of goblet cells undergoing GAP formation by FIB-SEM. The process of FIB-SEM of a goblet cell requires ~72 hours of continuous imaging (~1,200 SEM images) and some attempts to obtain an entire goblet cell were not successful, thus this information does not represent the entirety of the experiments performed. The process of constructing a 3D model of a GAP from a single FIB-SEM experiment required months of computer processing. Therefore, we chose one goblet cell undergoing GAP formation to generate our 3D model, and multiple FIB-SEM and TEM images to confirm this model. We have added a video (Video 2) demonstrating the Z stack of the FIB-SEM images with the corresponding Z stack of the segmented data to better convey the model. Additional information regarding the confirmation of the FIB-SEM data has been added to the Results section, page 8 line 186-187, and the methods section, page 43 lines 914-916 and page 44 lines 917-919.</p></body></sub-article></article>
