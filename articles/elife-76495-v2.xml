We have previously described a novel Cullin 3 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex formed by the substrate adaptor protein LZTR1 that binds, ubiquitinates, and promotes proteasomal degradation of the RAS GTPase RIT1. In addition, others have described that this complex is also responsible for the ubiquitination of classical RAS GTPases. Here, we have analyzed the phenotypes of <italic>Lztr1</italic> loss-of-function mutants in both fruit flies and mice and have demonstrated a biochemical preference for their RIT1 orthologs. Moreover, we show that <italic>Lztr1</italic> is haplosufficient in mice and that embryonic lethality of the homozygous null allele can be rescued by deletion of <italic>Rit1</italic>. Overall, our results indicate that, in model organisms, RIT1 orthologs are the preferred substrates of LZTR1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LZTR1</kwd><kwd>RIT1</kwd><kwd>noonan syndrome</kwd><kwd>RASopathy</kwd><kwd>CG3711</kwd><kwd>RIC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31CA265066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cuevas-Navarro</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35CA197709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCormick</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00CA245122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castel</surname><given-names>Pau</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DOD CDMRP Neurofibromatosis Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-20-1-0391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castel</surname><given-names>Pau</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012818</institution-id><institution>Comunidad de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programa “Atracción de Talento”</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grego-Bessa</surname><given-names>Joaquim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and genetic analysis of the functional relationship between RIT1 and its regulatory protein, LZTR1, across various model organisms helps define the substrate specificity of LZTR1 for RAS GTPases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dysregulation of signal transduction by the RAS family of guanosine 5’-triphosphate (GTP) hydrolases (GTPases) can have profound effects on human development and cause genetic disorders collectively termed RASopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rauen, 2013</xref>). Ras GTPases exhibit high affinity toward guanine nucleotides and act as molecular switches by mediating GTP hydrolysis. The nucleotide cycling of RAS GTPases is tightly regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs; e.g. neurofibromin) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs; e.g. SOS1) that facilitate nucleotide hydrolysis or loading, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Simanshu et al., 2017</xref>). Upon GTP binding, RAS proteins undergo a conformational change, which promotes the interaction with different protein effectors that activate downstream signaling pathways, including Raf/MEK/ERK mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Although GAPs and GEFs can rapidly affect the nucleotide cycling of RAS proteins, and hence their activity, other accessory proteins can modulate downstream signaling by regulating the stability and/or activity of RAS GTPases.</p><p>Noonan syndrome (NS) is a common RASopathy that is characterized by craniofacial dysmorphism, short stature, congenital heart disease, and developmental delays. The cause of NS has been linked to genetic alterations that result in hyperactivation of the Raf/MEK/ERK MAPK pathway, including recently reported gain-of-function mutations in the RAS GTPase RIT1 and loss-of-function mutations in the BTB protein LZTR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamamoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnston et al., 2018</xref>). We have previously reported that RIT1 is mostly bound to GTP in cells, suggesting that it either lacks a GAP, uses a less active GAP, or relies on its intrinsic GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castel et al., 2019</xref>). An alternative regulatory mechanism of RIT1 activity is through protein degradation; we identified a Cullin-3 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL3) that uses LZTR1 as a substrate receptor (CRL3<sup>LZTR1</sup>) to bind RIT1 and promote its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. CRL3<sup>LZTR1</sup> binds to GDP-bound RIT1 and maintains tight regulation of RIT1 protein levels. Importantly, NS-associated <italic>RIT1</italic> and <italic>LZTR1</italic> missense mutations disrupt CRL3<sup>LZTR1</sup>-RIT1 binding, thus relieving RIT1 from its negative regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castel, 2022</xref>).</p><p>LZTR1 has been reported to regulate the protein stability of other RAS GTPases by similar mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigenzahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Steklov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we employed a molecular evolutionary approach to elucidate the functional relationship and co-evolution of LZTR1 and its cognate RAS GTPase substrate(s), including the evaluation of LZTR1 loss-of-function mutations in invertebrate and mammalian model organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The RAS family of GTPase proteins has been previously shown to be well-conserved across species and LZTR1 has been proposed to regulate a subset of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rojas et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, to understand how LZTR1 has evolved in comparison with other RAS GTPases, we performed protein alignment analysis of the human orthologs of KRAS, RIT1, and LZTR1 orthologs from human and common model organisms. Consistent with previous studies, KRAS was highly conserved in less complex organisms, including fission yeast (Ras1; 60% protein identity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast, we found that RIT1 rapidly diverged in less complex organisms and a mildly conserved protein in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (RIC; 60% protein identity) was the most distant ortholog that could be found in these laboratory model species. LZTR1 followed a similar pattern as RIT1; we could identify an ortholog in fruit flies (CG3711/LZTR1; 60% protein identity), but not in the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). These analyses suggest that RIT1 and LZTR1 are more likely to have functionally co-evolved than KRAS and LZTR1. To further assess the biochemical relationship between these proteins across model organisms, we generated recombinant proteins for the KRAS, RIT1, and LZTR1 orthologs from mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), and fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) and tested their ability to interact in pull down assays. All LZTR1 orthologs preferentially interacted with RIT1 orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that this interaction that we previously reported for human proteins is also conserved in less complex model organisms.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Evolutionary analysis of LZTR1 and the RAS proteins KRAS and RIT1</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Phylogenetic trees of KRAS, RIT1, and LZTR1 orthologs based on multiple protein sequence alignments performed with Clustal Omega (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Ric levels were upregulated ~11 times in <italic>Lztr1<sup>2</sup></italic> fly heads relative to the control, while Ras85D (the HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS ortholog, hereafter referred to as Ras) levels were only modestly altered in both backgrounds (~1.5-fold difference) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Similarly, Ras64D (the MRAS ortholog) was only upregulated ~1.6-fold in <italic>Lztr1<sup>2</sup></italic> mutant heads. To validate these results, we generated <italic>Drosophila</italic> transgenic lines carrying N-terminally HA tagged Ric or Ras genes under the control of their natural genomic sequences, thereby facilitating detection of both products at their endogenous levels. Both transgenes were then placed in the <italic>Lztr1<sup>2</sup></italic> mutant background to assess the effect of <italic>Lztr1</italic> depletion on Ric and Ras protein stability. Consistent with our mass spectrometry results, HA-Ric levels were elevated in the absence of Lztr1, while HA-Ras levels remained barely altered in either mutant adult flies or third-instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–e</xref>). Altogether, these experiments show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Lztr1 preferentially regulates Ric rather than Ras levels, as seen with the corresponding mammalian orthologs.</p><p>Given the absence of a phenotype in fruit flies, we examined the effect of <italic>Lztr1</italic> deletion in mice. Steklov et al had previously reported that <italic>Lztr1</italic> heterozygous knockout mice display typical features of NS, suggestive of haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Steklov et al., 2018</xref>). In humans, NS-associated variants are most commonly found as bi-allelic loss-of-function variants that are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; although there are few heterozygous variants that segregate as autosomal dominant, these are single nucleotide variants that likely act as dominant negatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnston et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamamoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Motta et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, we further analyzed the potential NS-like phenotype of heterozygous <italic>Lztr1</italic> deletion in the mouse as previously described in other mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernández-Porras et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castel et al., 2019</xref>). Heterozygous mice did not exhibit significant changes in body weight and, overall, their morphology appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The morphology of the skull, which generally shows dysmorphic features in mouse models of NS (round skull, blunt snout, and hypertelorism), was assessed using micro-computed tomography (µCT) and did not have significant differences when compared to wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In addition, we assessed whether heterozygous mice displayed either cardiomegaly or splenomegaly, as these signs have been observed in other NS-like mouse models, but we failed to observe differences with wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d</xref>).

This indicates that these heterozygous loss-of-function variants are tolerated and are found in non-syndromic individuals.

We have previously shown that at the biochemical level CRL3<sup>LZTR1</sup> complex preferentially binds and promotes degradation of RIT1. Therefore, we generated <italic>Rit1</italic> knockout mice to test whether Rit1 depletion can rescue <italic>Lztr1</italic>-mediated embryonic lethality. To avoid potential heterosis, we generated <italic>Rit1</italic> knockouts in the C57BL6/N background; mice were born at expected Mendelian ratios, were fertile, and did not exhibit any visible phenotype, similar to a previous <italic>Rit1</italic> null mouse strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2011</xref>). We confirmed the elimination of Rit1 by immunoblot in different tissues, including brain, lung, and heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Next, we crossed <italic>Rit1</italic> knockout mice with <italic>Lztr1</italic> heterozygous mice to obtain both <italic>Lztr1</italic><sup>-/+</sup>/<italic>Rit1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Lztr1</italic><sup>-/+</sup>/<italic>Rit1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> progeny. As previously shown, a heterozygous breeding scheme with <italic>Lztr1</italic><sup>-/+</sup>/<italic>Rit1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice did not yield any viable <italic>Lztr1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sewduth et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, when <italic>Lztr1</italic><sup>-/+</sup>/<italic>Rit1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> breeders were used, we obtained 13/85 (~15.3%) mice that were double knockout (DKO) for both <italic>Lztr1</italic> and <italic>Rit1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). This result shows that <italic>Rit1</italic> deletion can rescue the embryonic lethality caused by <italic>Lztr1</italic> deletion in mice, indicating that Rit1 is the critical substrate of the CRL3<sup>LZTR1</sup> complex during embryonic development. The resulting DKO mice appeared normal, were fertile, and were absent of any detectable phenotype that resembled other NS mouse models, as assessed by size, heart weight, and cranial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, <italic>Lztr1</italic>/<italic>Rit1</italic> DKO embryos harvested at E18.5 showed a complete rescue of the cardiac phenotype, which were indistinguishable from <italic>Rit1</italic> KO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>). To assess whether the Rit1 dependency established by <italic>Lztr1</italic>/<italic>Rit1</italic> DKO mice is correlated to a rescue of MAPK pathway hyperactivation, we isolated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from wild type, <italic>Lztr1</italic> KO, <italic>Rit1</italic> KO, and <italic>Lztr1</italic>/<italic>Rit1</italic> DKO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). We then subjected these MEFs to FBS stimulation and observed a noticeable decrease in MAPK signaling in cells devoid of both LZTR1 and RIT1 compared to LZTR1 KO cells, both by immunoblot and using the two well-characterized MAPK-regulated transcriptional targets <italic>Spry2</italic> and <italic>Dusp6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g–h</xref>). This indicated that, in our MEF cells, MAPK pathway hyperactivation is mediated by RIT1 protein stabilization in the absence of CRL3<sup>LZTR1</sup> regulation.</p><p>Many human RAS proteins are highly conserved in less complex organisms and a common ancestor Ras protein has been described in distant relatives such as yeast and slime mold, among other Eukarya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox and Der, 2010</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses of certain regulators of RAS function, such as GAPs and GEFs, highlight the prominence of early RAS activity regulation and its robust coevolution; with ancestral genomes harboring multiple GAP and GEF genes for a single RAS GTPase and a notable expansion of GAP genes congruent with the expansion of RAS GTPases in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van Dam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van Dam et al., 2009</xref>). The high percentage of GTP-loaded RIT1 in mammalian cells indicates the potential absence or evolutionary loss of GAP-mediated regulation and highlights the importance of alternative RIT1 regulatory mechanisms, such as protein turnover. Here, we show that in contrast to the highly conserved protein KRAS, both RIT1 and LZTR1 proteins are less conserved in lower organisms. Despite this, LZTR1 orthologs of invertebrate model organisms retain preferential binding toward their respective RIT1, but not RAS, orthologs. Moreover, fruit flies exhibit strong conservation of the LZTR1-mediated protein degradation mechanism with specificity toward RIT1, as we had previously described with human orthologs, but minimal activity toward other fruit fly RAS GTPases. These data indicate a functional co-evolution between LZTR1 and RIT1.</p><p>We also demonstrate that, in contrast to previous reports, LZTR1 is haplosufficient in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Steklov et al., 2018</xref>). However, homozygous knockout mutations are not tolerated due to embryonic lethality caused by aberrant cardiovascular development concomitant with severe peripheral hemorrhaging and ventricular septal defects, which can be rescued by <italic>Rit1</italic> germline deletion. Interestingly, Sewduth et al., demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of the RAF/MEK/ERK MAPK or AKT pathway was unable to fully rescue the embryonic lethality and vascular defects of mice with conditional <italic>Lztr1</italic> KO in blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sewduth et al., 2020</xref>). Given that our <italic>Lztr1/Rit1</italic> DKO mice did not exhibit cardiovascular abnormalities during embryogenesis, excessive accumulation of Rit1 protein in Lztr1 KO cells likely results in the hyperactivation or dysregulation of additional Rit1 effector pathways that contribute to <italic>Lztr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuevas-Navarro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meyer Zum Büschenfelde et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vichas et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While other RAS GTPases have cognate GAPs and GEFs that regulate their activity, RIT1 GAPs and GEFs remain to be identified.

One μL from each sample was used to quantify protein amounts using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The samples were diluted by adding 90 μL of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 1 mM CaCl2 and digested with 6 μg trypsin overnight at 37 °C with agitation. The samples were then acidified by adding 1 μL of formic acid, and the digested peptides were desalted using Sep-Pak C18 Classic Cartridges (Waters, USA) using the manufacturer’s protocol.</p><p>For LC-MS/MS analysis, digested and desalted peptides were suspended in 0.1% formic acid, and ~0.5 ug was injected per sample on the EasySpray 50 cm C18 column (ES903, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using Acquity UPLC M-Class System (Waters, USA) on line with Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The column was held at 45 °C, and a 185 min low-pH reversed phase chromatography linear gradient was performed using a conventional two-buffer system (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in MS-grade water; buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) by increasing buffer B concentration from 3.5% to 30% over 185 min, followed by a 2 min wash to 50%, with a constant flow rate of 300 nL/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ionization mode with the spray voltage of 2.5 KV, ion transfer tube temperature of 275 °C, RF lens at 30%, and internal calibration set to Easy-IC. MS1 spectra were collected in the Orbitrap in profile mode at 120 K resolution, 375–1500 m/z mass range, 50ms maximum injection time (IT), and automatic gain control (AGC) target of 4.0e5. Precursor ions charged 2 + to 7 + with MS1 intensity above the threshold of 2.0e4 were isolated in the Quadruple using 1.6 Th isolation window, fragmented using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with 30% collision energy, and detected in the Orbitrap in Centroid mode at 30 K resolution, scan range set to Auto Normal, 100ms maximum IT, and 5.0e4 AGC target. The maximum cycle time was set to 3 s and dynamic exclusion to 30 s with +/-10 ppm tolerance.</p><p>MS.raw data files were converted to peak lists using PAVA in-house script and searched with Protein Prospector (v6.0.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalkley et al., 2008</xref>) against <italic>Drosophila</italic> UniProtKB FASTA-formatted database, which included proteins and their splicing isoforms downloaded on 2019-04-19 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/">uniprot.org</ext-link>) and a corresponding random-concatenated database of decoy peptides added with Protein Prospector. Instrument was set to &quot;ESI-Q-high-res.&quot; Enzyme was set to Trypsin. Up to 2 missed cleavages were allowed and up to 2 post-translational modifications per peptide. &quot;Carbamidomethyl (C)&quot; was set as a constant modification, and default variable modifications were allowed: Acetyl (Protein N-term), Acetyl +Oxidation (Protein N-term M), Gln- &gt; pyro Glu (N-term Q), Met-loss (Protein N-term M), Met-loss +Acetyl (Protein N-term M), Oxidation (M), and Oxidation (P). Precursor charges were set to 2 + to 5+, MS1 mass tolerance to 10 ppm, and MS2 mass tolerance to 20 ppm. FDR filters for peptides were set to 1% and for proteins to 5%. The search results were exported from Protein prospector as tab-delimited text and as.blib spectral library, which was imported into Skyline (v20) along with.raw files for quantification using MS1 filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schilling et al., 2012</xref>). The identified peaks were detected by training built-in mProphet model against corresponding random-sequence decoy peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reiter et al., 2011</xref>), peaks with an FDR &lt; 1% were integrated. Built-in MSstats (v 3.13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2014</xref>) plugin in Skyline was used to normalize runs by median centering log2 precursor intensities, to calculate aggregate protein abundances, and to estimate their statistical significance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is a consultant for Ideaya Biosciences, Kura Oncology, Leidos Biomedical Research, Pfizer, Daiichi Sankyo, Amgen, PMV Pharma, OPNA-IO, and Quanta Therapeutics and has received research grants from Boehringer-Ingelheim and is a consultant for and cofounder of BridgeBio Pharma</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>PC is a founder and advisory board of Venthera</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

This claim needs to be bolstered by additional evidence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.</p><p>a) Figure 1b: Reciprocal pull-down experiments i.e. pulling down with LZTR1, could further strengthen these data. Based on the interaction proteomics data from Steklov et al., it could have been more relevant to examine Hras or Nras in Figure 1b. However, Steklov et al., found also Kras as ubiquitination target of LZTR1. In the current study, Kras may have been used due to its species-wide conservation. However, the above-mentioned background in regards to the other Ras isoforms should be stated or discussed.</p><p>b) The abstract states a bit vaguely, 'biochemical dependency', which may be better expressed as 'preferred interaction with RIT1 than RAS orthologs' or similar.</p><p>c) Given the constitutive GTP-bound state of RIT1 it may not be surprising that its activity level is regulated 11-fold via LZTR1. While this compares to a mere 1.5-fold regulation of canonical RAS levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the latter needs to be multiplied by the probably 100 to 1000 fold-change in affinity e.g. for the RBD of the effector Raf, resulting in a total of 150 or 1500-fold activity change (PMID: 7852367). These activity ranges should be the actual values that are considered in order to assess the end-result of the regulation by LZTR1. However, canonical Ras activity will always depend on the coincidence of high local GEF and low GAP activity, while RIT1 might be active 'globally', a constellation particularly advantageous across long distances (e.g. in axons). This RAS-family activity consteallation could be discussed/ considered in their data interpretation.</p><p>2.</p><p>a) In mice the RIT1 tissue expression levels vary greatly (Figure 3g). Does this inversely correlate with LZTR1 levels in these tissues? If not, it could be assumed that an additional tissue specific modifier of the LZTR1/RIT1 output is highly relevant. In this context, do the RIT1 expression levels somehow correlate with the tissue-specific severity of NS-like phenotypes that are observed in LZTR1 -/- mice?</p><p>b) RIT1 and RIT2 are known to be highly expressed during brain development and were implicated in particular in neurite outgrowth (in Colicelli J 2004, PMID: 15367757). The increasing relevance for brain development (or in general complexity also with respect to vasculature) somewhat correlates with the evolutionary pattern the authors describe, namely that a higher divergence for RIT1 and LZTR1 orthologs is seen in less complex organisms. Neurite outgrowth, vascular outgrowth and developmental cell migration appear to often utilise similar molecular machineries, which would all impact on characteristic NS phenotypes. Can the authors therefore speculate on the specific relevance of RIT1 for the observed embryonal bleeding phenotypes (Figure 4a) in LZTR1 ko mice? The point is that it is quite possible that a specific relevance of RIT1 for vascularisation is sufficient to cause the lethal phenotype.</p><p>Given the discrepancy with the results reported by Steklov et al., and the cross-breeding data presented here, it is also plausible that additional modifiers are strongly involved in this complex process. In this context, the authors may first wish to consider the increased phenotypic relevance of the LZTR1/RIT1 coupling from fly (hardly any wing vein defects) to mouse (embryonal lethality)? This could be speculated on in the discussion.</p><p>c) The rescue in the double-knockout mice may be mostly an outcome of the rescue of this particular vascularization phenotype. It is not entirely clear, whether all LZTR1-/- associated defects are restored, data are mentioned but not shown (L. 264). The authors should provide the data or change their statement. They are encouraged furthermore to discuss the above points and eventually adjust their concluding statements.</p><p>d) It could have been interesting to examine the RIT1 and RAS levels in the heterozygous LZTR1 knockout animals from Steklov and see, whether they are increased; yet it is understood this is too much extra work. However, Steklov find Hras and Nras as main interactors of LZTR1, while here typically pan-Ras (unclear in Figure 3g) or Kras (Figure 1b) were considered. Data in Figure 3g need to be quantified, so that the (pan-)Ras effect is clearer. In the end, the fact that Ras is mildly up-modulated across all tissues may be more consistent with the multi-system defects observed in RASopathies.</p><p>One may wish to modify the statement that RIT1 is 'the' critical substrate of LZTR1 (L. 261), but rather 'an important'. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that only a 'partial' rescue (L.260) is observed</p><p>3.</p><p>a) Data in Figure 4g need to be quantified and sufficiently reproduced (i.e. in some repeats). How many repeats were performed, this information is not in the legend? Importantly, data in Figure 4g show that LZTR1 levels are serum-induced and then remain increased long term (24h). Thus, LZTR1 levels peak later than pMEK levels. Surprisingly, the modulation of LZTR1 is not reflected in the RIT1 levels in these blots. Here it would be important to see how RAS (ideally Hras and Kras) levels are modulated. All claims need quantification in particular those relating to pERK differences, which are not as obvious as pMEK differences. Could it be that in this particular background RIT1-levels are relatively uncoupled from LZTR regulation (Figure 4g)? Why?</p><p>b) If RIT1 is the major target responsible for the LZTR1 ko phenotype then how can a MEKi rescue the lethal phenotype as reported by Steklov et al.? Does RIT1 also bind to canonical RAS effectors? How are LZTR1 and RIT1 levels modulated with a MEKi? While such MEKi experiments during pregnancy are too laborious, it could be possible to test effects using MEFs such as in Figure 4g.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76495.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The pulldown experiments in Figure 1b should state the number of times the experiments were each repeated.

Regarding the positive control for Ras interaction, this is a challenging experiment because the known effectors of Ras only bind in the GTP-bound conformation. In Figure 1b, the GST-fused recombinant Ras GTPases used for the pulldown assays are in the GDP-bound conformation, because we had previously described that only the RIT1 GDP-bound conformer binds LZTR1 (Castel et al., 2019). Therefore, interaction of RIT1 to LZTR1 cannot be compared to a classic effector (i.e. Raf RBD). Bacterial expression of Ras proteins has been extensively shown to result in enzymatically competent, properly folded, and GDP-bound GTPases (Lacal et al., 1984; Fang et al., 2016). In fact, we routinely use these recombinant proteins for nucleotide exchange, an additional proof that these enzymes are properly folded.</p><p>Nevertheless, to try to address this important comment by the reviewers, we have decided to test the interaction with a catalytic fragment of SOS1 (SOS<sup>cat</sup>; residues 550 to 1050) that is sufficient for Ras-specific nucleotide exchange activity. SOS<sup>cat</sup> contains the Cdc25 domain, which was previously demonstrated to bind RAS, distort the nucleotide binding site, and promote the release of either GDP or GTP (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998; Margarit et al., 2003). Given the highly conserved nature of the Cdc25 domain, we used the human protein to assess the structural integrity of all the RAS orthologs. As expected, FLAG-tagged SOS<sup>cat</sup> was able to bind all the recombinant RAS, but not RIT1, orthologs. This data has now been included as Figure 1 – supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2a-b or accompanying text should state the number of flies analyzed of each genotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now indicated in the figure legend that we scored 209 flies in this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3a-d should state the number of mice of each genotype analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now indicated in the figure legend the number of mice analyzed in each experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please provide quantification of the rescue phenotype shown in Figure 4e across a population of mice of each genotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the quantification of compact and trabecular myocardial thickness in <italic>Lztr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Lztr1</italic><sup>-/</sup>;<italic>Rit1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos shown in Figure 4e.</p><p>In addition, based on the comments from multiple reviewers, we have now included an analysis of Noonan syndrome-like traits in the <italic>Lztr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>Rit1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> double knockout adult mice (Figure 4-supplement 1).

Could it be that in this particular background RIT1-levels are relatively uncoupled from LZTR regulation (Figure 4g)? Why?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point. We agree that the differences in MAPK are mild; this is generally the case in Noonan syndrome alleles in which the dysregulation of the MAPK pathway is mild and differences can only be seen upon stimulation with growth factors. Due to this small increase in MAPK activation in the Lztr1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, it is also difficult to appreciate the rescue in the Lztr1<sup>-/-</sup>/Rit1<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Given that immunoblot is a semiquantitative assay, we have now undertaken quantitative PCR of known and well-characterized MAPK target genes (<italic>Spry2</italic> and <italic>Dusp6</italic>) (Ekerot et al., 2008; Ozaki et al., 2001; Wagle et al., 2018). Using this assay, we can conclude that Lztr1<sup>/-</sup>/Rit1<sup>-/-</sup> cells rescue the increased MAPK activity in response to growth factor stimulation (Figure 4h). We have included this new data and included the number of repeats in the figure legend for both immunoblot and qPCR as requested.</p><p>We have previously observed changes in LZTR1 protein levels upon serum stimulation in other cell types and we are currently following up on this interesting observation. However, these changes in LZTR1 levels are not associated with changes in RIT1 protein levels. This is consistent with our unpublished observations that low levels of LZTR1 do not necessarily result in higher RIT1 levels (as assessed by knocking down LZTR1 with different degrees of efficacy), while complete knockout of LZTR1 results in RIT1 accumulation. We think this is explained by the fact that LZTR1-mediated degradation of RIT1 is extremely efficient and even in the presence of low levels of LZTR1, there is still proficient RIT1 proteolysis. These observations are in line with the haplosufficiency seen in mice and humans for NS phenotypes. Moreover, it is likely that RIT1 ubiquitination by CRL3<sup>LZTR1</sup> requires a molecular trigger that is yet to be discovered; therefore, levels of LZTR1 are not necessarily a good readout of RIT1 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Experimental considerations:</p><p>1) The pulldown experiments in Figure 1b should state the number of times the experiments were each repeated.

We have also included the data from an additional repeat in which we have included a positive control. Note that the binding between LZTR1 and RIT1 is GDP-dependent, so these recombinant proteins are not expected to bind to known effectors such as Raf kinases (GTP-dependent interaction). Therefore, we have used SOS1 catalytic domain (SOS<sup>cat</sup>), which is highly conserved and can bind GDP-bound RAS. GST-RAS recombinant proteins are well-documented to fold properly and are purified in their GDP-bound form.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2a-b or accompanying text should state the number of flies analyzed of each genotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the number of flies analyzed in these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3a-d should state the number of mice of each genotype analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the number of mice analyzed in these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please provide quantification of the rescue phenotype shown in Figure 4e across a population of mice of each genotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the quantification for the cardiovascular rescue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The value of the gNOMAD analysis is unclear.

We have analyzed these samples in the past and found that RAS levels inconsistently change between the different patient samples. This is also the case in other fibroblast lines derived from additional Noonan syndrome families (for which we do not have matched parents and/or unaffected sibling samples).

We now show in a more quantitative manner that deletion of <italic>Rit1</italic> decreases the degree of MAPK activation in <italic>Lztr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (new Figure 4h).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.</p><p>a) Figure 1b: Reciprocal pull-down experiments i.e. pulling down with LZTR1, could further strengthen these data. Based on the interaction proteomics data from Steklov et al., it could have been more relevant to examine Hras or Nras in Figure 1b. However, Steklov et al., found also Kras as ubiquitination target of LZTR1. In the current study, Kras may have been used due to its species-wide conservation. However, the above-mentioned background in regards to the other Ras isoforms should be stated or discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. As the reviewer points out, the reason we decided to use KRAS for our analysis and in vitro experiments is because <italic>Drosophila Ras1</italic> (the only RAS gene in this organism) is more similar to human <italic>KRAS</italic> than to <italic>NRAS</italic> or <italic>HRAS</italic>. In our previous publication (Castel et al., 2019 Science), using pulldown assays, we did not see measurable LZTR1 binding to any of the classical RAS proteins KRAS, NRAS or HRAS.</p><p>Regarding reciprocal pull downs, we have attempted this in the past, but have not been very successful. We hypothesize that because the N-terminal tag is in the Kelch repeats (domain required for RIT1 interaction), antibodies used to pull down LZTR1 compete with RIT1 interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The abstract states a bit vaguely, 'biochemical dependency', which may be better expressed as 'preferred interaction with RIT1 than RAS orthologs' or similar.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now changed this statement as recommended by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Given the constitutive GTP-bound state of RIT1 it may not be surprising that its activity level is regulated 11-fold via LZTR1. While this compares to a mere 1.5-fold regulation of canonical RAS levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the latter needs to be multiplied by the probably 100 to 1000 fold-change in affinity e.g. for the RBD of the effector Raf, resulting in a total of 150 or 1500-fold activity change (PMID: 7852367). These activity ranges should be the actual values that are considered in order to assess the end-result of the regulation by LZTR1. However, canonical Ras activity will always depend on the coincidence of high local GEF and low GAP activity, while RIT1 might be active 'globally', a constellation particularly advantageous across long distances (e.g. in axons). This RAS-family activity consteallation could be discussed/ considered in their data interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point and we would like to clarify. The interaction between LZTR1 and RIT1 is GDPdependent, as we had previously described (Castel et al., 2019 Science). Recombinant RIT1 produced in bacteria is found in the GDP-loaded state; it is in mammalian cells where we have previously found high GTP loading of RIT1 (even upon growth factor starvation). We attribute this observation to the selective degradation of the GDP bound form by CRL3<sup>LZTR1</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.</p><p>a) In mice the RIT1 tissue expression levels vary greatly (Figure 3g). Does this inversely correlate with LZTR1 levels in these tissues? If not, it could be assumed that an additional tissue specific modifier of the LZTR1/RIT1 output is highly relevant. In this context, do the RIT1 expression levels somehow correlate with the tissue-specific severity of NS-like phenotypes that are observed in LZTR1 -/- mice?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question, but unfortunately, we are unable to measure the levels in a panel of mouse tissues. While the RIT1 antibody works well for this application, in our hands, the LZTR1 antibody immunoreacts nonspecifically in many tissues, which makes it impossible to assess the levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) RIT1 and RIT2 are known to be highly expressed during brain development and were implicated in particular in neurite outgrowth (in Colicelli J 2004, PMID: 15367757). The increasing relevance for brain development (or in general complexity also with respect to vasculature) somewhat correlates with the evolutionary pattern the authors describe, namely that a higher divergence for RIT1 and LZTR1 orthologs is seen in less complex organisms. Neurite outgrowth, vascular outgrowth and developmental cell migration appear to often utilise similar molecular machineries, which would all impact on characteristic NS phenotypes. Can the authors therefore speculate on the specific relevance of RIT1 for the observed embryonal bleeding phenotypes (Figure 4a) in LZTR1 ko mice? The point is that it is quite possible that a specific relevance of RIT1 for vascularisation is sufficient to cause the lethal phenotype.</p><p>Given the discrepancy with the results reported by Steklov et al., and the cross-breeding data presented here, it is also plausible that additional modifiers are strongly involved in this complex process. In this context, the authors may first wish to consider the increased phenotypic relevance of the LZTR1/RIT1 coupling from fly (hardly any wing vein defects) to mouse (embryonal lethality)? This could be speculated on in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. (Meyer Zum Büschenfelde et al., 2018) have demonstrated that RIT1 can regulate cell migration and actin dynamics though an association with the Rho family GTPases, CDC42 and Rac1. These GTPases engage with cellular developmental programs (such as planar cell polarity) that coordinate the migration and organization of tissues during development, including the formation of vascular networks and neurite migration. One can speculate in higher organisms, upregulation of RIT1 protein levels during development may have profound effects on the organization of certain tissues, such as the vasculature, potentially through MAPK-independent mechanisms, such as the CDC41/Rac1 signaling node.</p><p>The difference in the phenotypic relevance of LZTR1/RIT1 between mice and flies could be attributed to differences in the spatial and temporal expression of RIT1 or LZTR1 (as well as the expression and/or existence of different downstream effector pathways regulated by RIT1) during the development of these two organisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The rescue in the double-knockout mice may be mostly an outcome of the rescue of this particular vascularization phenotype. It is not entirely clear, whether all LZTR1-/- associated defects are restored, data are mentioned but not shown (L. 264). The authors should provide the data or change their statement. They are encouraged furthermore to discuss the above points and eventually adjust their concluding statements.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. We think that the rescue is due to the improvement of both the cardiac and the vascular phenotype. As shown in Figure 4e, in E18.5 embryos the cardiac phenotype is completely rescued. Unfortunately, we have not quantified the vascular phenotype, but we did not find any double knockout embryo with hemorrhages.</p><p>To further characterize the rescued phenotype of the double knockout animals, we have now included the data of our morphometric analysis of adult animals for NS-like phenotype. We did not find any noticeable differences in body weight, skull morphology, or heart and spleen weight (Figure 4 – supplement 1). In the future, it would be interesting to further phenotype these mice (especially when aged) to see if there are any other phenotypes that could be linked to LZTR1 loss independently of RIT1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) It could have been interesting to examine the RIT1 and RAS levels in the heterozygous LZTR1 knockout animals from Steklov and see, whether they are increased; yet it is understood this is too much extra work. However, Steklov find Hras and Nras as main interactors of LZTR1, while here typically pan-Ras (unclear in Figure 3g) or Kras (Figure 1b) were considered. Data in Figure 3g need to be quantified, so that the (pan-)Ras effect is clearer. In the end, the fact that Ras is mildly up-modulated across all tissues may be more consistent with the multi-system defects observed in RASopathies.</p><p>One may wish to modify the statement that RIT1 is 'the' critical substrate of LZTR1 (L. 261), but rather 'an important'. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that only a 'partial' rescue (L.260) is observed</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included immunoblot analysis of RAS and RIT1 proteins in liver and lung protein extracts from Lztr1 heterozygous mice (C57BL6/N background). These mice were originated in the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) and are the same line used by (Steklov et al., 2018). As seen in these tissues, there is no consistent upregulation of any RAS protein in the Lztr1 heterozygous mice. Unfortunately, we were unable to assess other tissues, because the LZTR1 antibody shows extensive immunoreactivity in mouse lysates. This data has now included as Figure 3 – supplement 1e.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.</p><p>a) Data in Figure 4g need to be quantified and sufficiently reproduced (i.e. in some repeats). How many repeats were performed, this information is not in the legend? Importantly, data in Figure 4g show that LZTR1 levels are serum-induced and then remain increased long term (24h). Thus, LZTR1 levels peak later than pMEK levels. Surprisingly, the modulation of LZTR1 is not reflected in the RIT1 levels in these blots. Here it would be important to see how RAS (ideally Hras and Kras) levels are modulated. All claims need quantification in particular those relating to pERK differences, which are not as obvious as pMEK differences. Could it be that in this particular background RIT1-levels are relatively uncoupled from LZTR regulation (Figure 4g)? Why?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included in the figure legend the number of repeats for experiment 4g.</p><p>As the reviewer has noticed, we have previously observed that LZTR1 levels can be modulated by FBS and we are currently following up on this interesting observation. These changes in LZTR1 protein levels are not associated with changes in RIT1 levels. This is consistent with our unpublished observations that low levels of LZTR1 do not necessarily result in higher RIT1 levels (as assessed by knocking down LZTR1 with different degrees of efficacy), while complete knockout of LZTR1 results in RIT1 accumulation. We think this is explained by the fact that LZTR1-mediated degradation of RIT1 is extremely efficient and even in the presence of low levels of LZTR1, there is still proficient RIT1 proteolysis. These observations are in line with the haplosufficiency seen in mice and humans for Noonan syndrome-related phenotypes. Moreover, it is likely that RIT1 ubiquitination by CRL3<sup>LZTR1</sup> requires a molecular trigger that is yet to be discovered; therefore, levels of LZTR1 are not necessarily a good readout of RIT1 protein levels.</p><p>Because western blot is a semiquantitative technique, we have now included the results from our experiments in these cells using qPCR of well-known transcriptional targets of the MAPK (<italic>Dusp6</italic> and <italic>Spry2</italic>). We now clearly show that double knockout cells decrease the levels of MAPK activity seen in LZTR1 knockout cells (Figure 4e).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) If RIT1 is the major target responsible for the LZTR1 ko phenotype then how can a MEKi rescue the lethal phenotype as reported by Steklov et al.? Does RIT1 also bind to canonical RAS effectors? How are LZTR1 and RIT1 levels modulated with a MEKi? While such MEKi experiments during pregnancy are too laborious, it could be possible to test effects using MEFs such as in Figure 4g.</p></disp-quote><p>RIT1 has been shown by us and others to activate MAPK (Berger et al., 2014; Castel et al., 2019; Fang et al., 2016, p. 1; Lo et al., 2021; Van et al., 2020, p. 1). In fact, RIT1 is one of the most common mutations in Noonan syndrome, which is a disorder driven by increased MAPK response (Aoki et al., 2013). Consistent with this, a few case reports have shown that the cardiac phenotype of RIT1 mutant Noonan syndrome ameliorated upon pharmacological treatment with a MEK1/2 allosteric inhibitor (Andelfinger et al., 2019). A plausible explanation of Steklov’s data is that the embryonic phenotype of LZTR1 knockout mice is due to RIT1-driven MAPK activation. This would be consistent with the fact that in our hands, we rescue this phenotype with the RIT1 knockout allele.</p><p>We are currently working on a project that explores the mechanism by which RIT1 can activate the MAPK; our data so far indicates that RIT1 can bind directly Raf (with low affinity), but is likely to still require RAS activity to activate MAPK.</p><p>References</p><p>Andelfinger G, Marquis C, Raboisson M-J, Théoret Y, Waldmüller S, Wiegand G, Gelb BD, Zenker M, Delrue M-A, Hofbeck M. 2019.
