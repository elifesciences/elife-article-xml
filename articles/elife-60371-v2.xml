CMG helicase, which stably associates with DNA replication forks throughout elongation. When replication terminates, CMG is ubiquitylated on its Mcm7 subunit and disassembled by the Cdc48/p97 ATPase. Until now, the regulation that restricts CMG ubiquitylation to termination was unknown, as was the mechanism of disassembly. By reconstituting these processes with purified budding yeast proteins, we show that ubiquitylation is tightly repressed throughout elongation by the Y-shaped DNA structure of replication forks. Termination removes the repressive DNA structure, whereupon long K48-linked ubiquitin chains are conjugated to CMG-Mcm7, dependent on multiple replisome components that bind to the ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>Dia2</sup>. This mechanism pushes CMG beyond a ‘5-ubiquitin threshold’ that is inherent to Cdc48, which specifically unfolds ubiquitylated Mcm7 and thereby disassembles CMG. These findings explain the exquisite regulation of CMG disassembly and provide a general model for the disassembly of ubiquitylated protein complexes by Cdc48.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>termination</kwd><kwd>CMG helicase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_12016/13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deegan</surname><given-names>Tom D</given-names></name><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Pragya P</given-names></name><name><surname>Fujisawa</surname><given-names>Ryo</given-names></name><name><surname>Polo Rivera</surname><given-names>Cristian</given-names></name><name><surname>Labib</surname><given-names>Karim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102943/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Labib</surname><given-names>Karim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>204678/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deegan</surname><given-names>Tom D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C578/A24558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujisawa</surname><given-names>Ryo</given-names></name><name><surname>Labib</surname><given-names>Karim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C578/A25669</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polo Rivera</surname><given-names>Cristian</given-names></name><name><surname>Labib</surname><given-names>Karim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ubiquitylation of the CMG helicase is inhibited throughout the initiation and elongation phases of chromosome replication by the DNA structure of a replication fork.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic chromosomes are duplicated just once per cell cycle, by a large molecular machine called the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgers and Kunkel, 2017</xref>). Replisome assembly is initiated in the G1-phase of the cell cycle, when the six Mcm2-7 ATPases are loaded around double strand DNA (dsDNA) at origins of replication, as a ‘head-to-head’ double hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). Each Mcm2-7 hexamer comprises a two-tiered ring, which represents the catalytic core of the helicase that subsequently unwinds the DNA duplex at replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aparicio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishimi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Labib et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Origin unwinding cannot occur until S-phase, when two protein kinases induce multiple ‘firing factors’ to recruit the remaining helicase subunits known as Cdc45 and the GINS complex. The association of Mcm2-7 with Cdc45 and GINS splits the Mcm2-7 double hexamer into two CMG (<underline>C</underline>dc45-<underline>M</underline>cm2-7-<underline>G</underline>INS) helicase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abid Ali et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moyer et al., 2006</xref>). CMG assembly is coupled to initial origin melting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>), so that each of the two nascent CMG helicases is associated with around 6–7 bp of unwound single-strand DNA (ssDNA). Finally, the transient opening of a poorly defined ‘gate’ in CMG leads to complete exclusion of the lagging strand DNA template from the Mcm2-7 central channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wasserman et al., 2019</xref>), in a step that requires the Mcm10 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>). This produces two activated CMG helicases that encircle opposite strands of the parental DNA duplex. The two helicases then bypass each other and begin to unwind the parental duplex DNA in opposite directions, led by the N-terminal tier of Mcm2-7 and driven by the ATPases in the Mcm2-7 C-terminal tier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>). Multiple factors associate with the two helicases to form two replisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gambus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sengupta et al., 2013</xref>), leading to the initiation of DNA synthesis at a pair of bidirectional replication forks, with CMG encircling the template of the leading strand.</p><p>The association of CMG with replication fork DNA is uninterrupted from initiation to termination, based on the stable entrapment of the leading strand DNA template in the central channel of Mcm2-7. This is important, because displacement of CMG from DNA blocks fork progression irreversibly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Labib et al., 2000</xref>), since CMG cannot be reassembled at a replication fork during S-phase. Nonetheless, the convergence of two replication forks leads very quickly to CMG disassembly and replisome dissolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dewar and Walter, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gambus, 2017</xref>), which is likely to represent the final stage of DNA replication termination. Consistent with this view, CMG unloading occurs after the formation of a fully ligated DNA product during plasmid replication in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dewar et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, we observed complete plasmid replication and the formation of covalently closed products, using a reconstituted yeast replication system that lacks the components required for CMG disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deegan et al., 2019</xref>). This indicated that post-termination CMG complexes must encircle dsDNA, after DNA synthesis has been completed.</p><p>The key regulated step during replisome disassembly is the ubiquitylation of the Mcm7 subunit of CMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maric et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreno et al., 2014</xref>), which in budding yeast is mediated by the cullin ubiquitin ligase known as SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> and the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Cdc34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maric et al., 2014</xref>). Until now, it was unknown how CMG ubiquitylation is robustly blocked throughout initiation and elongation and then induced with high efficiency during termination.</p><p>A termination-specific signal that triggers CMG ubiquitylation has not been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dewar and Walter, 2017</xref>), but several possibilities have been proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Firstly, ubiquitylation might be triggered by the presence of dsDNA within the central channel of the Mcm2-7 component of CMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dewar et al., 2015</xref>), which occurs after fork convergence, once each CMG helicase encounters the 5’ end of the opposing fork’s nascent lagging strand. The presence of dsDNA in the Mcm2-7 channel was suggested to induce a termination-specific conformational change in CMG that leads to recruitment or activation of the cullin ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dewar and Walter, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maric et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, CMG ubiquitylation might be dependent upon the juxtaposition of two converged replisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dewar and Walter, 2017</xref>), for example if the ligase could only be recruited to a pair of converged replisomes, or if ubiquitylation can only occur in trans, or else if convergence drives dimerisation of a replisome-associated ubiquitin ligase, as reported previously for another SCF enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, it was suggested that ubiquitylation might be triggered by the encounter of CMG on dsDNA with the rear face of PCNA complexes from the converging fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dewar and Walter, 2017</xref>). Current data do not distinguish between these or other possibilities. Importantly, all the above models are dependent on the convergence of two replication forks, and thus provide no insight into the fate of CMG when replication is terminated in other ways, such as when a single fork meets a telomere, or when a fork meets a nick in the leading strand DNA template. CMG is likely to slide off DNA under such conditions, and its subsequent fate is important, given recent data showing that Mcm10 can mediate the re-loading of CMG onto ssDNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wasserman et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Following ubiquitylation, CMG is disassembled by Cdc48/p97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dewar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maric et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreno et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonneville et al., 2017</xref>), which is a hexameric ATPase that disrupts protein structure and transports unfolded polypeptides through its central channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blythe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weith et al., 2018</xref>). Cdc48 is recruited to ubiquitylated substrates by its Ufd1-Npl4 cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blythe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsuchiya et al., 2017</xref>). These have been found to bind with varying affinity to K48-linked chains of three or more ubiquitins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Twomey et al., 2019</xref>), or of at least six ubiquitins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsuchiya et al., 2017</xref>). However, the functional link between ubiquitin chain length and substrate unfolding by Cdc48 has yet to be examined directly. Previous studies have not determined the mechanism by which Cdc48 disassembles ubiquitylated protein complexes such as CMG. Recruitment of Cdc48 to non-ubiquitylated proteins can induce unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang and Ye, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weith et al., 2018</xref>), and so it remains unclear which subunits in a ubiquitylated protein complex would be targeted by Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4.</p><p>Here, we address the mechanism and regulation of CMG ubiquitylation and disassembly, by recapitulating these reactions in vitro with purified budding yeast proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DNA-dependent repression of CMG ubiquitylation during initiation and elongation</title><p>Previous studies described the reconstitution of DNA replication initiation and replisome assembly with yeast proteins, leading to the progression of bi-directional replication forks away from an origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yeeles et al., 2017</xref>). However, DNA replication termination is defective when two forks converge in this system, unless the reactions also contain one of the two yeast members of the Pif1 helicase family, which help the replisome to unwind the final stretch of parental DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deegan et al., 2019</xref>). For this reason, replication reactions in the presence or absence of Pif1 provide a model system, with which to study the regulation of CMG ubiquitylation during DNA replication termination.</p><p>Therefore, we replicated a 3.2 kb plasmid plus or minus Pif1, before adding purified SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> together with the other necessary components of the ubiquitylation system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the absence of Pif1, converging replication forks stalled to produce a ‘late replication intermediate’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 2). Under these conditions, CMG-Mcm7 ubiquitylation was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 2). However, Mcm7 ubiquitylation was readily detected in reactions containing Pif1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 1), which supported DNA replication termination and the production of fully replicated 3.2 kb plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 1). Moreover, Mcm7 ubiquitylation was dependent upon Pif1 helicase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (ii), compare lanes 2 and 3; Pif1-K264A lacks helicase activity and cannot support DNA replication termination). These findings indicated that CMG ubiquitylation is tightly blocked before DNA replication termination in the reconstituted replication system, without requiring a deubiquitylase enzyme to counteract SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> and the ubiquitin conjugation system. The data also demonstrate that CMG-Mcm7 ubiquitylation is induced when converging replication forks undergo DNA replication termination, without needing the action of any additional factors other than the E1, E2 and E3 ubiquitylation enzymes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mcm7 ubiquitylation is repressed before termination by the association of CMG with DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme for B-C, based on in vitro replication of plasmid DNA with purified budding yeast proteins.

Therefore, it is unlikely that the juxtaposition of two converged CMG complexes represents a trigger for CMG ubiquitylation, either during initiation or when forks converge during DNA replication termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of Mcm10, the initial steps of initiation convert an Mcm2-7 double hexamer into two CMG helicases that are each associated with around 6–7 bp of unwound DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that the lagging strand template has not yet been fully excluded from the Mcm2-7 channel of CMG. The newly assembled CMG helicases persist and remain associated with origins in yeast cells that lack Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Deursen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watase et al., 2012</xref>). Correspondingly, CMG ubiquitylation is blocked in the reconstituted in vitro replication system, when replication initiates in the absence of Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (i), compare lanes 1–2).</p><p>The failure to ubiquitylate CMG under such conditions might simply reflect the absence of an activating signal that is specific to termination. Alternatively, however, it is possible that ubiquitylation of nascent CMG is actively repressed at origins, for example by the manner in which newly assembled CMG embraces origin DNA. To test this idea, we performed replication reactions in the presence or absence of Mcm10, and then digested the products with DNase, before adding SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> and other ubiquitylation enzymes. Remarkably, both nascent CMG and post-termination CMG were ubiquitylated to an equivalent degree upon release from DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (i), compare lanes 3–4; the efficiency of DNase digestion is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These findings strongly indicate that the regulation of CMG ubiquitylation during chromosome duplication is not based on an activating signal that can only occur during DNA replication termination at a pair of converged forks. Instead, nascent CMG is potentially a substrate for SCF<sup>Dia2</sup>, but ubiquitylation is blocked during initiation, dependent upon the DNA structure of the origin.</p><p>To test whether CMG ubiquitylation is also repressed in a DNA-dependent manner during elongation, we performed replication reactions in the absence or presence of Pif1 as above, and then digested the products with DNase before addition of SCF<sup>Dia2</sup>, E1 and E2. Strikingly, CMG released from pre-termination forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (ii), lane 3, -Pif1) was ubiquitylated just as efficiently as CMG derived from fully replicated plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (ii), lane 4, +Pif1). Overall, therefore, these data indicate that the regulation of CMG ubiquitylation during chromosome replication is based on DNA-dependent repression during initiation and elongation, which is then relieved during DNA replication termination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CMG ubiquitylation is inherently efficient in the presence of other replisome proteins</title><p>To test directly whether CMG is an efficient substrate of SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> when not bound to DNA, we purified recombinant yeast CMG helicase as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>) and then incubated it together with the other replisome factors and ubiquitylation components described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).

Overall, these findings demonstrated that SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> ubiquitylates CMG-Mcm7 with remarkable efficiency and selectivity, without any requirement for CMG to have passed through the steps of DNA replication termination.

Moreover, the inhibitory effect of fork DNA was observed over a broad range of E3 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Note that free CMG, which is a highly efficient substrate for SCF<sup>Dia2</sup>, is in equilibrium with DNA-bound CMG under such conditions.

To test whether Mrc1 and Ctf4 were important for the Cdc48-dependent step of disassembly, independently of their role in promoting long-chain CMG ubiquitylation, we split the reaction into several distinct steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; see Materials and methods). Firstly, CMG was ubiquitylated in the presence of Mrc1, which associates dynamically with CMG and supports the conjugation of more than 12 ubiquitins to Mcm7 under these conditions. Secondly, ubiquitylated CMG was isolated by immunoprecipitation of Sld5, and then washed with high salt to remove the associated Mrc1 and SCF<sup>Dia2</sup>. Finally, the reactions were incubated with Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4.

These findings indicated that Mrc1 and Ctf4 promote CMG disassembly by stimulating the formation of long ubiquitin chains on CMG-Mcm7, but are not required subsequently for the action of Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4.</p><p>To investigate the mechanistic implications of ubiquitin chain length for CMG disassembly, we took two approaches that were both dependent on the ability to titrate ubiquitin chain length in the reconstituted in vitro system. Firstly, we explored the relation between the number of ubiquitin moieties conjugated to Mcm7 and the stable recruitment of Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 to ubiquitylated CMG, using a Walker B mutant of Cdc48 that does not support substrate unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, stable binding of Cdc48-E588A_Ufd1-Npl4 to ubiquitylated CMG was dependent upon the conjugation of very long polyubiquitin chains to Mcm7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), despite previous studies showing that Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 can bind with varying affinity to monomeric substrates that are conjugated to three or more ubiquitins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>), or at least six ubiquitins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsuchiya et al., 2017</xref>). These findings indicate that long ubiquitin chains increase the stability of binding to Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4, but the data do not address what length of ubiquitin chain is functionally required for a substrate to be unfolded by Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4.</p><p>Secondly, therefore, we developed an assay that provides a direct readout for the number of conjugated ubiquitins that are needed for substrate unfolding. The assay is based on monitoring the ubiquitin chain length of the unfolded Mcm7 subunit that is released upon disassembly of the CMG helicase. Thus, the approach is dependent upon the use of a multimeric ubiquitylated protein complex as the substrate of Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4, in contrast to previous studies of monomeric ubiquitylated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>) or free ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsuchiya et al., 2017</xref>). We established conditions in which a single K48-linked chain of up to about 10 ubiquitin moieties was conjugated to lysine 29 of CMG-Mcm7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1D</xref> and 0.3 nM E2, also see Materials and methods), which we previously showed is a favoured site for CMG ubiquitylation in yeast cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maric et al., 2017</xref>). The ability of Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 to disassemble CMG with short chains or longer chains was then compared, after isolation of the ubiquitylated helicase by immunoprecipitation of Sld5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Subsequently, CMG disassembly was monitored by release of ubiquitylated Mcm7 into the supernatant.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, Mcm7 with 1–4 ubiquitins was largely retained on the beads throughout the reaction, indicating that CMG disassembly was blocked. In contrast, Mcm7 with 5–7 ubiquitins was partially released into the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, left side), whereas longer ubiquitin chains on Mcm7 led to rapid dissociation from CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, right side, 10 nM E2). These findings indicated that CMG disassembly is gated by a ‘ubiquitin threshold’ that controls the action of Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4, analogous to an equivalent threshold that is thought to control the degradation of proteasomal substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Swatek and Komander, 2016</xref>). Conjugation of at least five ubiquitins to Mcm7 is required for CMG disassembly, although we note that longer ubiquitin chains increase the efficiency of disassembly still further (consistent with the binding data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In summary, therefore, the replisome components Mrc1 and Ctf4 ensure that SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> pushes CMG above a ubiquitin threshold that governs the action of Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4.

The Cdc48-FtsH fusion protein supported efficient disassembly of ubiquitylated CMG helicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), leading to the production of degraded fragments of ubiquitylated Mcm7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

In contrast, the other 10 subunits of CMG were not degraded by Cdc48-FtsH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), except for a very small amount of Mcm4 that correlated with the low level of Mcm4 ubiquitylation in the reconstituted system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>; note that Mcm4 is adjacent to Mcm7 within the structure of the CMG helicase). These findings demonstrated that Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 disassembles ubiquitylated CMG by specifically unfolding the ubiquitylated subunit (almost exclusively Mcm7), which is translocated through the central pore of Cdc48. This then induces the irreversible collapse of the CMG helicase complex.</p><p>As noted above, the ubiquitylated Mcm7 subunit of CMG remains associated with Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 after helicase disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lanes 7–8). This most likely reflects the fact that the unfolded polypeptide is partially extruded from the C-terminal face of the Cdc48 hexamer, with part of the unfolded protein present within the central channel of Cdc48, and at least some of the K48-linked ubiquitin chain still bound to Ufd1-Npl4 on the N-terminal face of Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>). As observed previously for ubiquitylated GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>), partial cleavage of the remaining ubiquitin chains with the Cdc48-linked deubiquitylase Otu1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ernst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stein et al., 2014</xref>) led to release of unfolded Mcm7 from Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). In this way, or via the action of other deubiquitylases, the Cdc48 unfoldase is recycled and thus is ready to interact with a new substrate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Building on previous in vivo approaches and those that used cell extracts, the fully reconstituted assays in this study have enabled us to define the minimal components and molecular basis for the regulation of CMG helicase ubiquitylation, together with the mechanism by which the ubiquitylated CMG is disassembled. As discussed above and summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, the data in this study are inconsistent with all of the previously suggested models for the regulation of CMG ubiquitylation during DNA replication termination. These were each based on a different termination-specific signal that was proposed to be an essential part of the mechanism for CMG ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dewar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dewar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maric et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonneville et al., 2017</xref>). Based on our data, we instead propose a new model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), whereby ubiquitylation of the CMG-replisome is inherently efficient from the moment of CMG assembly onwards, but ubiquitylation is inhibited throughout elongation by the DNA structure of a replication fork. We note that this model is not dependent on any structural change in CMG itself during DNA replication termination.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model describing the regulated ubiquitylation and disassembly of the CMG helicase during DNA replication termination.</title><p>Multiple replisome components are omitted for simplicity.

At a pair of converged replication forks, the repressive DNA structure is removed when the two CMG helicases unwind the final base pairs of parental dsDNA and then bypass each other. From this point onwards, each CMG helicase moves along a single parental DNA strand that is no longer connected to the other. Whilst it is likely that CMG encounters the 5’ end of the opposing fork’s lagging strand and moves onto dsDNA in the few minutes before CMG is disassembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dewar et al., 2015</xref>), the model indicates that the commitment to ubiquitylation occurs when the last bp of parental dsDNA is unwound, and the repressive fork DNA structure is removed from CMG.</p><p>Notably, the model also predicts that CMG will be ubiquitylated and disassembled via the same mechanism, whenever replication terminates by a single fork arriving at a telomere or a nick in the leading strand DNA template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As above, the trigger is the unwinding of the final bp of dsDNA, after which the repression of CMG ubiquitylation is removed, in this case by the helicase sliding off DNA. For this reason, the ubiquitylation of soluble CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) likely represents a physiologically important process that is responsible for disassembling the 32 CMG helicases that are released from the ends of 16 chromosomes in a haploid budding yeast cell, thereby explaining why CMG is not detected after the completion of S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gambus et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We propose that the parental DNA strand that is excluded from the Mcm2-7 channel of CMG, corresponding to the template of the lagging strand at replication forks, sterically inhibits the ubiquitylation of CMG-Mcm7. Consistent with this view, the N-terminal domain of Mcm7 contains a preferred site for ubiquitylation by SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> and Cdc34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maric et al., 2017</xref>), together with a hairpin that functions as a ‘separation pin’ to split the two parental DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baretic et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, replication fork DNA specifically inhibits CMG-Mcm7 ubiquitylation, without affecting the (less efficient) ubiquitylation of other replisome components such as Ctf4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>In subsequent studies, structural biology will be important to determine how SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> and Cdc34 engage with the yeast replisome, beyond the interaction of the Dia2-TPR with Ctf4 and Mrc1. In this regard, we note that the C-terminal Leucine-Rich Repeats (LRR) of Dia2, which comprise the canonical substrate-binding domain, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardozo and Pagano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Willems et al., 2004</xref>), are also required for SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> association with the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mukherjee and Labib, 2019</xref>). Given that CMG-Mcm7 is the preferred substrate of SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>), we predict that the Dia2-LRR binds directly to CMG. Consistent with this view, CMG is still a target for SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> in the absence of other replisome components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or the Dia2-TPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maculins et al., 2015</xref>), albeit with much reduced efficiency. Two important future challenges will be to establish the binding site of the Dia2-LRR on CMG and determine the path of the excluded DNA strand at a replication fork. Such structural insights will help to determine whether the excluded DNA strand blocks access of Cdc34 to key lysine residues on the surface of Mcm7, or else interferes directly with the function of SCF<sup>Dia2</sup>, for example by blocking recruitment. In this regard, we note that previous work showed that SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> co-purified with the yeast replisome after DNase treatment of S-phase cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morohashi et al., 2009</xref>), which would have removed the inhibitory effect of the excluded DNA strand. Therefore, it is not known when the ligase is recruited to the yeast replisome during chromosome replication, and this will also be an important issue to address in the future.</p><p>Ubiquitylation of nascent CMG is inhibited during initiation in the reconstituted DNA replication system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>), consistent with in vivo observations in yeast cells lacking Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Deursen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watase et al., 2012</xref>). This is dependent upon the association of nascent CMG with the DNA template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (i)), indicating that the small amount of ssDNA that is associated with CMG under such circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>) is sufficient to inhibit the action of SCF<sup>Dia2</sup>. The location of the melted origin DNA in relation to CMG is unclear at present, but it is plausible that ssDNA is associated with the N-terminal tier of Mcm2-7, which contains the ‘separation pin’ that drives DNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baretic et al., 2019</xref>). In this case, the mechanism repressing CMG ubiquitylation during initiation and at replication forks might be extremely similar, mediated in each case by unwound parental DNA at the N-terminal face of CMG. However, we cannot rule out that the continued association of firing factors with nascent CMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanke et al., 2012</xref>) also impairs the action of SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> during initiation.</p><p>Binding of Ctf4 and Mrc1 to SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> ensures that a long polyubiquitin chain is conjugated to CMG-Mcm7, once the inhibition of CMG ubiquitylation is relieved upon termination. By studying the release of unfolded Mcm7 from the CMG protein complex, we have established the functional significance of these long polyubiquitin chains, as our data indicate that Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 can only unfold proteins that are conjugated to at least five ubiquitins. We note that this functional requirement for at least five ubiquitins during substrate unfolding is consistent with recent data involving cryo-electron microscopy and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Twomey et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 can likely engage 4–5 five ubiquitins simultaneously, with two bound by Npl4, 1–2 bound by Ufd1, and a further ubiquitin unfolded within the central channel of Cdc48.</p><p>We propose two consequences of this mechanism for the biology of the CMG helicase. Firstly, the requirement for long ubiquitin chains provides a form of quality control. Unscheduled ubiquitylation events during elongation are likely to be inefficient and should thus only produce short chains, which would not trigger premature CMG disassembly by Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4. Secondly, the functional requirement of Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 for long ubiquitin chains has driven the evolution of pathways that exploit short-chain ubiquitylation of CMG during elongation for other uses. For example, work with <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts indicates that the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase leads to slow ubiquitylation of CMG at inter-strand DNA crosslinks, initially favoring the recruitment of DNA repair factors such as the NEIL3 glycosylase to short poly-ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Our data show why such short-chain ubiquitylation does not trigger premature CMG disassembly. Should the NEIL3 pathway not be sufficient for repair of the lesion, then the subsequent formation of longer ubiquitin chains induces CMG disassembly and the associated Fanconi Anaemia DNA repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Räschle et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our data demonstrate that the mechanism by which Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 disassembles ubiquitylated CMG involves specific unfolding of the ubiquitylated Mcm7 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, step 3), probably initiated by unfolding of a ubiquitin component of the K48-linked ubiquitin chain that is attached to Mcm7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Twomey et al., 2019</xref>). In this way, GINS and Cdc45 are segregated from the remainder of the Mcm2-7 proteins. It is likely that unfolded Mcm7 is then degraded by the proteasome, either directly due to the persistence of an oligo-ubiquitin chain on Mcm7 after release from Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4, or else via cellular pathways for the ubiquitylation and degradation of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enam et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>These findings provide a general model for the processing of ubiquitylated protein complexes by Cdc48/p97 and its Ufd1-Npl4 cofactors, which is an issue of broad significance in many areas of cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van den Boom and Meyer, 2018</xref>). Although other adaptors of Cdc48/p97 can recruit the ATPase to unfold non-ubiquitylated protomers of a protein complex, as is the case for an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weith et al., 2018</xref>), our data indicate that Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 exclusively unfolds the ubiquitylated subunit(s) of a protein complex.</p><p>Finally, we note that the ubiquitin ligases that control CMG helicase disassembly during DNA replication termination have diverged widely during the course of eukaryotic evolution. Although yeasts utilise SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maculins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morohashi et al., 2009</xref>), metazoa employ an unrelated cullin ligase called CUL2<sup>LRR1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dewar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonneville et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, the manner by which the CMG helicase embraces its DNA template is likely to be very similar in all eukaryotic species. It will be of particular interest to explore whether the excluded DNA strand defines a common mechanism that constrains CMG ubiquitylation before termination, despite the evolution of different ubiquitin ligases in diverse eukaryotic species.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Details of strains and reagents are provided in the Key Resources table in Appendix 1.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain yJF1 (<italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> <italic>ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100 bar1∆::hphNT pep4∆::kanMX</italic>) was transformed with linearised plasmids using standard procedures to generate protein expression strains, as detailed in the Appendix 1-key resources table.

Each sample was then incubated at 4°C with 2.5 µl magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-270 Epoxy; 14302D, Life Technologies) that had been coupled to anti-Sld5 antibody. After 1 hr, protein complexes bound to magnetic beads were washed once with 190 µl of Wash buffer/700 mM KOAc then twice with 190 µl of Wash buffer/150 mM KOAc. Beads were resuspended in 10 µl of Wash buffer/150 mM KOAc/5 mM ATP and Cdc48 and Ufd1-Npl4 were added to 50 nM. Reactions were then incubated at 30°C for 20 min with shaking at 1000 rpm. After the incubation, beads and associated proteins were isolated onto a magnetic rack and the supernatant was removed. Beads were then washed twice with 190 µl of Wash buffer/150 mM KOAc.

possible to reconstitute the entire replication process with purified proteins and the current paper extends this to reconstitute termination of DNA replication and removal of the replicative DNA helicase from the replicated DNA. In so doing, the authors have discovered a new mechanism for linking ubiquitylation of the helicase subunit, Mcm7, to the structure of the replicated DNA. This is an important contribution to understanding how the genome is copied only once per cell division cycle.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CMG helicase disassembly is controlled by replication fork DNA, replisome components and a ubiquitin threshold&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bruce Stillman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dirk Remus (Reviewer #2); Philip Zegerman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes the reconstitution of replisome disassembly after the termination of DNA replication with purified budding yeast proteins. Replisome disassembly has been previously shown by the Labib lab and others to be mediated by the ubiquitylation-dependent extraction of Mcm7 by the Cdc48 ATPase. However, the mechanism that links replisome disassembly to the termination of DNA replication has been elusive. Here, the authors propose that the displaced lagging strand template inhibits replisome disassembly during replication elongation. Moreover, the authors propose that replisome disassembly requires conjugation of extended ubiquitin chains on Mcm7 as a failsafe mechanism against premature replisome disassembly due to potential stochastic Mcm7 ubiquitylation. In addition, the authors demonstrate novel roles for Ctf4 and Mrc1 in mediating Mcm7 ubiquitylation.</p><p>This is a very interesting study that addresses an important biological problem and provides several critical mechanistic insights into an essential step of the DNA replication reaction. The experiments are generally well-controlled and of high quality. There are a number of minor clarifications and comments that the authors should address in a revised manuscript, none requiring new data.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) The purification of Cdc34, Cdc48, FtsH, Otu1, SCFDAI2, Uba1, Ufd1-Npl4, and CMG are described in the Materials and methods. The authors should state the yield of purified protein from the amount of cells used.</p><p>2) Discussion: The authors discuss why Mcm7 in the CMG is not ubiquitylated when it is an active helicase and the model is fine and consistent with the data. Perhaps they should also discuss why Mcm7 in all of the loaded Mcm2-7 double hexamers (DH) is not ubiquitylated. Two possibilities come to mind, one is the lack of elongation factors associated with the DH (e.g., Ctf4, Mrc1) or that the juxtaposition of the DH Mcm2-7 amino termini buries the Mcm7 N-terminal tails, making then only accessible after DH dissociation. The structures of the Mcm2-7 DH show some accessibility of the Mcm7 amino terminus, so it is either masked or elongation factors are required.</p><p>3) The paper relies on a system that utilizes Pif1 to induce replication termination in reactions containing Top1 but lacking Top2. This may not represent the default termination pathway. For example, the authors had previously demonstrated that termination of plasmid replication in yeast cells is only slightly delayed after depletion of Pif1/Rrm3 (PMID 30850330), indicating that termination is not strictly dependent on Pif1/Rrm3 in vivo. Moreover, as demonstrated in PMID 32341532 and the authors' previous paper (PMID 30850330) termination is less efficient in the presence of Top1 compared to Top2. Therefore: Why are the reactions here performed in the absence of Top2? Moreover, termination efficiency in the reconstituted budding yeast system reported in PMID 32341532 is significantly higher than that reported by the authors' system here, indicating that specific reaction conditions significantly affect the termination process. Combined, it therefore seems relevant to point out at the beginning of the paper that the Top1/Pif1 system is being employed here as a useful tool to enrich for LRIs.</p><p>4) Could the authors explain why the replication experiments are performed in the absence Pol-δ, which is required for normal DNA replication?</p><p>5) Figure 4: The authors had previously shown that K29 ubiquitylation is not essential for replisome disassembly in vivo (PMID 28355556). Thus, while the specificity for K29 ubiquitylation observed in the in vitro system here is a useful tool to assess the ubiquitin chain length requirement for Cdc48-catalyzed replisome disassembly (Figure 4), it should be noted that alternative disassembly pathways remain possible.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60371.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) The purification of Cdc34, Cdc48, FtsH, Otu1, SCFDAI2, Uba1, Ufd1-Npl4, and CMG are described in the Materials and methods.

This indicated that only CMG complexes and not Mcm2-7 double hexamers are a substrate for SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> (especially since we had also shown in the 2014 paper that CMG ubiquitylation can occur in G1-phase, upon re-expression of Dia2 in G1-arrested cells that had previously been depleted for Dia2). As the reviewers note, the failure to ubiquitylate Mcm2-7 double hexamers could either be due to a requirement for elongation factors, or else might reflect the occlusion within the double hexamer interface of important binding sites for SCF<sup>Dia2</sup>.</p><p>However, our new data in the present manuscript show that free Mcm2-7 complexes (single hexamers) are not ubiquitylated by SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> (Figure 3A lane 2). Therefore, the failure to ubiquitylate Mcm2-7 double hexamers is unlikely to be due to the occlusion of important binding sites for SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> within the double hexamer interface. Instead, only CMG is a substrate for SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> and ubiquitylation is almost entirely dependent upon the Ctf4 and Mrc1 partners of CMG (compare lanes 1-3 of Figure 3A).</p><p>In the revised manuscript we now discuss why Mcm2-7 complexes cannot be ubiquitylated outside of S-phase (subsection “Efficient ubiquitylation of the CMG-replisome is dependent upon recruitment of SCF<sup>Dia2</sup> by Mrc1 and Ctf4”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The paper relies on a system that utilizes Pif1 to induce replication termination in reactions containing Top1 but lacking Top2.

We point this out at the beginning of the Results: “replication reactions in the presence or absence of Pif1 provide a model system, with which to study the regulation of CMG ubiquitylation during DNA replication termination”.</p><p>However, our choice of topoisomerase was not related to the efficiency of termination. The reviewers correctly note that termination is slightly more efficient in our system in the presence of Top2, compared to reactions that only have Top1 (Deegan et al., 2019). But even in the presence of Top2, more than 80% of replicated plasmids accumulate as ‘late replication intermediates’, due to a failure of DNA replication termination.</p><p>Furthermore, Top2 is not essential for replication termination either in vivo (Baxter et al., 2008) or in vitro (Deegan et al., 2019). For this study, we omitted Top2 in order to avoid a slight inhibitory effect of Top2 on replication efficiency under our reaction conditions. We have now added a note to this effect in Materials and methods (subsection “In vitro replication-ubiquitylation assays”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Could the authors explain why the replication experiments are performed in the absence Pol-δ, which is required for normal DNA replication?</p></disp-quote><p>Pol-δ was omitted to avoid strand displacement synthesis, which is driven by Pol-δ and was previously shown to be enhanced by Pif1 (Osmundson et al., 2017, Rossi et al., 2008). Although this strand displacement activity of Pol-δ can be alleviated by higher salt concentrations, the latter conditions would also impair the efficiency of ubquitylation. We now state this and cite the relevant papers in Materials and methods (subsection “In vitro replication-ubiquitylation assays”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4: The authors had previously shown that K29 ubiquitylation is not essential for replisome disassembly in vivo (PMID 28355556). Thus, while the specificity for K29 ubiquitylation observed in the in vitro system here is a useful tool to assess the ubiquitin chain length requirement for Cdc48-catalyzed replisome disassembly (Figure 4), it should be noted that alternative disassembly pathways remain possible.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous work showed that Mcm7-K29 is the only residue that is ubiquitylated by SCF<sup>Dia2</sup>-Cdc34 during in vitro ubiquitylation reactions in yeast cell extracts, under conditions that are relatively inefficient (Maric et al., 2017). Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed K29 as a bona fide ubiquitylation site in vivo, but we found that other sites on Mcm7 could also be ubiquitylated in yeast cells with high efficiency (Maric et al., 2017). Consistent with these findings, our new data in the present manuscript show that multiple sites on Mcm7 can be ubiquitylated in the reconstituted ubiquitylation system under optimal conditions (e.g. see the K0-ubiquitin samples in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C with 25 nM E3 and 15 nM E2). However, Mcm7-K29 is the only site that is modified if the efficiency of the reactions is reduced (e.g. Figure 4E with 1 nM E3 and 0.3 nM E2). We now state that more than one lysine on Mcm7 is modified under standard reaction conditions in the subsection “CMG ubiquitylation is inherently efficient in the presence of other replisome proteins”.</p><p>Together with our previous in vivo findings (Maric et al., 2017), these data indicate that ubiquitylation of other sites on Mcm7, in addition to Mcm7-K29, can also support CMG disassembly. However, there is currently no reason to suggest the existence of alternative disassembly pathways that are independent of the ubiquitylation of CMG-Mcm7 (at least in budding yeast).</p></body></sub-article></article>
