xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by replicating selected results from a substantial number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/">citations and Altmetric scores</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Wnt activity defines colon cancer stem cells and is regulated by the microenvironment’ by Vermeulen and colleagues, published in <italic>Nature Cell Biology</italic> in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). The key experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 2F, 6D, and 7E. In these experiments, Vermeulen and colleagues utilize a reporter for Wnt activity and show that colon cancer cells with high levels of Wnt activity also express cancer stem cell markers (Figure 2F; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, treatment either with conditioned medium derived from myofibroblasts or with hepatocyte growth factor restored clonogenic potential in low Wnt activity colon cancer cells in vitro (Figure 6D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>) and in vivo (Figure 7E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://centerforopenscience.org/">Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</ext-link> and the results of the replications will be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07301.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07301.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>methodology</kwd><kwd>cancer stem cells</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is funded by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, provided to the Center for Open Science in collaboration with Science Exchange.

Wnt signaling proteins mediate a wide variety of biological processes during development, including maintenance of stem cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Malanchi and Huelsken, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Clevers et al., 2014</xref>), and aberrant Wnt activation is linked to several diseases, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>). Vermeulen and colleagues showed that high Wnt activity correlated with markers of colon cancer stem cells and enhanced clonogenic potential of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). They also showed that stromal myofibroblasts secreted factors such as HGF that enhanced Wnt activity and clonogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). Further, treatment of more differentiated cells with myofibroblast conditioned medium (MFCM) enhanced Wnt activity in these cells and enhanced clonogenicity in vitro and in vivo, illustrating that colon cancer cell stemness can be modified by the microenvironment.</p><p>To assess Wnt activity in colon cancer cells, Vermeulen and colleagues utilized the TOP-GFP reporter system, a LEF-1/TCF responsive promoter driving expression of the enhanced GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Reya et al., 2003</xref>). In Figure 2F, colon cancer stem cells were isolated from human colon cancer specimens and transduced with the TOP-GFP reporter. Wnt activity was then assessed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in populations derived from a single cell, and flow cytometry was concurrently used to assess the levels of the cancer stem cell markers CD133, CD24/CD29 or CD44/CD166 in these cells. Vermeulen and colleagues found that cells with high Wnt activity levels correlated with expression of cancer stem cell markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). Several other reports have used the TOP-GFP system or a similar reporter system to demonstrate that Wnt activity was enhanced in a population of cells expressing cancer stem cell markers. Correlation of cancer stem cells markers with high Wnt activity was found in primary and metastatic mouse mammary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Malanchi et al., 2012</xref>), spheroid cultures of colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Colak et al., 2014</xref>), human and mouse colonic adenomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Prasetyanti et al., 2013</xref>), and primary colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kemper et al., 2012</xref>). All of these studies also found that cells with high Wnt activity maintained clonogenicity, while cells with low Wnt activity had markedly reduced clonogenic potential. In contrast, one report did find that while high Wnt reporter activity did correlate with expression of cancer stem cell markers, the tumorigenic capacity of cells was not dependent upon Wnt activity in four of the five cell lines tested, including three cell lines derived from primary colon cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Horst et al., 2012</xref>). The experiment presented in Figure 2F will be replicated in Protocol 2.</p><p>Figure 6D assessed the potential of MFCM or HGF to enhance the clonogenic potential in vitro of colon cancer cells with low Wnt activity (TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells). Clonogenic potential was measured using a limiting dilution assay in which cells were plated at a range of densities and the number of colonies that grow over time was counted. This experiment also examined the ability of the small molecular c-Met inhibitor, PHA-665752, to block MFCM or HGF-mediated clonogenicity. Vermeulen and colleagues showed that treatment of TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells with HGF or MFCM increased clonogenicity of these poorly clonogenic cells, and that clonogenicity could be reversed by c-Met inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, MET has been reported to be enriched in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and promote their self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Bacco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Joo et al., 2012</xref>). Met inhibition could also reduce the clonogenic and tumorigenic potential of GSCs, with activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway shown to be a key mediator of the HGF/Met signaling pathway in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Joo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). This experiment is replicated in Protocol 3. This result was expanded upon in Figure 7E to assess the effect of MFCM on TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells in vivo, where Vermeulen and colleagues found that TOP-GFP<sup>Low</sup> cells coinjected with MFCM, or an admixture of the factors these cells secrete, had enhanced tumorigenicity compared to TOP-GFP<sup>Low</sup> cells injected alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). To assess the affect of MFCM on tumorigenicity, limiting dilutions of the different cell populations, in the presence or absence of MFCM, were injected subcutaneously into nude mice and tumor formation was measured over time. Likewise, HGF, along with other cytokines secreted from tumor-associated cells, was demonstrated to increase the tumorigenic activity and metastatic potential of colorectal cancer progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Todaro et al., 2014</xref>).

The authors have done a careful job in listing their set-up and experimental design. Nevertheless, there are a couple of remaining concerns that need to be addressed/adjusted.</p><p>1) The name of the TOP-GFP vector is listed incorrectly. This is not a b-cat-IRES-GFP but a TOP-CMV-GFP vector.</p><p>2) In protocol 3 DMSO is added to the control. This is unlikely to have an effect, but we did not perform such an addition.</p><p>3) The titration of cells in the LD in protocol 3 is uncertain. Different spheroid cultures from individual patients have different clonogenic potential. In some case we find 1 in 4, in other cases we find 1 in 100. If the current experiments will be performed on a low clonogenic CSC (i.e. low CSC faction) the authors will need to extend their titration curves.</p><p>4) The biggest worry for the reproducibility study is the simple use of just one culture. As is clear from our study and is clear from others, there is a variability in the cultures that can be derived from colon cancers. For instance, HCT-116 and Co56 in our study do not display the same intense difference in clonogenicity and this is also reported in the study. To perform all these studies with just one culture introduces a risk into the reproducibility study. I would therefore suggest using multiple primary cultures from different patients. In addition, to facilitate the reproduction it may be wise to re-investigate the possibility of studying the clonogenic differences in one of the original cultures. This will require extensive MTAs but may facilitate the studies tremendously. I will be happy to re-invest time in checking whether this is an option. In any case, the authors should consider to use a control for clonogenic studies using AC133 staining, which has been reported by many groups to identify CSCs in spheroids, but also does not uniformaly do so (i.e. HCT116 does not work). If this fails to identify a clonogenic fraction, the TOP-GFP is also not likely to work for that particular culture.</p><p>Alternative would be to use classical cell lines to identify the top high/low difference.</p><p>5) The production of HGF by Co18 should be validated to ascertain that the TFCM is truly reproducing the original studies.</p><p>6) The MFCM stimulation of TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells prior to injection was performed in pure MFCM generated as described. So not admixed 1:2 with CSC medium.</p><p>7) The authors should cite other data using HGF/MET to study cancer stemness (i.e. J. Rich in Cancer Research and Stassi in Cell Stem Cell).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study aims to reproduce the key experiments from the article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vermeulen et. al., 2010</xref> (Nature Cell Biology). Vermeulen et al. present experiments that suggest that the cancer microenviroment regulates WNT signalling, which in turn defines colon cancer stem cells.</p><p>For the reproducibility project the authors described the replication plan of key experiments. The experiments they have chosen were originally reported in Figures 2F, 6D and 7E: I agree with the choice for Figures 6D and 7E, but I feel that two other figures should be reproduced instead of Figure 2F.</p><p>In Figure 2, Vermeulen describes the generation of TopGFP transduced clones and their subsequent analysis. The analysis presented in Figure 2 goes along the following scheme:</p><p>1) Transduction of crc spheroid cells.</p><p>2) Sorting GFP<sup>High</sup> and GFP<sup>Low</sup> cells (Figure 2A).</p><p>3) In-vitro clonogenic assay on GFP<sup>High</sup> and GFP<sup>Low</sup> cells (Fig 2A, 2B and 2D).</p><p>4) Correlation of GFP<sup>High</sup> with proposed cancer stem cell markers (CD133, CD24/CD29, CD44/CD166) (Figure 2F).</p><p>To me the key experiment and the basis for the study is the observation that TopGFP<sup>High</sup> cells show a greater clonogenic potential than TopGFP<sup>Low</sup> cells. This observation directly links WNT signaling to tumor initiating potential/cancer stem cells. Whether or not these cells express proteins that are suggested to mark cancer stem cells is not relevant as cancer stem cells are functionally defined.</p><p>By repeating Figure 2A, the in-vitro clonogenic assay, the key experiment will be reproduced. In addition to the in-vitro potential, the study should also replicate the in vivo clonogenic experiment described by Vermeulen in Figure 3A.</p><p>I suggest you repeat the following experiments:</p><p>1) In-vitro clonogenic potential (Figure 2A)</p><p>2) In-vivo clonogenic potential (Figure 3A)</p><p>3) Restore clonogenic potential of GFP<sup>Low</sup> cells with MFCM and HGF in vitro (Figure 6D)</p><p>4) Restore clonogenic potential of GFP<sup>Low</sup> cells with MFCM and HGF in vivo (Figure 7E)</p><p>(Results obtained from Figures 2A and 3A are controls for 6D and 7E)</p><p>In addition to this, the authors propose to generate a single spheroidal culture. Given the heterogeneity of colorectal cancer I suggest they make at least three independent cultures. Vermeulen also confirmed the results in different spheroid cultures. Including more patients will make this replication effort more effective and the results more sound.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I am only commenting on the statistical part of this paper, Appendix A – Power Calculations.</p><p>1) For protocols 3 and 4, the authors proposed to compare means for multiple groups and do pairwise comparisons using Chi-square tests. There is no detail of the Chi-square test in the paper. As far as I know, the conventional tests for both scenarios are not a Chi-square test. The authors should provide the explicit test statistic they use as well as the assumptions of the test.</p><p>2) In Appendix A, under protocol 2, the variances of the two population distributions are not specified. Also, “the experiment will be performed with each of the 3 different TOP-GFP CSC cultures”. The multiple testing for the 3 scenarios is not addressed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article entitled “Registered report: Wnt activity defines colon cancer stem cells and is regulated by the microenvironment” for further consideration at <italic>eLife.</italic> Your revised Registered Report has been evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor).</p><p>Two of the three reviewers asked you to examine at least three colon cancer lines. You agreed to include one more, for a total of two. This is helpful, but at a minimum you should use three lines.</p><p>We are also disappointed that there are no in vivo tumorigenesis experiments, as indicated by Reviewer 2 (“the study should also replicate the in vivo clonogenic experiment described by Vermeulen in Figure 3A”). In vivo tumorigenesis experiments are the gold standard for drawing conclusions regarding cancer stem cells. The markers you plan to examine are controversial and of uncertain value, so no firm conclusions will be possible irrespective of what you observe with the markers. Nonetheless, if you add a third line to make the clonogenicity experiments in culture more robust, as indicated above, we would be prepared to move forward with acceptance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07301.003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The current manuscript provides a set-up to repeat experiments performed several years ago by my team.

It includes TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> and TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells without HGF or MFCM treatment, thus the control is built into the experimental design and is included as a planned comparison. This is also true of Figure 7E, which includes the TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> and TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells without MFCM, which is included in both figures 6D and 7E.

There were no inferential statistics used. However, the software originally used for the determining the clonal frequency is the extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA), which is the limdil function of the statmod package in R. This is the same test that will be used in the analysis of the replication results. The test can also be seen on the website of authors of the analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/index.html">http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/index.html</ext-link>). This approach uses the asymptotic Chi-square approximation to the log-ratio, which is applicable in these contexts as described in their paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hu and Smyth, 2009</xref>). We have updated the manuscript to make this clearer.</p><p><italic>2) In Appendix A, under protocol 2, the variances of the two population distributions are not specified.

This includes testing the in vivo clonogenic potential of the given clone (by comparing the TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> and TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> conditions, similar to Figure 3A), while also testing the clonogenic potential of GFP<sup>low</sup> cells with MFCM (restoring the clonogenic potential of GFP<sup>low</sup> cells).
