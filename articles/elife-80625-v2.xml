killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL), a very aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma yet with rather limited control strategies.

Treatment of ENKTL cells with LFS-1107 resulted in the nuclear retention of IkB<sub>α</sub> and consequent strong suppression of NF-κB transcriptional activities, NF-κB target genes downregulation and attenuated tumor cell growth and proliferation. Furthermore, LFS-1107 exhibited potent activities when administered to immunodeficient mice engrafted with human ENKTL cells.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Therefore, LFS-1107 holds great promise for the treatment of ENKTL and may warrant translation for use in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>Yang's laboratory was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant: 81874301), the Fundamental Research Funds for Central University (Grant: DUT22YG122) and the Key Research project of 'be Recruited and be in Command' in Liaoning Province (Personal Target Discovery for Metabolic Diseases).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>drug discovery</kwd><kwd>lymphoma</kwd><kwd>CRM1</kwd><kwd>ENKTL</kwd><kwd>sulforaphene</kwd><kwd>natural compounds</kwd><kwd>artificial intelligence </kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81874301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>He</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U20A20381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Caigang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82373063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Caigang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deep reinforcement model and experimental evaluations identified a small-molecule CRM1 inhibitor that can selectively ablate extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ENKTL represents as a rare yet highly aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Yamaguchi et al., 2018</xref>) with rather poor prognosis and short median survival time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>). Previously, we and colleagues uncovered that the overactivation of NF-κB signaling and its downstream cytokines is a key hallmark for the pathogenesis of ENKTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Wen et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, to date, targeted therapy towards ENKTL is still lacking and new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to combat this rare yet deadly tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Exportin-1, also known as CRM1, has been implicated in the aggressive behavior of various malignances by nuclear exporting critical tumor suppressor proteins and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, CRM1 has been found to be highly upregulated in a panel of tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Turner et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, it is believed that tumor cells strive to evade powerful negative regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation through CRM1-mediated nuclear export machinery. Previously, we reported that a natural and covalent CRM1 inhibitor sulforaphene and its synthetic analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Tian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Gao et al., 2021</xref>), can selectively kill a panel of tumor cells. Here, we presented the development and evaluation of a novel sulforaphene analogue as a potent CRM1 inhibitor with superior antitumor activities towards ENKTL while sparing human platelets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In this work, we want to find aromatic fragments that can be installed with sulforaphene parent structure as CRM1 inhibitors with strong potency. Previously, we developed a CRM1 inhibitor LFS-829 via traditional virtual screening and structure-based design approach. Herein, we strive to design a CRM1 inhibitor with strong potency against ENKTL cells through the recently developed AIDD (Artificial Intelligence Drug Discovery) approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chan et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, we adopted the deep reinforcement learning molecular de novo design model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Olivecrona et al., 2017</xref> to facilitate the discovery of novel aromatic fragments. This model prioritizes those structures with modest similarity to the molecules in the positive dataset of known CRM1 inhibitors rather than very close analogues. We obtained an initial output of 3,000 moiety structures and the top 50 candidate moieties generated from this step were used as seed structures to search for commercial-available aromatic fragments from Sigma-Aldrich compound library (similarity ~97%). Next, we selected and purchased 10 commercial-accessible aromatic fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) which were experimentally tested via biolayer interferometry assay (BLI). Among the ten experimentally tested fragments, tetrazole moieties (S5 and S8 fragment) obtained the second highest binding constant with CRM1 via BLI assay experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Yet, given that tetrazole fragments are more synthetic accessible as compared to the fragment with the highest binding constant (S4 moiety in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-N, N-dimethylaniline), the tetrazole moiety was chosen to install with sulforaphene parent structure. Subsequently, we prepared a synthetic analogue of sulforaphene with the tetrazole aromatic moiety, named as LFS-1107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which was further evaluated through cell lines and in vivo animal models.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The discovery of sulforaphene synthetic analogue LFS-1107.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The identification of ten commercial-accessible aromatic fragments aided by deep reinforcement learning model;

Here, we chose IkB<sub>α</sub> and Keap1 as two control probes to compare because both of them are reactive for covalent compounds and thereby frequently used for testing selectivity. Our BLI results revealed that LFS-1107 binds strongly with CRM1 (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>~1.25E-11 M, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) as compared to KPT-330 (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>~5.29E-09 M), a known CRM1 inhibitor approved by FDA. In contrast, LFS-1107 doesn’t bind with either two control probes IkB<sub>α</sub> or Keap1 in BLI assay experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, the results revealed that LFS-1107 is a reversible CRM1 inhibitor with clear dissociation process which may implicate a low toxicity profile. This is consistent with the results of our previous studies that sulforaphene synthetic analogues are reversible CRM1 inhibitors. Moreover, we used GSH/GSSG detection assay kit to show that the GSH:GSSG ratio keeps constant upon the treatment of LFS-1107 and therefore we ruled out the possibility that LFS-1107 is a general redox modulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Collectively, our results revealed that CRM1 is a major cellular target of LFS-1107 and responsible for its cellular activities.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>LFS-1107 strongly suppresses the growth of ENKTL cells acting through the nuclear retention of IkB<sub>α</sub> and subsequent attenuation of NF-κB signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Suppression of different human NK/T cell lymphoma cells; (<bold>B</bold>) GSH/GSSG ratio detection upon the treatment of LFS-1107; (<bold>C</bold>) The effect of LFS-1107 on normal PBMC cell lines; (<bold>D</bold>) The viability of platelets treated with LFS-1107; (<bold>E</bold>) Western blot result of the CRM1 with β-actin as loading control; (<bold>F</bold>) The cellular activities of LFS-1107 on siCRM1-293T and the wild-type 293T cell line with different concentrations of treatment for 48 h; (<bold>G</bold>) Nuclear retention of IκBα by confocal microscopy (Scale bar, 20 μM); (<bold>H</bold>) Quantification of the nuclear IΚB-α ratio by fluorescence intensity per cell (Data presented as mean ± SEM); (<bold>I</bold>) Representative western blots of p65, Cox-2, c-Myc, and Survivin; (<bold>J</bold>) Western blots showing the protein level of IκBα in nucleus and cytoplasm; (<bold>K</bold>) ELISA detection of cytokine production after treated with LFS-1107.

Our data show that LFS-1107 achieves IC<sub>50</sub> value of 26 nM in SNK6 cell line and 36 nM in HANK-1 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further study the selectivity of LFS-1107 towards ENKTL cells, we evaluated the toxicity of LFS-1107 in normal PBMCs isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, LFS-1107 barely showed any toxicity at concentration of 4 μM and the toxicity towards normal human PBMC is minimal even at a high dose of 9 μM. This implicates that LFS-1107 can selectively eliminate ENKTL cells while sparing normal human PBMC with good safety profile. Moreover, drug-induced toxicity towards platelets (also called as thrombocytopenia) is a common side effect in clinical trials for cancer therapeutics. We assessed the toxicity effects of LFS-1107 towards platelets and we found that LFS-1107 barely exhibits any effects on human platelets even at very high concentrations of 500 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, we want to investigate whether LFS-1107 could inhibit CRM1-mediated nuclear export of IκBα and reduce constitutive NF-κB activity in ENKTL cells. First, we demonstrated that LFS-1107 could suppress the expression of CRM1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We revealed that the cellular activities by LFS-1107 was significantly abrogated when CRM1 was knocked down by siCRM1, implicating that CRM1 is a main target responsible for the cellular activities of LFS-1107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Our immunofluorescent results by confocal microscopy revealed that LFS-1107 can lead to nuclear accumulation of IκB<sub>α</sub> after 3 hr treatment in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). Next, we employed Western blot to further confirm nuclear localization of IκB<sub>α</sub> upon the treatment of LFS-1107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). The results ascertained that IκB<sub>α</sub> was trapped in the nucleus as the protein level of nuclear IκB<sub>α</sub> was significantly upregulated after LFS-1107 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Moreover, it is well known that the constitutive activity of NF-κB/p65 was accompanied by the increased production of a few proinflammatory cytokines. Consequently, we found the expression of proinflammatory and proliferative proteins p65, COX-2, c-Myc, and Survivin were downregulated in a dose dependent manner after treatment with LFS-1107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Furthermore, when SNK6 cells were treated with LFS-1107, we observed a significant reduction of the proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IFN-γ, NF-κB/p65, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 as measured by ELISA assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Moreover, proteomics analysis suggests that Biological Process (regulation of cellular component organization) and Molecular Function (protein binding) related to CRM1 were modulated upon the treatment of LFS-1107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggested that the inhibition of CRM1 by LFS-1107 could lead to the downregulation of NF-κB transcriptional activity, proinflammatory cytokines and oncogenic signatures of ENKTL.</p><p>Lastly, we established a xenograft mouse model to test our findings by injecting SNK6 cells intraperitoneally into NCG mice. We found that LFS-1107 treatment (10 mg/kg/week) was able to extend mouse survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>) and eliminate tumor cells considerably as evidenced by flow cytometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D–E</xref>), demonstrating the efficacy of LFS-1107 in controlling ENKTL. Moreover, remarkably, mice injected with LFS-1107 reduced splenomegaly and restored spleen weight and spleen volume as compared with the normal group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>) with a better overall survival rate. Noteworthy, splenomegaly is a conventional symptom for extranodal natural NK/T cell lymphoma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Tse and Kwong, 2017</xref>). Hence, our results implicate that LFS-1107 can ameliorate the symptoms of ENKTL and might be a potentially promising compound for ENKTL treatment.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>LFS-1107 can ameliorate the symptoms of ENKTL in xenograft mouse model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the xenograft mouse model.

We demonstrated that treatment of LFS-1107 holds great promise as an effective remedy for ENKTL, acting through the nuclear retention of IkB<sub>α</sub> and subsequent attenuation of NF-κB signaling. We want to remind the reader that we don’t rule out the possibility that LFS-1107 may kill ENKTL cells via other mechanisms due to the broad-spectrum cargo proteins of CRM1. Yet, we want to argue that our study has captured the most prominent mechanism of actions for LFS-1107 towards ENKTL. Our study may represent a novel route for eliminating ENKTL tumor cells with a distinct mode of actions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

In brief, the deep reinforcement learning model consists of two main modules, the Design module (D) and the Evaluate module (E). The Design module (D) is used to produce novel chemical structures whereas the Evaluate module (E) is used to assess the feasibility and properties of the novel structures by assigning a numerical award or penalty to each new structure. The model employs the simple representation of chemical structures by the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings in both the Design module (D) and the Evaluate module (E). The Design module was first pre-trained with about ~2 million structures from the PubChem database to learn basic rules of organic chemistry that define SMILES strings within the context of Recurrent neural network (RNN). To check the validity of the approach, we used the module to generate about 0.2 million compounds which were assessed by the structure checker ChemAxon and 97% of the generated structures were chemical sensible structures. Finally, the deep reinforcement learning based molecular design model was able to design ~3000 chemical structures from which we chose the top 50 candidate moieties for further consideration. In this work, we want to find novel fragments that can be installed with sulforaphene parent structure as CRM1 inhibitors. Indeed, our model prioritizes those structures with modest similarity to the molecules in the positive dataset rather than very close analogues. We used the values of molecule descriptors and root mean square deviation (RMSD) calculated as the reward function in the reinforcement learning stage in the model. We obtained an initial output of 3,000 structures, which were then automatically filtered to remove molecules bearing structure alerts. The model prioritizes the synthetic feasibility of a small-molecule compound, and the distinctiveness of the compound from other molecules in the literatures and in the patent space. The top 50 candidate moieties generated from the previous step were used as seed structures to search for commercial-available aromatic fragments (similarity ~97%). Lastly, we purchased 10 commercial-available aromatic fragments which were experimentally tested via biolayer interferometry assay (BLI).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay</title><p>The Octet K2 system (Molecular Device, ForteBIO, USA) is suitable for the characterization of protein-protein or protein-ligand binding kinetics and binding affinity. The assay consists of the following steps: 1. Protein and BLI sensor preparation. The recombinant protein CRM1 (50 μg/mL) was biotinylated in the presence of biotin at room temperature (RT) for 1 hr. Then, the excess biotin was removed through spin desalting columns. The recombinant CRM1 protein was then immobilized on super streptavidin sensors (ForteBIO, USA). The sensors were then blocked, washed, and moved into wells containing various concentrations of the test compounds in kinetic buffer (ForteBIO); 2. BLI experimental process. Automated detection was performed using an Octet K2 (Molecular Devices ForteBIO, USA). Buffer was added to a 96-well plate, and the plate was transferred to the K2 instrument for analysis by running serially at 25 °C with a shaking speed of 1000 rpm. Baseline readings were obtained in buffer (120 s), associations in wells containing compound (180 s), and dissociation in buffer (180 s). The signals from the following buffer were detected over time. First, each of these concentrations was applied to four sets of experiments: (a) CRM1-immobilized sensor in drug-containing kinetics buffer; (b) Blanked-sensor in drug-containing kinetics buffer; (c) CRM1-immobilized sensor in PBS-kinetics buffer; and (d) Blanked-sensor in PBS-kinetics buffer. The final value was calculated using the equation: (a-c)–(b-d). This method removes interference from the sensor and drug-containing buffers. The binding signals were identified and the results were analyzed using the OctetHT V10.0 software.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>Cell viability assays were performed as previously described. Human lymphoma cell lines SNK6 and HANK-1 were seeded into 96-well plates and treated with LFS-1107 in concentrations of 0–800 nM for 72 hr. Cell viability was evaluated using the WST-8-based Cell Counting kit-8 (Beyotime), which was added to the wells and incubated for 3 hr. The absorbance of wells at 450 nm (reference wavelength 610 nm) was measured with a microplate reader (Infinite F50, Tecan).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Cytotoxicity assay</title><p>The Research Ethics Committee (REC) of Dalian University of Technology approved conduct of ex vivo assays with donated human cells (approval number: 2018–023). Normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from blood samples collected from healthy volunteers.

In fact, the training of the deep reinforcement learning molecule-generation model via ChEMBL library (~2 million compounds) took about 5-6 days on a regular GPU server in our lab. Next, the generation of seed structures (~10,000 structures) took about 3~4 hours. The manual inspection of the seed structures took about 3-4 days. Therefore, in total, it takes about two weeks for the whole design process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The cellular activities of KPT-330 for ENKTL cell lines are comparable with LFS<sup>-1</sup>107 (HANK1: IC<sub>50</sub>~36nM; SNK6: IC<sub>50</sub>~26nM;).

We fully agree with the referee that CRM1 have a spectrum of cargo proteins. Yet, we want to argue that our study captures the most prominent mechanism of actions for LFS<sup>-1</sup>107 towards ENKTL, that is, LFS<sup>-1</sup>107 treatment leads to the nuclear retention of IkBα and consequent strong suppression of NF-κB transcriptional activities.
