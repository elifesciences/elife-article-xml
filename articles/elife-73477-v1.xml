It is a site of diverse ophthalmologic diseases and it is a potential source of cells for ocular auto-transplantation. The present study provides foundational data on the mouse iris based on single nucleus RNA sequencing. More specifically, this work has (1) defined all of the major cell types in the mouse iris and ciliary body, (2) led to the discovery of two types of iris stromal cells and two types of iris sphincter cells, (3) revealed the differences in cell type-specific transcriptomes in the resting vs. dilated states, and (4) identified and validated antibody and in situ hybridization probes that can be used to visualize the major iris cell types. By immunostaining for specific iris cell types, we have observed and quantified distortions in nuclear morphology associated with iris dilation and clarified the neural crest contribution to the iris by showing that <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic>-expressing progenitors contribute to nearly all iris cell types, whereas <italic>Sox10-Cre</italic>-expressing progenitors contribute only to stromal cells. This work should be useful as a point of reference for investigations of iris development, disease, and pharmacology, for the isolation and propagation of defined iris cell types, and for iris cell engineering and transplantation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pupils</kwd><kwd>ocular structure</kwd><kwd>smooth muscle</kwd><kwd>single-cell sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using single nucleus RNA sequencing, a complete catalogue of cell types was determined for the mouse iris, and this information was used as a starting point to define the effects of pupil dilation on gene expression and on nuclear morphology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The iris, a thin disc of light-absorbing tissue with a central opening, is located in front of the lens and divides the eye into anterior and posterior chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Muscular contraction within the iris controls the diameter of the central opening – the pupil – to adjust the amount of light impinging on the retina. The iris has been an object of popular and scientific fascination for centuries, most likely as a consequence of its position as the principal target of gaze fixation in interpersonal encounters, the unconscious responses of the pupil to different psychological states, and the great diversity in iris appearance/pigmentation among humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duke-Elder and Wybar, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Larsen and Waters, 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single nucleus RNAseq (snRNAseq) defines the major cell types in the mouse iris.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic cross section of a mouse eye.

Under natural conditions, there are extended periods of pupil constriction, induced by sunlight during the day, alternating with extended periods of pupil dilation, induced by darkness at night. Pharmacologic dilation, produced by topical administration of an alpha-adrenergic agonist and/or a muscarinic antagonist, is widely used in the context of routine ophthalmologic exams and ocular surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paggiarino et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Motta et al., 2009</xref>). In response to constriction and dilation, several iris cell types exhibit striking changes in shape and in the arrangement of their plasma membranes and cytoskeletal fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lim and Webber, 1975a</xref>). At present, there are no known molecular correlates of these cellular responses.</p><p>We have undertaken the present study to provide foundational information for future investigations of iris structure, function, development, and disease. Our approach has been to define the transcriptome profiles of all of the major cell types of the mature murine iris by single nucleus (sn)RNAseq, to use those profiles to define the full repertoire of those cell types and the relationships among them, and to explore how the transcriptome changes within each iris cell type in response to pupil dilation or constriction. Using transcription factors as cell type-specific markers, we have also visualized the nuclear deformations that occur in response to pupil dilation and assessed the neural crest origin of different iris cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The major cell types of the mouse iris</title><p>The diversity of cell types in the iris – which includes muscle, epithelial, and stromal cells – suggested that homogenizing the iris and purifying nuclei might provide a more comprehensive and uniform sampling than would enzymatically dissociating the iris into single cells. Tissue homogenization has the added advantage that regulated RNA synthesis and degradation should largely cease upon cell disruption and dilution of the nuclei into homogenization buffer. By contrast, with enzymatic dissociation preparatory to single-cell (sc)RNAseq, transcriptome changes can be observed during the 30–60 min required for cell dissociation and processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lacar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hrvatin et al., 2018</xref>). A potential disadvantage of snRNAseq relative to scRNAseq is that it is insensitive to changes in RNA abundance arising from changes in RNA stability in the cytoplasm.</p><p>To prepare mouse iris and ciliary body samples for snRNAseq, nuclei were purified following: (1) continuous pupil dilation (mydriasis) for six and one-half hours with hourly 5% phenylephrine +1% cyclopentolate eye drops (two replicates), (2) continuous pupil constriction (miosis) for six and one-half hours with hourly 5% pilocarpine eye drops (three replicates), or (3) no treatment (three replicates). Six and one-half hours was chosen as the duration for dilation or constriction to provide sufficient time for any changes in gene expression to be fully manifest. snRNAseq data were obtained from a total of 34,357 nuclei (dilation: 11,027 nuclei; constriction: 8965 nuclei; no treatment: 14,365 nuclei) with a mean of 1760 transcripts detected per nucleus, using the 10× Genomics Chromium platform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The data were analyzed using the Seurat platform. Among independent replicates from mice subject to the same treatment, RNAseq read counts showed pairwise Pearson correlations of 0.98–0.99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, for all subsequent analyses, each set of replicate samples were merged into a single dataset. Female albino mice were used throughout this study to facilitate visualization of fluorescent antibody and in situ hybridization (ISH) probes.</p><p>Ten iris cell clusters were identified with Seurat, and their identities were subsequently assigned by immunostaining and ISH, as described below. A Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plot of the snRNAseq data revealed a distinctive distribution of the 10 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>): (1) a comma shape, consisting of the iris pigment epithelium (PE) and the adjacent and contiguous ciliary body epithelium (CBE), (2) a C-shaped arc in which dilator muscle connects to non-epithelial ciliary body cells on one side and sphincter muscle on the other side, (3) two widely separated clusters of stromal cells (referred to as stroma 1 and stroma 2), and (4) small clusters of leukocytes and endothelial cells. UMAP plots are well matched across treatment conditions and independent replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), with the only visually apparent difference being a small shift in the location of the dilator muscle cell cluster upon pupil dilation.</p><p>Some cluster identities could be inferred based on existing physiologic data. For example, classic pharmacologic studies have shown that the dilator muscle is responsive to alpha-adrenergic agonists and the sphincter muscle is responsive to muscarinic agonists. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, transcripts coding for the alpha-1A adrenergic receptor (<italic>Adra1a</italic>) are enriched in the dilator cluster, and transcripts coding for muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 3 (<italic>Chrm3</italic>) are enriched in the sphincter cluster. Interestingly, the sub-cluster of sphincter cells closest to the dilator cluster (referred to as the ‘sphincter 2’ cluster) contains both transcripts. Other transcripts that show high cluster specificity include transcription factors <italic>Sox10</italic> (stroma 1), <italic>Tfap2b</italic> (stroma 2), and <italic>Zic1</italic> (epithelial cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Transcripts coding for the gigantic muscle protein titin (<italic>Ttn</italic>) are restricted to the most distal sub-cluster of sphincter cells (referred to as the ‘sphincter 1’ cluster).</p><p>The distinctions between clusters rest on differences in the expression of multiple genes, a small fraction of which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). That the stroma 1 vs. stroma 2 and the sphincter 1 vs. sphincter 2 distinctions reflect transcriptome differences substantially larger than the differences associated with sample-to-sample variability is apparent in comparing scatter plots of snRNAseq read counts for these pairwise comparisons (from untreated irises) to scatter plots for each cluster from untreated vs. constricted irises (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). [There is almost no effect of pharmacologic constriction on iris gene expression, as described more fully below.] <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> also shows a scatter plot comparison of dilator vs. sphincter muscles (i.e., sphincter 1 and sphincter 2 clusters combined), showing that the scatter in the cross-cluster comparison is far greater than for the intra-cluster comparisons. These data indicate that the mouse iris contains two distinct types of stromal cells and three distinct types of smooth muscle cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Differences between dilator and sphincter muscles</title><p>A subset of markers that distinguish the different classes of iris smooth muscle cells were investigated by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Smooth muscle actin (SMA, the product of the <italic>Acta2</italic> gene) is expressed in all three classes of smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D and F–H</xref>). In iris cross sections, the strands of dilator muscle typically weave in and out of the plane of section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–G</xref>), as inferred from SMA immunostaining of iris flat mounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

This region coincides with the region of circumferential muscle fibers visualized by SMA immunostaining, implying that sphincter 1 and sphincter 2 cells are intermingled with each other within the mass of sphincter muscle fibers. Nitric oxide synthase-1 (<italic>Nos1</italic>), the NOS isoform enriched in the nervous system and skeletal muscle, is specifically expressed in dilator muscle and localizes in a pattern reciprocal to that of CKM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Immunostaining for markers that distinguish sphincter and dilator muscles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dot plot (as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) showing transcript abundances across a subset of iris cell types for transcripts coding for the markers shown in (<bold>B–H</bold>). <italic>Rbfox3</italic> codes for NEUN.

Titin, the largest member of the mammalian proteome (~27,000 to ~35,000 amino acids, depending on the splice isoform) connects the Z-disk to the M-band in striated muscle and appears to act as an elastic element, responding to muscle tension by progressively unfolding its many small domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chauveau et al., 2014</xref>). A similar elastic role in the sphincter 1 cells appears plausible in light of the 4-fold change in pupil diameter – and, hence, sphincter muscle length – with dilation and constriction. Why Titin would not similarly be required in dilator muscle is unclear. The localization of CTNNA3 to sphincter 1 cells represents a second structural/cytoskeletal distinction between sphincter and dilator muscle. Alpha-catenins heterodimerize with beta-catenins at adherins junctions and they regulate actin filament assembly, coordinating junctional and cytoskeletal architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Takeichi, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The localization to sphincter cells of NeuN, neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin-2 (NPTX2), and synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1) – all of which are enriched in the nervous system – suggests that gene expression in sphincter cells has a partially neuronal character. NeuN/RBFOX3 is an RNA-binding protein that regulates differential pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duan et al., 2016</xref>). NPTX2 (formerly NARP), the product of a neuronal immediate-early gene, is an extracellular protein that enhances neurite outgrowth, clusters AMPA receptors, and promotes synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tsui et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O’Brien et al., 1999</xref>). SYT1 promotes calcium-triggered synaptic vesicle fusion by arresting the SNARE complex in the pre-fusion state under low calcium conditions and then allowing the SNARE complex to ‘zipper up’ its alpha helices and promote membrane fusion in high calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The cell-type-specific transcriptomes derived from snRNAseq provide an opportunity to systematically assess signal transduction components that regulate iris smooth muscle function. In amphibia, birds, fish, and non-primate mammals, pupil diameter is controlled both by a retina-brainstem-sympathetic/parasympathetic-iris smooth muscle circuit and by the intrinsic light sensitivity of the iris musculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Douglas, 2018</xref>). Studies of knockout mice show that the intrinsic pathway is mediated by the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) photopigment melanopsin (OPN4) via activation of phospholipase C-beta2 and beta4 (PLCB2 and PLCB4) and calcium release by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).

We have (1) used snRNAseq to define all of the major cell types in the mouse iris, which has led to the discovery of two types of stromal cells and two types of sphincter cells; (2) validated a series of molecular markers that can be used to visualize each of the major iris cell types; (3) identified transcriptome changes and distortions in nuclear morphology associated with iris dilation; and (4) clarified the neural crest contribution to the iris by showing that <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic>-expressing progenitors contribute to nearly all iris cell types, whereas <italic>Sox10-Cre</italic>-expressing progenitors contribute only to stromal cells. As described more fully below, this work should be useful as a point of reference for investigations of iris development, disease, and pharmacology, for the isolation and propagation of defined iris cell types, and for iris cell engineering and transplantation. Going forward, it will be of interest to obtain and compare similar snRNAseq data from the irises of other species, most especially from humans.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Iris cell types</title><p>The present work defines the molecular heterogeneity among different classes of iris smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle cells are present in multiple organs and they control a wide range of physiological functions, including vascular tone, airway resistance, gastrointestinal (GI) motility, and pupil diameter. In contrast to the unitary mode of skeletal muscle excitation – quantal release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction leading to activation of postsynaptic nicotinic receptors and depolarization of the muscle membrane – smooth muscle activation and inhibition involve multiple classes of GPCRs that activate or inhibit calcium mobilization and protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kuo and Ehrlich, 2015</xref>). The comprehensive determination of the abundances of transcripts for all known receptors, channels, and signaling components for sphincter 1, sphincter 2, and dilator muscles constrains the possible ligand-receptor systems that control contraction and relaxation in each of these muscle types.</p><p>The iris PE cell transcriptome provides a foundation for strategies to genetically engineer these cells and monitor their state of trans-differentiation in cell culture. Over the past 30 years, the iris PE has been studied as a potential source of cells for autologous transplantation to replace dying or dysfunctional retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in individuals with age-related macular degeneration. These studies were motivated by the surgical accessibility of human iris PE cells, which can be harvested from a small iridectomy sample and expanded in culture, and by earlier work showing that the iris PE in non-mammalian vertebrates can transdifferentiate into other ocular cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sun et al., 2006</xref>). In three clinical trials of sub-retinal transplantation of iris PE in age-related macular degeneration patients, there have been minimal complications but also minimal effect on the clinical course of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lappas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aisenbrey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2007</xref>). The failure to significantly alter disease progression is likely referable to the failure of the transplanted iris PE cells to acquire the phagocytic and other properties of RPE cells, a deficiency that might be remedied if iris PE cells can be genetically engineered to trans-differentiate toward an RPE fate.</p><p>The identification of two types of iris stromal cells adds to a growing literature on molecular diversity among fibroblasts and stromal cells that has emerged from single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guerrero-Juarez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeSisto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biffi and Tuveson, 2021</xref>). One extension of the present study will be to define the responses of stroma 1 and stroma 2 cells to inflammation.

Going forward, it will be of interest to assess pupil function and to look for genetic variation in smooth muscle genes in individuals with less severe defects in GI motility, bladder emptying, uterine contraction, and other smooth muscle functions.</p><p>The release into the aqueous humor of excessive quantities of cellular material, including pigment granules, from the iris PE is the hallmark of pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Niyadurupola and Broadway, 2008</xref>). If sufficient quantities of this material become trapped in the trabecular meshwork, the ocular drainage structure, the resulting rise in intraocular pressure can lead to a subtype of open angle glaucoma referred to as pigmentary glaucoma (PG). PDS is associated with increased contact between the iris and lens, which may predispose to pigment release secondary to mechanical trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aptel et al., 2011</xref>). In mice, mutations in melanosomal genes lead to PDS, PG, and a related disorder, iris stromal atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). In humans, PDS also has a genetic component, but the contributing genes are still largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tandon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van der Heide et al., 2021</xref>). A conceptually similar disorder, exfoliation syndrome, is characterized by impaired pupil constriction and by the release of extracellular matrix material from the iris and lens, which accumulates in the trabecular meshwork and can lead to open angle glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kivelä, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schlötzer-Schrehardt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tekin et al., 2020</xref>).

Transcription factors PITX2 and FOXC1 are required for normal migration of peri-ocular mesenchyme cells, and mutations in <italic>PITX2</italic> or <italic>FOXC1</italic> produce (1) hypoplasia of the iris stroma, holes in the iris, and an eccentric position of the pupil (Rieger anomaly), and/or (2) strands of ectopic tissue in the space between iris and cornea (Axenfeld anomaly). Iris development is also sensitive to reductions in <italic>PAX6</italic> activity, with phenotypes ranging from mild iris hypoplasia to complete aniridia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hingorani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cvekl and Callaerts, 2017</xref>).</p><p>An important iatrogenic disorder, intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS), occurs during ~2% of cataract surgeries and is a risk factor for surgical complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Enright et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christou et al., 2020</xref>). IFIS is characterized by pupil constriction, a flacid and billowing iris, and prolapse of the iris through the surgical incision. IFIS is strongly linked to prior or ongoing systemic treatment with alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonists, most commonly for benign prostatic hypertrophy, which presumably leads to long-term changes in iris smooth muscle physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Gene expression and morphologic responses to dilation</title><p>The asymmetry in gene expression responses, in which an iris with a dilated pupil differs from an untreated iris but an iris with a constricted pupil is nearly identical to an untreated iris, most likely reflects the tissue compression associated with pupil dilation, as seen in the zig-zagging morphology of blood vessels and nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the flattening of nuclear shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and the membrane infoldings demonstrated in ultrastructural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lim and Webber, 1975a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lim and Webber, 1975b</xref>).

Extrapolating from the observations reported here to the human iris, it seems plausible that iris gene expression changes might also accompany the pharmacologic pupil dilation associated with routine ophthalmoscopic examinations of the human retina.</p><p>Nuclear elongation in response to dilation is most apparent in non-muscle cells, where nuclei in the resting and constricted states are minimally elongated.

Changes in the force exerted on the nucleus lead to (1) changes in transcription factor localization, as seen for YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elosegui-Artola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kassianidou et al., 2019</xref>), (2) chromatin reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miroshnikova et al., 2017</xref>), (3) direct and indirect changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tajik et al., 2016</xref>), and (4) changes in cytoskeletal organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoffman et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The optical accessibility of the iris offers a unique opportunity to extend the study of nuclear mechanobiology by imaging of nuclear dynamics and signal transduction in an intact tissue. For example, with the appropriate promoters and transgenes, stroma 1 or stroma 2 nuclei could be selectively visualized with a nuclear-localized far-red fluorescent protein to observe how their shapes change as the iris dilates and constricts in vivo or ex vivo. Reporters for other cellular structures (e.g., cytoskeleton) or molecules (e.g., calcium) could be similarly imaged in a cell-type-specific manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The following mouse lines were used: <italic>Wnt1-Cre2</italic> (JAX 022501; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Sox10-Cre</italic> (JAX 025807; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matsuoka et al., 2005</xref>), and <italic>R26-LSL-tdTomato-2A-H2B-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

The following probes from Advanced Cell Diagnostics were used: Mm-Myh11-C1 (316101); Mm-Adra1a (408611-C2); Mm-Chrm3-C1 (437701); Mm-Chrm3-C2 (437701-C2); Mm-Nos1-C3 (437651-C3); Mm-Syt1-C2 (491831-C2); Mm-Ttn-C1 (483031); Mm-Slc26a4-C1 (452491); Mm-Tmem158-C3 (452721-C3); Mm-Btg2-C1 (483001); Mm-Anks1b-O1-C3 (577781-C3); Mm-Ntng1-C3 (488871-C3); Mm-Sntg1-C1 (440561); Mm-Pde10a-C1 (466201); and Mm-Junb-C1 (556651).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>Confocal images were captured with a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope (40× objective) using Zen Black 2012 software, and processed with ImageJ, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Quantification of fluorescent RNAscope ISH signals (proportional to transcript abundances) was performed according to guidelines from Advanced Cell Diagnostics. Briefly, representative regions were selected on slides containing no RNAscope signal and the total integrated signal intensity was measured to provide an estimate of background intensity. The average background intensity was calculated as the integrated intensity divided by the area of the selected background region.</p><p>For each probe, 20 representative ISH signals (single ‘dots’) were chosen and the area and integrated intensity of each dot was determined to calculate the average intensity per dot with the following formula:</p><p>Average intensity per single dot = {(Total integrated intensity of selected dots) – [(Average background intensity)× Total area of selected dots]}/(Number of selected dots). The regions of interest (ROIs) were selected in the iris cross section slides, and the total ROI area was calculated and the total integrated intensity was measured. Using the average background intensity and the average intensity for each dot, the total number of dots in the ROI was estimated with the following formula: Total dot number in ROI = {(Total integrated intensity of ROI) – [(Average background intensity)× Total area of ROI]}/(Average intensity per single dot).</p><p>For each sample, the cross section of the iris was divided into two to three ROIs and the number of dots was estimated as described above for each ROI. To normalize for ISH efficiency in each section, the relative abundance of each transcript in each ROI was calculated as the ratio of the number of dots for that transcript divided by the number of dots for <italic>Adra1a</italic> (for dilator muscle analyses) or by the number of dots for <italic>Chrm3</italic> or <italic>Syt1</italic> (for sphincter muscle analyses).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantifying nuclear morphology</title><p>Nuclear length and width were measured using Fiji-ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/software/fiji/">https://imagej.net/software/fiji/</ext-link>) from captured Z-stacked whole mount iris images. The longest dimension of each nucleus was measured and designated as the length, and the width was designated as the largest nuclear width when measured perpendicular to the length. For each condition and for each cell type, 150–500 nuclei were measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical values are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical tests were carried out using GraphPad Prism 8. Student’s t-test was used to measure significance of differences between two independent groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with appropriate multiple comparisons tests was used to compare three independent groups. The statistical significance is represented graphically as *p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001; ****p &lt; 0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mice were housed and handled according to the approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Lois Smith as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bo Chen (Reviewer #2); Chenxi Qiu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) 10x platform was used in this study. The authors need to include: 1) If all the samples were collected in a single round of experiment on the same day. If not, how the batch effect was minimized. 2) For the three groups (untreated, dilated, constricted) of samples, what steps were used to minimize the potential transcriptional change and variation during the sample preparation. 3) How long after dilation or constriction were the sample taken?</p><p>2) Although only 6-8-week old female mice were used for single cell analysis, were the validation also conducted in male mice?</p><p>3) Does the duration of pupil dilation and constriction affect the transcriptome analysis? How did the authors choose seven hours as the duration for the dilation and constriction, any preparatory analysis to determine this time point?</p><p>4) Some missing labeling in the text, including Figure 2A, Figure 3A, and Figure 7A.</p><p>5) Could the authors provide some thoughts on why only dilation has effects on the gene expression changes, but not constriction? Some discussion on this might be helpful. No experimental proof required.</p><p>6) The methodological details for the differential gene expression analyses are not discussed in the manuscript. In addition, the authors should provide the full list of differentially expressed genes instead of top 25 genes and discuss the cutoff of differentially expressed genes where they are confident. The adjusted p-values for the top differentially expressed genes are small and may not provide true value into the analyses.</p><p>7) The figure legends could have more details on the replicates shown on the quantitation of immunofluorescence images. Example1 : In figure 8, I am assuming each dot here represents one nucleus. How many mice are in this plot? Is there systematic variation among different mice? It would help if the authors color code the data points by the mouse each nucleus is from. Example2: In supplemental figure 4, is each data point here is from one mouse or one image for a given area, and how many mice were used.</p><p>8) The choice of snRNA-seq over single-cell RNA-seq is well justified, as uniform sampling of diverse cell types is more critical for defining major cell types. However, the authors should discuss limitations of snRNA-seq in case future studies are built upon this work. For example, in cases where cells are enzymatically digestible and cytoplasmic mRNAs are of interests, scRNA-seq is a more relevant approach. It's also worth noting that the snRNA-seq approach in this work could still provide a roadmap for future scRNA-seq analyses.</p><p>9) The library preparation method should be expanded. The authors cited the 10X Genomics Chromium single cell 3' v3 kit, which may not be sufficient. Different RNA species are largely sensitive to the library preparation methods, especially for snRNA-seq. This is an essential section in the methods section that needs to be expanded.</p><p>10) In the differential gene expression analyses, is each cell treated as a replicate? If so how did the authors account for the biological replicates from different mice? How did the authors account for the dissection variation among different mice? Was there any quality controls done among different mice in the same group in terms of dissection variation?</p><p>11) Dotplots in the supplemental figure 3 lacks statistical tests and could be sometimes misleading, as the color of each dot is Z-score normalized if performed using the default setting of Seurat and could unnecessarily exaggerate an effect. The readers will benefit from some indication of adjusted p-values on the figure (e.g. asterisks). However, the authors should first clarify how different gene expression analyses were done. It would be helpful to show how a small effect size as validated in supplemental figure 4 could have so much statistical confidence as shown in the supplemental table 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study establishes fundamental information on the mouse iris and its function. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing, the authors have characterized all major cell types in the mouse iris and ciliary body, defined two types of iris stromal cells and two types of iris sphincter cells, and shown cell-specific transcriptome responses in the resting, constricted, and dilated states. They have identified and validated antibody and in situ hybridization probes for visualization of the major iris cell types. They have quantified distortions in nuclear morphology associated with iris dilation and clarified the neural crest contribution to the iris by showing that Wnt1-Cre-expressing progenitors contribute to nearly all iris cell types, whereas Sox10-Cre expressing progenitors contribute only to stromal cells. This work will be a valuable reference for investigations of iris development, disease, and pharmacology, for the isolation and propagation of defined iris cell types, and for iris cell engineering and transplantation.</p><p>This paper was a pleasure to read. It is well written, thorough, and will provide tools to study the iris and ciliary body for the research community. I had no major concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Major strengths of the manuscript:</p><p>1) Using single nucleus RNA sequencing technology had several advantages over single cell RNA sequencing with minimum disturbance of the native transcriptional profiles.</p><p>2) This research revealed major cell types in the mouse iris and provided valuable and verifiable markers for each of the iris cell types. This research generated great resources for future studies on normal and diseased irises.</p><p>3) The study showed very interesting changes in the transcriptome and nuclear morphology associated with iris dilation, and the most upregulated genes identified could be great candidates for studying iris function and malfunction in diseases.</p><p>4) The study provided definitive experimental proof showing the neural crest contribution to the various iris cell types.</p><p>Overall, the study was well designed and precisely executed, the data analysis was clear and scientifically stringent, the results are comprehensive and revealing novel molecular correlates of cellular responses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This work defines the mouse iris transcriptomic atlas by single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), an approach that captures nuclear transcripts without enzymatic cell dissociation and processing. The major cell types defined/revealed are independently and rigorously validated by immunofluorescence and fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Immunofluorescence and fluorescence in-situ hybridization experiments further confirmed distinction between sphincter and dilator muscles and revealed distinct distribution of subtypes of sphincter and stromal cells. More importantly, the snRNA-seq approach they have undertaken, though only capturing the nuclear transcripts, is sufficient to profile the transcriptomic changes during constriction and dilation, and some of the expression changes were confirmed by immunofluorescence. The identification of transcription factors associated with defined cell types also allows tests of an unexplored question- does nuclear morphology change along with known changes in the cell plasma during dilation? The authors assessed the nuclear morphology of each cell type by immunofluorescence of cell-type specific transcription factors they identified from snRNA-seq in this study, and found cell-type specific changes of nuclear morphology during dilation. Finally, the authors revisited a partially conflicting result on the neural crest cells contribution to iris cell types, with characterized transcription factors in this study to increase resolution.</p><p>Overall, this is a rigorous study and could have broad interests. This version of manuscript could benefit from more details in statistics and methodology in some analyses. Despite the insufficient technical/statistical details in some figures, the authors' major claims and the identified sub-celltypes are justified by their data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73477.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) 10x platform was used in this study.

For the revised manuscript we performed a time course of dilation (30 minutes, 90 minutes, and 150 minutes) and analyzed the response by immunostaining for EGR1. Interestingly, EGR1 induction is already present at 30 minutes. This has now been added to Figure 7 as a new panel D. Since there were no transcriptome changes with 6.5 hours of constriction, we did not explore shorter constriction times.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How did the authors choose seven hours as the duration for the dilation and constriction, any preparatory analysis to determine this time point?</p></disp-quote><p>Six and one-half hours was chosen as the duration for constriction and dilation because we hypothesized that this would provide a sufficiently long time to allow for changes in gene expression to be manifest. This estimate was based on other physiologic responses in mammals and mammalian cells in culture, such as responses to growth factors, metabolic perturbations, etc, which are generally maximal within several hours of onset. This is now clarified in the Results section with the sentence “Six and one-half hours was chosen as the duration for dilation or constriction to provide sufficient time for any changes in gene expression to be fully manifest.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some missing labeling in the text, including Figure 2A, Figure 3A, and Figure 7A.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noting this. In each of these instances, we had referred to the entire figure. In the revised manuscript, we now refer to each panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Could the authors provide some thoughts on why only dilation has effects on the gene expression changes, but not constriction? Some discussion on this might be helpful. No experimental proof required.</p></disp-quote><p>The iris is like an accordion or a set of pleated window shades – when the pupil dilates, the iris tissue is compressed, with blood vessels and nerves zig-zagging back and forth (Figure 6B (formerly 6A)), nuclei flattening (Figure 8), and plasma membranes of the epithelia folding to create a bumpy surface (Lim and Webber, 1975). By contrast, constriction flattens out the iris. The untreated iris is in-between these extremes (see the new images in Figure 6A). Our guess is that the gene expression changes with dilation reflect the cell biologic distortions associated with tissue compression. We have added the following text to the last section of the Discussion:</p><p>“The asymmetry in gene expression responses, in which an iris with a dilated pupil differs from an untreated iris but an iris with a constricted pupil is nearly identical to an untreated iris, most likely reflects the tissue compression associated with pupil dilation, as seen in the zig-zagging morphology of blood vessels and nerves (Figure 6B), the flattening of nuclear shape (Figure 8), and the membrane infoldings demonstrated in ultrastructural studies (Lim and Webber, 1975a, 1975b). By contrast, with pupil constriction, the iris is flattened to an even greater extent than it is in the untreated (resting) state.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The methodological details for the differential gene expression analyses are not discussed in the manuscript. In addition, the authors should provide the full list of differentially expressed genes instead of top 25 genes and discuss the cutoff of differentially expressed genes where they are confident. The adjusted p-values for the top differentially expressed genes are small and may not provide true value into the analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for that comment. In the revised manuscript, we have expanded the Methods section “Analysis of snRNAseq data” to flesh this out. We have also changed our analysis of differential transcripts between dilated and untreated irises by applying a defined threshold (fold change greater than log2=0.6 and P-value less than 0.05). These threshold criteria are illustrated in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and applied to the updated Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Supplemental Table 3. For the endothelial cell population, no transcripts passed this threshold, and therefore Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 2 and Supplemental Table 3 list only the other nine cell types. Re: adjusted P-values. Because snRNAseq and scRNAseq calculate read-count statistics with each nucleus or cell as an independent data point and because the evaluation is based on a data set with several hundred million reads, even small fold-changes tend to be associated with very small adjusted Pvalues (Bonferroni corrected). Depending how you look at it, this is either a strength or a weakness of single cell statistical analysis. From a purely statistical point of view, it is a strength because this is an objective analysis of the data. On the other hand, from the point of view of the reader trying to get an intuitive grasp of what the Pvalue means, it requires a recalibration from our customary familiarity with small sample sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The figure legends could have more details on the replicates shown on the quantitation of immunofluorescence images. Example1 : In figure 8, I am assuming each dot here represents one nucleus. How many mice are in this plot? Is there systematic variation among different mice? It would help if the authors color code the data points by the mouse each nucleus is from. Example2: In supplemental figure 4, is each data point here is from one mouse or one image for a given area, and how many mice were used.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for that comment. We have expanded the legend of Figure 2 (the first figure to show immunostaining) with the following sentence:</p><p>“For each immunostaining analysis in this and subsequent figures, iris cross-sections were stained from at least five mice and iris whole mounts were stained from at least two mice.”</p><p>We have expanded the legend of Figure 3 (the first figure to show in situ hybridization) with the following sentence:</p><p>“For each in situ hybridization analysis in this and subsequent figures, iris cross-sections were hybridized from at least three mice.”</p><p>In figure 8, each dot represents one nucleus. To assess systematic variation between mice, we have plotted the data for individual mice in a new Figure 8—figure supplement 1, which shows that the distribution of nuclear length/width ratios for individual mice are consistent within each of the three conditions (constricted, dilated, and untreated) and are also consistent with the aggregate data presented in Figure 8. In Figure 7—figure supplement 1 (formerly named Supplemental Figure 4), we now explain in the figure legend “Each data point is derived from a single image and represents approximately one-quarter of the iris cross-sectional area from pupil to periphery. For each condition and probe, 3-4 mice were analyzed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The choice of snRNA-seq over single-cell RNA-seq is well justified, as uniform sampling of diverse cell types is more critical for defining major cell types. However, the authors should discuss limitations of snRNA-seq in case future studies are built upon this work. For example, in cases where cells are enzymatically digestible and cytoplasmic mRNAs are of interests, scRNA-seq is a more relevant approach. It's also worth noting that the snRNA-seq approach in this work could still provide a roadmap for future scRNA-seq analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for that comment – we agree. We have added the following statement to the beginning of the Results section:</p><p>“A potential disadvantage of snRNAseq relative to scRNAseq is that it is insensitive to changes in RNA abundance arising from changes in RNA stability in the cytoplasm.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The library preparation method should be expanded. The authors cited the 10X Genomics Chromium single cell 3' v3 kit, which may not be sufficient. Different RNA species are largely sensitive to the library preparation methods, especially for snRNA-seq. This is an essential section in the methods section that needs to be expanded.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the 10X genomics V3 protocol, which is unfortunately not published in a peer-reviewed journal, but is available as a pdf download from the 10X Genomics web site. We now cite that web site and make it clear that we are following that protocol. “snRNAseq libraries were constructed using the 10X Genomics Chromium single cell 3’ v3 kit and following the manufacturer’s protocol (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cellgene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry).” This non-transparency issue permeates the field since virtually everyone is using kits – many with proprietary reagents – for Nextgen sample analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In the differential gene expression analyses, is each cell treated as a replicate?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, each cell’s RNAseq read counts are an independent data point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If so how did the authors account for the biological replicates from different mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following statement to the Results section and added Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2 to illustrate the point:</p><p>“Among independent replicates from mice subject to the same treatment, RNAseq read counts showed pairwise Pearson correlations of 0.98-0.99 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Therefore, for all subsequent analyses, each set of replicate samples were merged into a single data set.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How did the authors account for the dissection variation among different mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following to the methods section:</p><p>“Subsequent snRNAseq nucleus counts show that the percent of cells derived from CB and CBE to be tightly correlated within each sample (R<sup>2</sup>=0.9) and together they vary from 3% to 15% of the total cell number – presumably reflecting variable inclusion of the ciliary body as a result of variability in cutting around the margin of the iris. Nucleus counts for other cell types, which are intrinsic to the iris, showed less variation between samples.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was there any quality controls done among different mice in the same group in terms of dissection variation?</p></disp-quote><p>No, we simply pooled 5-6 irises per snRNAseq run and figured that the variation in cutting around the margins of the iris would average out. This turned out to be roughly correct, as judged by the inclusion in every data set of ciliary body tissue – which resides just beyond the iris.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Dotplots in the supplemental figure 3 lacks statistical tests and could be sometimes misleading, as the color of each dot is Z-score normalized if performed using the default setting of Seurat and could unnecessarily exaggerate an effect. The readers will benefit from some indication of adjusted p-values on the figure (e.g. asterisks). However, the authors should first clarify how different gene expression analyses were done. It would be helpful to show how a small effect size as validated in supplemental figure 4 could have so much statistical confidence as shown in the supplemental table 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have fleshed out this issue by producing a new supplemental figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 2) that shows volcano plots with a label for each transcript shown in the dot plot in supplemental figure 3 (now re-named Figure 6—figure supplement 1). As discussed in the reply to comment 6 above, the statistical analysis of scRNAseq takes some recalibrating on the part of the reader. “Because snRNAseq and scRNAseq calculate read-count statistics with each nucleus or cell as an independent data point and because the evaluation is based on a data set with several hundred million reads, even small fold-changes tend to be associated with very small adjusted P-values (Bonferroni corrected). Depending how you look at it, this is either a strength or a weakness of single cell statistical analysis. From a purely statistical point of view, it is a strength because this is an objective analysis of the data. On the other hand, from the point of view of the reader trying to get an intuitive grasp of what the P-value means, it requires a recalibration from our customary familiarity with small sample sizes.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
