Here we systematically assessed the expression and function of <italic>Angiopoietin-1</italic> (<italic>Angpt1</italic>) in bone marrow. <italic>Angpt1</italic> was not expressed by osteoblasts. <italic>Angpt1</italic> was most highly expressed by HSCs, and at lower levels by c-kit<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors, megakaryocytes, and Leptin Receptor<sup>+</sup> (LepR<sup>+</sup>) stromal cells. Global conditional deletion of <italic>Angpt1</italic>, or deletion from osteoblasts, LepR<italic>+</italic> cells, <italic>Nes-cre</italic>-expressing cells, megakaryocytes, endothelial cells or hematopoietic cells in normal mice did not affect hematopoiesis, HSC maintenance, or HSC quiescence. Deletion of <italic>Angpt1</italic> from hematopoietic cells and LepR<sup>+</sup> cells had little effect on vasculature or HSC frequency under steady-state conditions but accelerated vascular and hematopoietic recovery after irradiation while increasing vascular leakiness. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and LepR<sup>+</sup> stromal cells regulate niche regeneration by secreting Angpt1, reducing vascular leakiness but slowing niche recovery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>hematopoietic</kwd><kwd>Angiopoietin-1</kwd><kwd>niche</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>vascular</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><back><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf2"><p>Sean J Morrison, Senior editor, eLife.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The other authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
