Two systems are known to be critical in this regulation: mitochondrial matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>) and blood flow that is tuned by local cardiomyocyte metabolic signaling. However, these two regulatory systems do not fully account for the physiological range of ATP consumption observed. We report here on the identity, location, and signaling cascade of a third regulatory system -- CO<sub>2</sub>/bicarbonate. CO<sub>2</sub> is generated in the mitochondrial matrix as a metabolic waste product of the oxidation of nutrients. It is a lipid soluble gas that rapidly permeates the inner mitochondrial membrane and produces bicarbonate in a reaction accelerated by carbonic anhydrase. The bicarbonate level is tracked physiologically by a bicarbonate-activated soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). Using structural Airyscan super-resolution imaging and functional measurements we find that sAC is primarily inside the mitochondria of ventricular cardiomyocytes where it generates cAMP when activated by bicarbonate. Our data strongly suggest that ATP production in these mitochondria is regulated by this cAMP signaling cascade operating within the inter-membrane space by activating local EPAC1 (<bold>E</bold>xchange <bold>P</bold>rotein directly <bold>A</bold>ctivated by <bold>c</bold>AMP) which turns on Rap1 (Ras-related protein-1). Thus, mitochondrial ATP production is increased by bicarbonate-triggered sAC-signaling through Rap1. Additional evidence is presented indicating that the cAMP signaling itself does not occur directly in the matrix. We also show that this third signaling process involving bicarbonate and sAC activates the mitochondrial ATP production machinery by working independently of, yet in conjunction with, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>-dependent ATP production to meet the energy needs of cellular activity in both health and disease. We propose that the bicarbonate and calcium signaling arms function in a resonant or complementary manner to match mitochondrial ATP production to the full range of energy consumption in ventricular cardiomyocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial ATP production</kwd><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>ventricular myocytes</kwd><kwd>cAMP</kwd><kwd>soluble adenylyl

the blood flow needs of the body, with the heart consuming ATP at high and widely variable rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">From et

Because of the everchanging energy needs of the ventricular myocytes and their minimal ATP reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jacobus, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), ATP production must be dynamically managed by a control system that has high gain and is rapidly responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maack and O’Rourke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murphy and Steenbergen, 2021</xref>). Recent work has shown that heart rate-dependent elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling drives the ventricular myocytes to contract more frequently while elevating the mitochondrial matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>) and thereby increasing ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wescott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garg et al., 2021</xref>). The energetic needs of ventricular myocytes are also linked to local blood supply through the newly described ‘electro-metabolic signaling (EMS)’. Through this mechanism, as [ATP] in ventricular myocytes falls with ATP consumption, small blood vessels dilate to increase local blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grainger and Santana, 2020</xref>). EMS thereby will increase the supply of oxygen and nutrient substrates and speed up removal of metabolic waste products by increased flow through local end-arterioles and capillaries. Together, EMS and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> signaling provide important feedback controls to increase ATP production in working ventricular myocytes. There is, however, still a huge gap in accounting for the full physiological scale of ATP consumption by ventricular myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">From et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">From et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Katz et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Portman et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elliott et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matthews et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Massie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schwartz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 1998</xref>). There is no characterized feedback signal yet that provides a mechanism for ventricular myocytes to scale-up ATP production by their mitochondria when increased work is being done by the heart at constant [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>. This kind of situation arises routinely when the heart must pump at the same rate but against a greater afterload. This occurs, for example, when blood pressure rises. The investigation presented in this paper seeks to fill this major gap in our understanding.</p><p>Here, we report on an understudied and poorly understood signaling pathway in cardiac mitochondria in which CO<sub>2</sub> and soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) play pivotal roles. CO<sub>2</sub> is generated in mitochondria largely as a waste product originating from processing of energy substrates by the Krebs cycle, therefore reflecting the extent of energy metabolism. This CO<sub>2</sub> is dissolved in the local aqueous fraction and is in dynamic aqueous equilibrium with bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>). Importantly, sAC is activated by bicarbonate but unlike ‘transmembrane’ adenylyl cyclase (tmAC), sAC is found in solution not in the cellular membranes. When sAC is activated, like tmAC, it generates cAMP as the second messenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buck et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Litvin et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The 10-member family of signaling proteins known as adenylyl cyclases (ACs) is exquisitely adaptable and transduces a wide array of biological signals by generating the second messenger cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zaccolo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Benedetto et al., 2021</xref>). The family is best known by the nine members that are incorporated in the plasma membranes of almost every cell type via transmembrane (tm) protein domains. While tmACs are broadly regulated by G proteins in response to hormonal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oldham and Hamm, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Syrovatkina et al., 2016</xref>), they are able to maintain specificity and high signal-to-noise ratio through proximity to their targets docked at A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Scott et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zaccolo and Pozzan, 2002</xref>). Further signal compartmentalization is gained by nearby ‘firewalls’ of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that hydrolyze cAMP to AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lomas and Zaccolo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baillie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mongillo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burdyga et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, there is only one mammalian member of the sAC subset, and it is much less studied or understood. Mammalian sACs are structural homologues of the bacterial sACs and also lack a transmembrane domain. Instead, they are confined inside organelles like mitochondria, centrioles, and nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zippin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2009</xref>). Unlike tmACs, sACs achieve high local signal-to-noise ratio by producing cAMP inside the small subcellular volumes that also contain their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tresguerres et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rossetti et al., 2021</xref>), namely protein kinase A (PKA) and ‘Exchange Proteins Activated by cAMP’ or EPACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmid et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sample et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parker et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A number of recent papers investigated sAC and its activation by bicarbonate seeking to identify what was sensed by sAC, where in the cell the reactions took place and what the purpose of this signaling system was (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Valsecchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Valsecchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acin-Perez et al., 2011</xref>). This work by Manfredi et al., although widely cited, is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Benedetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Covian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lefkimmiatis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). These publications concluded that the bicarbonate-activated sAC works within the mitochondrial matrix to produce cAMP, which activates PKA, which in turn increases ATP production. It was also reported that the role of this signaling system is to sense and respond to ‘nutrient availability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Valsecchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Valsecchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acin-Perez et al., 2011</xref>).

In light of these major points of disagreement, we investigated sAC quantitatively with high spatial resolution to determine where sAC was located, how it worked, where the intermediate signals were generated, and importantly, what its overall role in cellular metabolism may be. Additionally, we decided to use fresh and functional heart tissue as our source of mitochondria because it is one of the most metabolically dynamic tissues. Additionally, we reasoned that by discovering how sAC worked in cardiac mitochondria, we were likely to provide a solid physiological framework to understand how sAC worked in other tissues. In contrast, the original investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Valsecchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Valsecchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acin-Perez et al., 2011</xref>) of sAC used mitochondria from cells in which mitochondrial ATP production normally operates over a very narrow range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Dyke et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bracht et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shadrin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">do Nascimento et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Medeiros et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colturato et al., 2012</xref>) and sAC signaling itself has a low signal-to-noise ratio.

Additionally, we found that sAC signaling reports on nutrient <italic>consumption</italic> not on nutrient ‘availability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Valsecchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Valsecchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acin-Perez et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, a major finding of the work presented here is that mitochondrial sAC signaling works independently of, yet in conjunction with, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling system. Together they report on the full scale of ATP needs in health and disease. This resonant or complementary signaling between the two systems enables the mitochondria in cardiac ventricular myocytes to produce ATP continuously at levels appropriate for the physiological demands of the heart.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>An investigation is presented that centers on where sAC is located within the ventricular myocyte, how that position affects its function and how bicarbonate increases ATP production through sAC.

This work then examines how the local potential effectors of cAMP – specifically EPAC1 and PKA – may be connected to the dynamic control of ATP production by mitochondria. Under these conditions, sAC signaling is examined in context of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to examine their interactions.

The sAC labeling clearly localizes to the mitochondria, which appear with punctate features (roughly 1 μm across) occurring in rows between the F-actin-containing (blue) myofilaments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barth et al., 1992</xref>). This conclusion is strengthened by the similarity of the distribution of sAC to that of ATP synthase (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This point is well illustrated in the merged image. The mitochondrial localization of sAC is also supported by colocalization analysis measured by the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between C<sub>V</sub> and sAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Likewise, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>, it is clear that neither protein is colocalized with the contractile filament (F-actin).

PDEs are plentiful in nearly all cells that use cAMP and are distributed to help focus the action of the cyclic nucleotide to a local region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baillie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maurice et al., 2014</xref>). The PDEs limit the diffusion of the cAMP away from their intended target. This has often been likened to a ‘firewall’ against the excessive signaling of cAMP within a region of a cell or within an organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lomas and Zaccolo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baillie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mongillo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burdyga et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, inhibition of endogenous PDEs within mitochondrial compartments would be expected to enhance cAMP signaling within those compartments. The effects of the PDE inhibitor IBMX on the action of sAC in isolated mitochondria are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>. Specifically, physiological concentrations of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> (10 and 15 mM) significantly increase ATP production, and IBMX elevates it further, for a combined effect of doubling ATP output. These data are consistent with a cAMP signaling system inside mitochondria that responds to bicarbonate by activating sAC, that is modulated by PDEs that reduce cAMP levels, and that regulates the primary function of these mitochondria, the generation of ATP.</p><p>The HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> that activates sAC in mitochondria is produced spontaneously by hydration of CO<sub>2</sub>, a reaction that is greatly accelerated by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>, we find that cardiac mitochondria contain CA-XIV (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As with sAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>), co-labeling for TOM20 indicates that CA-XIV is localized to an interior compartment of the mitochondria. Thus, the two critical upstream components of the CO<sub>2</sub>/bicarbonate signaling pathway reside inside the mitochondria of ventricular myocytes. Nevertheless, with the resolution achieved, it cannot be determined whether sAC and CA-XIV are both inside the matrix, the IMS, or both compartments. If sAC and CA-XIV both reside inside the mitochondrial matrix, where CO<sub>2</sub> is produced, it would enable sAC to rapidly track changes in CO<sub>2</sub> production in terms of [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>]. However, the alternative possibility in which sAC is in the IMS will also enable effective tracking of CO<sub>2</sub> production by sAC despite the low permeability of the IMM to the bicarbonate anion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arias-Hidalgo et al., 2016</xref>). Mitochondria in the interfibrillar regions of cardiomyocytes have cristae with extended flat surfaces packed closely together, creating stacks of thin alternating layers of intracristal and matrix spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Picard et al., 2013</xref>). This ‘lamellar’ membrane morphology combined with the very high permeability of the IMM to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arias-Hidalgo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Itel et al., 2012</xref>) is ideal for gas exchange between the two compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noble, 1983</xref>). In fact, most (85% or more) of the IMS volume in these lamellar mitochondria is in the crista layers adjacent to matrix and not in the peripheral IMS abutting the OMM and cytosol (see legend, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Thus, the level of CO<sub>2</sub> inside cristae should rapidly adjust in parallel with that in the matrix where it is generated, and spontaneous CO<sub>2</sub> hydration should generate steady-state levels of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> that track energy consumption. The presence of CA in the same subcompartment as sAC would speed up the response time of the metabolic tracking, but steady-state bicarbonate levels inside cristae should vary with matrix CO<sub>2</sub> even in the absence of CA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mitochondrial cAMP signaling</title><p>The above results indicate that the cAMP generated inside mitochondria by sAC and regulated by PDEs directly modulates ATP production by mitochondria. To investigate this process in more detail, the characteristics of the sAC signaling system aid us in the design of experiments to quantitatively assess the contributions of sAC to metabolic regulation of the heart. A critical characteristic is that the sAC output signal following activation is cAMP, which cannot readily cross a membrane due to its hydrophilicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lefkimmiatis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Benedetto et al., 2013</xref>).

However, when cAMP is added extra-mitochondrially to volume that also contains the mitochondria, there is a clear increase of approximately 50% in ATP production that is further augmented to 100% (doubling) upon addition of IBMX.

To examine these targets, experiments were conducted under conditions where matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>) were measured quantitatively and kept low (under 200 nM). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (right panel – black bars) shows that, in the <italic>absence</italic> of added extra-mitochondrial cAMP, blocking PKA (with its inhibitor H89) does not affect ATP production nor does the blocking of EPAC1 by the inhibitor CE3F4. However, when cAMP is applied extra-mitochondrially in low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> (green bars) there is an increase in ATP production that is inhibited by CE3F4 but not H89. From these experiments, we conclude that mitochondrial EPAC1 is the target protein activated by cAMP applied to isolated mitochondria, and that PKA is not involved. We also conclude that EPAC1 contributes to increased generation of ATP even in low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> and that this signaling happens within the IMS. We conclude that the signaling is in the IMS because cAMP does not enter the matrix under the conditions of our experiment.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows that at elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> (&gt;2 μM), in the absence of cAMP (blue bars), there is a significant increase (2.6-fold) in ATP production compared to the low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> control (dashed black line). There is an important further increase in ATP production (1.3-fold – brown bars) when cAMP is added to these mitochondria with elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>. These findings suggest that IMS sAC signaling and the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> signaling system have additive (independent) effects on ATP production. This conclusion is also supported by our findings that the sAC signaling system works without the need for elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). In addition, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>, the cAMP-dependent increase in ATP production was sensitive to EPAC1 inhibition. The pull-down and subsequent immunoblot data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref> show that this action can be attributed to activation of the canonical EPAC1 target protein, a member of the Ras-related protein family, Rap1 (Repressor/activator protein 1). Diagrammatically this activation process is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. While we have shown that much of the signaling (sAC, EPAC1, and Rap1) occurs in the IMS, the exact location and identity of the Rap1- target protein(s) remains unknown and will be examined in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>cAMP signaling domains: IMS versus matrix</title><p>Given the immunolocalization results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> using both isolated ventricular myocytes and isolated mitochondria and the functional experiments on isolated mitochondria in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, the sAC -&gt; EPAC1 -&gt; Rap1 signaling pathway appears to be in the IMS. In contrast to our simple results, other studies have suggested significantly more complex results that conflict with our findings. For example, some experiments suggest that cAMP signaling includes both cytosolic and mitochondrial matrix targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acin-Perez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lefkimmiatis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Benedetto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Valsecchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laudette et al., 2021</xref>). To sort out possible contributions from matrix-localized cAMP signaling, we employed the membrane permeant analog of cAMP, 8Br-cAMP. When applied to an isolated mitochondrial preparation, 8Br-cAMP would be expected to activate both EPAC and PKA in all compartments (i.e., both IMS and matrix) of the mitochondria. 8Br-cAMP also is a persistent activator of EPAC and PKA since it is resistant to breakdown by PDEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christensen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kawasaki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Rooij et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows the effects of 8Br-cAMP application to isolated mitochondria in low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> (&lt;200 nM). In contrast to the application of cAMP extra-mitochondrially, which produces significant increase in ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), 8Br-cAMP produces a modest reduction in ATP production. Further, more significant reduction in ATP production is seen with 8Br-cAMP and addition of the PKA inhibitor H89 or the EPAC inhibitor CE3F4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left panel). When the PDE inhibitor IBMX is applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right panel), it modestly increases ATP production when [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> is low in the absence or presence of 8Br-cAMP, suggesting persistent effects of cAMP produced in the IMS by sAC and undegraded by PDEs under these conditions. The progressive decrease in ATP production following addition of 8Br-cAMP alone and with blockers of PKA (H89) or EPAC (CE3F4) is also observed at the elevated ATP production rates associated with high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> (&gt;2 μM), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The simple conclusion is that the action of cAMP in the IMS is overwhelmed by the action of 8Br-cAMP in the matrix. Exactly what 8Br-cAMP does in the matrix to produce its effect is not yet known. It is evident, however, that the actions of bicarbonate on sAC, cAMP on EPAC1 and EPAC1 on Rap1 all take place in the IMS. Taken together, the physiological actions of bicarbonate and externally added cAMP that stimulate ATP production by cardiac mitochondria appear to be due to IMS-based signaling, and not to previously described actions of cAMP within the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Elevated matrix [cAMP] inhibits mitochondrial ATP production.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram showing mitochondrial compartments accessible to cAMP and the membrane permeant analog, 8Br-cAMP.

The Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway is clearly important since it links mitochondrial ATP production to heart rate by raising matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which in turn stimulates processes upstream of the respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wescott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Benedetto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luongo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kwong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we describe a complementary signaling mechanism that further broadens the range of ATP production by mitochondria. We find that cAMP signaling by sAC, likely located in the mitochondrial IMS, appears to set a scale factor for ATP generation in response to increased substrate consumption detected as an increase in the sAC activator, bicarbonate. Soluble AC has two features that make it an ideal metabolic sensor to complement the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> signal for regulation of mitochondrial ATP production under normal conditions. The first is sAC’s distinctive activation by the metabolic waste product CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>. In effect, the bicarbonate sensitivity of sAC enables it to ‘monitor’ the carbon emissions of the ATP production machinery that operate in the nearby mitochondrial matrix. In this way, sAC senses an integrated local energy consumption ‘index’ that reflects the level of cellular energy demands and CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> production as mitigated by vascular waste product removal. Secondly, sAC generates a powerful, locally acting second messenger, cAMP, as an output signal, based on the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> that it senses. Importantly, cAMP as a hydrophilic signaling molecule cannot readily cross the IMM to directly regulate matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lefkimmiatis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Benedetto et al., 2013</xref>). Instead, sAC operates within the nanometer scale of the IMS to activate EPAC1 which, in turn regulates guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for the Ras-like GTPase, Rap1. Since neither EPAC1 nor Rap1 has transmembrane domains, the working hypothesis is that Rap1 has an as yet unidentified target in the IMM that affects ATP synthesis either directly or indirectly, by transmitting its signal to another target in the matrix. Importantly, sAC appears to affect mitochondrial ATP production in a manner that does not depend on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> signaling but instead complements it. In effect, there are two signaling arms for feedback regulation of cardiac ATP production: one that depends on changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> (associated with heart rate) and another that depends on variations in CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> levels (energy consumption), presented schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. These findings provide an important new framework for understanding the dynamic regulation of ATP production in heart and perhaps other tissues. At the same time, the findings raise numerous questions about how the disparate signals are integrated to precisely regulate mitochondrial ATP production over its full dynamic range.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Dynamic control of mitochondrial ATP production by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and bicarbonate.</title><p>Schematic diagram of the two complementary signaling arms that control mitochondrial ATP production. Left: The Ca<sup>2+</sup> arm depends on heart rate. With higher heart rates, increased mitochondrial matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>) augments ATP production via a mechanism described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wescott et al., 2019</xref>. Right: The bicarbonate arm responds to pressure/volume work, highlighting the pivotal role played by CO<sub>2</sub> (in dynamic equilibrium with bicarbonate). This signaling arm is centered in the IMS (intermembrane space between the inner mitochondrial membrane [IMM] and the outer mitochondrial membrane [OMM]) with the final link (involving Rap1) reaching across the IMM and probably into the matrix. Neither the Ca<sup>2+</sup> nor the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> signaling arm alone accounts for the full scale of enhancement of ATP production during normal physiological function. Each arm can be stimulated by distinct signals, keeping ATP production in sync with heart rate and pressure–volume work. Importantly, it is the resonance signaling between this two signaling arms that properly matches ATP production to actual energy consumption.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84204-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Bicarbonate signaling in the IMS</title><p>Unlike membrane-anchored ACs, soluble ACs are restricted to organelles, whose small volumes confine and amplify cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tresguerres et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rossetti et al., 2021</xref>). At first glance, the mitochondrial matrix might seem a more likely compartment for a sAC signaling pathway than the IMS. The matrix is the site of CO<sub>2</sub> production, and the IMS is more accessible to the highly buffered cytosol. However, it is important to recall that the IMS has two functionally distinct domains. The first is the narrow peripheral region between the ‘inner boundary membrane’ (IBM) and OMM, which is also termed the ‘peripheral IMS’. The second is the crista compartments (intracristal space, ICS) that communicate with the peripheral IMS subregion through small (20–40 nm) crista junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frey and Mannella, 2000</xref>). In the case of myocardial mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), only ~15% or less of the IMS is peripheral and in close proximity to the porous OMM, while the majority is contained within crista compartments that are functionally distinct from the peripheral IMS region due to restricted diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rieger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rieger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Toth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afzal et al., 2021</xref>). For example, pH gradients of 0.3–0.4 have been detected along the cristae in respiring HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rieger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rieger et al., 2021</xref>) and between the peripheral IMS and crista interiors in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia et al., 2019</xref>). Such diffusion effects could be even more pronounced for myocardial mitochondria, which have more plentiful, more densely packed lamellar cristae than those of HeLa cells and yeast. As already noted, the interior of myocardial mitochondria is composed of scores of alternating layers of matrix and ICS, causing the cristae to be continuously bathed in the CO<sub>2</sub> generated in the matrix. This CO<sub>2</sub> would react with water, or ‘hydrate’, to produce HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garg and Maren, 1972</xref>) such that abrupt rise in CO<sub>2</sub> inside the cristae would elevate [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>] by several millimolar to its new steady-state levels in just a few seconds (numerical modeling with Stella Professional). Given the rapid kinetics of the hydration reaction when placed in the temporal context of cell function, it seems likely that [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>] achieves its equilibrium value inside cristae based on its pH and the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (pCO<sub>2</sub>) even in the absence of CA. With the newly appreciated geometry of the collection of IMS components (ICS is above 85% of the total IMS), this structure is ideal for rapid gas exchange between the source of CO<sub>2</sub>, the matrix, and the surrounding layers of ICS.</p><p>The proximity of the ICS and IMS layers to the source of CO<sub>2</sub> (the adjacent matrix layers) and their restricted communication with the buffered cytosol likely renders the cristae responsive to rapid changes in pCO<sub>2</sub> caused by swings in respiration from changes in workload. Furthermore, as we now show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the cardiac mitochondria, like other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balboni and Lehninger, 1986</xref>), contain CA that accelerate the processes. Thus, as seen by others in HeLa cells, changes in cellular metabolism are associated with changes in pH inside their cristae from 6.7 to 7.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rieger et al., 2014</xref>) which, assuming pCO<sub>2</sub> of 40 mm Hg, spans a range of values for [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>] of 5–24 mM that further varies linearly with pCO<sub>2</sub> (estimated via the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation).

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, this is represented by the dashed green arrow (bottom, left panel). The elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> acts on pyruvate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase to increase NADH production and thereby increase proton extrusion through the ETC to hyperpolarize the IMM potential, ΔΨ<sub>M</sub>. As ΔΨ<sub>M</sub> becomes more hyperpolarized (i.e., more negative), ATP production by the ATP synthase increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wescott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garg et al., 2021</xref>). In a separate signaling process, increased pressure–volume work increases ATP consumption, elevates ADP levels and promotes substrate oxidation rate. Increased CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> levels activate sAC which generates cAMP and starts a signaling cascade that further increases ATP production by mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, circular pathway, right panel). This signaling CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> is produced by the reactions of the TCA (tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle) and pyruvate decarboxylation, both in the mitochondria, as these processes break down and process higher energy substrates. We found that the ‘bicarbonate’ signaling arm of ATP production has the capacity to double the amount of ATP generated per unit time compared to elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> alone. When considering the two systems working together, there are likely to be many time- and activity-dependent interactions that favor the influence of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> arm or the bicarbonate arm of the ATP production machinery. This gives rise to the idea of resonance signaling between the two arms. The immediate and long-term adaptations of the systems are likely to play an important role in health and disease, as well as in physical training and organ-level adaptation of nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression and protein production. Thus, we have broadly presented the notion of the co-existing processes and accompanying cellular and mitochondrial interactions as a kind of ‘resonance’. We expect the overall response of ATP production to the two signaling arms (in terms of time and magnitude dependence) to be complex and perhaps not totally independent. Sorting out the control elements and mechanisms that produce the changes will provide a deeper physiological understanding and stimulate novel therapeutic opportunities.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Myocardial infarction and ATP production mechanisms</title><p>Our findings presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> suggest that there is a clear need for the two independent systems to control mitochondrial ATP production – one that depends on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>, and another that depends on HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>. We established these systems by carrying out experiments on ventricular myocytes and mitochondria that were harvested from healthy hearts. However, to broaden our understanding of how these two systems may work together during cardiovascular stress, we also examined mitochondria from diseased hearts. To do this, we measured the functions of both systems in mitochondria taken from ‘remodeled’ heart tissue in undamaged regions following a myocardial infarction (MI). These results were compared to the same heart region taken from sham operated control hearts. This specific aspect of our discussion is intended to probe the metabolic duality presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and raise additional points of interest for us and for other investigators. It is by no means part of a comprehensive investigation into remodeling of the heart following MI.</p><p>MI was produced by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gómez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez et al., 2000</xref>) and examination was done 8 weeks post-surgery. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows the large infarct in the anterior wall of the left ventricle. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref> shows data from sham versus post-MI hearts and reveal a significantly decreased ejection fraction and a significantly decreased fractional shortening of the post-MI left ventricle. Strain analysis is shown in SI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Sample tissue used for measurements was taken from the septum and the posterior left ventricle, far from the scar and the MI border zone. The energy demands of these regions were significantly elevated during the 8 weeks following the MI, largely due to compensation for mechanical dysfunction of the scar tissue and the MI border zone. With this approach, our work was directed at testing how mitochondrial ATP production was regulated by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> signaling systems in myocytes with persistently high energetic demands. In these measurements, we found that the mitochondrial ATP production in the absence of cAMP, and at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> (i.e., &lt;200 nM), was elevated above the sham control levels. Central protein components of the ATP production machinery were largely unchanged (SI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These findings could reflect a change in either regulatory system produced by the post-MI remodeling. It is also possible that both systems had changed because the ATP production that is regulated by CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> and that regulated by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> are summed at all measurements. In contrast, the ATP production at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> (i.e., &gt;2 μM) was elevated to the same levels as control. We also examined the ATP production regulated by CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and found that it was increased by application of cAMP. Taken together, these findings are in support of the argument that the CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> system was working as it had been under non-MI conditions. Thus, in all circumstances (i.e., pre-MI and post-MI and sham-MI), both cAMP and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>, are needed to control ATP production (see discussion below) but internal set-points are different.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Regulation of mitochondrial ATP production in the post myocardial infarction (MI) heart by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> and [cAMP].</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Anterior view of rat heart 8 weeks after induction of MI by ligation of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery.

We were able to determine with super-resolution imaging that sAC is predominantly in the interior and not the outer periphery of mitochondria of ventricular myocytes. Subsequent biochemical results, coupled with existing information about the permeability properties of the inner membrane, strongly supports localization of sAC in the mitochondrial IMS where the cAMP that it produces activates EPAC1. In our experiments, cAMP applied in the extramitochondrial solution should passively diffuse into the IMS through the large VDAC pores in the OMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rostovtseva and Colombini, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rostovtseva and Colombini, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rostovtseva et al., 2002</xref>) but cannot permeate the IMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lefkimmiatis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Benedetto et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, 8Br-cAMP is a cAMP analog that is broadly used in experiments with intact cells and organelles due to its relatively high membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christensen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kawasaki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Rooij et al., 1998</xref>). When added to cardiac mitochondria 8Br-cAMP causes ATP production to decline. Assuming the only differences between the signaling effects of cAMP and 8Br-cAMP relate to IMM permeability and insensitivity to PDEs, it appears that elevated matrix cAMP acts to slow down ATP production, overwhelming any IMS-based upregulation mechanism. The lack of stimulation of ATP output by 8Br-cAMP is consistent with findings by Balaban et al. who also used 8Br-cAMP with isolated cardiac mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Covian et al., 2014</xref>). However, these results appear to be at odds with those of Manfredi et al. who used 8Br-cAMP with isolated liver mitochondria. They concluded that sAC works <italic>only</italic> in the matrix and not the IMS and that its signaling target is PKA not EPAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2009</xref>). While it is possible that the discrepancy might be cell-type specific, the finding that elevated matrix cAMP (in the form of 8Br-cAMP) slows down ATP production raises important questions about how mitochondrial cAMP microdomains might operate and interact for metabolic regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Missing link in the mitochondrial sAC signaling cascade</title><p>Mechanistically, we have tracked the signaling sequence that begins with an elevation of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, followed by AC activation, leading to elevation of cAMP within the IMS, activation of EPAC1 and of Rap1 in the IMS, and eventually to elevation of ATP production by ATP synthase. The localization of these signals shown here for the first time is important as is their link to augmented ATP production. This raises the next (still unanswered) question: What are the mechanistic details explaining how the Rap1 signal leads to increased ATP production? In particular, does a target of Rap1 carry the message to the ATP synthase directly, or is upregulation of ATP generation achieved indirectly, by acting on some component of the ETC or on a critical membrane transport protein such as ANT or VDAC? Any of these mitochondrial components has the potential to increase ATP production if appropriately activated, but thus far, the relevant mitochondrial targets of Rap1 remain unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Mitochondrial PKA and CaMKII: location and function</title><p>Buck and Levine were the first to suggest that sAC resides in mitochondria, based on experiments in HEK293 cells and a novel antibody for sAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zippin et al., 2003</xref>). Manfredi et al. using HeLa, HEK293T, COS-1 cells, and liver mitochondria suggested that sAC was specifically located in the mitochondrial matrix where it activated PKA to affect the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, Balaban et al., using pig heart mitochondria presented evidence that PKA was not working at all within any part of cardiac mitochondria to augment ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Covian et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, Lefkimmiatis et al. showed that PKA does not affect mitochondria matrix signaling but instead that it associates with the cytosolic facing side of the OMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burdyga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lefkimmiatis et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we have presented findings that broadly do not contradict those of Balaban and Lefkimmiatis, but that extend investigation of cAMP signaling in an important new direction. Unlike previous work of others, we included guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in our experimental buffers to enable the primary catalytic function of guanine-nucleotide exchangers such as EPAC as well as small GTPases such as Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Traut, 1994</xref>). Additionally, we used the energy substrate pyruvate instead of glutamate. Pyruvate is not only more substantially metabolized by cardiac mitochondria than glutamate but is also metabolized by a larger number of enzymatic steps, which broadens the search for potentially regulated processes. Moreover, we conducted more direct luminescence measurements of mitochondrial ATP production rate, which also provide higher signal-to-noise ratio than the analogous measurements of oxygen consumption presented in previous studies. With this approach we were able to find that cAMP <italic>does</italic> act to increase ATP production in cardiac mitochondria but only when it operates in the IMS and acts on EPAC not on PKA.</p><p>Another signaling pathway in the mitochondrial matrix was reported by Anderson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joiner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Luczak et al., 2020</xref>). They suggested that mitochondrially localized CaMKII (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) has multiple targets within mitochondria. Subsequent work by Lezoualc’h et al. found that mitochondrial CaMKII was activated by EPAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fazal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laudette et al., 2021</xref>). The location of these processes, as presented in these publications, was within the space that includes the IMS, the IMM, and the matrix but was not further specified. Our work clearly supports cAMP-dependent activation of EPAC, and it is possible that CaMKII may also be involved. This will be pursued in future work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Summary</title><p>Here, we have demonstrated that there are two independent signaling systems that regulate cardiac mitochondrial ATP production under normal conditions and that they complement each other. One is the well-known calcium signaling pathway that we recently redefined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wescott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garg et al., 2021</xref>). The second is described here. Moreover, the details of the operation of this second pathway are presented and tested and, in its new form, constitutes a functionally novel pathway. The major signaling occurs in the IMS and serves to use bicarbonate to monitor carbon-based fuel consumption. That information is translated by sAC to cAMP production and from there to EPAC1 and Rap1 activation. How the signal enters the matrix and details on how it leads to the increased ATP production by the ATP synthase is unknown and under investigation. We show that this cAMP signaling pathway complements the calcium-dependent arm of ATP production in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wescott et al., 2019</xref>), and that one or both may be modified in cardiac tissue that has been stressed for prolonged periods following MI. It will be important to investigate how each pathway may be modified and contribute to the development of cardiac disease and how they respond to therapeutic interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mitochondria isolation</title><p>Six- to ten-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats (250–300 g, from ENVIGO, USA, strain code # 002) were anesthetized using Isoflurane (20 min).

Similarly, critical was the purification of the ADP stocks as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wescott et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ELISA measurements of cAMP</title><p>Quantitative cAMP measurements were carried out on isolated cardiac mitochondria (0.5 mg per sample) using cAMP Direct Immunoassay Kit (Fluorometric) (Abcam, ab138880). Mitochondria samples were treated with 0 or 10 or 15 mM [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>], and 0 or 25 μM forskolin for 30 min, pelleted at 3200 × <italic>g</italic> for 12 min, and lysed using the lysis buffer. Florescence measurements of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-cAMP displacement were carried out on the BMG LABTECH CLARIOstar plate reader (excitation: 540 ± 4 nm, emission: 590 ± 4 nm). A standard curve was performed daily over a range of 0.06–2 nmol cAMP (0.3 nM to 10 μM cAMP).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immune pull down of Rap1</title><p>RalGDS RBD Agarose beads were used to selectively pull-down the active form of Rap1 (Rap-GTP) from isolated cardiac mitochondria (Rap1 Activation Assay Kit, Abcam, ab212011). Samples of mitochondria, 2.5 mg per sample in 2 ml assay buffer, were treated with 0 or 1.25 mM cAMP for 30 min on ice, added with pyruvate (1 mM) and malate (0.5 mM) and ADP (25 μM), incubated for 2 min at room temperature, pelleted by centrifugation at 3200 × <italic>g</italic> for 12 min, and lysed using the lysis buffer provided with the kit. As positive control, lysed mitochondria samples were treated with 0.1 mM GTPyS (guanosine 5′-<italic>O</italic>-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) to maximally and irreversibly activate Rap1. Pull down of Rap1-GTP was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amounts of active Rap-1 were detected by immunoblot analysis of the pull-down product using anti-Rap1 goat polyclonal antibody (Abcam, ab212011).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Isolated cardiac mitochondria or homogenized freshly harvested ventricular tissue (100–200 µl) were lysed in the same volumes of 2× sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol (Millipore) and incubated at 100°C for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 21,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatants were retained, and protein concentrations were measured directly in these SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis samples using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were separated on 4–20% gradient Novex Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Membranes were blocked in 5% blocking-grade nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in PBS-Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 60 min at RT. Blots were developed with Super Signal West Pico ECL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and imaged using Amersham Imager 600 chemiluminescence imager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Densitometry quantification was carried out using ImageJ 1.53k (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Primary antibodies used for western blotting were anti-Tom20 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, PTG-11802-AP; 1:20,000), anti Rap1 goat polyclonal antibody (Abcam, ab212011; 1:1,000), OxPhos Human WB Antibody Cocktail for ETC Complexes: CI-20(ND6), C-II-30(FeS), C-III-Core2, C-IV-II, and C-V-alpha (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 45-8199; 1:2500). Secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Cell Signaling Technology, CST-7076) or anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling Technology, CST-7074) or donkey anti-goat (Abcam, ab205723).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>All results are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. All test conditions are described in detail in the paper. All data collected from experiments in accordance with the specified conditions are included in the paper. All data collected from each experiment were included in the paper. All experiments were repeated independently with at least three separate sample preparations. All the experiments were preformed using sample sizes based on standard protocols in the field. All experiments require fresh heart tissue, thus statistical analysis was carried out in parallel with experiments to determine when further repetition was no longer required. Statistical analysis was performed using either OriginPro 2018 or Matlab R2016a statistical packages, all with <italic>α</italic> = 0.05. Where appropriate, column analyses were performed using an unpaired, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test (for two groups) or one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction (for groups of three or more). Data fitting convergence was achieved with a minimal termination tolerance of 10<sup>−6</sup>. p values less than 0.05 (95% confidence interval) were considered significant. All data displayed a normal distribution and variance were similar between groups for each evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Electron tomography and morphometric analysis</title><p>Ventricular myocytes from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, obtained as described above, were glutaraldehyde-fixed, osmium tetroxide post-fixed and epon-embedded according to the protocol described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2013</xref> by the Microscope Facility of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD).

so enough energy is provided for a given task and previous studies have described how calcium signals in the mitochondria convey a message of demand that regulates enzymes to alter ATP production accordingly. This manuscript presents a parallel mechanism that implicates CO2 and HCO<sub>3</sub> sensors that regulate cAMP signalling. The authors have identified the putative location of the enzyme pathway following super-resolution imaging of isolated ventricular myocytes and mitochondria. Localizing sAC to the interior portion of the mitochondria is a significant advance and provides a framework for future target discovery.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84204.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Paterson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/052gg0110</institution-id><institution>University of Oxford</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Swietach</surname><given-names>Pawel</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/052gg0110</institution-id><institution>University of Oxford</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.10.31.514581">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.31.514581v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Benoît Kornmann as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Pawel Swietach (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers raise a concern about the location of the enzymes in the putative IMS pathway versus the matrix.</p><p>2) An effort needs to be made to biochemically confirm the location. A possible experimental solution has been suggested by one of the reviewers. That is, to determine the relative distribution of carbonic anhydrase in both compartments. For example, is the signal to sAC dependent on CO2 diffusing from the matrix and getting converted to bicarb in the IMS, or is bicarb transported out of the matrix? Perhaps a pulse of CO2 could be given to see if it triggers the response, with or without a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor present.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A revision should address the primary question if the responses in isolated mitochondria are due to pH (and hence PMF etc) or bicarbonate, or both. Efforts need to be undertaken to alter HCO<sub>3</sub> at constant pH, e.g. by raising CO2 accordingly. If IMS HCO<sub>3</sub> is to change over a 10 mM range, then pH would also change. This could be measured in intact cells, but I don't believe there has been evidence for this. Finally, the appropriateness of placing an HCO<sub>3</sub> sensor beyond a partitioning membrane should be revised – to me, it would seem more sensible to guage HCO<sub>3</sub> in the matrix, as this is a membrane-bound space, wherein HCO<sub>3</sub> could rise and fall considerably. Once CO2 leaves the mitochondrion and dissipates, its concentration profile is near constant (as you would expect for a rapidly diffusing gas).

We appreciate their overall assessment that this work substantially advances our understanding of a major research question -- how cardiac energy supply is regulated. As acknowledged by the reviewers, the structural and functional examination of cardiac ATP production provides strong evidence that sAC activation by bicarbonate inside the mitochondria leads to increased ATP production via a signaling pathway involving EPAC and Rap1. We also demonstrate that this signaling process operates inside the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) that includes both the peripheral IMS and the intracristal space (ICS). We took the reviewers comments seriously and followed their suggestions to seek additional evidence for this localization. Our super-resolution imaging of isolated ventricular myocytes and mitochondria isolated from these cells localized sAC to the interior of the mitochondria. In the revised manuscript, we also found carbonic anhydrase 14 (CA-XIV) inside the mitochondria (new Figure 2 D-G, and Figure 2 supplement 1). Although resolution between 20 nm (best) to 100 nm is not sufficient to distinguish between matrix and IMS (including intracristal) compartments, given the ultrastructure of heart mitochondria (see new Figure 2H), it is clear that both sAC and CA-XIV are abundant and in the interior of the mitochondria. We explain how this strengthens our earlier <italic>functional</italic> evidence for a bicarbonate–activated sAC signaling pathway in the IMS/intracristal space. We acknowledge that additional verification by higher resolution imaging would provide useful validation for this localization, but such investigation is beyond the scope of this paper and not needed, given the functional results. In light of the reviewers’ comments, we strove to ensure that these important points are stated clearly, and that the language is balanced appropriately throughout the paper.</p><p>An important addition stimulated by the reviewers is a discussion of CO<sub>2</sub> and bicarbonate signaling in the IMS/ Intracristal space. This is now provided in the results and Discussion sections of the revised paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A revision should address the primary question if the responses in isolated mitochondria are due to pH (and hence PMF etc) or bicarbonate, or both.

We feel the more detailed discussion about cardiac mitochondrial ultrastructure, spurred by this reviewer’s critique, have strengthened our hypothesis about physiological relevance of the signaling pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) While the findings are novel and interesting, the essential conclusions about the localization of the components are based on deduction from a comparison of the effects of soluble cyclic AMP versus permeable cyclic AMP.

We collaborated with experts using these techniques in other cell types but failed to find the optimized conditions that could enable us to succeed. As part of this effort, we learned from our colleagues that such procedures for cardiac mitochondria vary between extremely challenging to nearly impossible. There are, for example, a huge array of possible permeabilizations, extractions, and proteolytic conditions. The sticky membranes and tight packing of the components of the cardiac mitochondria make the methodology exquisitely challenging. Nevertheless, thank you for the suggestion!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some elements of the SR may remain attached to the isolated mitochondria.

It is theoretically possible that some calcium may be cycling in a microdomain even at low (200nM) external Ca.

Thus, where indicated, the level of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> is below 200 nM. These measured levels are intramitochondrial calcium levels not extra-mitochondrial calcium levels. We can thus rule out the possibility that the actions of cAMP on ATP production is related to enhanced calcium uptake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The paper is structured in a strange way, with the results of figure 6 appearing after the discussion started. It is also unclear what this experiment adds to understanding the mechanisms examined in the paper, other than to show that the non-ischemic post-infarct heart is somehow remodeled – but why or how it is altered is not investigated. While overall cardiac function is impaired in the post-infarct model, the importance of enhanced mitochondrial ATP production by the remaining healthy tissue does not seem to add much relevance to the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree. While Figures 1-5 report the physiological aspects of this study, Figure 6 raises an additional point for discussion, &quot;Is this bicarbonate driven, sAC-based regulation of ATP production important for energy supply in the failing heart?&quot; Figure 6 shows that the signaling pathway is relevant in post-MI hearts with HFrEF, which underscores the potential clinical importance of the current study in common disease. At the present time we have little understanding of how mitochondria function in the failing heart and how it contribute to this disease. Thus, it is valuable to share new relevant findings that can contribute to better understanding. Planned future studies will seek to better explain the mechanistic underpinnings in normal and failing hearts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
