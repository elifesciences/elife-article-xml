the mossy fibre inputs into the cerebellar cortex. The granule cell axon is made of an ascending portion and a long parallel fibre extending at right angles, an architecture suggesting that synapses formed by the two segments of the axon could encode different information. There are controversial indications that ascending axon (AA) and parallel fibre (PF) synapse properties and modalities of plasticity are different. We tested the hypothesis that AA and PF synapses encode different information, and that the association of these distinct inputs to Purkinje cells might be relevant to the circuit and trigger plasticity, similar to the coincident activation of PF and climbing fibre inputs. Here, by recording synaptic currents in Purkinje cells from either proximal or distal granule cells (mostly AA and PF synapses, respectively), we describe a new form of associative plasticity between these two distinct granule cell inputs. We show for the first time that synchronous AA and PF repetitive train stimulation, with inhibition intact, triggers long-term potentiation (LTP) at AA synapses specifically. Furthermore, the timing of the presentation of the two inputs controls the outcome of plasticity and induction requires NMDAR and mGluR1 activation. The long length of the PFs allows us to preferentially activate the two inputs independently, and despite a lack of morphological reconstruction of the connections, these observations reinforce the suggestion that AA and PF synapses have different coding capabilities and plasticity that is associative, enabling effective association of information transmitted via granule cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cell</kwd><kwd>granule cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE37-011-01 SpinoCereLoco</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Auger</surname><given-names>Céline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE16-0010-01 RewardInhib</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Auger</surname><given-names>Céline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Associative plasticity of proximal and distal granule cell inputs to Purkinje cells enables time dependent association of information from local and distant receptive fields.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to discriminate self-generated from external stimuli is essential to apprehend the world as movement itself activates sensory receptors. In fish, discrimination of self from external stimuli has been shown to rely on associating motor command and sensory feedback in cerebellar-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montgomery and Bodznick, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawtell, 2017</xref>). This is achieved by modifying the motor inputs to generate a negative image of the associated sensory inputs, effectively subtracting the predictable sensory inputs. This way, only unpredicted inputs are output by the principal cells. While in most cases the role of the cerebellum in sensory information processing is still unclear, theoretical models and work on plasticity suggest that it might similarly be involved in cancellation of predictable sensory inputs, but distinct sensory and motor synapses have yet to be identified in the cerebellum. The role of the cerebellum in motor learning and coordination has been well documented, but it is now clear that it is also involved in a number of higher cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stoodley and Schmahmann, 2010</xref>). An intriguing possibility, in the wider context of the cerebellum, is that receptive field and contextual inputs are encoded differentially by the granule cell AA and PF synapses. These inputs might be functionally associated based on relative timing to subtract predictable inputs, and output only unpredicted inputs, as observed for motor and sensory inputs in cerebellar-like structures.</p><p>Sensorimotor information is delivered to the cerebellar cortex by mossy fibres and relayed by granule cells (GCs) to the Purkinje cells (PCs) and inhibitory network for integration. Anatomically, the axon of a GC first extends through the PC layer and into the molecular layer, making up the ascending portion of the axon (AA), then bifurcates at a right angle, forming a PF that extends several millimetres along the folium in both directions. As a consequence, an AA can form multiple synapses with a few overlaying PCs in the same sagittal plane as the GC soma, distributing information to a restricted number of cells, whereas PFs course through the dendritic trees of hundreds of PCs along the lobule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Napper and Harvey, 1988</xref>), distributing information widely to other microzones. This morphology and functional data have suggested that PC activity might be principally driven by local GCs via AA synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen and Yarom, 1998</xref>), while distant GCs might modulate its activity via the PF system to provide the PC with less specific contextual information.</p><p>In the adult rat, an estimated 175 k excitatory PF synapses encode information on the dendritic tree of a single PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Napper and Harvey, 1988</xref>). We previously identified two PF synaptic populations with different molecular signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devi et al., 2016</xref>). However, PF synapses have usually been treated as a uniform population, and we know little about the way the variety of information received by PCs is encoded at the synaptic level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isope and Barbour, 2002</xref> estimated that 85% of PF synapses are silent, as suggested by in vivo data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ekerot and Jörntell, 2001</xref>), however, that proportion was significantly lower for local GCs and presumably AA synapses. In this study and that by Walter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walter et al., 2009</xref>), the properties of AA synapses were found to be indistinguishable from PF synapses. On the other hand, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sims and Hartell, 2005</xref>, has shown that AA and PF synaptic properties and susceptibility to plasticity are different. AA synapses were shown to be refractory to plasticity with well-described protocols. Neither associative CF-mediated long term depression (LTD) nor LTP could be induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sims and Hartell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sims and Hartell, 2006</xref>). These observations, together with the anatomical properties of the GC axon, suggest that AA and PF synapses can transmit different types of information and play different roles in cerebellar computation.</p><p>In this study, we asked whether coincident activation of synapses formed by proximal and distal GCs (mostly AA and PF synapses, respectively) might trigger specific synaptic plasticity of GC inputs. We show that a protocol pairing stimulation of AAs and PFs, with inhibition preserved, results in LTP of the AA inputs, while PF inputs are depressed although not significantly. AA-LTP is timing-dependent and relies on NMDAR and mGluR1 activation, bringing together these two pathways. GABA<sub>A</sub>R activation was also required for efficient induction and maintenance of plasticity. Finally, we show that the different plasticity found for AA and PF inputs is not merely due to the differential spatial distribution of their synapses on the dendritic tree.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Associative plasticity of AA synapses</title><p>To test for associative plasticity between ascending axon and parallel fibre inputs we positioned two separate stimulating electrodes to achieve activation of different GC inputs onto a recorded PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top panel). To stimulate PFs, a stimulation pipette was positioned in the molecular layer, 100–200 µm away from the dendritic tree of the recorded cell. The average length of a PF is between 4.2 and 4.7 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pichitpornchai et al., 1994</xref>). If we assume that only granule cells located within the 50 µm thick layer of the PC dendritic tree can make AA synapses, and take the average length of a parallel fibre, they represent only 1 to 2% of granule cells or parallel fibres. Therefore, the vast majority of fibres stimulated locally in the molecular layer belong to GCs distant from the recorded cell and only 1 to 2% are likely to originate from that 50 µm layer and make AA synapses. To stimulate AAs, a second stimulation pipette was positioned in the GC layer, within a narrow window centred on the PC somatodendritic plane. The GCs stimulated in this position have a high probability of making AA synapses onto the dendritic tree of the PC, although a small proportion could also make synapses from the proximal portion of PFs after bifurcation. For the sake of simplicity, we will use the terms AA and PF synapses thereafter although the terms proximal and distal synapses (with respect to GC soma) might be more appropriate.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Associative plasticity of ascending axon (AA) and parallel fibre (PF) inputs.</title><p>(<bold>A, top</bold>) Whole-cell recording in a Purkinje cell (PC).

For AA responses instead, there was a moderate positive correlation between the level of long-term potentiation (LTP) and the number of spikes, and a moderate negative correlation between the level of LTP and the time at which the first spike was fired, indicating a weak dependence of AA plasticity on spiking during induction.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96140-fig1-figsupp2-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>The EPSC amplitude of AA and PF pathways were sampled with a pair of stimulations each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> middle panel). On average, the amplitude of the AA-EPSC during baseline recordings was 110±12 pA (median 90 pA) and PF-EPSC 480 ± 100 pA (median 288 pA, n=25), and the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was PPR<sub>AA</sub> 1.93 ± 0.08 and PPR<sub>PF</sub> 1.89 ± 0.07. Inhibitory inputs were preserved, and EPSCs were often followed by outward IPSCs. After baseline recording, a protocol aimed at inducing plasticity was applied (synchronous stimulation of both inputs by a train of 15 pulses at 100 Hz, every 3 s, 100 times, in the Current clamp, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> bottom panel). Test of the AA and PF amplitude was then resumed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> middle panel shows a sample experiment with average traces of the AA-PSC, in blue, and the PF-PSC, in orange, 5 min before (continuous line) the plasticity induction protocol, and 25–30 min after the protocol (dotted line). Subtraction traces (25–30 min - last 5 min) are shown in grey to highlight changes. The AA-EPSC amplitude is increased while the PF-EPSC amplitude is decreased. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> top panel shows the time course of 25 such experiments for the AA pathway and 26 for the PF pathway with amplitude normalised to the last 5 min of control before plasticity induction. It shows that on average, following the induction protocol, we observed a long-term change of opposite sign of the two inputs. The AA peak EPSC amplitude increased to 162 ± 15% of baseline immediately after the induction protocol and then slowly decayed within 15 min to stabilise at a value of 131 ± 7% 25–30 min after induction, significantly larger than the baseline (p=7e-5 one-tailed T-test, n=24). The PF-EPSC on the other hand was almost unchanged immediately after the protocol (91 ± 9%) and decreased to 65 ± 5% of baseline at 25–30 min, significantly smaller than the baseline (p=1e-7 one-tailed T-test, n=25).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> also reveals a rundown of the EPSC amplitude during the baseline period, potentially obscuring long-term changes induced by plasticity. A series of control experiments was conducted to quantify the rundown (No Stim experiments, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). After the baseline period, the recording was switched to Iclamp for 5 min, but no stimulation was delivered during that period. Continuous lines <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> top panel shows the average time course for 17 No Stim experiments for the AA- (blue) and PF-EPSCs (orange). On average, 25–30 min after the Iclamp period, the AA-EPSC was 80 ± 6% of baseline (n=16, significantly smaller than baseline p=0.0004, and significantly smaller than synchronous stimulation protocol p=10e-7) and the PF-EPSC was 81 ± 8% of baseline (n=17, not significantly smaller than baseline p=0.062, and not significantly larger than synchronous stimulation protocol p=0.106), indicating a rundown of the amplitude for both pathways during experimental time, independent of the induction protocol. The extent of AA- and PF-EPSC rundown was not significantly different (n=16 and 17, respectively, p=0.82). These values can be used to correct long-term changes. When compensating for rundown, the plasticity protocol caused a long-lasting effective increase of the AA-EPSC to 164% of baseline and a decrease of the PF-EPSC to 80% of baseline on average.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> middle panel shows the ratio of normalised AA and PF peak amplitudes (AA/PF). This measure highlights the relative amplitude change of AA and PF inputs, or relative plasticity, and eliminates changes common to both pathways, such as the rundown of synaptic responses. On average the normalised amplitude of the AA-EPSC more than doubles compared to that of the PF-EPSC, due to both the increase of the AA peak amplitude and the concomitant decrease of the PF, and this is sustained (AA/PF = 2.5 ± 0.4 with n=24, p=3e-4 after 25–30 min of induction). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) bottom panel shows the paired-pulse ratio of normalised amplitudes (PPR) for both pathways. While the peak amplitude of the first response in the pair of stimulations showed a progressive decrease, the peak amplitude of the second response of both AA and PF underwent either potentiation or depression respectively, and was relatively stable thereafter. As a result, the normalised PPRs are transiently decreased following induction, but return to their original value within 25–30 min (PPR<sub>AA</sub> 1.03 ± 0.03, PPR<sub>PF</sub> 0.99 ± 0.03, n=24, p=0.81). Changes in the PPR have been linked to a change in the presynaptic release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>). This suggests a transient presynaptic effect on release probability following induction and likely explains the progressive effects on AA and PF responses, but there was no significant long-term change in the PPR, suggesting that the long-term effects observed are linked to postsynaptic changes.</p><p>Additionally, the level of plasticity measured in a given input pathway did not depend on the amplitude of the synaptic response of that input nor on the sum of the amplitudes of the two pathways (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), showing that even relatively small inputs can trigger plasticity. We analysed the average number of spikes and the time to the first spike during the first 5 trains of stimulation of the induction protocol.

AA-LTP is associative as it is not observed with stimulation of either pathway alone and it is timing-dependent. AA-LTP is weakly dependent on GABAergic inhibition, but most interestingly also, it depends on the activation of both mGluR1s and NMDARs. It is linked to the identity of AA synapses rather than their sparse distribution on PC dendrites, as it is not observed for sparse PF inputs. Below we discuss these findings and potential consequences for cerebellar physiology.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Identification of AA synapses</title><p>We have shown that the difference in plasticity observed between the AA and PF inputs is not linked to the distribution of synapses on the dendritic tree but to the different properties of the synapses. We have argued earlier that our approach for stimulating fibres recruits mainly PF synapses, for molecular layer stimulation, and mainly AA synapses, for local GC layer stimulation. However, we have no morphological identification to verify that all stimulated synapses are strictly AA or PF synapses. Strictly speaking, GC layer stimulation close to the PC soma will recruit synapses from local GCs, formed by the initial portion of the axons, including some formed by the PF close to the bifurcation point, whereas molecular layer stimulation will recruit mostly synapses from distal GCs and formed by the distal portion of the axons. The observed associative plasticity could thus alternatively be due to a gradient of properties of synapses from proximal to distal sites along the GCs axon. If there is a gradient however, it is limited to short distances compared to the total fibre length, as this effect was not observed when stimulating PFs in the GC layer 100–180 µm from the recorded cell (4 to 5% of the total fibre length, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). If the plasticity described here applies to a gradient along the GC axon rather than to AAs and PFs, this would not impact the mechanisms identified nor the consequences for cerebellar physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>AA plasticity</title><p>We have observed AA-LTP with synchronous stimulation and AA-LTD when AAs were stimulated 150 ms after PFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Changes of the PPR have been linked to a change in the presynaptic release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>). This suggests a transient presynaptic effect following induction, which likely explains the progressive changes in AA and PF responses. Presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> and CB1 receptors have been shown to modulate the presynaptic release probability at granule cell to Purkinje cell synapses, but they decrease release and increase the PPR (Dittman and Regehr, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Safo and Regehr, 2005</xref>). Also, endocannabinoid release is triggered by mGluR1 activation, but the mGluR1 block did not affect the transient decrease of the PPR. Therefore, activation of these receptors cannot account for the transient presynaptic effect we observed. However, there was no significant long-term change in the PPR, suggesting that AA-LTP is due to postsynaptic changes.</p><p>Activation of both mGluR1s and NMDARs was required for AA-LTP induction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This is interesting in view of the past involvement of these receptors, mostly independently, in postsynaptic forms of cerebellar PF LTD and LTP, both linked to PF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daniel et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konnerth et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hémart et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lev-Ram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casado et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Safo and Regehr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bidoret et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouvier et al., 2016</xref>).

However, the need for coincident activation of the two synaptic inputs suggests either spatial overlap or a requirement for crosstalk between the two synaptic territories. Our experiments used horizontal slices, where PC dendrites dip into the slice, so we have no indication of whether the two synaptic territories overlap. Given the size of the synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) however, they represent a small number of synapses compared to the total number formed by granule cells on a PC. The median PF-EPSC (288 pA, n=25) corresponds to approximately 34 active synapses (unitary amplitude for distal GC to PC connection is 8.4 pA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isope and Barbour, 2002</xref>). Taking into account that 85% of the synapses formed by PFs onto GCs are silent, our stimulation likely recruits about 230 synapses, active and silent, put together. For a similar unitary synaptic size, the median AA-EPSC (90 pA) would correspond to 11 active synapses and a total of 22 synapses (50% of local GC to PC connections are silent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isope and Barbour, 2002</xref>). These numbers represent less than 0.2% of the 175,000 excitatory synapses present on the dendritic tree of a PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Napper and Harvey, 1988</xref>). Given that we placed the PF stimulating electrode at variable depths and distances from the recorded Purkinje cell, there is statistically little chance of reproducible overlap between the territories of PF and AA recruited. Moreover, AA synapses will be spread in the vertical axis of the dendrites whereas PF synapses will form a dense patch on the PC dendrites. Spatial overlap is, therefore, unlikely to happen in a significant proportion of experiments, suggesting that for interaction to occur a signal needs to propagate from PF to AA synapses to explain associative AA-LTP.</p><p>Crosstalk might be required because a receptor is absent from AA synapses or a pathway fails to activate. The specific localisation of receptors at AA vs PF synapses is unknown. If mGluR1 is present at AA synapses, stimulation could activate the mGluR1 slow EPSC or mGluR1 mediated presynaptic endocannabinoid inhibition. However, this is not observed at sparse PF inputs unless glutamate transporters are blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marcaggi and Attwell, 2005</xref>), which is thought to reflect insufficient glutamate buildup, and makes it difficult to localise the receptors. mGluR1 mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from stores shows a higher sensitivity to glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canepari and Ogden, 2006</xref>) and might take place with sparse inputs, but Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals have not been investigated in this configuration, and we do not know if mGluR1s are present at AA synapses. Similarly, we do not know whether presynaptic NMDARs are present.</p><p>A crosstalk mechanism would require the propagation of a signal between synaptic territories. mGluR1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in Purkinje cells are not expected to propagate across the PC dendritic tree, because both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and IP<sub>3</sub> are quickly buffered. On the other hand, mGluR1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from stores is known to require priming by depolarisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canepari and Ogden, 2006</xref>). It is possible that mGluR1s are present at AA synapses, but Ca<sup>2+</sup> release fails to activate because the local depolarisation is insufficient. The PF beam stimulated forms a dense patch of synapses which will be very efficient at depolarising the membrane potential locally, and this depolarisation might spread to AA synapses if it reaches the threshold for active conductances. Fluctuations of the dendritic membrane potential triggered by the PF-EPSC might enable mGluR1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at AA synapses. The isolation of AA synapses in fine dendritic branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2009</xref>) might make them more prone to depolarisation. mGluR1 activation also triggers the production of endocannabinoids (EC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maejima et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2003</xref>), and presynaptic CB1Rs have been involved in PF-LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Safo and Regehr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carey et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, NO is released by the activation of presynaptic NMDARs. EC and NO are both diffusible messengers and potential substrates for crosstalk between AA and PF synapses. Activation of PF synapses might be required for NO or EC production and diffusion to AA synapses (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> for potential crosstalk mechanisms). Further experiments will be required to test whether EC or NO are sufficient to induce AA-LTP when stimulating AA inputs on their own.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>PF synapses</title><p>In the experimental conditions used here, the induction protocol had no significant effect on the amplitude of the PF-EPSC although we observed a tendency to decrease. This was unexpected because the induction protocol we used, when applied to PF only and with inhibition preserved, was previously shown to induce PF-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2002</xref>), although not always (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">González-Calvo et al., 2021</xref>). But <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binda et al., 2016</xref> also showed that PF-LTP was not sustained when inhibition was blocked during induction, contradicting other studies performed with inhibition blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouvier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piochon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schonewille et al., 2021</xref>) with Picrotoxin or Bicuculline (a blocker of SK channels, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khawaled et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, PF-LTP either relied on mGluR1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binda et al., 2016</xref>), or NMDAR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bidoret et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouvier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schonewille et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we do not have an explanation for the lack of PF-LTP, but the literature shows multiple contradictions, likely indicating that the processes involved are sensitive to the experimental conditions. Noticeable experimental differences with the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binda et al., 2016</xref> are the use of mice rather than rats, differences in the orientation of cut of the slices, which might have resulted in the study of different cerebellar lobules, but importantly also, we used a low internal Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration, reproducing the concentration estimated in PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chavas and Marty, 2003</xref>), and the recording solution was supplemented with 10 µM of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer EGTA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of inhibition</title><p>Experiments were performed with inhibition preserved and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs activation was shown to secure efficient induction of AA-LTP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Block of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs did not suppress the initial increase in amplitude, but under these conditions, plasticity was not sustained, highly variable, and not significant when compared to control experiments. Inhibition indeed seems to interfere with plasticity induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rowan et al., 2018</xref>). At this stage, we have no detail on the mechanism of influence of GABAergic inhibition in AA-LTP induction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binda et al., 2016</xref> showed that hyperpolarisation by IPSCs relieves inactivation of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, themselves regulated by mGluR1, boosting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and triggering PF-LTP. That mechanism would seem compatible with our results at AA synapses although we do not know whether it requires NMDARs activation. On the other hand, the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rowan et al., 2018</xref> indicated that inhibition decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and as a result converted LTD into LTP. In this study, inhibition was recruited using optogenetics rather than synaptic excitation, and it is possible that the pattern of inhibition generated was less physiological, both with respect to the number of molecular layer interneurons stimulated and timing. This might explain the different results.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Cerebellar physiology</title><p>We argued in the introduction that, as a consequence of morphology, AAs can only form synapses with a few PCs, while PFs course through and synapse with the dendrites of hundreds of PCs. AA synapses are suited to encode precise and selective information from the receptive field, while PF synapses could efficiently represent context. This work is consistent with the idea that they are functionally different and might fulfil distinct roles with respect to the computation performed by the cerebellar cortex. The associative form of plasticity we describe, together with the time dependence, is expected to reinforce AA signals presented conjointly with PF, or within a pertinent time window, while attenuating signals presented in isolation. This would lead to the strengthening of the inputs linked to activity in other receptive fields.</p><p>This work shows that associative plasticity in PCs can be triggered by granule cell inputs independently of the climbing fibre, requiring only moderate inputs, in contrast with the powerful CF, which triggers widespread depolarisation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase.

When filled with the internal solution, recording pipettes had a resistance between 3 and 4 MΩ. Membrane currents were recorded at a pipette potential of –60 mV (not corrected for junction potential of approximately –12 mV pipette-bath). Series resistance was 80–90% compensated. During experiments, the preparation was visualised on an upright microscope (Olympus BFX51; 60 × 0.9 NA water dipping objective) and the bath was continuously perfused at a rate of 5 ml/min (5 bath volumes per min) with solution equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> to maintain pH and solution recirculated.</p><p>Plasticity of GC to PC synapses was studied in horizontal cerebellar slices as these slices better preserve PFs running in the plane of cut. At this age, GC synapses are well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ichikawa et al., 2016</xref>). AAs and PFs were stimulated with patch pipettes slightly larger than those used for recordings filled with a Hepes-buffered external solution and positioned either in the molecular (lower two-thirds) or the GC layer, as discussed in the result section. The baseline amplitude of both AA and PF pathways were sampled with a pair of suprathreshold pulses at 50 ms intervals, delivered every 10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top panel, stimulation was biphasic, 100–180 µs duration, 5–15 V). The AA and PF test stimuli were separated by 0.5 s. Stimulation strength was adjusted between 5 and 15 V to stimulate AA- and PF-EPSCs reliably. PF stimulation was usually very efficient as fibres are densely packed in the molecular layer and PF-EPSC amplitude typically increased smoothly with stimulation intensity. Although we originally worked with large amplitude PF-EPSCs (up to about 1nA), we aimed at amplitudes of a few hundred pA, closer to the amplitude of stimulated AA-EPSCs, by adjusting stimulation intensity. Granule cell somas and axons are more sparse in the granule cell layer and stimulation intensity was adjusted to activate EPSCs a few hundred pA when possible, but increasing stimulation intensity did not necessarily recruit larger EPSCs. Care was taken to avoid stimulating the local Purkinje cell axon and climbing fibre. Once a stable input was obtained, stimulation intensity was raised by one Volt to increase reliability. In most of the experiments, AAs were tested first to avoid possible interference from mGluR1s activation and the release of endocannabinoid by PFs stimulation. No antagonist of the inhibitory inputs was applied. Evoked responses consisted of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that were often quickly followed by inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) (mixed EPSC/IPSC, see Appendix 1). The low Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration in the intracellular solution ensured the reversal potential for Cl<sup>-</sup> was close to the value determined for PCs (–85 mV, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chavas and Marty, 2003</xref>), and IPSCs were outward at the recording potential of –60 mV. After recording a baseline period of at least 10 min, we applied a stimulation protocol aimed at inducing plasticity. The recording configuration was switched to Current clamp and the potential was set and maintained near –65 mV. The protocol applied (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> bottom panel) consisted of the synchronous stimulation of both inputs by a train of 15 pulses at 100 Hz repeated every 3 s a total of 100 times. Following the induction protocol, the recording configuration was returned to Voltage clamp, and the test of alternate AA- and PF-EPSC amplitude resumed.</p><p>Data were excluded from analysis if synaptic stimulation became unstable and resulted in loss of the synaptic response or unstable responses. In the result section the number of cells sometimes differ for the two pathways for a given set of experiments, because one of the inputs was sometimes lost during the 30 min following induction. Because the protocol was properly applied, the data for the remaining input were included in the results. Occasionally, stimulation of an input started stimulating the Climbing fibre or the Purkinje cell itself during the course of an experiment. Climbing fibre stimulation precludes measurement of the EPSC and could trigger plasticity. Stimulation intensity of that input was reduced to avoid recruiting the fibre or Purkinje cell, and the input was excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of evoked EPSCs</title><p>For the analysis of synaptic currents, raw current traces were exported to Igor Pro (Wavemetrics), and peak excitatory current amplitudes were measured as the minimum of the synaptic response (mixed EPSC/IPSC) over a time window overlapping the peak and spanning a few sampling points of the average EPSC.

performed with inhibition intact and with a Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential close to the value estimated in PCs (–85 mV, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chavas and Marty, 2003</xref>). Because GCs also synapse on molecular layer interneurons, most of the time AA and PF stimulation recruits monosynaptic excitation and disynaptic inhibition to PCs, generating a mixed synaptic response with excitatory and inhibitory currents of opposite signs, where inhibition comes with a short delay. As a result, the time course of the recorded mixed PSC can be complex. Also, the plasticity protocol might affect EPSCs and IPSCs differently, and the estimate of the peak EPSC and its long-term changes might be affected by the overlapping inhibitory currents. To control for possible errors in the estimate of the excitatory peak amplitude, in a set of experiments, we made short applications of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist SR95531 (SR) before and after induction, to isolate the excitatory from the inhibitory component of the synaptic response. We assumed that the mixed PSCs are the arithmetic sum of two synaptic functions: an EPSC and a delayed IPSC.

For the IPSC a quadratic exponential rise gave a good fit.</p><p>The pharmacologically-isolated EPSCs (measured between 2–3 min after SR perfusion) were used to characterise the kinetic parameters of the excitatory responses, and were well described by the fitting function. The fitting EPSC function was then subtracted from the recorded mixed PSC to extract the IPSC component of the response. Since we observed an effect of SR application on the amplitude of EPSCs (presynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are known to modulate release probability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stell et al., 2007</xref>), the EPSC fitting function was first rescaled to match the rise of the mixed response before subtraction. The resulting inhibitory component of the response was well-fitted by the IPSC function and allowed us to estimate its kinetic parameters. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref> shows the average time course of the mixed response normalised to the peak EPSC for both AA and PF, and the extracted excitatory and inhibitory components, during baseline for all cells (n=7). The average delays and decay time parameters estimated were: tau-decay: 5 ± 1 ms for excitatory (n=7), 6.5 ± 1.6 ms for inhibitory (n=6) responses for AA stimulation and 4.4 ± 0.6 ms for excitatory (n=7) and 5 ± 1 ms for inhibitory (n=4) responses for PF stimulation; average delay between inhibitory and excitatory current onset: 1.51 ± 0.15 ms for AA stimulation (n=6), and 1.7 ± 0.3 ms for PF stimulation (n=4).</p><p>To measure the excitatory and inhibitory components of the evoked mixed EPSC/IPSC before and after the induction protocol, we first recorded the AA- and PF- mixed PSCs for a short control period and then applied the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 (3 μM) for 3–4 min. SR was then washed off the slice for 15–20 min, the induction protocol was applied, and the synaptic response was monitored for a further 30 min. SR was applied again to monitor the isolated EPSCs at the end of the experiment. For each experiment, the EPSC fitting functions obtained during the first application of SR were used to calculate the amplitude of the two synaptic components during the period preceding induction (10 min), and those obtained from the second SR application at the end of the recordings, to calculate the amplitudes after induction (30 min). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref> shows an example of analysis of excitatory and inhibitory components before and after the induction protocol, with mixed PSCs and corresponding excitatory and inhibitory fitting functions, which shows an increase of the AA-EPSC and a decrease of the PF-EPSC, together with an increase of the IPSC in both pathways. In these experiments, the inhibitory disynaptic component evoked by both AA and PF stimulations had a tendency to increase after the pairing protocol, indicating that excitation and inhibition do not necessarily change in the same direction. However, due to the small sample and the absence of an inhibitory component in some of the experiments, long-term changes in the inhibitory synaptic components were not significantly different from baseline (average change in peak IPSC: 130 ± 50% for the AA pathway, p=0.4 of being bigger than baseline n=5; and 150 ± 50% for the PF pathway, p=0.2 of being bigger than baseline, n=4). When measured at the end of the plasticity experiments, the decay time of the excitatory responses estimated was: tau-decay: 7 ± 2 ms (n=7, not significantly different from baseline, p=0.14) for AA stimulation and 6.0 ± 0.7 ms (n=7, significantly different from baseline, p=0.026) for PF stimulation.</p><p>On average, the plasticity of the AA- and PF-EPSC (measured by the usual method of the amplitude of the minimum of the PSC response) in these experiments was not significantly different from that in control experiments (AA pathway: 160 ± 30%, as compared to 131 ± 7% in control, p=0.4, n=7 et n=24 and PF pathway 65 ± 9%, as compared to 65 ± 5% in control, p=1, n=7 et n=25 for SR and control, respectively; the ratio of normalised AA/PF responses: 3 ± 1, p=0.76, n=7 et n=24), showing that the short applications of GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist did not influence the plasticity outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). We thus analysed the change in amplitude of the stimulated pathways using the two separated EPSC/IPSC components obtained by the fitting method before and after the induction protocol to check for differences with respect to the standard method used in all other experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> compares, for each cell, the AA- and PF-EPSCs relative amplitudes obtained by direct measure of the mixed PSC minimum with those obtained with the fitting method. The two methods of measurement are equivalent. The delayed onset of the inhibitory component limits its impact on the EPSC amplitude.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dissecting excitation and inhibition shows that excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitude and long term changes are well estimated with the direct measure method.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fitting procedure used to extract the excitatory and inhibitory components of the recorded mixed PSCs (EPSC + IPSC).

Although we acknowledge that the stimulation and recording conditions were different from those of other studies, according to the literature (e.g. Bouvier et al 2016, Piochon et al 2016, Binda et al, 2016, Schonewille et al 2021 and others), high-frequency stimulation of parallel fibers leads to long-term postsynaptic potentiation under many different experimental conditions (blocked or unblocked inhibition, stimulation protocols, internal solution composition). Furthermore, in vivo experiments have confirmed that high-frequency parallel fibers are likely to induce long-term potentiation (Jorntell and Ekerot, 2002; Wang et al, 2009).</p><p>This article provides further evidence that long-term plasticity (LTP and LTD) at this connection is a complex and subtle mechanism underpinned by many different transduction pathways. It would therefore have been interesting to test different protocols or conditions to explain the discrepancies observed in this dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>Even though this is not the main result of this study, we acknowledge that the control experiments done on PF stimulation add a puzzling result to an already contradictory literature. High frequency parallel fibre stimulation (in isolation) has been shown to induce long term potentiation in vitro, but not always, and most importantly, this has been shown in vivo. This was the reason for choosing that particular stimulation protocol. Examination of in vitro studies, however, show that the results are variable and even contradictory. Most were done in the presence of GABAA receptor antagonists, including the SK channel blocker Bicuculline, whereas in the study by Binda (2016), LTP was blocked by GABAA receptor inhibition. In some studies also, LTP was under the control of NMDAR activation only, whereas in Binda (2016), it was under the control of mGluR activation. Moreover, most experiments were done in mice, whereas our study was done in rats. Our results reveal multiple mechanisms working together to produce plasticity, which are highly sensitive to in vitro conditions. We designed our experiments to be close to the physiological conditions, with inhibition preserved and a physiological chloride gradient. It is likely that experimental differences have given rise to the variability of the results and our inability to reproduce PF-LTP, but it was not the aim of this study to dissect the subtleties of the different experimental protocols and models.</p><p>We have modified the Discussion to cover that point fully.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another important weakness is the lack of evidence that the AAs were stimulated. Indeed, without filling the PC with fluorescent dye or biocytin during the experiment, and without reconstructing the anatomical organization, it is difficult to assess whether the stimulating pipette is positioned in the GC cluster that is potentially in contact with the PC with the AAs. According to EM microscopy, AAs account for 3% of the total number of synapses in a PC, which could represent a significant number of synapses. Although the idea that AAs repeatedly contact the same Purkinje cell has been propagated, to the best of the review author's knowledge, no direct demonstration of this hypothesis has yet been published. In fact, what has been demonstrated (Walter et al 2009; Spaeth et al 2022) is that GCs have a higher probability of being connected to nearby PCs, but are not necessarily associated with AAs.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that we have not identified morphologically ascending axon synapses, and we stress this fact both in the first paragraph of the Results section, and again at the beginning of Discussion. Our point is mainly topographical, given the well documented geometrical organisation of the cerebellar cortex. Strictly speaking, inputs are local (including AAs) or distal (PFs). Similarly, the studies by Isope and Barbour (2002) and Walter et al. (2009), just like Sims and Hartell (2005 and 2006), have coined the term ‘ascending axon’ when drawing conclusions about locally stimulated inputs. Moreover, our results do not rely on or assume multiple contacts, stronger connections, or higher probability of connections between ascending axons and Purkinje cells. Our results only demonstrate a different plasticity outcome for the two types of inputs. Therefore, our manuscript could be rephrased with the terms ‘local’ and ‘distal’ granule cell inputs, but this would have no more implication for the results or the computation performed in Purkinje cells. However, in our experience, these terms are more confusing, and consistent with the literature, we do not wish to make this modification. However, we have modified the abstract of the manuscript to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe a form of synaptic plasticity at synapses from granule cells onto Purkinje cells in the mouse cerebellum, which is specific to synapses proximal to the cell body but not to distal ones.

Therefore, plasticity is not relative to a stable baseline, but relative to a process of continuous decline that occurs whether or not there is any plasticity-inducing stimulus.</p></disp-quote><p>As highlighted by the reviewer, we observed a postsynaptic rundown of the EPSC amplitude for both input pathways. Rundown could be mistaken for a depression of synaptic currents, not for a potentiation, and the progressive decrease of the EPSC amplitude during the course of an experiment leads to an underestimate of the absolute potentiation. We have taken the view to provide a strong set of control data rather than selecting experiments based on subjective criteria or applying a cosmetic compensation procedure. We have conducted control experiments with no induction (n = 17), which give a good indication of the speed and amplitude of the rundown. Comparison shows a highly significant potentiation of the ascending axon EPSC. Depression of the parallel fibre EPSC, on the other hand, was not significantly different from rundown, and we have not spoken of parallel fibre long term depression. The data show thus very clearly that ascending axon and parallel fibre synapses behave differently following the costimulation protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>The focus of the authors on the properties of two different synapse-types on cerebellar Purkinje cells is interesting and relevant, given previous results that ascending and parallel fiber synapses might be functionally different and undergo different forms of plasticity. In addition, the interaction between these two synapse types during plasticity is important for understanding cerebellar function. The demonstration of timing and order-dependent potentiation of only one pathway, and not another, after associative stimulation of both pathways, changes our understanding of potential plasticity mechanisms. In addition, this observation opens up many new questions on underlying intracellular mechanisms as well as on its relevance for cerebellar learning and adaptation.</p><p>Weaknesses and suggested improvements:</p><p>A concern with this study is that all recordings demonstrate &quot;rundown&quot;, a progressive decrease in the amplitude of the EPSC, starting during the baseline period and continuing after the plasticity-induction stimulus. In the absence of a stable baseline, it is hard to know what changes in strength actually occur at any set of synapses. Moreover, the issues that are causing rundown are not known and may or may not be related to the cellular processes involved in synaptic plasticity. This concern applies in particular to all the experiments where there is a decrease in synaptic strength.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided an answer to that point directly below the summary paragraph. We will just add here that if the phenomenon causing rundown was involved in plasticity, it should affect plasticity of both inputs, which was not the case, clearly distinguishing the ascending axon and parallel fibre inputs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should consider changes in the shape of the EPSC after plasticity induction, as in Fig 1 (orange trace) as this could change the interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1 shows an average response composed of evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. The third section of Supplementary material (supplementary figure 3) shows that this complex shape is given by an EPSC followed by a delayed disynaptic IPSC. We would like to point out that while separating EPSC from IPSC might appear difficult from average traces due to the averaged jitter in the onset of the synaptic currents, boundaries are much clearer when analysing individual traces. In the same section we discuss the results of experiments in which transient applications of SR 95531 before and after the induction protocol allowed us to measure the EPSC, while maintaining the same experimental conditions during induction. Analysis of the kinetics of the EPSCs during SR application at the beginning and end of experiments, showed that there is no change in the time to peak of both AA and PF response. The decay time of AA- and PF-EPSCs are slightly longer at the end of the experiment, even if the difference is not significant for AA inputs. This analysis has been added to the Supplementary material. Our analysis, that uses as template the EPSCs kinetics measured at the beginning and at the end of the experiments, takes directly into account these changes. The results show clearly that the presence of disynaptic inhibition doesn’t significantly affect the measure of the peak EPSC after the induction protocol nor the estimate of plasticity.</p><p>In addition, the inconsistency with previous results is surprising and is not explained; specifically, that no PF-LTP was induced by PF-alone repeated stimulation.</p><p>In our experimental conditions, PF-LTP was not induced when stimulating PF only, the condition that reproduces experiments in the literature. As discussed in our response to reviewer 1, a close look at the literature, however, reveals variabilities and contradictions behind seemingly similar results. They reveal intricate mechanisms working together to produce plasticity, which are sensitive to in vitro conditions. We designed our experiments to be close to physiological conditions, with inhibition preserved and a physiological chloride gradient. It is likely that experimental differences have given rise to the variability of the results and our inability to observe PF-LTP. We have modified the Discussion section to cover that point thoroughly in the context of past results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors test the role of NMDARs, GABAARs and mGluRs in the phenotype they describe. The data suggest that the form of plasticity described here is dependent on any one of the three receptors. However, the location of these receptors varies between the Purkinje cells, granule cells and interneurons. The authors do not describe a convincing hypothetical model in which this dependence can be explained. They suggest that there is crosstalk between AA and PF synapses via endocannabinoids downstream of mGluR or NO downstream of NMDARs. However, it is not clear how this could lead to the long-term potentiation that they describe. Also, there is no long-lasting change in paired-pulse ratio, suggesting an absence of changes in presynaptic release.</p></disp-quote><p>We suggest in the result section that the transient change in paired pulse ratio (PPR) is linked to a transient presynaptic effect, but there was no significant long term change of the PPR, suggesting that the long term effects observed are linked to postsynaptic changes. We now stress this point in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>Concerning the involvement of multiple molecular pathways, investigators often tested for the involvement of NMDAR or mGluRs in cerebellar plasticity, rarely both. Here we showed that both pathways are involved. The conjunctive requirement for NMDAR and mGluR activation could easily be explained based on the dependence of cerebellar LTP and LTD on the concentrations of both NO and postsynaptic calcium (Coesman et al., 2004; Safo and Regehr, 2005; Bouvier et al., 2016; Piochon et al., 2016).</p><p>We also observed an effect of GABAergic inhibition. GABAergic inhibition was elegantly shown by Binda (2016) to regulate calcium entry together with mGluRs, and control plasticity induction. A similar mechanism could contribute to our results, although inhibition might have additional effects. We have modified the Discussion of the manuscript to clarify the pathways involved in plasticity and added a diagram to highlight the links between the different molecular pathways, potential cross talk mechanisms, and the location of receptors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the synapse that undergoes plasticity correctly identified? In this study, since GABAergic inhibition is not blocked for most experiments, PF stimulation can result in both a direct EPSC onto the Purkinje cell and a disynaptic feedforward IPSC. The authors do address this issue with Supplementary Fig 3, where the impact of the IPSC on the EPSC within the EPSC/IPSC sequence is calculated. However, a change in waveform would complicate this analysis. An experiment with pharmacological blockade will make the interpretation more robust. The observed dependence of the plasticity on GABAA receptors is an added point in favor of the suggested additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We did consider that due to long recording times there might be kinetic changes, and that’s the reason why the experiments of Supplementary figure 3 were done with pharmacological blockade of GABAAR with SR, both before and again after LTP induction. The estimate of the amplitude of the EPSC is based on the actual kinetics of the response at both times.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A primary hypothesis of this study is that proximal, or AA, and distal, or PF, synapses are different and that their association is specifically what drives plasticity. The alternative hypothesis is that the two synapse-types are the same. Therefore, a good control for pairing AA with PF would be to pair AA with AA and PF with PF, thereby demonstrating that pairing with each other is different from pairing with self.</p></disp-quote><p>Pairing AA with AA would be difficult because stimulation of AA can only be made from a narrow band below the PC and we would likely end up stimulating overlapping sets of synapses. However, Figure 5 shows the effect of stimulating PF and PF, while also mimicking the sparse and dense configuration of the control experiment. It shows that sparse PF do not behave like AA. Sims and Hartell (2006) also made an experiment with sparse PF inputs and observed clear differences between sparse local (AA) and sparse distal (PF) synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is hypothesized that the association of a PF input with an AA input is similar to the association of a PF input with a CF input. However, the two are very different in terms of cellular location, with the CF input being in a position to directly interact with PF-driven inputs. Therefore, there are two major issues with this hypothesis: (1) how can subthreshold activity at one set of synapses affect another located hundreds of micrometers away on the same dendritic tree? (2) There is evidence that the CF encodes teaching/error or reward information, which is functionally meaningful as a driver of plasticity at PF synapses. The AA synapse on one set of Purkinje cells is carrying exactly the same information as the PF synapses on another set of Purkinje cells further up and down the parallel fiber beam. It is suggested that the two inputs carry sensory vs. motor information, which is why this form of plasticity was tested. However, the granule cells that lead to both the AA and PF synapses are receiving the same modalities of mossy fiber information. Therefore, one needs to presuppose different populations of granule cells for sensory and motor inputs or receptive field and contextual information. As a consequence, which granule cells lead to AA synapses and which to PF synapses will change depending on which Purkinje cell you're recording from. And that's inconsistent with there being a timing dependence of AA-PF pairing in only one direction. Overall, it would be helpful to discuss the functional implications of this form of plasticity.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not hypothesise that association of the AA and PF inputs is similar to the association of PF and climbing fibre inputs. We compare them because it is the other known configuration triggering associative plasticity in Purkinje cells. It is indeed interesting to observe that even if the inputs are very small compared to the powerful climbing fibre input, they can be effective at inducing plasticity. Physiologically, the climbing fibre signal has been linked to error and reward signals, but reward signals are also encoded by granule cell inputs (Wagner et al., 2017). We have modified the discussion to make sure that we do not suggest equivalence with CF induced LTD.</p><p>Moreover, we fully agree that AA and PF synapses made up by a given granule cell carry the same information, and cannot encode sensory and motor information at the same time. AA synapses from a local granule cell deliver information about the local receptive field, but PF synapses from the same granule cell will deliver contextual information about that receptive field to distant Purkinje cells. In the context of sensorimotor learning, movement is learnt with respect to a global context, not in isolation, therefore learning a particular association must be relevant. The associative plasticity we describe here could help explain this functional association. We have clarified the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Granule cells' axons bifurcate to form parallel fibers (PFs) and ascending axons (AAs). While the significance of PFs on cerebellar plasticity is widely acknowledged, the importance of AAs remains unclear. In the current paper, Conti and Auger conducted electrophysiological experiments in rat cerebellar slices and identified a new form of synaptic plasticity in the AA-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses. Upon simultaneous stimulation of AAs and PFs, AA-PC EPSCs increased, while PFs-EPSCs decreased. This suggests that synaptic responses to AAs and PFs in PCs are jointly regulated, working as an additional mechanism to integrate motor/sensory input. This finding may offer new perspectives in studying and modeling cerebellum-dependent behavior. Overall, the experiments are performed well. However, there are two weaknesses. First, the baseline of electrophysiological recordings is influenced significantly by run-down, making it difficult to interpret the data quantitatively. The amplitude of AA-EPSCs is relatively small and the run-down may mask the change. The authors should carefully reexamine the data with appropriate controls and statistics. Second, while the authors show AA-LTP depends on mGluR, NMDA receptors, and GABA-A receptors, which cell types express these receptors and how they contribute to plasticity is not clarified. The recommended experiments may help to improve the quality of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As highlighted by the reviewer and developed above in response to reviewer 2, we observed a postsynaptic rundown of the EPSC amplitude. Rundown could be mistaken for a depression of synaptic currents, not for a potentiation. Moreover, we have conducted control experiments with no induction (n = 17), which give a good indication of the speed and amplitude of the rundown, and provide a baseline. Comparison shows a highly significant potentiation of the ascending axon EPSC, relative to baseline and relative to these control experiments. Depression of the parallel fibre EPSC on the other hand was not significantly different from rundown. For that reason we have not spoken of parallel fibre long term depression. The data, however, show that ascending axon and parallel fibre synapses behave very differently following the costimulation protocol.</p><p>We have discussed above in our response to reviewer 2 the potential involvement of mGluRs, NMDARs and GABAARs.

Careful control experiments with SR application presented in supplementary figure 3 show that the delay of the IPSC does not significantly affect measurement of the peak amplitude of the EPSC. The reversal potential for Clin our study (-85 mV), chosen to reproduce the physiological gradient in Purkinje cells, is too low to record from Purkinje cells at this potential in good conditions as it activates the hyperpolarisation activated cation current Ih, generating huge inward currents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is not clear whether, during the current clamp, the potential was maintained at -65 mV throughout the induction protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>The potential was set and maintained around -65mV during the induction protocol. The method section has been amended to specify that point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Experiments using GABAB or endocannabinoid antagonists would have been interesting to assess the role of presynaptic plasticity occluding postsynaptic plasticity.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure why the reviewer suggested these particular experiments to test for the role of presynaptic plasticity. GABAB and endocannabinoid receptor activation both have presynaptic effects at granule cell to Purkinje cell synapses. They decrease release probability, and as a result increase the paired pulse ratio (Dittman and Regehr, 1997; Safo and Regehr, 2005). Here we only observed a transient decrease of the paired pulse ratio. Additionally, presynaptic endocannabinoid receptor activation, linked to postsynaptic mGluR1 activation and release of endocannabinoids, was shown to be required for induction of postsynaptic PF-LTD (Safo and Regehr, 2005). This effect required climbing fibre stimulation and mGluR activation. Here we show that mGluR1 inhibition did not inhibit the PF depression nor affect the transient change in PPR. Therefore there is no indication that activation of these receptors could induce a pre-synaptic depression occluding postsynaptic plasticity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- To give credit to this new plasticity in contradiction with many previous studies, induction pathways should be addressed more deeply.</p></disp-quote><p>As developed earlier in response to the public review, this study does not contradict previous studies, expect maybe that by Binda et al., (2016), conducted on mice. From our point of view, our study in fact reconciles past results which have alternatively involved the mGluR or NMDAR pathways, whereas the molecular downstream pathways they recruit can easily cooperate. We aim to describe a new phenomenon and we cannot cover the mechanistic dissection which has been performed to date on plasticity in the cerebellar cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The quality of the figures could be enhanced by modifying the dashed line.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the dashed line more discrete.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- Is there cross-talk between the two synaptic pathways?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to explain the associative nature of AA-LTP we suggest that a signal is generated at the AA input during the induction protocol only when the PF input is also stimulated, i.e. a form of cross-talk takes place between the two synaptic territories.

We discuss possible cross-talk mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Clarification question: &quot;While the peak amplitude of the first response in the pair of stimulations showed a progressive decline, the peak amplitude of the second response of both AA and PF underwent either LTP or LTD respectively...&quot; Does this mean that all LTP/LTD figures show the amplitude of the second EPSC in the paired pulse stimulation, and that the first EPSC has a different response?

Figure legends have been amended to clarify this point. The average values given in the Results section and figure legends relate to the first EPSC only for clarity. As can be seen from the figures, long term plasticity affected the first and second EPSC in a very similar manner.

Based on the results of PPR (mostly unchanged after induction), the post-synaptic mechanism may be more significant. Supplemental Figure 2C shows a trend toward a positive correlation between AALTP and the number of spikes, suggesting intracellular calcium levels in the post-synaptic Purkinje cells may be important. Whether this is true or not can be directly tested by the addition of BAPTA in the recording pipettes.</p></disp-quote><p>The absence of a long lasting effect on the paired pulse ratio (PPR) indicates that postsynaptic mechanisms are involved in long term changes. This is in line with the dependence of plasticity induced with similar protocols on the concentrations of NO and postsynaptic calcium, both affecting postsynaptic targets, as developed in our response to reviewer 2. BAPTA interferes with calcium and mGluR signalling, and could be used to further confirm the involvement of a postsynaptic mechanism, however, we did not wish to pursue further the dissection of the signalling cascade. We have modified the Results and Discussion sections to include a discussion of pre and postsynaptic mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Most results from the plasticity experiments are shown as average/sem and do not include individual data, making ithard to appreciate the magnitude of the changes. The authors could show the individual data at some time points (e.g. 5 min before and 30 min after induction), plot bar-graphs (Figure 2C with individual data), or boxplots to compare different conditions and perform statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>Individual data points are now visible for plasticity induction in Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 2 for a number of conditions. Statistics have been performed as detailed in the text and legend of Fig 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In addressing point #2, it is strongly recommended that the authors include the values for controls without inductionbecause AA/PF-EPSCs undergo significant run-down. In most experiments, the authors compare the magnitude of plasticity with baseline changes in Supplemental Figure 1. This should not be appropriate for some experiments, such as Figures 3 &amp; 4, where pharmacological treatments are performed. The authors should carefully consider including the appropriate controls from baseline recording to rule out significant confound by the run-down.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that control experiments without stimulation (no Stim) are only appropriate controls for the initial synchronous stimulation and AA and PF only experiments (Fig 1). All the other experiments were compared to the synchronous stimulation experiments, not to control No Stim. The synchronous stimulation protocol is strictly the same as that applied in experiments with pharmacological treatments and the appropriate control to test whether treatments affected plasticity. This is now systematically specified in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors recorded mixed EPSC/IPSCs and used a fitting approach to extract EPSCs. Applying AMPA-receptor blockers to check that extracted IPSCs are correctly predicted may solidify the reliability of the approach. An additional concern is that this approach can only be used if the waveform of EPSC/IPSC does not change with plasticity. The authors should compare the waveforms between conditions to address this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Fits were not used to extract EPSCs. EPSCs were isolated by blocking IPSCs with SR95531, and the IPSCs were then extracted by subtraction from the mixed EPSC/IPSC. Fits were then done of the isolated EPSC and the extracted IPSC. This procedure was applied both at the start of the experiment and at the end to avoid changes in kinetics that would influence measurements. A section of supplementary material is devoted to this analysis. Isolating IPSCs using AMPAR blockers is not possible as IPSCs are disynaptic. AMPAR blockers would fully suppress inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) While the AA-LTP depends on NMDA-Rs, which cell type is responsible is not clear. Recording NMDA components in AA/PF-EPSCs should be informative in addressing this point. Cesana et al suggested that AA induces significant activation of NMDA-Rs in Golgi cells (PMID: 23884948). Whether AA stimuli could significantly evoke NMDA current in the experimental condition used in this paper could provide essential information.</p></disp-quote><p>The granule cell to Purkinje cell EPSCs are devoid of an NMDAR component (Llano et al., 1991), and there is no postsynaptic NMDARs at granule cell to PC synapses, but a proportion of presynaptic boutons show the presence of NMDARs (Bidoret et al, 2009). This is now stated clearly on p8. Presynaptic NMDAR have been involved in LTP and LTD of parallel fibre synapses (Casado et al., 2002; Bouvier et al., 2016; Schonewille et al., 2021), and linked to the activation of NOS in granule cell axons. However, we do not know whether presynaptic NMDARs are also present at AA synapses. NMDAR and NOS are also expressed by molecular layer interneurons, and have sometimes been involved in LTD induction (Kono et al., 2019), although this is disputed. In the paper by Cesana (2013), white matter stimulation activated mossy fibre inputs to granule cells, and as a consequence, granule cell to Golgi cell disynaptic EPSCs. The authors identified AA synapses on the basolateral dendrites of Golgi cells, and showed NMDAR activation associated with the mossy fibre to granule cell EPSC. Granule cell to Golgi cell synapses were shown to activate both postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptors (Dieudonné, 1999). But to our knowledge, Golgi cells do not express NOS. Therefore it is unlikely that activation of NMDARs in Golgi cells is linked to synaptic plasticity in Purkinje cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Pharmacological experiments in Figure 3 show that AA-LTP is dependent on mGluR. The authors mentioned that it could be explained by the presence and absence of mGluRs in PFs and AAs, respectively. This is an important and reasonable possibility and should be tested. The authors could simply check whether slow EPSCs can be recorded by the AA activation.</p></disp-quote><p>Activation of the mGluR slow EPSC by AA stimulation would reveal the presence of mGluRs at AA inputs. We know, however, that sparse PF stimulation does not activate the mGluR slow EPSC nor endocannabinoid release unless glutamate transporters are blocked (Marcaggi and Attwell., 2005). This is thought to reflect insufficient glutamate buildup in the sparse configuration to activate mGluR1s. AA inputs are sparsely distributed and are not expected to activate the slow EPSC either, and this is confirmed by our own experiments (CA personal communication). However, mGluR1 mediated Ca2+ release from stores shows a higher sensitivity to glutamate than the slow EPSC (Canepari and Ogden, 2006) and might take place with sparse inputs, but Ca2+ signals have not been investigated in this configuration. Therefore the absence of the slow EPSC is not sufficient proof that mGluR1s are not activated and not present at AA synapses. This is now further discussed p12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) The authors should describe how they adjusted the stimulation strength for both AAs and PFs.</p></disp-quote><p>Adjustment of the stimulation intensity is now described in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A rationale explaining why the authors chose the current induction protocol (synchronous stimulation of both inputs) should be included.

Moreover, based on the morphology of the cerebellar granule cell and Purkinje cell, AA and PF inputs can carry different information to a given Purkinje cell. We reasoned that co-presentation of the inputs might represent an important piece of information for the circuit, signalling functional association, and lead to plasticity, as seen for motor command and sensory feedback in cerebellar-like structures, or for PF and climbing fibre.
