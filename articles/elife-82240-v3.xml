While a plethora of genomic data reveals the long-term fate of diverging coding sequences and their <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, little is known about the early dynamics around the duplication event itself. In microorganisms, selection for increased gene expression often drives the expansion of gene copy-number mutations, which serves as a crude adaptation, prior to divergence through refining point mutations. Using a simple synthetic genetic reporter system that can distinguish between copy-number and point mutations, we study their early and transient adaptive dynamics in real time in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We find two qualitatively different routes of adaptation, depending on the level of functional improvement needed. In conditions of high gene expression demand, the two mutation types occur as a combination. However, under low gene expression demand, copy-number and point mutations are mutually exclusive; here, owing to their higher frequency, adaptation is dominated by copy-number mutations, in a process we term amplification hindrance. Ultimately, due to high reversal rates and pleiotropic cost, copy-number mutations may not only serve as a crude and transient adaptation, but also constrain sequence divergence over evolutionary time scales.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>copy-number mutation</kwd><kwd>evolutionary dynamics</kwd><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>duplication divergence</kwd><kwd>point mutations</kwd><kwd>promoter evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In bacteria, frequent adaptive copy-number mutations can hinder the fixation of beneficial point mutations and hence the divergence of duplicated DNA sequences.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adaptive evolution proceeds by selection acting on mutations, which are often implicitly equated with point mutations, that is, changes to a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence. However, nature is full of different types of bigger-scale mutations, such as mutations to the copy-number of genomic regions ranging from only a few base pairs up to half a bacterial chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Roth, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Darmon and Leach, 2014</xref>). The specific properties of mutations, such as their rate of formation and reversal, might influence the evolutionary dynamics in major ways, but are rarely considered.</p><p>In bacteria, which are our focus, the duplication of genes or genomic regions occurs orders of magnitude more frequently than point mutations, ranging from 10<sup>–6</sup> up to 10<sup>–2</sup> per cell per generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roth, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drake et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reams and Roth, 2015</xref>). Moreover, while duplications can form via different mechanisms, they all are genetically unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>); the repeated stretch of DNA sequence is prone to <italic>recA</italic>-dependent homologous recombination. At rates between 10<sup>–3</sup> and 10<sup>–1</sup> per cell per generation duplications will reverse to the single copy (deletion) or duplicate further (amplification) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roth, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pettersson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reams and Roth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>). Amplification of a gene or genomic region will, to a first approximation, increase its expression by means of elevated gene dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yona et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steinrueck and Guet, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belikova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Todd and Selmecki, 2020</xref>). Not surprisingly, due to their high rate of formation, gene amplifications are adaptive in situations where a rapid increase in gene expression is needed: resistance to antibiotics, pesticides or drugs via over-expression of resistance determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prody et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albertson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bass and Field, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicoloff et al., 2019</xref>), immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belikova et al., 2020</xref>), or novel metabolic capabilities through increased expression of spurious enzymatic side activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blount et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richts et al., 2021</xref>). Due to their high intrinsic rate of deletion, often combined with significant fitness cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pettersson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reams et al., 2010</xref>), copy-number mutations not only differ from point mutations in their frequency of occurrence, but also in the nature of their reversibility.</p><p>Together, copy-number and point mutations are responsible for the evolution of most functional novelty of genes through the process of duplication and divergence of existing genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohno, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kacser and Beeby, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conant and Wolfe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andersson et al., 2015</xref>). Owing to the dynamic nature of gene duplication formation and reversal, the interplay between copy-number and point mutations may lead to complex evolutionary dynamics around the time point of origin of a new gene duplication event. However, so far most attention has been focused on understanding the long-lasting process of how duplicate gene pairs diverge by accumulating point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lynch and Conery, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Teufel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedlander et al., 2017</xref>), while we know little about the potentially short-lived initial duplication event itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>). On one hand, this bias is due to significant technical challenges in studying transient copy-number variation experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lauer and Gresham, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belikova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>), and on the other hand, research has focused on the plethora of long-term evolutionary data that document the sequence divergence of paralogs, as ‘attention is shifted to where the data are’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kondrashov, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In bacteria adaptive amplification, that is, amplification as a response to selection as opposed to neutral duplication and divergence, is considered the default mode of paralog evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Treangen and Rocha, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Copley, 2020</xref>) and has been conceptualized in the innovation-amplification-divergence (IAD) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>), which was later validated by evolution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>). The IAD model posits that selection for a novel enzymatic activity leads to adaptive gene amplification that increases expression of an existing enzyme if it exhibits low levels of a beneficial secondary enzymatic activity (also referred to as promiscuous functions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tawfik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Copley, 2017</xref>). Eventually, protein sequences diverge as point mutations improve the secondary enzymatic function: a new protein function is born from an existing one. After the new (improved) function is present, superfluous additional gene copies will be lost due to their cost and high rate of reversibility, leaving only the copies of the two (ancestral and evolved) paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, adaptive amplification can precede the divergence of promoter sequences under selection favouring increased gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steinrueck and Guet, 2017</xref>). Thus, gene amplifications serve as a fast adaptation which can later be replaced by point mutations either within the coding region of a gene, increasing a cryptic enzymatic activity, or in its non-coding promoter region, increasing its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yona et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steinrueck and Guet, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Since elevated numbers of gene copies provide an increased target for point mutations to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">San Millan et al., 2017</xref>), it has been suggested that copy-number mutations speed up the process of divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>). However, if both, copy-number and point mutations, are adaptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>), they also have the potential to interact epistatically or due to clonal interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerrish and Lenski, 1998</xref>). This interaction could result in unexpected evolutionary dynamics due to the different rates of formation and reversal of the two different mutation types.</p><p>To fill the knowledge gap that exists at around ‘time zero’ of the duplication-divergence process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>), we designed a synthetic genetic system with which we can monitor, in real time, arising copy-number and point mutations in evolving populations of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Importantly, while our results are also relevant to the divergence of paralogous protein sequences, here we study the process of divergence in a model gene promoter. Our genetic reporter system allows us to phenotypically distinguish between copy-number and point mutations, by specifically selecting for the increased expression of an existing but barely expressed gene. With our system at hand, we set out to test whether adaptive copy-number mutations facilitate or hinder adaptation by point mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The motivation for this work was sparked by an evolution experiment conducted in <italic>E. coli</italic> at a locus exhibiting high rates of gene amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steinrueck and Guet, 2017</xref>), which failed to produce any evolved clones with point mutations and thus lead us to hypothesize that copy-number mutations may interfere with the evolution by point mutations under certain conditions.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>An experimental system that distinguishes copy-number and point mutations</title><p>To study the interplay between copy-number and point mutations during adaptation, we follow the fate of a barely expressed gene during its evolution towards higher expression. Our experimental system consists of an intact endogenous <italic>galK</italic> gene of <italic>E. coli</italic> that harbours a random promoter sequence (P0) that replaces its endogenous promoter. By growing <italic>E. coli</italic> in the presence of the sugar galactose, we are selecting for increased <italic>galK</italic> expression. Adaptation to selection for increased expression can happen by two different, non-mutually exclusives ways: through increased copy-number (duplication or amplification) or through point mutations in the P0 promoter region of <italic>galK</italic> (divergence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our genetic reporter system allows us to distinguish between the two mutation types. <italic>GalK is</italic> part of a chromosomal reporter gene cassette and is transcriptionally fused to a <italic>yfp</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Hence, any increases in <italic>galK</italic> expression – be it by copy-number or point mutations – can be detected as increases in YFP expression. However, only mutations to the copy-number of the entire <italic>galK</italic> locus lead to an additional increase in the expression of an independently transcribed <italic>cfp</italic> gene downstream of <italic>galK-yfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steinrueck and Guet, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Hence, increases in <italic>yfp</italic> alone indicate the divergence of the <italic>galK</italic> promoter sequence P0 by point mutations, while increases of both fluorophores indicate copy-number mutations of the whole locus. Finally, clones with increased <italic>yfp</italic> but without point mutations in P0 would indicate the presence of a <italic>trans</italic>-acting mutation at a different locus on the chromosome or a rare amplification event occurring independent of the repeated IS elements and excluding CFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steinrueck and Guet, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, while in principle possible, an adaptive mutation in the coding sequence of <italic>galK</italic> itself is extremely unlikely to be selected under our experimental conditions given that growth is limited only by expression of the endogenous and fully functional galactokinase enzyme.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An experimental system to study gene duplication and divergence in strains with different duplication rates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of chromosomal selection and reporter cassette.

Two fundamentally different kinds of adaptive mutations are shown on the right: (i) point mutations in P0 lead to increases in GalK-YFP while CFP remains at ancestral single-copy levels (top), (ii) mutations to the copy-number of the whole reporter cassette will increase both YFP and CFP expression (bottom).

A common way to manipulate the duplication rate is by deleting the <italic>recA</italic> gene involved in homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg and Mekalanos, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dhar et al., 2014</xref>). However, given its role in DNA repair, comparing <italic>recA</italic> and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains will be strongly influenced by the growth defects that such a mutation entails. In order to not have to consider pleiotropic effects caused by a difference in the genome-wide duplication rate, we instead compare two identical strains whose difference in duplication rate is restricted to a single genomic locus. To this end, we take advantage of a chromosomal location that is characterized by high rates of duplication and amplification due to homologous recombination occurring between two endogenous identical insertion sequences (IS) elements that flank this specific locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steinrueck and Guet, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>).

The strain lacking one of the flanking IS<italic>1</italic> elements (IS-) showed a drastic reduction in the ability to undergo <italic>galK</italic> amplification. In contrast to the IS+ strain, very few IS- populations evolved increased CFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> – red traces). Interestingly, in the IS+ strain, the number of populations amplified by the end of the experiment depended on the environment. At least twice as many populations were amplified in the low (0.01%) galactose environment compared to the other two environments (68, 19, and 34 populations for low, intermediate, and high galactose, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Not only the number of amplified populations, but also the maximum CFP fluorescence attained by IS+ populations differed significantly between the low (0.01%) and higher (0.1% and 1%) galactose environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Populations, which evolved increases in CFP fluorescence, did so within 2 days and maintained this level relatively stably for the duration of the experiment. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> for an independent evolution experiment confirming the environment-dependent patterns of amplification.) The observed difference in the number of <italic>galK</italic> copies is consistent with the observation that the three environments select for different levels of increasing gene expression (‘levels of improvement’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and confirms that amplifications are an efficient way of tuning gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We then asked whether other differences in the nature of adaptive mutations exist between the three different environments. To get a coarse-grained overview, we plotted the YFP fluorescence of evolving populations as a proxy for <italic>galK</italic> expression against their CFP fluorescence as a proxy for <italic>galK</italic> copy-number for all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The YFP-CFP plot shows that evolving populations exhibit qualitatively different distributions of fluorescence levels in the three different environments, indicating that adaptation has followed different trajectories.</p><p>In the absence of galactose, populations retain their ancestral fluorescence phenotype. In the lowest galactose concentration (0.01%), data points show a correlated increase between YFP and CFP fluorescence indicative of gene copy-number mutations (‘YFP+CFP+’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the intermediate galactose concentration (0.1%) 5/96 IS- populations exhibit increased YFP fluorescence with ancestral (single-copy) CFP fluorescence indicative of promoter mutants, (‘YFP+’ fraction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, sequencing the P0 region upstream of <italic>galK</italic> of these evolved clones from populations with strongly increased YFP fluorescence (‘YFP+’ fraction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) showed that they harboured an ancestral P0 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We hypothesized that the YFP+ populations carried an amplification extending into <italic>galK-yfp,</italic> yet excluding <italic>cfp</italic>. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed our suspicion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). As the IS- strain cannot undergo the frequent duplication via the two flanking IS elements, it cannot access a major adaptive route available to the IS+ strain. Thus, its adaptation follows an alternative trajectory, which occurs through a repeat-independent lower-frequency duplication with junctions between <italic>yfp</italic> and <italic>cfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>While increased CFP still reliably reports on increased copy-number, the <italic>yfp</italic>-only amplification hijacks our ability to unambiguously infer ancestral copy-number from ancestral CFP fluorescence alone. As increasing CFP itself bears no adaptive benefit, populations with increased CFP must carry amplifications that also include <italic>galK</italic>. In contrast, ancestral copy-number can only be confirmed by qPCR. The fact that some populations carry IS-independent <italic>yfp</italic>-only amplifications implies that our system of fluorescence reporters will yield a slight underestimate of the number of amplified populations both in the IS+ and IS- strain. However, we were ultimately interested in the divergence of promoter sequences, and going forward relied on sequencing to unambiguously determine the presence of adaptive promoter mutations.</p><p>In the high (1%) and intermediate (0.1%) galactose environment, data points occupy an additional space (‘mixed fraction’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) between the other two fractions, where both YFP and CFP are increased, but the YFP increase is larger than in the YFP+CFP+ fraction. Based on these population-level data, we hypothesized that this phenotypic space is occupied either by a population of double mutants carrying a combination of point and copy-number mutations, or by populations consisting of cells with only promoter mutations and cells with only copy-number mutations (i.e. the two mutations being mutually exclusive). Knowing the single-cell phenotype is therefore crucial for distinguishing between the two cases. Importantly, single-cell fluorescence (using FACS) recapitulated the population measurements with the YFP-CFP phenotype falling into three distinct fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Copy-number and point mutations occur as a combination in the intermediate and high demand environment</title><p>To understand whether copy-number and point mutations are mutually exclusive or if they occur as a combination in the IS+ strain after evolution in intermediate (0.1%) and high (1%) galactose, we determined the single-cell fluorescence of all mixed fraction populations using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). It is worth noting that after 12 days of evolution, cells with ancestral YFP and CFP fluorescence were still present in every single amplified population.

If instead a population consisted of two mutually exclusive mutants, we would expect cells to fall into two distinct phenotypic clusters, one with only increased YFP (corresponding to the ‘YFP+’ fraction) and one with only amplifications (corresponding to the ‘YFP+CFP+’ fraction). Moreover, YFP fluorescence of the mixed fraction cells was greater than YFP for pure amplification mutants, which falls along the diagonal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> – right panel), again indicating a combination of copy-number and promoter mutations.

Surprisingly, and in contrast to the intermediate and high galactose environments, in low galactose adaptive amplification of IS+ populations happened more rapidly with the majority of populations (68/96) showing increases in CFP fluorescence during the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> – left top and bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Notably, cells of those few populations that did not follow this general trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> – right top and bottom panel) showed an increase in YFP without a concomitant increase in CFP. As this small increase in YFP was not visible in the initial population measurements of liquid cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we turned to patching populations onto LB agar, a potentially more sensitive method, which alleviates changes in fluorescence related to growth rate.

We pooled all 96 populations into pools of 32 and quantified the fraction of SNPs in P0 previously known to be adaptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>). To do so, we subjected PCR amplicons of the pooled populations to next-generation sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We designed our sequencing experiment such that we were able to analyse 39 bp upstream and downstream of the <italic>galK</italic> start codon. We calculated the fraction of sequence reads carrying either one or both most frequently observed adaptive SNPs at position –30 and –37 upstream of the <italic>galK</italic> start codon (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As a control, we also compared the fraction of SNPs within the <italic>galK</italic> gene of the IS+ and IS- evolved under different galactose conditions. In our experimental system, galactose selection is not expected to lead to adaptive mutations anywhere in the coding region of <italic>galK</italic>, as the enzyme itself is fully functional despite lacking a functional promoter sequence. Comparing the fraction of reads with SNPs (i.e. reads with a single SNP in <italic>galK</italic> divided by the number of reads with ancestral <italic>galK</italic>) allowed us to compare across samples with different absolute numbers of sequencing reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with our expectation, the fraction of sequencing reads with a single SNP at any position in <italic>galK</italic> was similar in populations evolved in different galactose concentrations and in the control populations evolved in the absence of galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Amplicon deep sequencing of P0 in pooled evolved populations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left panel) Number of reads carrying a P0 sequence with two adaptive SNPs 30 and 37 bp upstream of <italic>galK</italic>, respectively (‘T&gt;A + C&gt;T’ in blue) or its respective single SNPs (‘T&gt;A’ in green, ‘C&gt;T’ in cyan).

Intriguingly, in low galactose, we found a higher fraction of reads carrying both adaptive single SNPs (–30T&gt;A and –37C&gt;T) in IS- populations than in the IS+ populations. This is consistent with our hypothesis that the more frequent amplification mutants effectively out-compete point mutations in the low demand environment.</p><p>We are here using the fraction of sequencing reads (‘alleles’) with adaptive SNPs divided by the number of ancestral reads as a simple metric of divergence. However, this normalization leads to an underestimation of SNPs if they occur in an amplified background. For instance, a SNP within a cell with four P0-<italic>galK</italic> copies, where one carries an SNP, counts less than a cell with one copy of P0-<italic>galK</italic> carrying one SNP. The rationale for using the fraction of adaptive alleles as our metric of divergence as opposed to the alternative, which is the number of SNPs per cell, is twofold: First, the methodology used here does not allow comparing absolute read counts between samples. Second, and more importantly, due to the random nature of deletion mutations, a single SNP in an amplified array of four copies has a one in four chance of being retained as a lasting divergent copy in the process of amplification and divergence. Hence, the dilution of SNPs by additional amplified copies is not simply a counting artefact, but reflects a biological reality relevant to the very process that we are studying. Therefore, we conclude that in the low demand environment a strain which cannot adapt by gene amplification exhibits a higher level of divergence than a strain which frequently adapts by gene amplification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Evolutionary dynamics between mutation types differ for different initial random promoter sequences</title><p>Given the paucity of point mutations that we observed for the evolution of the random P0 sequence (either a combination of –30T&gt;A and –37C&gt;T or each SNP alone), we wondered whether a greater variety of mutations could be obtained when using a different random promoter sequence as a starting point for evolution. Therefore, we repeated our evolution experiment in the intermediate (0.1%) galactose environment with three additional random promoter sequences (P0-1, P0-2, P0-3).</p><p>After 10 days of evolution, only two out of the four random P0 sequences evolved increased <italic>galK-yfp</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This is roughly consistent with the fact that approximately 60–80% of random sequences are one point mutation away from a functional constitutive promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yona et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lagator et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, P0-1 and P0-3 did not gain any gene duplications or amplifications. At first glance, this drastic difference in gene amplification was unexpected, since the IS+ strains only differ in their P0 sequence, and not in their gene duplication rate. However, random sequences have different abilities to recruit RNA-polymerase, and as a result, different baseline expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yona et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lagator et al., 2022</xref>). Given that a plateau exists in the expression growth relation for low levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the initial expression level conferred by P0-1 and P0-3 might be too low to yield a selective benefit upon gene duplication alone.

In the IS+ strain, almost every single population evolved amplifications within the first 2 days of the evolution experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, only two fractions are visible in the YFP-CFP plots of P0-2. The first fraction is occupied by YFP+ populations carrying a single copy of <italic>cfp</italic>. The second fraction along the diagonal between YFP and CFP is occupied by amplified populations (YFP+CFP+). Moreover, it is shifted towards higher values of YFP/CFP relative to values found for P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that P0-2 exhibits a higher baseline expression level than all the other three random promoter sequences. In contrast to the population-level measurements, single-cell measurements were not sufficiently sensitive to corroborate any difference in leaky expression amongst the four random promoter sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, in line with the observed evolutionary dynamics, P0 and even more so P0-2 confers a significant growth advantage over the other two promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As mentioned above, this suggests that the observed growth advantage of P0-2 populations can explain their rapid amplification dynamics. In agreement with the evolution experiments with P0, the YFP+CFP+ (amplification) fraction is also strongly reduced in the IS- strain for P0-2.</p><p>Intriguingly, with the majority (88/96) of P0-2 IS+ population amplified, six P0-2 IS+ populations that failed to evolve amplifications show an increase in YFP/CFP early in the evolution experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> – left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result combined with the idea that P0-2 exhibits a relatively high baseline expression level and the absence of a mixed fraction for P0-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) suggests that increases in gene expression evolve <italic>either</italic> via gene amplification <italic>or</italic> via point mutation. In other words, because initial <italic>galK</italic> expression is high in P0-2, a small improvement (either amplification or a promoter mutation) is sufficient to reach the required gene expression demand. Thus, the adaptive trajectory of P0-2 in intermediate galactose resembles that of P0 in low galactose as both environments select only for a modest improvement in <italic>galK</italic> expression.</p><p>In contrast to the IS+ strain, where only six populations showed increased YFP/CFP fluorescence that emerged only within the first 3 days of evolution, populations of the IS- strain were evolving increased YFP/CFP fluorescence throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> – right panel). We were curious whether the increase in YFP/CFP in both, IS+ and IS- populations, was due to promoter mutations. Sequencing of randomly picked evolved clones revealed that in the majority (4/6 for IS+, 11/21 for IS-) of clones with increased YFP/CFP indeed harboured a mutation in P0-2, including an SNP, a 12 and a 13 bp deletion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Importantly, colonies of the same populations but with ancestral fluorescence harboured ancestral P0-2 sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that the observed mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) are causal for the increased YFP expression. While finding the causal mutations for the remaining evolved clones with increased YFP but ancestral P0-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) lies outside the scope of the current work, we speculate that they may occur further upstream of P0-2 or could be acting in trans such as mutations in the transcription factor <italic>rho</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steinrueck and Guet, 2017</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the 12 bp deletion mutation, the 13 bp deletion mutation and the SNP were in fact adaptive, we reconstituted these mutations into the ancestral P0-2 strain, where they conferred increased YFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) resulting in increased growth in medium supplemented with galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The finding that the promoter mutations were responsible for increased <italic>galK-yfp</italic> expression was corroborated by the fact that these mutations occurred exclusively in populations with increased YFP but ancestral CFP, and were completely absent in amplified (YFP+CFP+) and ancestral colonies from a random set of 14 IS+ populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). It is worth noting that mutations observed in P0-2 were more diverse than those observed in P0 (seven different mutations including indels, an IS insertion and an SNP in P0-2 versus three different SNPs in P0 – compare <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>). Thus, amplification can interfere with divergence not only by point mutations but also by small insertions and deletions.</p><p>Taken together, the facts that (i) the majority of IS+ populations become rapidly amplified, (ii) with few promoter mutations arising exclusively in the first day in non-amplified populations (mutations are mutually exclusive), and (iii) many more promoter mutations occur in IS- populations throughout the evolution experiment strongly suggest that negative epistasis between frequent copy-number mutation and point mutations hinder fixation of the latter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Amplification hinders divergence by point mutations in the low demand environment</title><p>The experimental results we presented this far suggest that the evolutionary dynamics of duplication/amplification and divergence depend on the level of gene expression increase selected for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In both environments, promoter point mutations evolve at a low rate in a single-copy background. However, if rates of copy-number mutation are high, evolutionary dynamics are dominated by amplification. Irrespective of the environment, this amplification increases the mutational target size for rarer adaptive point mutations to occur. However, only if a strong increase in <italic>galK</italic> expression is selected for (high demand environment), the beneficial effects of both types of mutation add up, and we observe a combination of amplifications and point mutations to occur, in agreement with the IAD model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andersson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Frequent copy-number mutation can hinder adaptation by point mutations.</title><p>Genotype-fitness map (‘fitness landscape’) illustrating the difference between adaptive trajectories of a high demand (<bold>A</bold>) and low demand (<bold>B</bold>) environment, which differ solely by the increase in gene expression they select for.

High rates of duplication and amplification may cause clonal interference between competing mutants, slowing down the fixation of either. Moreover, there needs to be sufficient selective benefit (‘demand’) for two consecutive selective sweeps to occur. If, however, only a modest level of gene expression increase is selected for (low demand environment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), a single mutational event may be sufficient to provide it. Therefore, adaptation is dominated by the more frequent type of mutation, namely copy-number mutation. In other words, amplifications effectively hinder divergence in the low demand environment due to their negative epistatic interaction with point mutations. Thus, in a process, which we term amplification hindrance, the high rate of amplification results in evolutionary dynamics that slow down divergence via two different non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: clonal interference and negative epistasis.</p><p>However, in our experiments mutation rates can be assumed to be equal across environments.

Hence, clonal interference is an unlikely explanation for the absence of combination mutants in the low galactose environment. However, there is a difference in the degree to which strains that harbour amplifications fulfil the necessary gene expression demand posed by the environment they have evolved in. Strains with amplifications evolved in the high and intermediate galactose environment grow slower and to lower densities than a strain with a strong constitutive promoter. In contrast, in the low galactose concentration strains with amplifications evolved in this environment exhibit both yield and growth rate comparable to that of the promoter mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that gaining additional promoter point mutations on top of an amplification would only be beneficial in the higher galactose concentrations, but yield little or no fitness benefit in the low galactose environment.

In contrast, selection for only a modest increase in <italic>galK</italic> expression lead to populations adapting by either gene amplifications or point mutations in their random promoter sequence, but not both simultaneously. Moreover, if amplification occurred early in the experiment, the random promoter sequence P0 did not diverge within the timespan of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This phenomenon was even more pronounced for a second random promoter sequence, P0-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, comparing the number of point mutations between strains that differ solely in the rate of undergoing copy-number mutations in the <italic>galK</italic> locus, we found that under a low demand environment, a strain with a high duplication rate (IS+) diverged more slowly compared to a strain with low duplication rate (IS-).</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that frequent gene amplification hinders the fixation of adaptive point mutations due to most likely negative epistasis between these two different mutation types. While epistatic interactions can occur with any two adaptive mutations, copy-number mutations are unique, in that they are orders of magnitude more frequent than point mutations in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roth, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drake et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reams and Roth, 2015</xref>) and in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lynch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lipinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schrider et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keith et al., 2016</xref>). This large difference in rates means that a competition between point and copy-number mutations is heavily skewed in favour of the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the phenomenon of clonal interference (which occurs between any two beneficial mutations even if their adaptive benefits are additive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerrish and Lenski, 1998</xref>), negative epistasis does not slow down adaptation per se, as adaptation is agnostic to whether point or copy-number mutations lead to an improved phenotype. However, negative epistasis slows down divergence as populations have reached the fitness peak with an alternative kind of adaptive mutation. Negative epistasis between point and copy-number mutations can be expected to occur in any selective condition, which requires only a relatively modest increase to a particular biological function, namely an increase in gene expression or enzyme activity by only a <italic>few</italic>-fold. Thus, amplification hindrance may not only be of general relevance for the evolution of gene expression in bacteria, but also for the evolution of promiscuous enzyme functions, which analogous to a barely expressed gene can be enhanced by either copy-number mutations or point mutations in the coding sequence.</p><p>While we found that amplification slows down divergence under conditions of negative epistasis, the consensus in the literature has been that copy-number mutations not only serve as a first step in the ‘relay race of adaptation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yona et al., 2015</xref>), but that they also facilitate divergence, either indirectly by providing a first ‘crude’ adaptation to cope with a new environment until more refined adaptation occurs by point mutations, or directly by increasing the target size for point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yona et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bayer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Todd and Selmecki, 2020</xref>). The intuitive idea that amplification speeds up divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 1998</xref>) was originally developed as strong evidence against the adaptive mutagenesis hypothesis proposed by Cairns and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cairns et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cairns and Foster, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Based on it, various experimental studies interpreted observations of adaptation to dosage selection in the light of ‘amplification as a facilitator of divergence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pränting and Andersson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yona et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yona et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bayer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Todd and Selmecki, 2020</xref>). However, despite showing that adaptive amplification <italic>precedes</italic> divergence by point mutations, none of the studies provided a direct experimental test of the hypothesis that amplification <italic>causes</italic> increased rates of divergence. Experiments controlling for the rate of amplification were needed in order to dissect the ensuing evolutionary dynamics and establish causality.</p><p>All else being equal, more copies indeed mean more DNA targets for point mutations to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">San Millan et al., 2017</xref>). However, as our experiments show, all else is not necessarily equal, and the evolutionary dynamics may differ strongly between an organism that can increase copy-number as an adaptation and an organism that cannot. Intriguingly, indications for more complex dynamics can be found in the existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yona et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richts et al., 2021</xref>). One study showed that rapid adaptive gene amplification in yeast results in strong clonal interference between lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>). A second study in yeast found that adaptation to an abrupt increase in temperature was dominated by rapid copy-number mutation, with SNPs occurring only much later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yona et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yona et al., 2015</xref>). Lastly, an experimental evolution study in <italic>Bacillus</italic>, adaptation was dominated by copy-number mutations and the authors noted the surprising lack of promoter mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richts et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The transient dynamics of gene amplification allows tuning of gene expression on short evolutionary time scales in the absence of an evolved promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>). In principle, such transient evolutionary dynamics do not leave traces in the record of genomic sequence data on evolutionary time scales and as such, their detailed study may not seem warranted. This is especially true in the context of duplication and divergence of paralogs, which is studied because abundant genomic sequence data are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kondrashov, 2012</xref>). Our present study proved this intuition wrong, as we uncovered a potentially long-lasting effect resulting from the transient dynamics associated with copy-number mutations: if adaptation by amplification is the fastest and sufficient, other, less frequent, mutations may not have a chance to compete. While our evolution experiments were conducted under continuous selection, natural environments are often characterized by regimes of fluctuating selection. Due to the pleiotropic cost often associated with copy-number increases as well as their high rate of deletion, adaptive amplification returns to the ancestral single-copy state in the absence of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reams et al., 2010</xref>). This means that once the selective benefit of the transient adaptation ceased, no change at the level of genomic DNA remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roth, 1996</xref>). Therefore, the idea that gene amplifications act as a transient ‘regulatory state’ rather than a mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>) can be extended by an implication found here, namely that amplifications could effectively act as buffer against long-lasting point mutations. In this view, amplification could repeatedly provide rapid adaptation to selection for increased gene expression, but collapse back to the single-copy ancestral state once selection has subsided and yet hinder sequence divergence each time it does so. Thus, on sufficiently long time scales, the transient dynamics that play out before the fixation of mutations may ultimately shape entire genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cvijović et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Amplification hindrance is in agreement with the observation that gene duplication and divergence is not a dominant force in the expansion of protein families in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Treangen and Rocha, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tria and Martin, 2021</xref>). Consequently, in all situations where rapid amplification provides sufficient adaptation, amplification hindrance could work as a mutational force that – in addition to purifying selection – acts to conserve existing genes and their expression level. While purifying selection affects deleterious alleles only, counterintuitively, amplification hindrance prevents beneficial mutations from fixating.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strain construction</title><p>To construct the IS- strain, we replaced the second copy of IS<italic>1</italic> downstream of the selection and reporter cassette in IT030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>) with a kanamycin cassette using pSIM6-mediated recombineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Datta et al., 2006</xref>).

For the full duration of the experiment, cultures were grown in the plate reader with continuous orbital shaking and OD<sub>600</sub> and fluorescence was measured in 10 min intervals.</p><p>Growth rate was calculated using a custom R script. Briefly, the script applies a linear model (base R function lm()) to a 20-datapoint sliding window of log(OD<sub>600</sub>) as a function of time. The script then outputs the steepest slope (maximal growth rate) amongst all possible sliding windows (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The growth rates plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref> were obtained in the same manner (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s2sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>), with strains and carbon sources as indicated in the respective figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Flow cytometry experiments</title><p>Frozen evolved populations (–80°C, 15% glycerol) from day 4, day 8, or day 12 (as indicated in the figures) were pinned (1:820) into M9 buffer and put on ice until the measurement. Fluorescence was measured using a BD FACSCanto II system (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) equipped with FACSDiva software. CFP fluorescence was collected with a 450/50 nm bandpass filter by exciting with a 405 nm laser. YFP fluorescence was collected with a 510/50 bandpass filter by exciting with a 488 nm laser. The bacterial population was gated on the FSC and SSC signal resulting in approximately 6000 events analysed per sample, out of 10,000 recorded events.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>For qPCR, gDNA was isolated from overnight cultures grown in the respective evolution medium inoculated by single evolved colonies using Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI). We performed qPCR using Promega qPCR 2× Mastermix (Promega, Madison, WI) and a C1000 instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). To quantify the copy-number of samples of an evolving population, we designed one primer pair within <italic>galK</italic> (target) and one primer within <italic>rbsB</italic> as a reference, which lies outside the amplified region. We compared the ratios of the target and the reference loci to the ratio of the same two loci in the single-copy control. Using dilution series of one of the gDNA extracts as template, we calculated the efficiency of primer pairs and quantified the copy-number of <italic>galK</italic> in each sample employing the Pfaffl method, which takes amplification efficiency into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfaffl, 2001</xref>). qPCR was performed in three technical replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Measurement of colony fluorescence</title><p>Evolving populations were pinned onto LB agar supplemented with 1% charcoal and imaged using a macroscope setup (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://openwetware.org/wiki/Macroscope">https://openwetware.org/wiki/Macroscope</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chait et al., 2010</xref>). To obtain median colony YFP and CFP fluorescence intensity, a region of interest was determined using the ImageJ plugin ‘Analyze Particles’ (settings: 200px-infinity, 0.5–1.0 roundness) to identify colonies on 16-bit images with threshold adjusted according to the default value. The region of interest including all colonies was then used to measure intensity and plotted using a custom R script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Amplicon deep sequencing of P0</title><p>Frozen samples of evolved populations were diluted 1:10 into 100 µl of LB and grown for 5 hr (37°C, shaking) to increase cell numbers prior to DNA extractions. Columns 1–4 (populations A1, B1, C1, …, F4, G4, H4), 5–8 (populations A5, B5, C5, …, F8, G8, H8), and 9–12 (populations A9, B9, C9, …, F12, G12, H12) of each 96-well plate were pooled prior to DNA extraction using Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The P0 region including the beginning of <italic>galK</italic> was amplified for 25 PCR cycles using primers deep_seq_Fw and deep_seq_Rv carrying 5′ adaptors for Illumina sequencing. In parallel, PCRs were performed for 35 cycles to confirm bands on a gel. Illumina sequencing was carried out by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland).</p><p>We note that our amplicon libraries of P0 were contaminated with reads carrying the sequence of P0-2, which we had prepared for sequencing in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore excluded all reads of P0-2 for our analysis of P0 and do not report the result of the P0-2-specific samples as they could not be trusted.</p><p>Reads of P0 were analysed using a custom R script. Briefly, we defined four sequence motifs of each 39 bp length, which represented the ancestral P0 sequence and the same region with known adaptive SNPs (–30T&gt;A, –37C&gt;T or both). We calculated the fraction of reads with an evolved versus ancestral 39 bp motif in all samples, including those of control populations evolved in the absence of galactose. We also calculated the fraction of reads carrying a 39 bp ancestral <italic>galK</italic> sequence motif with any single single SNP versus those with the same 39 bp motif of the ancestral <italic>galK</italic> sequence.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-82240-mdarchecklist1-v3.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source Data and R scripts to generate the plots shown in the Figures are uploaded as the respective source code files.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The adaptation dynamics between copy-number and point mutations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sergey Kryazhimskiy as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Molly Przeworski as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Joakim Näsvall (Reviewer #2); Alejandra Rodríguez (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers agree that the paper asks an interesting question, and addresses it with a powerful reporter system. The most important issue that the reviewers identified is a lack of a convincing argument against clonal interference as an alternative explanation for the observations made in the low-demand environment. In your revision, please address this and other major criticisms listed below, and consider various suggestions for improving clarity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) While your explanation involving negative epistasis makes a lot of sense, the lack of mutants carrying both duplications and point mutations in the low-demand condition could be explained by clonal interference between these types of mutations.</p><p>Please explicitly describe this alternative hypothesis in the main text and make an argument why the negative epistasis hypothesis is favored. The reviewers suggest several possibilities for making this argument.</p><p>The gold standard experiment is to construct double mutants (carrying a duplication and a point mutation that arose in the low-demand condition) and compare their competitive fitness with that of single mutants. The direct prediction of your hypothesis is that the double mutants should not be more fit than either of the single mutants. If engineering double mutants is not feasible, it may be possible instead to compare the competitive fitness (in the low-demand environments) of double mutants isolated from the high- or medium-demand environments with that of single mutants. In addition, it may also be possible to make an argument against clonal interference in the low-demand condition based on the observations made in other conditions and/or by carrying out simulations.</p><p>If a convincing argument against clonal interference cannot be made at this time, then please adjust your claims accordingly. Once the new data and/or analyses become available, you can publish them as a Research Advance article.</p><p>(2) Your main line of reasoning currently relies on the assumption that the YFP+CFP+ cells have only duplications but no promoter mutations. While this seems reasonable, we ask you to clearly spell out the argument supporting this assumption.</p><p>(3) All reviewers found the Amplification Hindrance hypothesis very interesting and useful. However, duplications are inherently unstable and are very quickly lost once selection stops favoring them. Please discuss the Amplification Hindrance hypothesis in light of this important fact.</p><p>(4) The reviewers found that your Materials and methods section lacks key pieces of information. For example, how were growth rate assays performed? How was the growth rate estimated? How were genetic reconstructions of mutations, described on LL. 472--484 and in Figure 6, carried out? This list is not exhaustive but simply illustrates the methodological gaps that the reviewers found particularly glaring. We ask you to revise the Methods section by adding enough detail so that all experiments and analyses can be reproduced.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>LL. 241-248. I don't understand this discussion. &quot;Despite the occurrence of yfp-only mutations in the IS- strain, increased CFP still reliably reports on increased copy-number.&quot; This sentence is self-contradictory as written. Perhaps the authors meant to add &quot;in IS+ strains&quot; in the second clause?</p><p>&quot;However, the yfp-only amplification hijacks our ability to unambiguously infer ancestral copy-number from ancestral CFP fluorescence alone.&quot; This also doesn't make sense to me. Isn't the ancestral copy number known ( = 1)? Why does it need to be inferred from CFP fluorescence?</p><p>L. 253. &quot;Mixed mutants&quot; is a strange term. Please replace it with &quot;double mutants&quot; or &quot;combination mutants&quot;. But calling populations &quot;mixed&quot; in the next sentence would be appropriate and helpful.</p><p>LL. 296--298. &quot;in low galactose adaptive amplification of IS+ populations happened</p><p>rapidly with the majority of populations showing increases in CFP fluorescence during the course of the experiment&quot;. The speed has not been quantified, so I suggest making the language more precise here by dropping &quot;rapidly&quot;. Similarly, instead of saying &quot;the majority&quot;, it would be good to give the exact number as well as the percentage.</p><p>L. 306. &quot;populations with clearly increased YFP levels&quot;. Which ones are these? Are these the ones labelled with red triangles in Figure 4D? If so, please say so explicitly. It would also be helpful to identify them somehow in panel 4B.</p><p>L. 310. &quot;Sequencing of the amplified colony&quot;. Was only one colony sequenced here? I thought all YFP+ colonies were sequenced and reported in Supp Table 1. Please clarify.</p><p>L. 347. &quot;do not occur&quot;. Point mutations presumably do occur, but they don't spread. Please correct.</p><p>L. 434-435. &quot;Moreover, it is shifted towards higher values of YFP/CFP relative to values found for P0&quot; Please clarify how you arrived at this claim. To say that, P0 and P0-2 must be shown on the same plot, which I do not see.</p><p>LL. 446. &quot;with the majority of P0-2 IS+ population amplified, those few P0-2 IS+ populations that failed to evolve amplifications&quot;. Please be precise: &quot;majority&quot; – how many and what fraction? &quot;Few&quot; – how many and what fraction?</p><p>Figure 1. In panel B, it would be helpful to have error bars to see whether the decline in growth rate at higher expression levels is significant.</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>(i) In panel A (0% galactose), please color IS- populations red as in other panels for the sake of consistency. Lines can be made more transparent to increase clarity.</p><p>(ii) In other panels, it would be helpful to show the threshold of fluorescence for calling an amplification (as a horizontal line) and then also indicate on each panel the number and fraction of populations that have acquired an amplification by the end of the experiment.</p><p>(iii) In panel B, I would suggest doing the same thing as above, i.e., showing the number (and fraction) of populations in each class e.g., YFP+CFP+ (18). Also, please show grid lines and the diagonal so that it is possible to compare data across panels.</p><p>Figure 3: It is currently impossible to associate each panel in C with a specific point in panel A because multiple points have the same color. One possible way to resolve this ambiguity is to draw the trajectories in A as lines but only show one time point (the one that is shown as a panel in C) with a circle.</p><p>Figure 4: I have several issues with panel A.</p><p>(i) How are the cell counts normalized and why?</p><p>(ii) I think the authors should consider splitting the CFP vs YFP plot into two, one showing population B1 and the other showing population B3. Right now, B1 completely obscures B3. I also suggest somehow highlighting the three subpopulations that the authors refer to in the text on LL. 308-309.</p><p>(iii) I don't understand whether the right-most panel and the middle set of panels show the same data. Specifically, on the CFP vs YFP plot, it is clear that population B1 has a subpopulation with log(CFP) ~ 6 and log(YFP) ~ 6. On the YFP plot, there is a visible tail around the same value, but the CFP plot does not seem to have a corresponding peak. Is this a plotting error? If not, perhaps the issue is with the normalization, or maybe the cell counts need to be plotted on the log scale.</p><p>(iv) It seems important for the authors' argument to show that ALL populations evolved in 0.01% show the same pattern as B1 and B3. I would suggest showing the YFP vs CFP plot for every population as a supplementary figure.</p><p>(v) Panel B. It is nice to show the raw data, but I think the exposition would improve if this panel was in the supplement. The reason is that differences in YFP fluorescence values are very difficult to discern by eye, and the same data (as far as I understood) are anyway presented in a more discernible way in panel D.</p><p>Figure 5:</p><p>(i) In the caption and in the text (l. 369) the authors refer to the &quot;number of reads&quot;, but I think in all case they mean &quot;fraction of reads&quot;. I am also a bit confused what the authors mean by &quot;normalized to the number of reads with ancestral P0&quot;. Do they show the actual fraction of reads carrying the respective mutations in each set of population or is it something else?</p><p>(ii) I would suggest adding the position number to the labels of point mutations, e.g., T30A, C37T</p><p>Figure 6:</p><p>(i) please add a legend to panel A, as in Figure 2A.</p><p>(ii) I am very confused about panel C. If I understand it correctly, it shows that &gt;20 colonies sampled from IS- populations are labelled as YFP+CFP+. Based on what data was this assignment made? Panel A shows that there are apparently no IS- populations that have the YFP+CFP+ phenotype, and we don't expect them to happen at such high rates in the IS- populations. Please clarify.</p><p>(iii) In panel E, mutants are labeled A11, F2, etc., but I don't seem to find a correspondence between these labels and the specific mutations that have been reconstructed. Please clarify.</p><p>(iv) By the same token, I don't see a description of how these mutants were constructed.</p><p>Figure 7B: The double-mutant is missing from this panel. I understand that the authors have not observed such double-mutants in low-demand environments, but I think it would be helpful to show it for the purposes of clarifying their hypothesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I find the present manuscript acceptable for publication but think the authors could consider adding a few points where it's suitable:</p><p>1. Could the authors discuss or comment on the &quot;possible weakness&quot; mentioned in the public review?</p><p>2. The evolutionary dynamics at different galactose concentrations are shown in Supplementary Figure 2, but there might be more to be learned by looking at the exact conditions of the evolution experiments (M9+casaminoacids+various concentrations of galactose): what are the growth dynamics of the ancestral strain and the evolved strains? Is the main evolutionary advantage on the maximum growth rate, final population size, or somewhere else (or a combination of several parameters)? If data on this is not already available I think it should be a quick and simple experiment to add (note that I do not think this is critical for publication, but that it could potentially add some additional value to the discussion).</p><p>3. Could selection at slightly different conditions (smaller/larger populations, smaller/larger bottlenecks) or with fluctuating selection pressures affect the outcome? Could variations in the conditions used produce a different skew of duplications vs. promoter mutations?</p><p>I enjoyed reading the manuscript and hope to see it published soon!</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I think is an exciting study and the researcher was rigorously conducted and well presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82240.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) While your explanation involving negative epistasis makes a lot of sense, the lack of mutants carrying both duplications and point mutations in the low-demand condition could be explained by clonal interference between these types of mutations.</p><p>Please explicitly describe this alternative hypothesis in the main text and make an argument why the negative epistasis hypothesis is favored.

For the current revision however, we could not do this, as the first author is already in Oxford doing her postdoctoral work and is tied up by family obligations as well (two small kids) from travelling to perform this work in Vienna, at the present time.</p><p>Therefore, we chose to address this criticism in two ways: (i) We explicitly discuss clonal interference (CI) in the main text while at the same time we weaken our epistasis claims to entertain the possibility of CI, as we are not showing the presence of epistasis directly with experiments. (ii) We also present arguments (in this response but also in the main text) of why we think epistasis is the more likely explanation. Please see the final section of the Results section, starting at line 551 (together with the newly added Figure 7 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>Clonal interference (CI) is the effect of the competition between lineages arising from different beneficial mutations in a population without recombination (i.e. asexually reproducing). When the product of population size and mutation rate (N*µ) is smaller than one (N*µ&lt;1), mutations fix one by one, whereas if N*µ exceeds one significantly (N*µ&gt;&gt;1), mutations compete, thereby slowing down the fixation of each other (Gerrish and Lenski, 1998; Park and Krug, 2007).</p><p>At the first glance, the fact that significantly more replicate populations become amplified in the lowest galactose concentration suggests that clonal interference could play a role in this environment. All else being equal, we expect CI to occur for larger population sizes or at higher mutation rates. However, in the absence of strong <italic>galK</italic> expression (i.e. expression levels of.<italic>galK</italic> with ancestral P0) the maximal OD<sub>600</sub> (“yield”) as a proxy for population size is similar between populations in the different galactose environments (please see new Figure 7 —figure supplement 1a). The reason for this is that in the absence of <italic>galK</italic> expression the cells essentially only metabolize the casaminoacid component of the evolution medium, which is the same across all galactose environments.</p><p>At the same time, there is no reason to assume that the mutation rate should differ between the different galactose concentrations. Instead, the observation that amplifications evolve faster in the low galactose environment can be explained by differences in the expression-growth relation for <italic>galK</italic> (“fitness landscape”, Figure 1b) between the different environments. Specifically, it appears as though the environments differ in their adaptive benefit of increasing <italic>galK</italic> expression starting from a low level (at low levels of inducer arabinose in Figure 1b). This would imply that acquiring a duplication of <italic>galK</italic> incurs little fitness benefit in 1% galactose (the fitness landscape exhibits a plateau for low expression values), while the same mutation incurs a bigger benefit in 0.01% galactose (the fitness landscape is slightly steeper when going from one copy of <italic>galK</italic> to two copies of <italic>galK</italic>). Because we can with relative confidence rule out both very significant differences in the population size and differences in the duplication rate between environments, CI is an unlikely explanation for the fact that we see mutually exclusive mutations in low galactose, but not in higher galactose concentrations.</p><p>There is one additional argument to be made in favour of epistasis: In our (new) Figure 7 —figure supplement 1b-d, the growth of amplified strains (blue) that have evolved in the three different Gal concentrations for seven days, respectively, is compared to the growth of two different promoter mutants (double mutant, and slightly weaker single mutant, both in green) (for convenience, also see Figure 7 —figure supplement 1b-d). Intriguingly, the difference between both yield and growth rate of amplified and promoter mutant strains is bigger in both high galactose environments (1% and 0.1%) than in low galactose (0.01%). The amplified strains, which have evolved in low galactose are growing comparably well to the promoter mutant. One of the amplified strains (blue continuous lines) even reaches higher population densities (yields) than either promoter mutants. This suggests that amplification can in fact provide sufficient expression in low galactose, while a higher expression level is required in high galactose. These results are in agreement with the epistasis hypothesis, namely that additional point mutations would be beneficial in the higher galactose concentrations, but that they would yield little or no fitness benefit in low galactose (=resulting in negative epistasis).</p><p>Finally, a second line of evidence argues against clonal interference playing a role in making mutations mutually exclusive in low galactose. CI essentially means that many adaptive mutations arise simultaneously but in different individuals. Hence, beneficial mutations are not only competing against the ancestral (low fitness) allele, but against all other beneficial alleles. Its fixation is therefore slowed down. However, even in low galactose, despite the rapid amplification of most populations, a significant fraction of cells is still ancestral by the end of the evolution experiment (see new Figure 4 —figure supplement 1, Figure 4a). This suggests that the population is not yet “saturated” with competing mutations. Extending this argument, in the case of CI we would expect to find at least small subpopulations of combination mutants when monitoring populations both, on the single-cell level (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1, Figure 4a) or single-colony level (essentially corresponding to single cells; e.g. Figure 4C).</p><p>The above listed arguments, together with the fact that the maximal copy-number differs significantly for evolved populations in the three environments (Figure 2 – Figures Supplement 1b) strongly suggests (even in the absence of direct experimental evidence) that combination mutants are absent in the low demand condition because additional point mutations are obsolete (i.e. negative epistasis).</p><p>We made the following changes in the main text to address the point about CI versus epistasis:</p><p>– We adjusted the abstract by removing the claim of epistasis (and pointing out the high frequency of amplifications, which is underlying amplification hindrance irrespective of whether it occurs through negative epistasis or clonal interference): line 23.</p><p>– We adjusted line 109 in the Introduction: “However, if both, copy-number and point mutations are adaptive (Gruber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012), they also have the potential to interact epistatically or due to clonal interference.”</p><p>– We added a new section to the final part of the Results, starting at line 551 (together with the newly added Figure 7 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>– We adjusted the discussion in line 626 (“most likely epistasis”)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Your main line of reasoning currently relies on the assumption that the YFP+CFP+ cells have only duplications but no promoter mutations. While this seems reasonable, we ask you to clearly spell out the argument supporting this assumption.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important point which we have not made sufficiently explicit (in part because YFP+CFP+ cells having only copy-number mutations has been a repeated observation we have had in past studies (Steinrueck and Guet, 2017; Tomanek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020)).</p><p>We adjusted the manuscript in two places to make this point clearer and also support it with additional data:</p><p>(i) Using data from previous experiments, we added a new Figure 1 —figure supplement 1, which shows the correlation between YFP and CFP and copy-number as measured by qPCR. In these plots, a promoter mutant ((-30T&gt;A and -37C&gt;T)) is an obvious outlier in the levels of YFP. This is mentioned in line 153.</p><p>(ii) In Figure 6C we summarise the sequencing result of (among other things) 21 colonies from the amplified fraction (i.e. with a correlated increase in both fluorophores (“YFP+CFP+”)), which all harbour an ancestral P0-2 sequence. We point this out more clearly in the text now (line 520).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) All reviewers found the Amplification Hindrance hypothesis very interesting and useful. However, duplications are inherently unstable and are very quickly lost once selection stops favoring them. Please discuss the Amplification Hindrance hypothesis in light of this important fact.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point and want to emphasise that we are aware of the unstable nature of amplifications, which we have studied previously under regimes of fluctuating selection (Tomanek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020).</p><p>In our previous study, we evolved populations with amplifications in P0-<italic>galK</italic> in environments alternatingly selecting for and against <italic>galK</italic> expression. Under our experimental conditions, copy-number polymorphisms accumulate rapidly and provide an ample diversity of <italic>galK</italic> expression levels for selection to pick from. Most likely because evolutionary dynamics were dominated by strong selection and high rates of duplication/deletion, in that study we failed to recover any point mutations in P0 in populations evolved under our fluctuating conditions.</p><p>In fact, it is plausible that under fluctuating selection amplification hindrance may be even stronger than under continuous selection. The reason for this is that promoter point mutations leading to constitutive expression might be slightly costly when expression is not selected for. Unlike the rate of reversal of point mutations, amplifications have a very high rate of reversal that allows amplified populations to rapidly attain ancestral (low) expression levels, only to re-appear once selection for increased gene expression resumes.</p><p>That being said, we agree with the general point that the study uses simplified environments. Therefore, we would be very interested in whether the phenomenon described here actually occurs in natural/clinical settings (e.g. antibiotic resistance genes that are known to be amplified and causing heteroresistance) and are more conserved than comparable resistance genes, which are not amplified.</p><p>In our present manuscript, we touched on this topic in the Discussion section (see below). We now added the following statements to more explicitly discuss fluctuating selection (line 694).</p><p>“If adaptation by amplification is the fastest and sufficient, other, less frequent, mutations may not have a chance to compete. While our evolution experiments were conducted under continuous selection, natural environments may provide regimes of fluctuating selection. Due to the pleiotropic cost often associated with copy-number increases as well as their high rate of deletion, adaptive amplification returns to the ancestral single copy state in the absence of selection (Andersson and Hughes, 2009; Reams <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010). This means that once the selective benefit of the transient adaptation is gone, no change at the level of genomic DNA remains (Roth <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996). Therefore, the idea that gene amplifications act as a transient “regulatory state” rather than a mutation (Roth <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996; Tomanek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020) can be extended by an implication found here, namely that amplifications could effectively act as buffer against long-lasting point mutations. In this view, amplification could repeatedly provide rapid adaptation to selection for increased gene expression, but collapse back to the single copy ancestral state once selection has subsided and yet hinder sequence divergence each time it does so. Thus, on sufficiently long time-scales, the transient dynamics that play out before the fixation of mutations may ultimately shape entire genomes”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The reviewers found that your Materials and methods section lacks key pieces of information. For example, how were growth rate assays performed? How was the growth rate estimated? How were genetic reconstructions of mutations, described on LL. 472--484 and in Figure 6, carried out?

I don't understand this discussion. &quot;Despite the occurrence of yfp-only mutations in the IS- strain, increased CFP still reliably reports on increased copy-number.&quot; This sentence is self-contradictory as written. Perhaps the authors meant to add &quot;in IS+ strains&quot; in the second clause?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this sentence (and the following mentioned below) was confusing as stated.

In contrast, ancestral copy-number can only be confirmed by qPCR. The fact that some populations carry IS-independent yfp-only amplifications implies that our system of fluorescence reporters will yield a slight underestimate of the number of amplified populations both in the IS+ and IS- strain. However, we were ultimately interested in the divergence of promoter sequences, and going forward relied on sequencing to unambiguously determine the presence of adaptive promoter mutations.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;However, the yfp-only amplification hijacks our ability to unambiguously infer ancestral copy-number from ancestral CFP fluorescence alone.&quot; This also doesn't make sense to me.

The differences between replicate experiments are probably mainly due to batch effects in the sugar- and casaminoacids stocks used for preparing the different media.</p><p>As the reviewer noted, it seems there is indeed a growth rate reduction in 1% arabinose (in the control, i.e. in the absence of galactose), but this is likely an artifact of the strain we are using rather than the cost of high <italic>galK</italic> expression itself. We used strain background BW27784 for our chromosomal <italic>pBAD-galK</italic> construct. BW27784 has the advantage of allowing an almost linear induction behaviour for the arabinose promoter (pBAD) as opposed to the none-to-all behaviour typical of most catabolic promoters (Khlebnikov et al., 2001). To this end, it carries a constitutive arabinose import system and a deletion of the arabinose catabolic genes. Therefore, BW27784 is not able to catabolize arabinose, such that high concentrations are probably toxic. Importantly, our evolution experiments we used an MG1655 strain background (and no arabinose), so we don’t expect high levels of <italic>galK</italic> expression to be toxic. Indeed, we do not see a cost of <italic>galK</italic> expression even in the absence of galactose when comparing strains with very low levels of <italic>galK</italic> expression (ancestral P0) and strains with high <italic>galK</italic> expression (P0 double promoter mutant) such as in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2b.</p><p>Moreover, we are confident that the data in Figure 1b capture the most important aspects of the <italic>galK</italic> expression-growth relation in the different environments, as the level of amplification (#of copies) evolving in our evolution experiment increases with increasing galactose concentration (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1B).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Replicates of the Experiment shown in Figure 1b, where growth rate is plotted against arabinose concentration used to induce <italic>galK</italic> expression for different galactose concentrations (line colors, see legend).</title><p>Left panels show all tested galactose concentrations, while right panels show the relevant galactose concentrations used in the experiments of the manuscript.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82240-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2:</p><p>(i) In panel A (0% galactose), please color IS- populations red as in other panels for the sake of consistency.

The evolutionary dynamics at different galactose concentrations are shown in Supplementary Figure 2, but there might be more to be learned by looking at the exact conditions of the evolution experiments (M9+casaminoacids+various concentrations of galactose): what are the growth dynamics of the ancestral strain and the evolved strains? Is the main evolutionary advantage on the maximum growth rate, final population size, or somewhere else (or a combination of several parameters)? If data on this is not already available I think it should be a quick and simple experiment to add (note that I do not think this is critical for publication, but that it could potentially add some additional value to the discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. The data behind Figure 1b (where we induced expression of <italic>galK</italic> along a gradient of arabinose and measured growth rates in the different galactose concentrations) hints at the fact that both growth rate and population size (yield) will be increased with increasing either <italic>galK</italic> expression or galactose concentration (at a given expression level). The data also suggests that when <italic>galK</italic> is expressed a low level, low galactose concentrations result in higher growth rate. (As mentioned above, we suspect that this is the reason behind the steeper fitness peak for low galactose and the reason why amplifications evolve there more rapidly than in the higher galactose concentrations).

While we do not have data on how the ancestral strain compares in the same environment, the data from the different mutants suggests that populations gain both, growth rate and yield increases with increasing galactose concentration (please see new Figure 7 —figure supplement 1; for convenience the figure is also plotted within <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> where we discuss it in the context of clonal interference/epistasis – Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Could selection at slightly different conditions (smaller/larger populations, smaller/larger bottlenecks) or with fluctuating selection pressures affect the outcome? Could variations in the conditions used produce a different skew of duplications vs. promoter mutations?</p><p>I enjoyed reading the manuscript and hope to see it published soon!</p></disp-quote><p>Intuitively, we think that slightly different population sizes/ bottlenecks should not matter too much for the experiments shown. We gather this information from some preliminary experiments where we used different dilution factors, and one experiment where we also used a 10-fold bigger population size.</p><p>However, the rather big difference in outcome between the different environments seems to suggest that the distribution of mutations should quite sensitively depend on the galactose concentration, especially for lower galactose concentrations. We would speculate that the fitness landscape (shown in Figure 1b) if resolved at a finer scale (i.e. plotting growth rate along a series of very small increases in gene expression), might show an initial plateau for the high galactose concentrations, but not for the low one. We suspect that metabolic/biochemical constraints differ in the different galactose concentrations and the strength of selection will not simply be a linear function of the galactose concentration.</p></body></sub-article></article>
