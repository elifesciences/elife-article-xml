which allows them to facilitate redox reactions in electron transport chains across all domains of life. Genomic evidence suggests that cyt <italic>c</italic> are involved in electron transfer processes among the Archaea, especially in members that produce or consume the potent greenhouse gas methane. However, neither the maturation machinery for cyt <italic>c</italic> in Archaea nor their role in methane metabolism has ever been functionally characterized. Here, we have used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tools to map a distinct pathway for cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis in the model methanogenic archaeon <italic>Methanosarcina acetivorans,</italic> and have also identified substrate-specific functional roles for cyt <italic>c</italic> during methanogenesis. Although the cyt <italic>c</italic> maturation machinery from <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> is universally conserved in the Archaea, our evolutionary analyses indicate that different clades of Archaea acquired this machinery through multiple independent horizontal gene transfer events from different groups of Bacteria. Overall, we demonstrate the convergent evolution of a novel Archaea-specific cyt <italic>c</italic> maturation machinery and its physiological role during methanogenesis, a process which contributes substantially to global methane emissions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Archaea are single-celled organisms that were discovered over half a century ago. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in these microbes because theyplay a key role in climate change by controlling greenhouse gas emissions, like methane. Indeed, methane-producing Archaea generate nearly 70% of the methane gas released into the atmosphere.</p><p>A group of proteins called c-type cytochromes are essential to energy generation in several methane-producing archaea. However, it is a mystery how Archaea assemble their c-type cytochromes. In fact, genomic studies suggest that Archaea are missing some of the c-type cytochrome assembly machinery that bacteria use. This has led scientists to suspect that Archaea have an alternate mechanism for building these essential components.</p><p>To solve this mystery, Gupta, Shalvarjian, and Nayak used CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tools to characterize which proteins are essential for c-type cytochrome production in <italic>Methanosarcina acetivorans</italic>, a species of Archaea that produces methane<italic>.</italic> These experiments showed that <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> discarded a few parts of the process used by bacteria to generate c-type cytochromes, streamlining the assembly of these proteins. By comparing the genes of different Archaeal species, Gupta, Shalvarjian and Nayak were able to determine that Archaea acquired the genes for producing c-type cytochromes from bacteria via horizontal gene transfer, a process in which genes move directly from one organism into another. The streamlining of the process took place later, as different Archaeal species evolved independently, but losing the same parts of the process.</p><p>Gupta Shalvajiran and Nayak’s experiments also showed that c-type cytochromes are essential for the growth and fitness of methane-producing Archaea like <italic>M. acetivorans.</italic> The role of c-type cytochromes in methane production varies in different species of Archaea depending on their growth substrate or where they live. These results provide vital information about how Archaea produce methane, and the tools and techniques developed will aid further investigation of the role of Archaea in climate change.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Archaea</kwd><kwd>methanogens</kwd><kwd><italic>Methanosarcina acetivorans</italic></kwd><kwd>methane</kwd><kwd>cytochromes</kwd><kwd>energy conservation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF#9324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nayak</surname><given-names>Dipti D</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Dinesh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Simons Early Career Investigator in Marine Microbial Ecology and Evolution Award (822981)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nayak</surname><given-names>Dipti D</given-names></name><name><surname>Shalvarjian</surname><given-names>Katie E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000008</institution-id><institution>David and Lucile Packard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Packard Fellowships for Science and Engineering</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nayak</surname><given-names>Dipti D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014185</institution-id><institution>Searle Scholars Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nayak</surname><given-names>Dipti D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000997</institution-id><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Beckman Young Investigator Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nayak</surname><given-names>Dipti D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010319</institution-id><institution>Shurl and Kay Curci Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nayak</surname><given-names>Dipti D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A streamlined form of the bacterial System I cytochrome c biogenesis machinery in archaea was characterized using <italic>Methanosarcina acetivorans</italic> as a model system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>C</italic>-type cytochromes (cyt(s) <italic>c</italic>) are found across the tree of life, and are critical to electron transfer processes ranging from aerobic respiration in the mitochondrion of Eukaryotes to intra/extracellular electron transport in Bacteria and Archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richardson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2020</xref>).

Three distinct systems for cyt <italic>c</italic> maturation have been identified thus far, and have been studied extensively in bacterial and eukaryotic model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanders et al., 2010</xref>). However, despite growing evidence that cyt <italic>c</italic> play a vital role in electron transport processes across members of the Archaea – particularly in microorganisms that metabolize methane and other alkanes – the biogenesis of cyt <italic>c</italic> has never been functionally characterized in an archaeon.</p><p>Based on genomic surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kletzin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chadwick et al., 2021</xref>) of sequenced isolates and metagenomics assembled genomes, the vast majority of cyt <italic>c</italic> containing Archaea encode homologs of the System I cyt <italic>c</italic> maturation pathway (Ccm pathway) that is widespread in members of the Bacteria and is also present in the mitochondria of some Plants and Protozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giegé et al., 2008</xref>). The Ccm pathway is best characterized in Gram-negative bacteria, such as <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> where nine to ten proteins, encoded by <italic>ccmABCDEFGH</italic>(<italic>I</italic>) and <italic>ccdA</italic> (or <italic>dsbD</italic>), are involved in cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanders et al., 2010</xref>). Typically, the <italic>ccm</italic> genes are encoded in an operon on the chromosome and the <italic>ccmH</italic> open reading frame in <italic>E. coli</italic> is often found as two different genes, annotated as <italic>ccmH</italic> (or <italic>ccl2</italic>) and <italic>ccmI</italic> (or <italic>cycH</italic>), in bacteria like <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2009</xref>). Genetic and biochemical studies of the Ccm pathway have revealed that the membrane-associated CcmABCD complex translocates heme across the cytoplasmic membrane to form holo-CcmE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Heme from holo-CcmE is ultimately transferred to the apo-cyt <italic>c</italic> by the CcmF/H complex (cytochrome synthetase) to form holo-cyt <italic>c</italic>. CcmG and CcdA (or DsbD) reduce the disulfide bond between cysteine residues of heme-binding motifs (CXXCH) in the apo-cyt <italic>c</italic> prior to heme attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fabianek et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Setterdahl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reid et al., 2001</xref>). Curiously, most, if not all, archaeal genomes sequenced thus far lack several <italic>ccm</italic> genes (namely <italic>ccmD, ccmH, ccmI</italic>) that have been shown to be essential for cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis in Bacteria like <italic>E. coli, R. capsulatus, Paracoccus denitriﬁcans, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Shewenella oneidensis,</italic> and <italic>Desulfovibrio desulfuricans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kranz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thöny-Meyer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goddard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu et al., 2015</xref>). In bacteria, CcmD facilitates the release of the heme-bound holo-CcmE from the CcmABCD complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richard-Fogal et al., 2008</xref>), while CcmH and CcmI are a part of the protein complex involved in covalent attachment of heme to the apo-cyt <italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanders et al., 2010</xref>). As such, based on evidence from studies with bacteria, the streamlined Ccm machinery found in archaeal genomes, comprised only of CcmABCEFG and CcdA, would be insufficient for the biogenesis of cyt <italic>c</italic>. However, mature cyt <italic>c</italic> proteins have been identified in many archaeal strains, such as <italic>Haloferax volcanii, Ignicoccus hospitalis, Pyrobaculum islandicum, Ferroglobus placidus,</italic> and <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kletzin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sreeramulu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nab et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feinberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Whether Archaea have replaced CcmD, CcmH, and CcmI with non-orthologous proteins or have reconfigured the Ccm machinery such that <italic>ccmDHI</italic> are no longer essential remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we used the genetically tractable methanogenic archaeon, <italic>M. acetivorans,</italic> as a model system to functionally characterize the pathway for biogenesis of cyt <italic>c</italic> in archaea. Most archaea that encode cyt <italic>c</italic> proteins are either recalcitrant to laboratory cultivation techniques, genetically intractable, or only encode only one cyt <italic>c</italic> that might be essential for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kletzin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chadwick et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arshad et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> encodes multiple cyt <italic>c</italic> proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holmes et al., 2019</xref>), can be easily cultivated in a laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sowers et al., 1993</xref>), and has state-of-the-art genetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kohler and Metcalf, 2012</xref>), including inducible gene expression, tests for gene essentiality, and CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing for complex genetic manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nayak and Metcalf, 2017</xref>). <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> is a methanogen that can only grow by coupling energy conservation to the production of methane gas using acetate or methylated compounds, like methanol, as a growth substrate. At least five different cyt <italic>c</italic> proteins are encoded in the <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> genome and these proteins contain between one and seven heme-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holmes et al., 2019</xref>). Recent studies have even proposed distinct roles for some of these cyt <italic>c</italic> proteins in intracellular electron transport during methanogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schlegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferry, 2020</xref>), extracellular electron transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holmes et al., 2019</xref>), as well as direct interspecies electron transfer between <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> and bacterial strains like <italic>Geobacter metallireducens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmes et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> is not only an ideal candidate to dissect the biogenesis of cyt <italic>c</italic> in Archaea but also to functionally characterize the role of cyt <italic>c</italic> in various electron transfer processes that have ramifications on global carbon cycling as well as on the formation of microbial communities in anoxic environments.</p><p>Here, we have used a combination of genetic, molecular, and biochemical analyses, to show that <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> and other archaea use a streamlined version of the Ccm machinery that only requires <italic>ccmABCEF</italic> for cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis. To this end, we have shown that the <italic>ccmABCEF</italic> from <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> is sufficient to produce holo-cyt <italic>c</italic> in a heterologous host, <italic>Methanosarcina barkeri</italic> Fusaro, that otherwise is incapable of cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis. Our physiological analyses also reveal substrate-specific phenotypes for the cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis pathway and cyt(s) <italic>c</italic> during growth and methanogenesis in <italic>M. acetivorans</italic>. A closer inspection of the distribution and synteny of the cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis genes in methane-metabolizing archaea related to <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> (i.e. belonging to the order <italic>Methanosarcinales</italic>) suggests that the cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis genes were likely acquired in the last common ancestor of the <italic>Methanosarcinales</italic> and have been lost in many extant clades that also do not encode any cyt <italic>c</italic> genes. Although the streamlined Ccm machinery is conserved across Archaea, our evolutionary analyses suggest that the acquisition of cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis in Archaea has occurred through multiple horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events with different members of the Bacteria. Overall, we have used the model methanogenic archaeon, <italic>M. acetivorans,</italic> as a model system to characterize a streamlined form of the Ccm machinery used for the biogenesis of cyt <italic>c</italic> in members of Archaea.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Ccm machinery is essential for cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis in <italic>M. acetivorans</italic></title><p>We used a sequence-based approach to identify homologs of eight different genes of the Ccm machinery for cyt <italic>c</italic> maturation at four different chromosomal loci in <italic>M. acetivorans</italic>.

The biogenesis of cyt <italic>c</italic> is complex and is mediated by a dedicated pathway that can vary substantially across the tree of life. In the vast majority of eukaryotes, a single protein called cyt <italic>c</italic> heme lyase is involved in the biogenesis of cyt <italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, bacteria contain more complex pathways that are fine-tuned to work with lower concentrations of heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2009</xref>). The most complex of these pathways, called the Ccm machinery, requires at least nine to ten proteins (CcmABCDEFGH(I) and CcdA/DsbD) that work in concert for the biogenesis of cyt <italic>c</italic>. The biochemical details of the Ccm machinery in bacteria has been studied in great detail using model systems over the past few decades and the role of each <italic>ccm</italic> gene is well established at this point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanders et al., 2010</xref>). Previous research has shown that archaea encode some components of the bacterial Ccm machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kletzin et al., 2015</xref>), however, orthologs of at least three proteins (CcmD, CcmH, and CcmI) that are absolutely critical for cyt <italic>c</italic> maturation in bacteria are universally absent in archaeal genomes. Thus, it was unclear how the Ccm machinery is being repurposed (if at all) for cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis in archaea. In this study, we use the methanogen <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> to characterize a streamlined form of the Ccm system comprised of only five proteins (CcmABCEF) that likely serves as the predominant route for cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis in members of the Archaea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).</p><p>Based on our findings, there are three key differences between the Ccm machinery in Bacteria and Archaea. While <italic>ccmD</italic> seems to be uniformally absent in archaeal genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2006</xref>), it is universally present in bacterial genomes and is essential for cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis in a number of strains ranging from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Rhodobacter capsultus</italic> to <italic>D. desulfuricans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goddard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richard-Fogal et al., 2008</xref>). In bacteria, CcmD is a small (69 aa long) transmembrane protein that associates with CcmABC and facilitates the release of holo-CcmE in the periplasm after heme transport and attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richard-Fogal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feissner et al., 2006a</xref>). In <italic>M. acetivorans,</italic> the CcmABC complex is capable of forming holo-CcmE and releasing it into the pseudo-periplasm in a CcmD-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is unlikely that the <italic>ccmD</italic> gene has been fused to <italic>ccmA, ccmB,</italic> or <italic>ccmC</italic> based on the sequence length and alignment of the archaeal genes with their bacterial counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">3</xref>). It is also unlikely that the CcmD-independent mechanism for the release of holo-CcmE from CcmABC might be linked to the CXXXY heme-binding motif in CcmE because some bacteria, like <italic>D. desulfuricans</italic>, that encode <italic>ccmD</italic> and require this gene product for cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis also contain a CXXXY heme-binding motif in CcmE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goddard et al., 2010</xref>). One plausible hypothesis for the absence of CcmD might be the unusual architecture of archaeal membranes. The archaeal cytoplasmic membrane is composed of isoprenoid lipids (phytanyl units), compared to phospholipids in bacterial cytoplasmic membranes. This lipid composition might alter how CcmABC and CcmE are anchored into the membrane and render CcmD inconsequential during the formation and release of holo-CcmE.</p><p>Next, the archaeal CcmE universally contains a CXXXY heme-binding motif whereas bacterial CcmE can either have an HXXXY motif or a CXXXY motif depending on the strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goddard et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>E. coli,</italic> an H130C allele of CcmE can still bind heme but cannot transfer the heme to the CcmFH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goddard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Enggist and Thöny-Meyer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stevens et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, a C120H mutation in <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> seems to destabilize the protein to such an extent that it can no longer be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, no heme-bound CcmE was detected for the C127H allele of CcmE derived from the bacterium <italic>D. desulfuricans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goddard et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the Cys and His residues involved in heme-binding CcmE are not interchangeable. In fact, many other as yet uncharacterized features of CcmE, possibly unique to these two groups of CcmE proteins, are likely to be equally important for the formation of holo-CcmE and the transfer of heme to the apo-cyt <italic>c</italic> via interactions between CcmE and CcmF as well as other proteins. Whether the absence of an HXXXY motif containing CcmE in archaea is just an artifact of historical contingency or due to functional/evolutionary constraints remains unclear.</p><p>Finally, the cyt <italic>c</italic> synthetase complex in bacteria contains two (CcmFH or CcmFI) or three (CcmFHI) proteins depending on the strain whereas the archaeal counterpart only contains CcmF. In <italic>M. acetivorans</italic>, the CcmF gene is split into two coding sequences (<italic>ccmF1</italic> and <italic>ccmF2</italic>), each of which might be derived from different bacterial groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">6</xref>). Functionally important domains of the cyt <italic>c</italic> synthetase complex including the two histidine residues that coordinate the pseudo-periplasmic heme <italic>b</italic> as well as the highly conserved WWD domain are all present in CcmF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). CcmF1 probably plays a secondary role in cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis, which might explain why a small amount of holo-cyt <italic>c</italic> can still be detected in the ∆<italic>ccmF1</italic> mutant of <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In bacteria and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, CcmH/I have been shown to interact with the apo-cyt <italic>c</italic> and deliver it to CcmF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Setterdahl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meyer et al., 2005</xref>). It is unlikely that <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> and other archaea have replaced CcmH/I with a non-orthologous protein as heterologous expression of <italic>ccmABCEF1F2</italic> in the non-native host, <italic>M. barkeri</italic> Fusaro, seems to be sufficient for cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, we cannot distinguish between the possibility that <italic>M. barkeri</italic> Fusaro also encodes this non-ortholgous protein or that the standalone CcmF in <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> performs the function of CcmFH in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Within the Archaea, cyt <italic>c</italic> are especially enriched in the family <italic>Methanosarcinaceae</italic> wherein these proteins have likely fostered tremendous metabolic innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mand and Metcalf, 2019</xref>). Our work and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holmes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferry, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>) show that cyt <italic>c</italic> like MmcA are intricately coupled to growth under a variety of conditions in the marine methanogen <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, membrane-spanning multi-heme cyt <italic>c</italic> have been shown to facilitate anaerobic methane oxidation by microbial consortia comprised of ANME archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wegener et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGlynn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2019</xref>) and recent studies also suggest an important role for cyt <italic>c</italic> in facilitating anaerobic alkane metabolism in several members of the <italic>Methanosarcinaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borrel et al., 2019</xref>). Since ANME and alkane oxidizing archaea are yet to be isolated in pure culture, our ability to manipulate the biogenesis of cyt <italic>c</italic> also renders <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> as an ideal platform to perform functional analyses of diverse cyt <italic>c</italic> across the <italic>Methanosarcinaceae</italic>. Curiously, even though cyt <italic>c</italic> are widely present in members of the <italic>Methanosarcinaceae</italic>, there are many extant strains, such as <italic>M. barkeri</italic> Fusaro, that lack the Ccm machinery altogether and do not encode any cyt <italic>c</italic> proteins in their genome. Our evolutionary analyses provide strong evidence that the uneven distribution of the Ccm machinery and cyt <italic>c</italic> in the <italic>Methanosarcinaceae</italic> is due to gene loss events rather than independent gene gain events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is also worth noting that many of the extant lineages that lack the Ccm machinery and cyt <italic>c</italic> are found in freshwater or anthropogenic sources (like waste digestors); reciprocally, the Ccm machinery and diverse cyt <italic>c</italic> are especially conserved in lineages derived from marine environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This pattern is indicative of the likelihood that there might be environment-specific selective pressure to retain or discard cyt <italic>c</italic> and the associated biogenesis machinery. However, the specific biotic or abiotic environmental cues that underlie this pattern remain unclear at the moment.</p><p>Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kletzin et al., 2015</xref>) have used some of the unique features that unify the archaeal Ccm machinery, notably the absence of CcmDHI and a conserved CXXXY heme-binding domain in CcmE, to support an ancestral origin of the Ccm machinery in the Archaea. Our phylogenetic analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">6</xref>) contradict this hypothesis and provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that there have been many independent HGT events that have cross-pollinated the Ccm machinery between the Archaea and Bacteria. In fact, even the Ccm machinery in one single archaeon, like <italic>M. acetivorans,</italic> may not have been derived from a single source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">6</xref>).

Growth curve plots and statistical analyses were obtained using GraphPad Prism 9.0.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Purification of membrane fraction containing TAP-tagged CcmE</title><p>Protein purification was performed with 250 mL of mid-exponential phase culture grown in HS + 50 mM TMA at 37°C without shaking under anaerobic conditions. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000× <italic>g</italic>) for 20 min at 4°C and were lysed in 10 mL of hypotonic Lysis buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH = 8.0) on ice for 30 min with intermittent shaking. Sodium chloride was added from a 5 M stock solution to a final concentration of 300 mM to the cell lysate. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000× <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C, followed by separation of soluble and membrane fractions via high-speed ultracentrifugation at 100,000× <italic>g</italic> for 45 min at 4°C. The membrane pellets were solubilized in 4 mL Wash buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, pH = 8.0) with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). The solubilized membrane fraction was loaded on a column containing 0.5 mL Strep-Tactin Superflow plus resin (50% suspension; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) equilibrated with 4 mL of the Wash buffer. The column was washed twice with 4 mL of Wash buffer by gravity flow and the purified protein was eluted in four fractions with 0.5 mL Elution buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM desthiobiotin, pH = 8.0) per fraction. The protein was concentrated using 10 kDa Amicon filter (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA). The protein concentration in each fraction was estimated using the Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) with BSA (bovine serum albumin) as the standard per the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Heme staining and immunoblotting</title><p>Heme staining using heme peroxidase assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feissner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>). For heme staining MmcA, total cell lysate of <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> or <italic>M. barkeri</italic> Fusaro was incubated at 65°C for 4 min. For heme staining CcmE, cell lysate/enriched protein samples were not heat treated. Protein samples were resolved by 12% Mini-Protean TGX denaturing SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and transblotted to 0.2 µm PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For heme staining, the SuperSignal West Femto kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to detect the heme signal on the transblotted PVDF membrane and imaging was performed with ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). All the heme stain blots were washed with 50 mL stripping buffer (60 mM Tris pH = 7 containing 2% SDS and 7 µL/mL β-mercaptoethanol) shaking at 50 rpm for 1 hr at 50°C and confirmed for the absence of any peroxidase-based signal from heme before they were used for immunoblots. FLAG-tagged proteins were probed with immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-Flag M2-Peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) (1/50,000× dilution) and Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, Burlington, MA) was used for signal detection. Imaging was performed with ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Near-equal loading of total protein was estimated using the Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) with BSA as the standard per the manufacturer’s instructions. All experiments were conducted for at least two biological replicates per strain and a representative blot has been shown in the text.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Bioinformatics analyses</title><p>Phylogenetic trees of <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> spp. and other strains within the <italic>Methanosarcinales</italic> (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) were obtained from AnnoTree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mendler et al., 2019</xref>).

cytochromes in methane producing archaea called methanogens. Compared to the bacterical cytochrome c assembly system, genes like ccmD, ccmH and ccmI are not found in archaea that contain a functional cytochrome Cs. They show that the proteins encoded by the ccmABCEF genes of <italic>Methanosarcina acetivorans</italic> are both essential and sufficient for cyt c biogenesis. They also show the substrate specific role of the mmcA y cyt c <italic>M. acetivorans</italic>.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Sonja V Albers as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Cornelia Welte (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please describe the number of biological and technical repetitions that were performed for each experiment (also for the western blots).</p><p>2) L107: the I in DIET stands for 'interspecies', not 'interdomain'. While in the specific case mentioned here, it is an interdomain electron transfer, in general it more broadly categorizes interspecies electron transfer. Please correct.</p><p>3) L149-150: this sentence is misleading, as it infers that MmcA is expressed in most methane-metabolizing archaea, which is incorrect. It is present only in those few methanogens that harbor the Rnf, and I'm not even sure that the ANME Rnf's contain it. Please rephrase the sentence to better reflect this.</p><p>4) L170: I was confused here by the +Control in Figure 2c. The authors mean plus empty vector? Can you please specify this in the legend?</p><p>5) L202-204: I think the authors need to explain this better, as this statement doesn't match their Figure in my view. In the figure, CcmD is required for dissociation of CcmE, not for the loading. Furthermore, with their essay they do not check for dissociated CcmE, only for heme loading of CcmE.</p><p>6) L215: There is a double band in the anti Flag Western Blot. Do the authors have any idea why there are two bands?</p><p>7) L269: replace free energy yield by Gibb's free energy change, as that's the correct term</p><p>8) L269: I don't think that the -164.5 kJ/mol is correct. How did the authors determine this number? According to Watkins et al. 2012 doi: 10.1128/AEM.03076-13 it's -172 kJ per four TMA, so per one TMA it would be only -43 kJ, whereas if you calculate it per methane, it's -57 kJ.</p><p>L286-287: I think this sentence is not so understandable – what was reduced by what? Please rephrase.</p><p>9) L321: I'm not so sure. Whereas for all methanogens, full genome sequences with one contig exists, for Methanoperedens (and other ANME), all genomes are fragmented, making gene absence analyses untrustworthy. At least you have to mention that the ANME genomes are, in contrast to all methanogens, incomplete metagenome-assembled genomes that make gene absence analyses questionable.</p><p>10) L402: this is much more strongly phrased in the Results section. I recommend to tone it down also there to be more in line, as I agree that you cannot rule out that other genes required for cyt c maturation are maybe still present in the Fusaro strain</p><p>11) L422: Methanoperedens as one of the archaea with most cyt c is a freshwater species, so I'm not so sure whether the marine environment is the most relevant driver</p><p>12) L469 and elsewhere: could the authors please use SI units instead of psi? bar?</p><p>13) L535: I really hope Methanosarcina was cultured anaerobically, not aerobically</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76970.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please describe the number of biological and technical repetitions that were performed for each experiment (also for the western blots).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included these details for each relevant experiment in the Materials and methods section; please see lines 513-514 and lines 556-557 in the revised manuscript.

Based on a recent study (https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001508), it does look like the MAGs from ANME archaea that contain Rnf also encode MmcA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) L170: I was confused here by the +Control in Figure 2c.

However, dissociation is required for heme-bound CcmE to transfer the heme group to MmcA (as shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2), which allows us to conclude that heme-bound CcmE has indeed dissociated from CcmABC. Since our experiments did not directly test dissociation of CcmE, aspointed out by the reviewer, we have softened our claim and conclusions. Please see lines 188-189.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) L215: There is a double band in the anti Flag Western Blot. Do the authors have any idea why there are two bands?</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 4c, we notice only band with heme staining (top panel) and two bands in the anti-flag western blot (bottom panel). It is likely that the second band is a degradation product of the tagged version of CcmE that does not bind heme. We do not notice any cross-reactivity with the anti-FLAG antibody in the strain expressing the C120H mutant of CcmE (which likely does not produce a stable protein), which further corroborates our hypothesis that the second band in the anti-FLAG western is a CcmE degradation product rather than any other protein in the cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) L269: replace free energy yield by Gibb's free energy change, as that's the correct term</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the edits per the reviewer’s suggestion.
