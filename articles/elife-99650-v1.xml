Caspase participates in reversible neuronal modulation via non-lethal activation. However, the mechanism that enables non-lethal activation remains unclear. Here, we analyzed proximal proteins of <italic>Drosophila</italic> executioner caspase in the adult brain using TurboID. We discovered that executioner caspase Drice is, as an inactive proform, proximal to cell membrane proteins, including a specific splicing isoform of cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin 3 (Fas3), Fas3G. To investigate whether sequestration of executioner caspase to plasma membrane of axons is the mechanism for non-lethal activation, we developed a Gal4-Manipulated Area-Specific CaspaseTracker/CasExpress system for sensitive monitoring of caspase activity near the plasma membrane. We demonstrated that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression promotes caspase activation in olfactory receptor neurons without killing them, by inducing expression of initiator caspase Dronc, which also comes close to Fas3G. Physiologically, <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression-facilitated non-lethal caspase activation suppresses innate olfactory attraction behavior. Our findings suggest that subcellularly restricted caspase activation, defined by caspase-proximal proteins, is the mechanism for non-lethal activation, opening the methodological development of reversible modification of neuronal function via regulating caspase-proximal proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Networks of neurons in the nervous system are continuously adapting and changing their role, often without having to kill and replace cells.

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During and even after development, the nervous system undergoes functional modification usually not depending on cell turnover. Caspase, best known as a cysteine aspartic acid protease involved in cell death, participates in neuronal functional modulation through non-lethal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mukherjee and Williams, 2017</xref>). In zebrafish embryos, non-lethal caspase activity promotes axon arbor dynamics in retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell and Okamoto, 2013</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, caspase activation promotes engulfment of pruned dendrites during metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, non-lethal caspase activity promotes the maturation of olfactory sensory neurons during development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohsawa et al., 2010</xref>). In the mature nervous system, non-lethal caspase activity induces long-term depression by AKT cleavage in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2010</xref>). These processes are termed caspase-dependent non-lethal cellular processes (CDPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aram et al., 2017</xref>). While a growing number of CDPs have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakajima and Kuranaga, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shinoda and Miura, 2024</xref>), relatively less is known about its regulatory mechanisms that enable specific non-lethal functions without causing cell death, especially in nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mukherjee and Williams, 2017</xref>). One potential mechanism is the restriction of the extent and spread of activated caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mukherjee and Williams, 2017</xref>), yet experimental evidence is limited.</p><p>Proteins that interact with initiator caspases are among the key regulators of CDPs. Tango7, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> translation initiation factor eIF3 subunit m, acts as an adapter and regulates the localization of the initiator caspase Dronc. During sperm individualization, Tango7 directs Dronc to the individualization complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D’Brot et al., 2013</xref>). In salivary glands, Tango7 directs Dronc to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2017</xref>). In both cases, caspase activity promotes cellular remodeling without inducing cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D’Brot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2017</xref>). CRINKLED, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> unconventional myosin, functions as an adaptor of Dronc and facilitates the cleavage of Shaggy46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Orme et al., 2016</xref>). Shaggy46, activated by caspase-mediated cleavage, suppresses the emergence of ectopic sensory organ precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanuka et al., 2005</xref>). During apoptosis-induced proliferation (AiP), Myo1D, another <italic>Drosophila</italic> unconventional myosin, facilitates Dronc translocation to the basal side of the plasma membrane of imaginal discs to promote AiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amcheslavsky et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, initiator caspase-interacting proteins regulate caspase activity in CDPs. However, given the importance of executioner caspases, which are activated by the initiator caspase to cleave a broad range of substrates and are essential for apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Julien and Wells, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar, 2007</xref>), little is known about the subcellular compartmentalization and interacting proteins of those involved in CDPs. This lack of understanding is partly due to the absence of protein-protein interaction domains (e.g. DED and CARD) in the N-terminus of executioner caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To understand the molecular mechanism regulating caspase activity involved in CDPs, we focused on the proximal proteins of executioner caspases using TurboID, a proximity labeling technique that analyzes protein proximity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Branon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qin et al., 2021</xref>). We have previously established C-terminal TurboID knocked-in caspase fly lines for Dronc (initiator), Drice (executioner), and Dcp-1 (executioner) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shinoda et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, we have demonstrated that one of the preferred substrates of Drice, BubR1, is proximal to Drice in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shinoda et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that substrate preference is exploited by protein proximity. Therefore, the proximity of executioner caspases to proteins is emerging as a means of regulating specific non-lethal functions.</p><p>To investigate the regulatory mechanisms of non-lethal function of caspase in the nervous system, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of proximal proteins of executioner caspase Drice. We discovered that Drice is, as an inactive proform, primarily proximal to cell membrane proteins, including cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin 3 (Fas3). Notably, Drice is proximal to the specific alternative splicing isoforms of Fas3, Fas3G. To ascertain whether Fas3G modulates caspase activity, we developed a Gal4-Manipulated Area Specific CaspaseTracker/CasExpress (MASCaT) system, which permits the monitoring of caspase activity near plasma membrane with high sensitivity and simultaneous genetic manipulation in the cells of interest. Using MASCaT, we demonstrated that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression enhances caspase activation without killing olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) through the induction of the expression of initiator caspase Dronc, which also comes proximal to Fas3G. Subsequently, we showed that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression-facilitated non-lethal caspase activation in ORNs suppresses innate olfactory attraction behavior. Collectively, our findings suggest that caspase activation is subcellularly restricted, the platform of which is defined by caspase-proximal proteins, for non-lethal functions. In contrast to lethal activation, suppressing neuronal activity with non-lethal caspase activation is reversible. By regulating caspase-proximal proteins, reversible modification of neuronal function by non-lethal caspase activation will be achieved.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Drice is the major executioner caspase expressed in the adult brains</title><p>Apoptotic stimuli activate initiator caspases that trigger a proteolytic cascade, leading to the activation of executioner caspases and culminating in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green, 2019</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the caspase-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakajima and Kuranaga, 2017</xref>). The activity of executioner caspases, specifically Drice and Dcp-1, is regulated by apoptotic signaling pathways, including the initiator caspase Dronc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate the expression patterns of <italic>Drosophila</italic> caspases, we employed <italic>Caspase::V5::TurboID</italic> knocked-in fly lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shinoda et al., 2019</xref>). We found low levels of expression of the initiator caspase Dronc in adult heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Conversely, we observed high expression of the executioner caspase Drice, whereas Dcp-1 was expressed at lower levels in adult heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The proximal proteins of each caspase were labeled with TurboID in adult heads by the administration of 100 µM biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, we investigated the expression patterns of caspases using histochemical analysis by examining streptavidin (SA) signal. Consistent with the western blotting findings, Drice showed higher expression levels than Dronc and Dcp-1, which were expressed at lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We found that Drice was expressed in distinct regions, including the mushroom bodies (MBs), subesophageal ganglions (SOGs), optic lobes (OLs), and antennal lobes (ALs), which showed the highest levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> ALs comprise synaptic contacts between the axons of ORNs, the dendrites of projection neurons, and local interneuron processes. Neuron-type-specific Gal4s were used to knock down <italic>Drice,</italic> and the expression patterns were subsequently examined. We found that Drice was expressed predominantly in ORNs in the AL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results show that Drice is highly expressed in a specific subset of neurons in the adult brains. Comparisons of the expression patterns of Drice were consistent across both males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), indicating an absence of sex-based differences, which justifies the use of males for functional simplicity in this study.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression patterns and proximal proteins of Drice in the adult brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram of <italic>Drosophila</italic> apoptosis signaling.

We confirmed biotinylation of Drice-proximal proteins in the adult brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). After purifying the biotinylated proteins using NeutrAvidin magnetic beads, we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We identified 643 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table S1</xref>), of which 158 were highly specific to <italic>Drice::V5::TurboID</italic> flies compared to wild-type flies (<italic>Drice::V5::TurboID</italic>/<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>&gt;10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table S1</xref>).

This finding suggests that Drice is localized primarily in cell membrane compartments rather than in the cytoplasm of the adult brain. Additionally, because the SA signal of <italic>Drice::V5::TurboID</italic> is mainly observed in the AL where the axons of ORNs project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the enrichment of cell membrane proteins in the proximal proteins of Drice is reasonable.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A specific splicing isoform of Fasciclin 3 is in proximity to Drice</title><p>During our analysis of proteins proximal to Drice, we discovered that the expression patterns of Fasciclin 3 (Fas3) in the adult brain closely resembled those of Drice, especially within the OLs, SOGs, and ALs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Thus, we focused on Fas3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiba et al., 1995</xref>), a transmembrane protein containing immunoglobulin-like domains that regulates synaptic target recognition and axon fasciculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kose et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>Fas3</italic> is encoded by seven splicing isoforms, resulting in the production of five protein isoforms that share extracellular domains but differ in intracellular domains with low-complexity sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Only one specific protein isoform, Fas3 isoform G (Fas3G), was identified in the LC-MS/MS analysis as a Drice-proximal protein in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table S1</xref>). Using AlphaFold2-Multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>), Drice was predicted to interact with Fas3A (ipTM = 0.456) and Fas3G (ipTM = 0.372) rather than Fas3C (ipTM = 0.298), Fas3D/E (ipTM = 0.220), and Fas3B/F (ipTM = 0.207). Among Fas3 isoforms, only Fas3G is predicted to interact with Drice with two intracellular regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To validate this result, we generated an antibody specific to Fas3G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>). We confirmed that only the Fas3G was labeled with Drice::V5::TurboID and purified using NeutrAvidin magnetic beads as detected using western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

After proximity labeling with TurboID, followed by NeutrAvidin purification, we found that Fas3G was highly enriched compared to the other isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These findings suggested that Drice is proximal to a specific isoform of Fas3 in ORNs, regardless of its protein expression level. We also investigated whether Drice and Fas3G statically interact by co-immunoprecipitation. Although Fas3G was labeled by Drice::V5::TurboID, indicating its proximity to Drice within the ORNs of adult brains, Drice did not co-immunoprecipitate with Fas3G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

CaspaseTracker/CasExpress is a highly sensitive reporter of caspase activity that uses caspase-activatable Gal4 tethered to the membrane by mCD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). However, reliance on Gal4 to report their activity presents a challenge in reconciling Gal4/UAS-dependent gene manipulations. To overcome this limitation, we created a new reporter to capture caspase activation independent of caspase-activatable Gal4. We replaced the caspase-activatable Gal4 with the caspase-activatable QF2 (<italic>mCD8::DQVD::QF2</italic>), where DQVD is a caspase cleavage sequence, and first expressed directly downstream of <italic>UAS</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the caspase-activatable QF2 induced mNeonGreen expression under <italic>QUAS</italic> sequence even either with a pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, or an uncleavable DQVA mutant probe (<italic>mCD8::DQVA::QF2</italic>, insensitive to caspase-mediated cleavage which serves as a negative control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), potentially because the Gal4/UAS binary system expressed excessive mCD8::DQVD/A::QF2 probes that result in caspase activation-independent induction of QF2/QUAS system. Thus, to reduce the amount of probes expression, we generated <italic>Ubi-FRT-STOP-FRT-mCD8::DQVD::QF2</italic>, simultaneously expressing <italic>Flippase</italic> (<italic>FLP</italic>) under <italic>UAS</italic> to restrict reporter expression to the cells of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells undergo weak caspase activation only by transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shinoda et al., 2023</xref>). Taking advantage of that, this system reports caspase activity through the caspase-activatable QF2/QUAS system, expressing mNeonGreen, which is not detected by caspase-non-activatable QF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We named this novel reporter a MASCaT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Using MASCaT, we detected caspase activity, specifically in the neurons of adult brains, using <italic>ELAV-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Previously, we reported that a specific subset of ORNs, including Or42b neurons, undergoes age-associated caspase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chihara et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this finding, we detected age-dependent caspase activation in the AL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

We first confirmed that MASCaT probes were distributed in the axons of ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Using MASCaT, we observed weak caspase activation even in the control group at a young age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). The expression of <italic>Fas3G</italic> significantly promoted caspase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>), indicating that Fas3G regulates non-lethal caspase activation. Moreover, the simultaneous expression of <italic>Drice</italic> and <italic>Fas3G</italic> significantly enhanced caspase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>), signifying the promoting effect of their proximity. Moreover, the concurrent expression of Diap-1, an E3 ligase known to inhibit caspase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ditzel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hay et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2011</xref>), mitigated the caspase activation induced by <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>). This indicates that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression-facilitated non-lethal caspase activation is dependent on the core apoptotic machinery. To test whether endogenous Fas3G regulates caspase activation, we generated a <italic>Fas3G</italic>-specific <italic>shRNA</italic>-expressing strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Fas3</italic> or <italic>Fas3G</italic> in Or42b neurons didn’t suppress the inherent, weak caspase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). In agreement with this, Drice’s presence in the axon of ORNs with Fas3G was observed, yet its presence was not strictly contingent on Fas3 or Fas3G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Given the numerous other membrane proteins in proximity to Drice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table S1</xref>), it is probable that additional proteins may be responsible for recruiting Drice to the axon. These findings collectively imply that while Fas3G is not essential for mild endogenous caspase activation, overexpression of <italic>Fas3G</italic> does enhance non-lethal caspase activation in ORNs, thus providing a valuable model for exploring the molecular processes that facilitate caspase activation without leading to cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Fas3G is proximal to Dronc, which is required for non-lethal caspase activation</title><p>Next, we investigated the underlying mechanism that enhances non-lethal activation facilitated by <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression. Executioner caspases, Drice and Dcp-1, are activated by initiator caspase, Dronc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We precisely analyzed the expression pattern of Dronc in adult brains and found that while its expression was low in control, overexpression of <italic>Fas3G</italic> in ORNs markedly increased Dronc levels in those neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, akin to Drice, Dronc was also found in close proximity to the overexpressed Fas3G, but not to the overexpressed Fas3C in ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Consequently, we examined whether Dronc is required for the non-lethal caspase activation enhanced by <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression. Employing MASCaT, we discovered that both knockdown of <italic>Dronc</italic> and the expression of the <italic>dominant-negative form of Dronc</italic> (<italic>Dronc<sup>DN</sup></italic>) hindered the non-lethal caspase activation facilitated by <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), indicating a dependence on initiator caspase activity. Importantly, the genetic suppression of Dronc activity did not alter the proximity between Drice and Fas3G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that the inactive Drice proform is primarily proximal to Fas3G.

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) excites six glomeruli in the AL, including DM1, which is innervated by the axons of Or42b neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>). We have previously reported that Or42b neurons undergo aging-dependent caspase activation and partial cell death, which reduces neuronal activity and attraction behavior in response to ACV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chihara et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of caspase activity in aged flies restores attraction behavior but does not affect that of young flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chihara et al., 2014</xref>). Using a two-choice preference assay with ACV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), we found that 16 hr of starvation combined with 25% ACV in the trap elicited a robust attraction behavior to the vinegar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, 4 hr of starvation with 1% ACV in the trap resulted in milder attraction behavior, with the preference index value being close to 0 but still showing a positive trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Under the milder experimental condition, we first confirmed that inhibition of caspase activity through expressing <italic>Dronc<sup>DN</sup></italic> didn’t affect attraction behavior in young adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chihara et al., 2014</xref>).

In humans, caspase-3 and caspase-7 have been shown to share but also have discrete substrate preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walsh et al., 2008</xref>). Caspase-7 leverages an exosite to facilitate interaction with RNA and enhance the proteolysis of RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boucher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desroches and Denault, 2019</xref>). Thus, protein proximity can be used to precisely regulate specific cellular functions by selectively cleaving a limited pool of substrates in non-lethal scenarios compared with lethal cleavages where all the substrates are potentially cleaved during apoptosis. We showed that executioner caspases, before activation as proforms, are exclusively sequestered in specific subcellular domains, including the plasma membrane of axons. We found that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression facilitates non-lethal activation, underscoring the importance of protein proximity not only in substrate cleavage but also in localizing non-lethal activation to the vicinity of the plasma membrane of axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Our results suggest that subcellularly restricted caspase activation mediated by caspase-proximal proteins is one of the potential mechanisms regulating caspase activation without inducing cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>MASCaT as a highly sensitive reporter for identifying non-lethal caspase regulators</title><p>Various caspase activity reporters have been developed, including SCAT3, a FRET-based reporter with superior temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takemoto et al., 2003</xref>), CaspaseTracker/CasExpress, Caspase-activatable Gal4-based reporters with superior sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). However, to date, no reporter has been developed that is sensitive enough to identify non-lethal regulators of caspases in cells of interest. In this study, we developed a novel caspase reporter, MASCaT, that can detect caspase activation with high sensitivity in a cell-type-specific manner following gene manipulation. Using MASCaT, we identified previously overlooked regulators of non-lethal activation of caspases in a cell-type-specific manner. Proximal proteins of executioner caspases are potential non-lethal regulators, and combining TurboID-mediated identification of these proteins will pave the way for identifying non-lethal components and broaden our understanding of the molecular mechanism of non-lethal caspase activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Non-lethal caspase activation regulates neuronal activity and behaviors</title><p>We previously reported that age-dependent caspase activation reduces neuronal activity and innate attraction behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chihara et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we found that, while <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression did not impair attraction behavior by itself, caspase activation upon <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression suppressed attraction behavior toward ACV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In mice, L1CAM, an immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule similar to Fas3, facilitates neuronal excitability by regulating the voltage-gated Na+ channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valente et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that non-lethal caspase activation antagonizes the neuronal excitability promoted by Fas3G. In neurons, caspases have diverse non-lethal functions, including axon degeneration and macro- and micro-pruning, to regulate synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dehkordi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mukherjee and Williams, 2017</xref>). In presynaptic terminals, it has been recently reported that caspase-3 modulates synaptic vesicle pools via autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is possible that non-lethal activation regulates synaptic pools and neuronal activity in a reversible manner without killing the cells. Analyzing the functions mediated by Drice and Fas3G proximity, including the identification of specific substrates, will pave the way for identifying diverse CDPs and understanding their molecular mechanisms.</p><p>While suppressing innate attraction behavior does not seem beneficial by itself, it should be a great advantage in decision-making. To survive, flies must constantly make appropriate behavioral decisions (e.g. feeding versus mating) depending on their physiological conditions. In males, a subset of neurons regulated by tyramine controls feeding versus mating behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheriyamkunnel et al., 2021</xref>). In regard to that, it is important to adequately promote or suppress neuronal activity, which controls the behaviors of the organisms, by precisely controlling caspase activation in a subcellularly restricted manner in neurons. Compared with lethal activation, which irreversibly removed the neurons of interest, suppressing neuronal activity with non-lethal reversible caspase activation is beneficial for decision-making depending on their varying physiological conditions. As regulating caspase-proximal proteins enables non-lethal activation, which is not achieved by directly manipulating caspase expression, our results open the possibility of the methodological development for reversible manipulation of neuronal activity via non-lethal caspase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Proximal proteins of executioner caspases define the site of caspase activation ‘hotspot’</title><p>Although the core apoptotic machinery has been well characterized during the past 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakajima and Kuranaga, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shinoda and Miura, 2024</xref>), the precise regulation of CDPs remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, we identified that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression activates Drice. Mechanistically, we found that the <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression induced the expression of initiator caspase Dronc, which also comes close to Fas3G, regulating non-lethal caspase activation. Direct overexpression of Dronc alone results in cell death within ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). However, when Dronc expression is upregulated due to <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression, it does not lead to cell death in ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). The exact process by which Dronc expression is increased in response to <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression remains to be elucidated. It is known that Dronc can be upregulated via the ecdysone signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorstyn et al., 1999</xref>) and the Hippo signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verghese et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the overexpression of <italic>Fas3G</italic> might potentially activate Dronc expression through one or both signaling pathways. Fas3 is an immunoglobulin-like domain-containing transmembrane protein that regulates axonal fasciculation and neuronal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiba et al., 1995</xref>). NCAM, a mammalian homologue of Fascicilin 2, is an immunoglobulin-like domain-containing cell adhesion molecule. NCAM can physically bind to caspase-8, and depending on NCAM clustering, caspase-8 and caspase-3 are activated and contribute to neurite outgrowth by cleaving its substrate spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Westphal et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that cell adhesion molecule-mediated subcellularly restricted caspase activation is conserved among species. Indeed, caspase-9/Apaf-1-dependent caspase-3 activation, without resulting in cell death, has also been observed in the axon of olfactory sensory neurons during mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohsawa et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>While the restriction of the extent and spread of activated caspases is proposed as one of the potential molecular mechanisms for non-lethal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mukherjee and Williams, 2017</xref>), experimental evidence is limited. A critical insight from our research is that the executioner caspase is pre-compartmentalized in proximity to a specific set of proteins prior to activation, poised for the initiator caspase to approach. Consequently, the ‘hotspot’ for non-lethal caspase activity appears to be determined by these neighboring proteins of executioner caspases. While the ‘hotspot’ located in the axon of the ORN may exert an inhibitory effect on neuronal activity, it could also play a role in avoiding cell death by localizing caspase activity, especially during development.</p><p>Recently, a protein interactome analysis in humans showed that tissue-preferentially expressed proteins that interact with known apoptosis regulators participate in apoptosis sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luck et al., 2020</xref>). Given that CDPs are often cell- and tissue-type-specific processes, the identification of modulators of context-dependent apoptotic pathways will aid in understanding the precise molecular regulation of CDPs. Importantly, alternative splicing can diversify protein-protein interaction networks. A recent report showed that minor spliceosomes regulate alternative splicing, including Fas3. A specific isoform of Fas3 has distinct functions and cannot be substituted by other isoforms during neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Our results support the idea that alternative splicing may not only diversify the protein itself, but also its interaction networks to regulate module-dependent activation. Further interactome analysis using TurboID will reveal the regulatory mechanisms of the non-lethal activation of caspases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains and rearing conditions</title><p>We raised the flies in standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium at 25°C.

The FG-NeutrAvidin beads (25 µL, approximately 500 µg) were washed three times with RIPA buffer. Benzonase-treated biotinylated protein samples suspended in 1 mL RIPA buffer were incubated overnight at 4°C. Conjugated beads were magnetically isolated and washed with 500 µL of an ice-cold RIPA buffer solution, 1 M KCl solution, 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> solution, and 4 M urea solution.

There are a few minor comments and a point was raised regarding figure 6 for which further details were asked. Please see the reviewer's comments. We are looking forward to receiving an updated version of your very interesting paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to you and the reviewers for dedicating time to review our manuscript and for providing insightful comments and suggestions. We have revised our manuscript in line with the reviewers' feedback. The major revision involves clarifying the two-choice preference assay presented in Figure 6. Details of these revisions are provided in our point-by-point responses to the reviewers’ comments below. The new and extensively modified sections of text are highlighted in blue. We have introduced new panels (Figures 1D, 3D, 6B, and 6C) and made modifications to Figure 6A. The previous Figure 1D has been relocated to Figure 1–figure supplement 1B. Additionally, our detailed responses to the reviewers’ comments are also highlighted in blue within the point-by-point response section. With all concerns and suggestions from the Editor and reviewers addressed, our conclusion—that executioner caspase is proximal to Fasciclin 3 which facilitates non-lethal activation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory receptor neurons—is now more robustly supported. We are confident that our revised manuscript makes a significant contribution to the fields of caspase function and neurobiology. We remain hopeful that the reviewers will find it suitable for publication in eLife.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The main comment here is related to Figure 6, which needs to be better explained. First, if the results in Figure 6B and C are conducted with young flies, why is the preference index close to 0? Aren't these young flies more attracted to ACV? Second, what are the results with Dronc-RNAi and DroncDN alone? These should be shown to more accurately assess the outcome of Fas3G expression with and without Dronc inhibition. Third, if Fas3G overexpression induces non-lethal caspase activation and a behavioral change, why does Dronc inhibition enhance (and not suppress) this behavioral change?</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the comment. We used one-week-old young flies for the two-choice preference assay. We found that 16 hours of starvation combined with 25% ACV in the trap elicited a robust attraction behavior to the vinegar (New Figure 6B). In contrast, 4 hours of starvation with 1% ACV in the trap resulted in milder attraction behavior, with the preference index value being close to 0 but still showing a positive trend (New Figure 6B). Since our hypothesis is that non-lethal caspase activation suppresses attraction behavior, and that inhibiting caspase activation could enhance attraction, we used the milder experimental condition for subsequent analyses.</p><p>In the original manuscript, we did not test Dronc inhibition alone because caspase activation is rarely observed in young flies (as demonstrated in Figure 3C, New Figure 3D, etc), suggesting that Dronc inhibition during this stage would not affect behavior. This hypothesis is further supported by previous research showing that inhibition of caspase activity in aged flies restores attraction behavior but does has no effect in young flies (Chihara et al., 2014). To validate this hypothesis, we conducted the two-choice preference assay again, including caspase activity inhibition by <italic>DroncDN</italic> expression alone. As expected, Dronc inhibition alone did not alter behavior in young flies (New Figure 6C).</p><p>We also observed that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression promotes a weak, though not statistically significant, enhancement in attraction behavior. Importantly, simultaneous inhibition of caspase activity further enhanced attraction behavior (New Figure 6C). These results suggest that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression has a dual function: one aspect promotes attraction behavior, while the other induces non-lethal caspase activation. In this context, non-lethal caspase activation appears to counteract the behavioral response, acting as a regulatory brake. To address the reviewer’s comments comprehensively, we included the New Figure 6B and replaced the original Figure 6B and C with New Figure 6C. Additionally, we revised the manuscript text as follows:</p><p>Using a two-choice preference assay with ACV (Figure 6A), we found that 16 hours of starvation combined with 25% ACV in the trap elicited a robust attraction behavior to the vinegar (Figure 6B). In contrast, 4 hours of starvation with 1% ACV in the trap resulted in milder attraction behavior, with the preference index value being close to 0 but still showing a positive trend (Figure 6B). Under the milder experimental condition, we first confirmed that inhibition of caspase activity through expressing <italic>DroncDN</italic> didn’t affect attraction behavior in young adult (Figure 6C), consistent with a previous report (Chihara et al., 2014).We then observed that the overexpression of <italic>Fas3G</italic>, which activates caspases, did not impair attraction behavior. Instead, it rather appeared to enhance the tendency for attraction behavior (Figure 6C), suggesting that Fas3G promotes attraction behavior. Finally, we found that inhibiting <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression-facilitated non-lethal caspase activation by expressing <italic>DroncDN</italic> strongly promoted attraction to ACV (Figure 6C). Overall, these results suggest that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression has a dual function: it enhances attraction behavior while also triggering non-lethal caspase activation, which counteracts the behavioral response, functioning as a regulatory brake without causing cell death.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other minor comments are below:</p><p>The authors should clarify that while they refer to their caspases reporters as &quot;non-lethal caspase reporters&quot;, these are caspase reporters in general and can report both lethal and non-lethal caspase activation. Of course, the only surviving cells are those that experience non-lethal caspase activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. This reporter can monitor caspase activation with high sensitivity only if the cell is capable of transcribing and translating the reporter proteins following cleavage of the probe, most likely in living cells. However, as mentioned, using the term “non-lethal reporter” is not accurate, as additional experiments are required to determine whether caspase activation leads to cell death. Therefore, we removed the term “non-lethal” and referred to this reporter simply as a highly sensitive caspase reporter in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the figure panels could be better described in the legends (e.g. Figure 1E, 1F, 4E, 4F).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment.

We intended to use the colors where the light blue bars represent <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression, while the red dots indicate caspase-activated conditions. In the New Figure 6C, we used light blue dots for <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression and red bars for caspase-activated conditions. We have added an explanation in the figure legend.

Why do you use only females?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In the original manuscript, we analyzed female flies by crossing each Gal4 strain with <italic>UAS-Drice-RNAi; Drice::V5::TurboID</italic> virgin females. In this case, because <italic>Pebbled-Gal4</italic> is located on X chromosome, we could only use female flies for the analysis. To address this, we examined the expression pattern in males flies by crossing each Gal4 virgin female with <italic>UAS-Drice-RNAi; Drice::V5::TurboID</italic> males. As expected, Drice expression is also mostly depleted when using the ORN-specific Gal4 driver, <italic>Pebbled-Gal4</italic>, suggesting that Drice expression is predominantly observed in ORNs in males as well. We have added New Figure 1D to present the male data. The original Figure 1D, which presents female data, has been relocated to Figure 1–figure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 1D. Be clear about the LN driver used here in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We used <italic>Orb0449-Gal4</italic> driver (#63325, Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center), which has been previously characterized as an LN-specific Gal4 driver (Wu et al., 2017). Accordingly, we have revised “LN-Gal4” to “<italic>Orb0449-Gal4</italic>” throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1 images are very good. I would recommend the use of a different color palette, to help visualization for colorblind readers (such as this reviewer).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any inconvenience caused. We chose the green/magenta color pair because these are complementary colors, which generally provide better contrast compared to other color pairs. Therefore, we have decided to continue using this pair. To enhance readability, we have intensified the magenta signal in the New Figure 1D and Figure 1–figure supplement 1B. We retained the original magenta signal levels in Figure 1C and Figure 1–figure supplement 1A to avoid oversaturation. Instead, we have kept the Streptavidin-only signal images alongside the color merged images for clarity. We hope these adjustments improve the visualization and help you better interpret the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Based on Supplementary Figure 1 and based on the fact that Figures 1B and 1C use males, why not used also males for Figure 1D?</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our reply to comment #7. We have now included the results for males in the New Figure 1D, which show a similar expression pattern to that observed in females. The results for females originally shown in Figure 1D have been relocated to Figure 1–figure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Why were the old versus young flies used for Figure 3 raised at 29C? Why not let the animals age at 25C? The use of 29C throughout the manuscript is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Most of the UAS fly strains used in this study, including a <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression line, are <italic>UASz</italic> lines, which exhibit relatively low expression levels compared to UASt lines (DeLuca and Spradling, 2018). Since the Gal4/UAS system is temperature-dependent (Duffy, 2002), we performed most of the experiments at 29°C to enhance gene expression.</p><p>For the aging experiments, we chose to rear flies at 29°C because higher temperatures accelerate aging including neuronal aging (Okenve-Ramos et al., 2024), allowing for faster experimentation, and 29°C is within the ecologically relevant range of temperatures for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (SotoYéber et al., 2018). Additionally, we confirmed that a subset of olfactory receptor neurons undergo aging-dependent caspase activation at both 29°C and 25°C, as shown in New Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Why not use an Or42b specific GAL 4 for the aging experiment? What are the odorants that are detected by this ORN? Are any of the odorants behaviorally relevant compounds?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. While the exact odorant detected by Or42b neurons has not been fully determined, these neurons innervate the DM1 region in the antennal lobe, which is activated by ACV. Additionally, Or42b neurons have been shown to be required for attraction behavior to ACV (Semmelhack and Wang, 2009), supporting the relevance of ACV for the behavioral experiment. We used <italic>Or42b-Gal4</italic> to confirm that Or42b neurons undergo aging-dependent caspase activation, which is detectable using the MASCaT system (New Figure 3D). Furthermore, we verified that these neurons exhibit aging-dependent caspase activation at both 25°C and 29°C (New Figure 3D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Make the panel lettering in all the figures bigger or bold.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.

Were the flies young or old?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We performed the assay using one-week-old young flies under constant dark conditions during both the starvation period and the assay. We have added a detailed explanation in the Methods section. For clarity, we have also revised Figure 6A to provide a more detailed explanation of the experimental setup.</p><p>References</p><p>Chihara T, Kitabayashi A, Morimoto M, Takeuchi K-I, Masuyama K, Tonoki A, Davis RL, Wang JW, Miura M. 2014.
