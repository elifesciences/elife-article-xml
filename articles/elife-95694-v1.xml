believed to modulate the release of dopamine in the striatum of mammals. Experiments in brain slices clearly show that synchronous activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons is sufficient to drive dopamine release via axo-axonal stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. However, evidence for this mechanism in vivo has been less forthcoming. Mohebi, Collins and Berke recently reported that, in awake behaving rats, optogenetic activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons with blue light readily evokes dopamine release measured with the red fluorescent sensor RdLight1 (Mohebi et al., 2023). Here, we show that blue light alone alters the fluorescent properties of RdLight1 in a manner that may be misconstrued as phasic dopamine release, and that this artefactual photoactivation can account for the effects attributed to cholinergic interneurons. Our findings indicate that measurements of dopamine using the red-shifted fluorescent sensor RdLight1 should be interpreted with caution when combined with optogenetics. In light of this and other publications that did not observe large acetylcholine-evoked dopamine transients in vivo, the conditions under which such release occurs in behaving animals remain unknown.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>fluorescent probes</kwd><kwd>photometry</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>photoactivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH130658</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tritsch</surname><given-names>Nicolas X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006984</institution-id><institution>Irma T.

Striatum-projecting midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are no exception; many transmitters present in the striatum directly act on DA axons to facilitate or depress vesicular release of DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sulzer et al., 2016</xref>). However, the axons of DA neurons do stand out in their sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh), whose release from striatal cholinergic interneurons in brain slices is potent enough to trigger axonal action potentials and locally evoke DA release (i.e., independently of somatic spiking activity) via the activation of β2-containing nicotinic ACh receptors on DA axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cachope et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mamaligas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kramer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Matityahu et al., 2023</xref>). This mechanism was proposed to underlie observations that DA release in ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens, NAc) can increase even when the firing of DA neurons in the midbrain appears unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). However, direct evidence for ACh-evoked striatal DA release in vivo remains limited.</p><p>In their original report of ACh-evoked DA release, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cachope et al., 2012</xref> presented an example recording whereby strong optogenetic activation of cholinergic interneurons for several seconds is accompanied by DA elevation in the NAc of a urethane-anesthetized mouse. More recently, we and others showed in mice and rats that the patterns of DA and ACh release in various striatal locations in vivo are strongly correlated on sub-second time-scales in a manner that is consistent with ACh-evoked DA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Howe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chantranupong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krok et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mohebi et al., 2023</xref>). Yet, we were unable to observe strong changes in the dynamics of DA in the dorsal and lateral striatum of mice after molecular, pharmacological and optogenetic interference with ACh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chantranupong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krok et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>A recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mohebi et al., 2023</xref>) provided some of the most compelling evidence to date that optogenetic activation of channelrhodopsin-expressing striatal cholinergic interneurons drives DA release in the NAc of awake behaving rats, as measured with the red-shifted DA sensor RdLight1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Patriarchi et al., 2020</xref>). However, one concern with these experiments is that mApple-based fluorescent sensors – including RdLight1 and the GRAB-rDA series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhuo et al., 2024</xref>) – may exhibit photoactivation (also known as ‘photoswitching’ or ‘photoconversion’), a process whereby mApple’s red fluorescence changes in the presence of blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shaner et al., 2008</xref>). This phenomenon is one of the main downsides of the R-GECO family of red Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, which also use mApple and grow brighter independently of Ca<sup>2+</sup> for hundreds of milliseconds following brief flashes of blue light, limiting their use with optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dana et al., 2016</xref>). In the case of RdLight1, it was previously shown that photoactivation effects are negligible when expressed in cultured kidney cells and imaged using light-scanning confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Patriarchi et al., 2020</xref>). Whether RdLight1 shows photoactivation in vivo under conditions routinely used in behavioral experiments (i.e., full-field fiber photometry and optogenetic stimulation) has not been investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Blue light evokes RdLight1 fluorescence transients in the absence of an opsin</title><p>To determine if blue light modifies the fluorescent properties of RdLight1 in the behaving brain, the laboratory of N.X.T. virally expressed RdLight1 in either the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) or NAc of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and imaged RdLight1 fluorescence in vivo using fiber photometry while mice were head-fixed on a cylindrical treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Several lines of evidence suggest that this is not the case. First, our wild-type mice do not express blue light-gated opsins to drive DA release and DA neurons are not thought to be intrinsically sensitive to blue light. Second, blue light-evoked transients show little trial-by-trial variability in their amplitudes and kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and J</xref>). Third, blue light-evoked transients do not display short-term facilitation or depression under a variety of stimulation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), calling into question their synaptic origin. Fourth, we repeated the above experiments in a subset of mice treated with reserpine, an irreversible antagonist of the transporter required for loading DA into synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Under these conditions, spontaneous fluctuations in RdLight1 fluorescence vanished in both the DLS (N=4) and NAc (N=4), confirming the absence of activity-dependent DA release in vivo. By contrast, blue light-evoked RdLight1 transients did not disappear and, if anything, grew in amplitude and duration in both DLS and NAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>), demonstrating that they do not reflect synaptic release of DA.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>RdLight1 photoactivation transients evoked by blue light pulse trains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup.

This photoactivation manifests as a prolonged, DA-independent increase in RdLight1 fluorescence that outlasts the blue light pulse and slowly decays back to baseline over hundreds of milliseconds, giving it the appearance of synaptically-released DA. Under our recording conditions, photoactivation remained detectable with as little as 0.3 mW blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), indicating that RdLight1 fluorescence should be interpreted with caution when combined with blue light in a variety of experimental conditions, including dual-color imaging of green and red fluorophores. In this case, the steady or rapidly-modulating (i.e., tens to hundreds of Hz) blue light might lead to constant activation of mApple but, due to its long photoswitching time, is unlikely to contribute to phasic and aperiodic transients in the red channel, which our experiments showed reflect DA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chantranupong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krok et al., 2023</xref>). It is possible that the initial characterization of RdLight1 failed to reveal strong blue light-mediated photoactivation as it used laser-scanning microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Patriarchi et al., 2020</xref>), which Roger Tsien and colleagues found in their original characterization of mApple produced significantly less photoswitching compared to continuous wide-field illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shaner et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our findings call into question the nature of the RdLight1 fluorescent transients reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mohebi et al., 2023</xref>. Given the similarity of our recordings in terms of response magnitude, timing and dynamics over a variety of stimulation parameters, it is likely that the light-evoked RdLight1 responses reported reflect this photoactivation effect. Although the study used 405 nm illumination to control for changes in fluorophore properties independent of ligand binding (i.e., the so-called isosbestic point), this deep blue wavelength has not been shown to be the isosbestic point for RdLight1. Indeed, the isosbestic point of commonly-used green dopamine sensors is more green-shifted (e.g. 440 nm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sun et al., 2020</xref>), stressing the need for sensors to be published along with their full excitation/emission spectra, and for experimenters to tailor illumination wavelengths to their specific sensor. It also remains to be determined whether illumination at isosbestic wavelengths can contribute to or modify photoactivation.</p><p>Moving forward, additional experiments will be needed to determine conditions under which cholinergic interneurons locally evoke DA release in the striatum of behaving animals. If using RdLight1, experiments should include controls to account for the effects of blue light alone, such as expressing RdLight1 only (i.e., no opsin), RdLight1 and a fluorophore [e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP)] or a mutated sensor that does not bind DA. Blue light illumination power should be kept as low as possible. Alternatively, optogenetic experiments may be designed using GFP-based DA sensors such as dLight1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>) or GRAB-DA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhuo et al., 2024</xref>) in combination with red-shifted optogenetic actuators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Marshel et al., 2019</xref>), although this configuration is not without caveats either, as continuous blue light illumination may cause opsin activation.</p><p>Importantly, photoactivation is not unique to RdLight1. Other mApple-based sensors, including the GRAB-rDA and R-GenGAR-DA families of red DA sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nakamoto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhuo et al., 2024</xref>), as well as the R-GECO family of Ca2 +indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dana et al., 2016</xref>) show photoactivation when presented with blue light, with individual constructs differing in the polarity, magnitude and duration of photoactivation effects. Photoactivation also extends beyond mApple, as many fluorophores can modify their biophysical properties when presented with different wavelengths of light. It is, for instance, the biophysical principle on which some molecular tracking and super-resolution imaging methods are founded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lippincott-Schwartz and Patterson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chozinski et al., 2014</xref>). Experiments should therefore be designed carefully to control for these and other potential confounds, particularly when novel sensors are introduced.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the NYU Grossman School of Medicine (NYUGSM; #IA16-02082) and Harvard Medical School (HMS; #IS0000571) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.

The red light emitted by RdLight1 was collected through the same patch cord and routed via the fluorescence mini cube and a second fiber optic (MFP_600/630/LWMJ-0.48_0.5 m_FCM-FCM; Doric) to a photoreceiver (Newport 2151) to produce a voltage that is proportional to the intensity of the emitted light. Voltages were digitized at 2 kHz with either a National Instruments acquisition board (NI USB-6343) or a Labjack (T7) and saved to disk as ‘trials/sweeps’ lasting 5–20 s in duration each using Wavesurfer software (Janelia). To characterize the photoactivation behavior of RdLight1, we delivered brief pulses (1–6ms in duration) of blue light (NAc, DLS: 470 nm LED, Thorlabs M470F3; VLS: 470 nm laser, Optoengine) to the brain via the same fluorescence mini cube and patch cord used for photometry. We tested a range of blue light powers (measured at the tip of the patch cord) frequently used for optogenetic manipulations in vivo. The timing, duration and intensity of blue light pulses were controlled digitally using Wavesurfer, with each stimulation parameter repeated at minimum 10 times per mouse/recording site. RdLight1 photoactivation responses are extremely stable over time and were reliably seen for the duration of 1 h-long recording sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fiber Photometry Analysis</title><p>Photometry signals were processed and analyzed offline using custom code (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TritschLab/Taniguchi-Melani-2024">https://github.com/TritschLab/Taniguchi-Melani-2024</ext-link>; copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">TritschLab, 2024</xref>) in MATLAB (Mathworks) and Igor Pro 6.02 A (Wavemetrics).

Moreover, the dynamics of RdLight1 responses to blue light closely mimic the classic dynamics of dopamine transients and would be difficult to distinguish without proper controls. The magnitude of the artifact scales with blue light duration and intensity, is reproducible across several regions of striatum (and in separate laboratories), is robust to dopamine depletion with reserpine, and shows no evidence of depression with repeated stimulation. Taken together, these data highlight an important caveat for the use of RdLight1 with blue-light-activated opsins. This issue has implications for both the interpretation of the paper by Mohebi, Collins and Berke and for the wider audience of scientists utilizing fluorescent sensors in their work. While the findings of this comment show definitively that Figure 1 of Mohebi et al. is contaminated by an artifact, the remaining figures of the paper add valuable knowledge to our limited understanding of the role of cholinergic interneurons in modulating dopamine activity in the striatum in vivo. It is important to note that this comment is an example of responsible and transparent work that reflects how science should be conducted. Both the authors of the original paper and of this comment showed commendable scientific integrity in producing this comment.

It is still unclear if dual-color fiber photometry (as is used in some of the remaining Mohebi et al. figures) would be subject to the same artifact, as the light intensities generally used for fiber photometry are much lower than for optogenetics and lower than were tested in this comment. In the future, all authors making use of fluorescent sensors can use the approaches demonstrated in this comment to conduct proper controls for their own experiments.</p><p>2. The authors correctly point out that many mApple-based fluorescent sensors have been shown to have similar photoswitching artifacts (Zhuo et al., 2023), but should be careful about singling out mApple as the sole issue.

(2023) that substantially changes the interpretation and impact of the original article. In Mohebi et al., the authors used a red-shifted fluorescent dopamine sensor, RdLight1, to measure dopamine release in behaving rodents. They then simultaneously activated a population of acetylcholine-releasing interneurons (ChIs) using a blue-light gated channel rhodopsin (ChR2). They found that evoking action potentials in the ChIs with blue light led to transient increases in the RdLight1 signal that were interpreted as dopamine release. This result was the key observation for the principal conclusions of their study.</p><p>However, the present Comment clearly demonstrates through new data that blue light stimulation also directly 'activates' the RdLight1 sensor to produce a signal that appears as dopamine but is in fact not dopamine. Taniguchi et al. thoroughly tested and verified these findings. These results directly challenge the principal findings from Mohebi et al., including the observation that dopamine release is linearly scaled with intensity and duration of activation of cholinergic interneurons (i.e. no short-term depression).</p><p>It should be noted that Mohebi and Berke collaborated on this Comment and acknowledge the methodological error in their original publication. This Comment should be published with no need for additional data. I have no substantive concerns.</p><p>There are two changes to the text I would ask the authors to make.</p><p>1. The language used in a sentence in the Introduction implies that previous work examining the function of nicotinic receptors on dopaminergic fibers implicated these receptors as the sole drivers of all dopamine release in the dorsal and lateral striatum. This is because it is written that &quot;DA dynamics in the dorsal and lateral striatum were found to persist even after …. interference with ACh signaling&quot;. Likely everyone would agree that the majority of &quot;DA dynamics&quot; should persist in these conditions. Please amend this section to use more precise language giving appropriate context to these experiments and results. For example, &quot;previous results were unable to detect a change in DA dynamics…&quot;</p><p>2. The authors of this Comment are experts in RdLight1, and similar sensors based on mApple.

Experiments in brain slices clearly show that synchronous activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons is sufficient to drive dopamine release via axo-axonal stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, but there is less evidence for this mechanism in vivo. Mohebi, Collins and Berke recently reported that, in awake behaving rats, optogenetic activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons with blue light readily evokes dopamine release, as measured with the red fluorescent sensor RdLight1 (Mohebi et al., 2023). Here, we show that blue light alone alters the fluorescent properties of RdLight1 in a manner that may be misconstrued as phasic dopamine release and that this artefactual photoactivation can account for the effects attributed to cholinergic interneurons. Measurements of dopamine using RdLight1 should, therefore, be interpreted with caution when combined with optogenetics. In light of these results (which were obtained by a multi-laboratory collaboration that included Mohebi and Berke), and the results of other studies that did not observe large acetylcholine-evoked dopamine transients in vivo, the conditions under which such release occurs in behaving animals remain unknown.</p><p>b) Results section</p><p>The statement &quot;In a separate laboratory...&quot; will confuse readers: please revise the Results section to make clear where the different experiments were performed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95694.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The comment by Taniguchi et al. systematically and convincingly demonstrates that the red dopamine sensor RdLight1 is photoactivated in response to blue light in the absence of blue light-activated opsins.

First, as the Reviewer correctly points out, photometry typically uses much less power than optogenetics (&lt;100 uW vs. &gt;1 mW). Our data suggest that the magnitude of the photoactivation artifact scales with blue light power (see our Figure 1I). Thus, while some photoactivation may take place any time blue light is applied, it is likely exceedingly small compared to the fluorescence transients evoked by dopamine. Second, the flashes of blue light used to image GCaMP6 were delivered at a constant rate and intensity. As such, they could not account for the large and aperiodic RdLight1 fluorescence transients observed. Lastly, close inspection of the example traces reveals that many RdLight1 and GCaMP6 transients occur independently of one another, providing additional evidence that one process does not drive the other. We added a paragraph at in the discussion to that effect:</p><p>“RdLight1 fluorescence should be interpreted with caution when combined with blue light in a variety of experimental conditions, including dual-color imaging with alternating stimulation of green and red fluorophores. In this case, the steady or rapidly-modulating (i.e., tens to hundreds of Hz) blue light might lead to constant activation of mApple but, due to its long photoswitching time, is unlikely to contribute to phasic and aperiodic transients in the red channel.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors correctly point out that many mApple-based fluorescent sensors have been shown to have similar photoswitching artifacts (Zhuo et al., 2023), but should be careful about singling out mApple as the sole issue. Doing so could lead researchers to falsely assume non-mApple-based sensors are safe from such artifacts. Researchers should be reminded of the need to run appropriate controls for all new sensors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. We added a paragraph at the end of the discussion to emphasize this point:</p><p>“Importantly, photoactivation is not unique to RdLight1: other mApple-based sensors, including the GRAB-rDA and R-GenGAR-DA families of red DA sensors, as well as the R-GECO family of Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators also show photoactivation when presented with blue light, with individual constructs differing in the polarity, magnitude and duration of photoactivation effects. Photoactivation also extends beyond mApple, as many fluorophores can modify their biophysical properties when presented with different wavelengths of light. It is, for instance, the biophysical principle on which some molecular tracking and super-resolution imaging methods are founded. Experiments should therefore be designed carefully to control for these and other potential confounds, particularly when novel sensors are introduced.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors mention that the 405 nm wavelength has not been shown to be an appropriate isosbestic wavelength for RdLight1. This provides an opportunity to highlight the need for those developing new sensors to carefully test and publish the full excitation and emission spectra of their sensors in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer. We added the following sentence in the discussion:</p><p>“Indeed, even the isosbestic point of commonly used green dopamine sensors is more green-shifted (e.g. 440 nm), stressing the need for sensors to be published along with their full excitation/emission spectra, and for experimenters to tailor illumination wavelengths to their specific sensor.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the present Comment Taniguchi et al. address an important methodological issue concerning the primary data collection in Mohebi et al.

The authors of this Comment are experts in RdLight1, and similar sensors based on mApple. It would be a tremendous benefit to the field if the authors could leverage that expertise here to identify other sensors that could be impacted by the present results.</p><p>a. Are there other red fluorescent sensors that are based on mApple?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. All of the red fluorescent neuromodulator sensors developed to date use circular permutated (cp) mApple, including the RdLight (Patriarchi et al., 2020), GRAB-rDA (Sun et al., 2020; Zhuo et al., 2023) and R-GenGAR-DA (Nakamoto et al., 2021) families of red DA sensors. The GRAB family of red serotonin sensors also uses cpmApple (Deng et al., 2024). We now write a sentence in the discussion to that effect:</p><p>“Importantly, photoactivation is not unique to RdLight1: other mApple-based sensors, including the GRAB-rDA and R-GenGAR-DA families of red DA sensors, as well as the R-GECO family of Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators show photoactivation when presented with blue light, with individual constructs differing in the polarity, magnitude and duration of photoactivation effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.

Or is the problem with RdLight1 due to the molecular alterations necessary to make it respond to dopamine?</p></disp-quote><p>Having not tried the suggested experiment, it is difficult to answer the question in the affirmative, but our hypothesis is that we would. In the original paper describing the development of mApple, Shaner, Tsien and colleagues noted that mApple displays ‘complex reversible photoswitching behavior’ that is more pronounced with continuous wide-field illumination than with laser-scanning microscopy (Shaner et al., 2008). Interestingly, their attempts at fixing this problem using mutagenesis failed. We also know that all red DA sensors developed to date (by several groups, independently) show some form of photoactivation, although individual variants differ in the polarity, magnitude and duration of such effects (see Nakamoto et al., 2021; Zhuo et al., 2023). Lastly, photoactivation also extends to mApple-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (Akerboom et al., 2013; Dana et al., 2016) and to fluorophores not based on mApple (Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz 2002; Lippincott-Schwartz and Patterson 2009). Photoactivation is therefore neither specific to RdLight1, nor to the molecular alterations necessary to turn mApple into a fluorescent reporter for dopamine (i.e. circular permutation of mApple and insertion into one of the intracellular loops of a G protein-coupled DA receptor).</p><p>References cited in this response</p><p>Akerboom J, Carreras Calderon N, Tian L, Wabnig S, Prigge M, Tolo J, Gordus A, Orger MB, et al.
