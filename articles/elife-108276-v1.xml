Unlike tolerance, differentiation, or priming, trained immunity relies on epigenetic and metabolic rewiring of resident myeloid cells, particularly in mucosal barriers such as the skin, gut, and lungs, where these cells provide continuous protection against toxins and pathogens. Here, we review recent advances showing how an initial stimulus endows monocytes and macrophages with long-lasting functional changes that can be either protective or maladaptive upon re-exposure. We highlight therapeutic opportunities that harness trained immunity to boost vaccine efficacy and discuss strategies to modulate this program in cancer and hyper-inflammatory disorders.

Macrophages play a pivotal role in innate immunity, offering the first line of defense against pathogens through rapid, non-specific responses. In 2007, Medzhitov and colleagues demonstrated that toll-like receptor (TLR) genes in murine macrophages bifurcated into two distinct functional categories following in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Bukhbinder et al., 2022</xref>). These categories, marked by chromatin modifications, either silenced pro-inflammatory mediators or activated antimicrobial effectors, thereby showing adaptive-like properties in macrophages to regulate inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Foster et al., 2007</xref>). Shortly after, Netea and colleagues introduced the concept of ‘trained immunity,’ defining it as the memory of the innate immune system, mediated by epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, leading to enhanced responses upon secondary infections or stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Netea et al., 2016</xref>). Since then, trained immunity has been observed in various innate immune cells, including macrophages, monocytes, natural killer (NK), neutrophils, and even hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mouse and human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Netea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>). Neutrophils, once thought too short-lived to ‘remember,’ can be centrally trained via reprogrammed granulopoiesis and emerge with enhanced antimicrobial and tissue-protective programs. β-glucan exposure, for example, generates trained neutrophils that promote disease tolerance to influenza and limit immunopathology, highlighting their relevance to barrier-tissue defense and vaccination strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Kalafati et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Khan et al., 2025</xref>). Trained macrophages exhibit heightened functional capacities, including improved pathogen recognition, increased phagocytosis, and more robust cytokine production upon secondary exposure. Notably, ‘phagocytosis’ in the context of trained immunity is cargo-specific: recent work indicates that trained programs can differentially tune macrophage handling of distinct targets, with no change in antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) but decreased efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils—an effect with direct implications for tumor immunity and resolution biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Chatzis et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>Since the formal designation of trained immunity, a series of studies have demonstrated that a primary infection with fungi such as <italic>Candida albicans (C.albicans</italic>) or an inoculation with a purified compound derived from fungal cell walls called β-glucan could induce long-lasting protection against subsequent heterologous challenges. Although not permanent, this protection resulted from epigenetic modification in monocytes following initial exposure, mediated by intrinsic activation of macrophage and monocyte PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">Quintin et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). Findings from β-glucan studies challenged the conventional belief that immunological memory was exclusive to adaptive immunity offering new insights into human immune response to infection, environmental factors and vaccinations. Here, we provide a detailed account of recent advances in trained immunity in monocytes and macrophages, emphasizing developments particularly relevant to the lung.</p><p>Therapeutically, trained immunity offers significant potential in enhancing vaccine efficacy and modulating immune responses in disease settings. By harnessing the reprogramming of macrophages, we can improve host defense in the context of infections, as well as explore new avenues in cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease management. Central and peripheral training of macrophages, mediated by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or tissue-resident populations, could provide innovative strategies to prevent or treat inflammatory and infectious diseases. This review explores the evolving role of macrophages in innate immune memory and their therapeutic implications in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Central and peripheral training</title><p>Trained immunity manifests both in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib230">Sohrabi et al., 2020</xref>), where it involves hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), known as ‘central trained innate memory (CTM),’ and in fully differentiated, mature innate immune cells or tissue-resident cells within peripheral tissues, referred to as ‘peripheral trained innate memory (PTM).’ In this review, we define CTM strictly as training that occurs at the level of HSPCs in the bone marrow, leading to durable imprinting of their myeloid progeny. By contrast, when we discuss macrophages resident within the bone marrow niche (non-HSPC compartment), we consider these as peripheral/local training events occurring in a lymphoid organ or mucosal tissues. A substantial body of evidence supports the concept of CTM, particularly from studies demonstrating trained immunity in HSCs, myeloid progenitors, and BM–derived monocytes following infections or immunization (e.g. with BCG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Cirovic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Mitroulis et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, peripheral or local trained immunity, where tissue-resident macrophages undergo long-term functional reprogramming at the site of infection or inflammation remains less well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Netea et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, for a comprehensive understanding of trained immunity, parallel investigation is necessary to understand the impact of primary stimuli in the BM as well as peripheral tissues that may collectively contribute to host immune consequences, as shown in an example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, where trained immunity is orchestrated in the lungs locally as well as via BM-derived precursors.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Central and peripheral trained immunity.</title><p>A primary stimulus can initiate two complementary training programs. <italic>Local (peripheral) training</italic> occurs when resident tissue macrophages (resident macrophages RTMs, blue → purple with receptor activation) sense the insult, secrete cytokines, and acquire a trained phenotype within the lung. <italic>Central (bone-marrow) training</italic> arises when the same stimulus reprograms hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow, producing primed monocytes that enter the circulation, migrate to the lung, and differentiate into trained monocyte-derived macrophages (Mo-Macs, red). For clarity, we define central trained innate memory (CTM) as training strictly within HSPCs/myeloid progenitors. Peripheral trained innate memory (PTM) encompasses local training of mature macrophages, including those residing in bone marrow niches. These pathways may act independently or together, depending on the nature, timing, and intensity of the initial insult. Upon re-exposure, whichever trained population is present mounts an enhanced, coordinated response, illustrating that peripheral and central pathways are bona fide and often cooperative forms of innate immune memory.

One major barrier to advancing this field is the lack of selective experimental tools and models that can deplete or manipulate specific tissue-resident macrophage populations without affecting other myeloid cells. Traditional approaches, such as clodronate liposome administration to deplete macrophages have many nonspecific effects on other myeloid cells, such as neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Culemann et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Mass, 2023</xref>). More recently, transgenic mouse models in which human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) is selectively expressed on immune cells (e.g. CD11b-DTR, CD169-DTR, or NAM-DTR) (CD169-cre mice crossed to CX3CR1-flox-DTR) mice have been used to deplete lung interstitial macrophages and broader tissue-resident macrophage populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib249">Ural et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Hua et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib273">Yu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Gaertner et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Borthwick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Duffield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Miyake et al., 2007</xref>). However, even these tools lack the resolution to distinguish among distinct macrophage subsets within tissues, such as in the lung. Nevertheless, recently, several new more sophisticated transgenic mice have been developed that have allowed investigators to probe functions and ontogeny of specific subsets of macrophages. These include CX3CR1-Cre/Ert2-Cre (allows for lineage tracing and targeting of tissue resident macrophages) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib272">Yona et al., 2013</xref>), Ms4a3-Cre (allows lineage tracing of bone marrow-derived macrophages in tissues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) and the split-Cre (<italic>Lyve1<sup>ncre</sup>:Cx3cr1<sup>ccre</sup>;</italic> binary transgenic Cre approach to dissect functions of specific subsets of macrophages) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Boura-Halfon et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, more precise transcriptomic profiling is needed to identify unique surface markers and regulatory pathways that govern the maintenance and function of resident macrophage subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Hua et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To understand the broader implications of trained immunity, it is essential to compare the mechanisms involved in central versus peripheral training, particularly within macrophages across various tissues. While CTM involves systemic changes in HSC-like progenitors leading to enhanced immune responses in peripheral tissues, PTM directly involves epigenetic modifications within tissue-resident macrophages exposed to local pathogens. This distinction is particularly important when analyzing trained immunity across lymphoid and mucosal tissues, as the nature of training in these distinct environments may vary based on local immune challenges and the specific tissue microenvironments involved. An important unresolved question is how turnover dynamics in mucosal macrophage pools influence the relative weight of central vs peripheral training. In tissues like the lung and gut, where resident populations are rapidly replaced by BM-derived precursors, sustained trained immunity likely relies more on central training. For example, the alveolar macrophages (AMs) are known to rapidly undergo cell death following infections and are replaced by bone marrow-derived monocytic precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Li et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aegerter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Hartung and Esser-von Bieren, 2022</xref>). However, other lung resident macrophages, such as a subset of interstitial macrophages (IMs) known as the nerve and airway-associated interstitial macrophages (or NAMs) that proliferate after infections may exhibit local training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib249">Ural et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, in organs such as the brain or liver, long-lived resident macrophages may maintain peripheral training for extended periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib257">Waisman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The interval between the primary stimulus and detection of trained phenotypes varies with the cellular locus of training and the stimulus used. CTM (HSPC-level) training is typically assessed weeks to months after exposure and can persist long-term because HSPCs continuously generate primed myeloid progeny (e.g. Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) and β-glucan remodel HSPCs and myeloid progenitors). Peripheral training of mature macrophages is often assayed days to weeks post-exposure and tends to wane with local turnover, especially in mucosal sites. In the lung, influenza and helminth models reveal training detectable weeks later, with durability depending on whether resident pools are replaced by BM-derived cells. Notably, human and animal studies suggest innate memory can persist up to ~1 year in some contexts, consistent with an HSPC reservoir of epigenetically imprinted progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Netea and Joosten, 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Mhlanga et al., 2025</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Macrophage training across different organs and tissues</title><p>Frequency of macrophages varies vastly in mucosal tissues such as the gut, skin, and lungs compared to lymphoid tissues, despite a presence of tissue-resident macrophages in all. Macrophages in the lymphoid tissues, such as the spleen and the BM exhibit a wide variety of phenotypes and functions such as removal of apoptotic cells to thereby prevent autoimmunity, as well as kill cancer cells and activating other adaptive as well as innate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">den Haan and Martinez-Pomares, 2013</xref>). Whereas the primary purpose of the mucosal tissues is to serve as a barrier between the body and the external environment, these tissues have profound tissue-specific secondary functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Dickson et al., 2025</xref>). Due to a constant exposure to pathogens, allergens, and environmental pollutants, macrophages in the lungs (AMs), skin (dermal macrophages) as well as the gut (intestinal macrophages) undergo trained immunity for a rapid, localized responses to secondary infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Li et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aegerter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Chen et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Feuerstein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Leopold Wager and Schlesinger, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib274">Zahalka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Chen et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Misharin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib260">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, the plasticity of mucosal macrophages allows them to enhance their immune functions, such as cytokine production and phagocytic activity, in response to repeated exposure to similar pathogens. Moreover, they also exhibit the ability to modulate tissue repair and homeostasis, particularly in the lungs, where macrophages play a crucial role in tissue regeneration after injury caused by pathogens or environmental toxins. In this section, we present a thorough comparative analysis of trained immunity of macrophages in lymphoid vs mucosal tissues. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows a comprehensive and diverse array of stimuli that trigger trained immunity in the myeloid progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib230">Sohrabi et al., 2020</xref>) and macrophage populations (BM and periphery) across all tissues that result in host beneficial or host damaging consequences.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Triggers of trained immunity across all tissues.</title><p>Peripheral and central trained immunity can be initiated by diverse stimuli, including pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi, vector-borne agents, and enteric or blood parasites), allergens (food- or environmental-derived), purified microbial or synthetic compounds, vaccines, toxins (radiation, air pollution, cigarette smoke), physiological processes such as aging and pregnancy. Following the primary stimulus, macrophages in mucosal sites (skin, gut, lung), lymphoid organs (spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes), lymphatic-associated tissues (liver, kidney), and the brain undergo profound epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming. These trained macrophages and the monocytes they give rise to subsequently mount an amplified immune response to secondary challenges, which can be host-protective or host-damaging depending on context.

When macrophages in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes acquire a trained phenotype, they respond more rapidly to early danger signals, speeding pathogen clearance and priming adaptive immunity.

The sections that follow offer an overview of how trained immunity reprograms macrophages in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bone marrow</title><p>Here, we specifically discuss bone marrow–resident macrophages (not HSPCs), which can undergo local or peripheral training within the marrow niche. This distinction separates CTM at the progenitor level from training of mature macrophages that reside in BM. In bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), inflammatory cues, particularly IL-1β and microbial products trigger epigenetic remodeling, including histone acetylation and changes in methylation status. BM-derived macrophages mount vigorous responses to systemic infections and play a pivotal role in maintaining long-term immune memory after vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Netea and Joosten, 2024b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Netea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Netea et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Exposure to β-glucan or BCG reprograms BM myeloid progenitors, imprinting trained immunity on their myeloid descendants.

Unlike systemic macrophage training, which originates in hematopoietic progenitors microglial training unfolds entirely within the brain. The resulting epigenetic imprints persist for years, rendering microglia hyper-responsive and thereby increasing the brain’s vulnerability to chronic inflammation and progressive neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Netea and Joosten, 2024a</xref>). Microglial priming is defined as the process of trained immunity in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Haley et al., 2019</xref>).

Central reprogramming drives pro-inflammatory myelopoiesis for months, while local training in tissue macrophages supports recurrent inflammation at barrier sites such as the gut, skin, and synovium.

Evidence from animal models and early human studies highlights both the promise and peril of trained macrophages and monocytes, particularly in the respiratory tract. Progress, however, is limited by gaps in experimental tools: we lack models that can selectively ablate specific tissue-resident macrophage subsets, and the cells’ plasticity makes it hard to distinguish ‘central’ (BM-derived) from ‘peripheral’ (local) training. While key epigenetic modifications, including H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K9me3, and DNA methylation have been characterized, the exact sequence of epigenomic events driving macrophage reprogramming remains unresolved. Similarly, the role of non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs and miRNAs) in shaping trained immunity is largely unknown. Resolving these issues will be critical for manipulating trained immunity for improved immunotherapy and vaccine design.</p><p>The duration of trained immunity also raises important questions. Human studies suggest that innate memory can persist for up to a year, indicating that long-lived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) may serve as reservoirs for epigenetically modified myeloid cells. Yet, the interplay between central and peripheral training and the impact of overlapping macrophage markers in tissues such as the lung, skin, and gut remains poorly defined.</p><p>Additional uncertainties include whether trained macrophages can revert to a naïve state, and how extrinsic factors like diet, the microbiome, and chronic infections modulate the stability of trained immunity. The heterogeneity among tissue-resident macrophage subsets (e.g. alveolar, interstitial, Kupffer cells, microglia, and splenic macrophages) further complicates our understanding of their distinct capacities for training and systemic influence.</p><p>Moreover, the mechanisms governing macrophage metabolic shifts, especially the switch between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as the roles of fatty acid oxidation and glutaminolysis are not fully defined. Given that metabolic modifiers such as mTOR inhibitors and AMPK activators are already used therapeutically, elucidating these pathways could offer new strategies for cancer, infectious, and metabolic diseases.</p><p>Lastly, the impact of aging on macrophage-trained immunity is unclear. Age-related changes in metabolism and epigenetics might predispose macrophages to a pro-inflammatory state, reducing their protective capacity. Addressing these gaps is crucial for developing rejuvenation strategies that enhance immune defenses and improve vaccine efficacy and cancer therapies in older populations.</p><p>Targeting trained immunity through vaccines and adjuvants is emerging as a powerful strategy to provide broad, non-specific protection against diverse pathogens. Classic examples include BCG and seasonal influenza vaccines, which bolster host defense not only against their intended microbes but also against unrelated infections, underscoring the growing importance of trained immunity in vaccine efficacy. Trained immunity causes outcomes that are context-dependent: while BCG augments resistance to tuberculosis and some cancers, it can worsen malaria pathology. Likewise, COVID-19 vaccines induce durable metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming in monocytes and macrophages, illustrating the wider potential of innate memory but also revealing complexities that certain vaccine-induced trained responses may amplify inflammation or facilitate tumor progression. Fully harnessing the benefits of trained immunity, particularly for immunocompromised or chronically ill individuals, will depend on dissecting the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms that tip the balance between protection and pathology.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s12"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by 1R01AI143861 (KMK), 3R01AI143861-02S1 (KMK), 1R01DK138675 (KMK), R01AI188824 (KMK) NYU Cardiovascular Research Center pilot award (KMK), 5F32HL154598 (PD- Y).
