Here, we describe a new assay using fluorescently-tagged anthrolysin O, a cholesterol-binding bacterial toxin, to measure accessible cholesterol in human red blood cells (RBCs). Accessible cholesterol levels were stable within individuals, but varied &gt;10 fold among individuals. Significant variation was observed among ethnic groups (Blacks&gt;Hispanics&gt;Whites). Variation in accessibility of RBC cholesterol was unrelated to the cholesterol content of RBCs or plasma, but was associated with the phospholipid composition of the RBC membranes and with plasma triglyceride levels. Pronase treatment of RBCs only modestly altered cholesterol accessibility. Individuals on hemodialysis, who have an unexplained increase in atherosclerotic risk, had significantly higher RBC cholesterol accessibility. Our data indicate that RBC accessible cholesterol is a stable phenotype with significant inter-individual variability. Factors both intrinsic and extrinsic to the RBC contribute to variation in its accessibility. This assay provides a new tool to assess cholesterol homeostasis among tissues in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23355.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23355.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>membranes</kwd><kwd>reverse cholesterol transport</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>red blood cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakrabarti</surname><given-names>Rima S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ingham</surname><given-names>Sally A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hobbs</surname><given-names>Helen H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO1 HL20948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gay</surname><given-names>Austin</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Jonathan C</given-names></name><name><surname>Radhakrishnan</surname><given-names>Arun</given-names></name><name><surname>Hobbs</surname><given-names>Helen H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1793</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Radhakrishnan</surname><given-names>Arun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12SDG12040267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Radhakrishnan</surname><given-names>Arun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32-GM008203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gay</surname><given-names>Austin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR001105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kozlitina</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name><name><surname>Hobbs</surname><given-names>Helen H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Accessible cholesterol levels in human red blood cells were found to be stable within individuals but vary &gt;10-fold among individuals and this variability may contribute to differences in cholesterol trafficking among tissues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cholesterol is an essential component of vertebrate cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldstein et al., 1979</xref>). Membrane cholesterol is supplied by the diet or synthesized endogenously from acetyl coenzyme A. All cells in the body except red blood cells (RBCs) synthesize cholesterol. To maintain cholesterol balance, an amount of cholesterol equivalent to the sum of what is made in the cells and acquired from the diet must be removed from the body. The major pathway for cholesterol excretion in humans is via the biliary system. The proteins and processes by which cholesterol is secreted into the bile, either directly, or after conversion to bile acids, have been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russell, 2009</xref>). In contrast, the process by which cholesterol from peripheral tissues is delivered to the liver for excretion remains poorly defined.</p><p>A mechanism for the centripetal trafficking of cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues to the liver, which has been termed reverse cholesterol transport, was first conceptualized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glomset (1968)</xref>. That work, and subsequent studies, have implicated high density lipoproteins (HDL) as an essential component of this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey, 1964</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the first step of the Glomset model, HDL acquires free cholesterol from cell membranes in peripheral tissues. Free cholesterol is transferred from cells to HDL by ATP binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawn et al., 1999</xref>). The free cholesterol in the HDL particle is then esterified with long-chain fatty acids by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glomset, 1968</xref>) and sequestered in a hydrophobic core below the phospholipid surface of HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stoffel et al., 1974</xref>). This step is critical to the delivery of cholesterol to the liver; sequestration in the HDL core decreases the propensity of cholesterol to exchange with cell membranes, thus limiting the retrograde transfer of cholesterol from HDL back to the tissues. The cholesteryl ester is then delivered to the liver either directly via a cell surface receptor, scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acton et al., 1996</xref>), or indirectly after transferring the cholesterol to Apolipoprotein (Apo)B-containing lipoproteins, which then undergo endocytosis by the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Several components of the HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport pathway have been supported by studies in cultured cells and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Rader, 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23355.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of reverse cholesterol transport in the blood.</title><p>Free cholesterol in peripheral tissues is effluxed by ABCA1 transporters to high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and transported into the vascular space. Lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT), present on HDL, esterifies free cholesterol. The cholesterol esters formed by the LCAT reaction are either taken up by SCARB1 receptors on hepatocytes or transferred to apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins (ApoB LP) and taken up into hepatocytes by the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Red blood cells (RBCs) may also participate in reverse cholesterol transport by accepting cholesterol from vascular endothelial cells and participating in a cholesterol exchange with lipoproteins and plasma components, such as albumin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23355.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23355.002</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-23355-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p>Despite data implicating HDL as a central component of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, some observations in murine models of HDL deficiency are not compatible with an essential role for HDL in the transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver and bile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jolley et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Mice lacking ABCA1, or ApoA1, the major structural protein of HDL, have very low HDL levels and yet have no alterations in cholesterol turnover in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jolley et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Glomset proposed that RBCs may participate in the transport of cholesterol from tissues to the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glomset, 1968</xref>). Approximately 50% of circulating cholesterol is carried in RBC membranes and tracer studies in humans indicate that the magnitude of the cholesterol flux through RBCs is comparable to the total efflux of free cholesterol from tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turner et al., 2012</xref>). Cholesterol exchanges freely between RBCs, plasma, circulating lipoproteins, and cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hagerman and Gould, 1951</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). More recently, Smith and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hung et al., 2012</xref>) showed that reducing the number of RBCs in ApoA1 knockout mice, which have little to no circulating HDL, decreases the transfer of radiolabeled cholesterol from macrophages to feces.</p><p>For RBCs to participate in reverse cholesterol transport, the cholesterol must be located in the outer leaflet of the RBC membrane, and thus accessible for transfer to proteins and cells. The accessibility of cholesterol in a membrane is related to its chemical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McConnell and Radhakrishnan, 2003</xref>), alternatively referred to as its fugacity (tendency to flee). The chemical activity of cholesterol generally increases with increasing cholesterol concentration. However, at lower concentrations, complex formation with phospholipids can suppress the chemical activity of cholesterol below what would be expected in the absence of lipid interactions. At higher concentrations, when phospholipids become limiting, the chemical activity of cholesterol rises. Sharp rises in chemical activity have been detected in model membranes by measurements of cholesterol accessibility, as assayed by cyclodextrin extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Litz et al., 2016</xref>), oxidation by cholesterol oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn and Sampson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lange et al., 2013</xref>), and binding of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins such as perfringolysin O (PFO) or anthrolysin O (ALO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heuck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gay et al., 2015</xref>). A sharp rise in the chemical activity of RBC membrane cholesterol has been observed using the cholesterol oxidase assay to assess cholesterol accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lange et al., 1980</xref>). In all of these cases, the increase in cholesterol accessibility with increasing cholesterol concentration was sigmoidal, rather than linear, with little change until a threshold concentration was reached. Once the cholesterol content of the membrane exceeded this threshold, accessibility of membrane cholesterol increased sharply.</p><p>The partitioning of cholesterol between accessible and sequestered pools may allow RBCs to serve as vehicles for cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues to the liver. As a first step towards elucidating the relative contributions of the accessible and sequestered pools of RBC cholesterol to cholesterol transport, we have developed an assay using ALO, a cholesterol-binding toxin produced by <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourdeau et al., 2009</xref>), to measure the relative amount of accessible cholesterol in RBC membranes.</p><p>Using this assay, we show that RBC cholesterol accessibility is stable within individuals, but varies over a more than ten-fold range between individuals. To address the basis for the inter-individual variation in accessible RBC cholesterol, we examined the effect of demographic, physiologic, and biochemical differences among individuals on this newly described trait. Whereas age and gender had modest effects on accessible RBC cholesterol, significant ethnic differences were apparent in RBC cholesterol accessibility. The variation in cholesterol accessibility was not related to the cholesterol content of the membrane or to pronase-accessible proteins in the RBC membrane, but rather to the content of other membrane lipids and to levels of circulating triglycerides (TG). Finally, we find that a group of patients on hemodialysis, who have more coronary heart disease than anticipated based on known risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levey et al., 1998</xref>), have higher RBC cholesterol accessibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Measurement of RBC cholesterol accessibility using cholesterol binding domain of ALO</title><p>As described previously, a recombinant protein consisting of the cholesterol binding domain 4 (D4) of ALO was purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> and covalently modified with a maleimide-linked fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 488) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gay et al., 2015</xref>).

we describe a new assay that measures the relative amount of accessible cholesterol in the membranes of RBCs. The assay is highly reproducible and captures a new quantitative trait in humans. The major finding of the study is that the amount of accessible cholesterol in RBC membranes is stable within an individual but varies &gt;10 fold among individuals. The high degree of inter-individual variation was unrelated to total cholesterol content of the RBC membrane and modestly affected by pronase-sensitive changes in protein content of the RBC membrane. Differences in RBC phospholipid composition of the RBC membrane accounted for 17.6% of the inter-individual variability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Cholesterol accessibility in RBCs varied significantly between ethnic groups and correlated indirectly with plasma levels of TG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), but not with the morphology or hemoglobin content of the RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, we have shown that the level of accessible cholesterol in RBCs in the population varies significantly among individuals in a stable fashion and we have identified several factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the RBC membrane, that contribute to the variation in RBC cholesterol accessibility. The significance of this variability on the trafficking of cholesterol among plasma components and tissues or if it relates to human disease awaits further study.</p><p>Among individuals, relative fALOD4 binding to RBCs did not correlate with the total cholesterol content of the RBC membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, the cholesterol in the RBC membrane that is accessible to fALOD4 represents a distinct pool (or state) of cholesterol, which is not reflected by direct assays of RBC cholesterol mass. The striking reproducibility of relative fALOD4 binding to RBCs within a given individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) indicates that the factors that govern RBC cholesterol accessibility must be relatively stable.</p><p>The lack of a relationship between cholesterol content and cholesterol accessibility in RBCs is similar to what has been observed among membranes from different organelles in mammalian cells, For example, plasma membranes (PMs) have a cholesterol content of ~40 mole%, whereas the cholesterol content of the membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is only ~5 mole% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010</xref>). Despite this wide difference in cholesterol content, the chemical activity of cholesterol in these two membranes may be similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</xref>). This equivalence could be achieved if PM phospholipids interact more strongly with cholesterol than ER phospholipids, a plausible possibility based on extensive fractionation analysis of PM and ER lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colbeau et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Comte et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schroeder et al., 1976</xref>) and biophysical studies of the varying affinity of cholesterol for different phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McConnell and Radhakrishnan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wattenberg and Silbert, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finean, 1953</xref>). Fluctuations in membrane composition lead to changes in the chemical activity of cholesterol and could result in cholesterol transport between membranes, either internally or externally. In the case of the RBC, which has no internal organelle membranes, changes in cholesterol activity in the plasma membrane must equilibrate with cholesterol in lipoproteins, other plasma proteins, or with other cells, such as circulating leukocytes or endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lange and Steck, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We found that treatment of RBCs with either PLA2 or SMase increased cholesterol accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), a finding that is consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Subbaiah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Slotte et al., 1989</xref>). Non-cholesterol lipids contributed significantly to inter-individual differences in cholesterol accessibility (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>), but identifying exactly which lipid species contributed to the observed variation in cholesterol accessibility was not straightforward. The complex population of phospholipids in the RBC membrane and the high degree of correlation between different phospholipid classes confounded the analysis. In the multivariate model adjusted for age, sex, lipid and lipoprotein levels, only LPE, SM and PA were associated with fALOD4 binding. Taken together, differences in these membrane lipids accounted for 17.6% of the variability in fALOD4 binding. It is also possible that differences in phospholipid composition alter the distribution of cholesterol between the two leaflets of the RBC membrane. Further studies in which the RBC membrane content of individual phospholipids can be selectively altered will be required to elucidate the effect of membrane phospholipids on cholesterol accessibility.</p><p>Why should RBC cholesterol accessibility be maintained at levels that closely bracket the threshold point of cholesterol accessibility? At cholesterol concentrations below the inflection point, the capacity of the membrane to incorporate cholesterol into complexes with phospholipids is high and the propensity for cholesterol to leave the membrane is low, therefore cholesterol will tend to accumulate in the RBC. At cholesterol concentrations above the inflection point, the capacity of the membrane to accommodate additional cholesterol in complexes with phospholipids is low, and cholesterol is poised to leave the RBC membrane when suitable acceptors become available. Thus, the cholesterol content of the RBC membranes is maintained close to equilibrium with respect to cholesterol exchange.</p><p>It remains possible that differences in the complement of proteins in RBC membranes contribute to the observed inter-individual variability in fALOD4 binding. However, depletion of membrane proteins by pronase digestion had only a modest effect on fALOD4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that in our experiments pronase treatment failed to digest a protein that contributes to the inter-individual differences in cholesterol accessibility. No association was found between ABO blood groups and fALOD4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, upper panel), but fALOD4 binding was reproducibly lower in those who were negative for the Rh antigen, a transmembrane protein of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, lower panel). The effect of the Rh antigen on fALOD4 binding may be direct or indirect. Rh antigen may compete with or directly inhibit fALOD4 binding. Alternatively, the antigen may alter the cholesterol accessibility in the RBC membrane. More extensive studies of the relationship between Rh antigenicity and cholesterol accessibility will be needed to elucidate the basis for this relationship.</p><p>Factors that are extrinsic to the RBC were also found to be associated with differences in RBC cholesterol accessibility. Lipoprotein lipids accounted for 5.4% of the variation in fALOD4 binding in a multivariate model that included gender and race (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Plasma levels of TG and RBC cholesterol accessibility were inversely correlated. This correlation may be a direct result of movement of accessible cholesterol from RBCs to very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 1986</xref>). It is also possible that circulating lipoproteins influence RBC cholesterol accessibility by transferring phospholipids to (or from) the RBC membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reed, 1968</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that ABCA1 transfers cholesterol directly from cells to RBCs, and thus contributes to the flux of cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues to the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). RBCs do not have access to peripheral tissues unless there is loss of vascular integrity, but they can interact indirectly with peripheral tissues through cells, such as macrophages, and lipoproteins that enter the tissues and return to the circulation. RBCs have been shown to be excellent acceptors of free cholesterol from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ho et al., 1980</xref>). Brown and Goldstein found that RBCs were 6-fold more potent than whole serum as cholesterol acceptors from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ho et al., 1980</xref>). Lipoprotein-depleted plasma is as efficient an acceptor as whole serum or plasma from cholesterol-loaded macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ho et al., 1980</xref>). Although here we focused on the relationship between RBC accessible cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, it is also possible that blood components other than lipoproteins contribute to differences in cholesterol accessibility of the RBC membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ho et al., 1980</xref>). RBCs may also exchange cholesterol with endothelial cells, thus indirectly transporting cholesterol from the tissues. It is unlikely that RBCs deliver cholesterol directly to hepatocytes since they are too large to enter the space of Disse.</p><p>Significant and systematic differences in RBC cholesterol activity were found among individuals of European, African, and Hispanic descent. Median fALOD4 binding was highest in African-Americans (1.18 nRFU), intermediate in Hispanics (0.86 nRFU) and lowest in European-Americans (0.77 nRFU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These differences were seen in two independent samples collected at different times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). The increased RBC accessibility in Blacks was not fully explained by the measured differences in RBC lipid composition or by the plasma lipoprotein levels. In linear regression analysis, adjusted for these factors, the proportion of variability in fALOD4 binding explained by ethnicity was reduced from 32% to 22.4%, but remained highly statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Dietary differences between the ethnic groups may also contribute to differences in RBC cholesterol accessibility. It would be informative to measure fALOD4 binding to RBCs in a larger multiethnic sample and use genetic association to identify potential factors accounting for the observed differences between both individuals and ethnic groups.</p><p>Interethnic differences in cholesterol accessibility may be the consequence(s) of historic differences in selective pressure among the three ethnic groups. RBCs with higher fALOD4 binding would be anticipated to be more susceptible to microorganisms that produce cholesterol-binding toxins. ALO, produced by <italic>Bacillus Anthracis</italic>, is a member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin family, which is a family of pore-forming toxins produced by a myriad of different gram positive bacteria, including species of <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Listeria</italic> and <italic>Clostridium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palmer, 2001</xref>). Perhaps individuals with lower fALOD4 binding are less susceptible to the hemolytic effects of these toxins, thus providing them with a survival advantage.</p><p>Genetic and pharmacological studies have provided compelling evidence that increased circulating levels of HDL-cholesterol, widely viewed as the vehicle for reverse cholesterol transport, do not confer protection against coronary heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Siddiqi et al., 2015</xref>). RBCs may be a conduit for transporting cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver. Mice made anemic had reduced fecal excretion of cholesterol from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hung et al., 2012</xref>), and anemia has been shown to be associated with increased coronary artery disease (Hazard Ratio of 1.41 over 6 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sarnak et al., 2002</xref>). To determine if RBC cholesterol accessibility provides a clinically relevant biomarker, we measured cholesterol accessibility in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis, who have a dramatically increased risk of atherosclerosis that is not explained by known risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levey et al., 1998</xref>). We found a systematic increase in cholesterol accessibility in RBCs in patients on dialysis when compared to healthy age- and race-matched controls. The cause of these differences and whether they are related to the increase in atherosclerosis seen in this population is not known at this time and will require further study.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) were obtained from the Cyclodextrin Technologies Development, Inc.

We used 389 Da for the molecular mass of cholesterol and 800 Da as an estimate for the average molecular mass of a phospholipid.</p><p>To measure RBC phospholipids, the ghost membranes were prepared as described above and lipids were extracted using a modified Bligh-Dyer extraction (1:1:1 mixture of dichloromethane: methanol: PBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Folch et al., 1957</xref>). In short, membranes were suspended in a volume of 3 mL PBS and added to an 8 mL, 13 × 100 mm glass culture tube (Fisherbrand, Pittsburgh, PA) containing 3 mL methanol that was immersed in a water bath sonicator (Branson model # B2510MT, Danbury, CT) set at maximum speed. After removal of the tube from the sonicator, a total of 3 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) was added to the tube. The samples were capped (Fisherbrand black phenolic Teflon coated screw cap), vortexed, and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. The bottom phase, which contained the lipids, was transferred to a fresh glass culture tube. An additional 4 mL DCM was added to the original tube, which was again capped, vortexed and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 2.5 min at room temperature. The bottom phase was combined with the material from the initial phase separation (total volume of approximately 5 mL). The samples were placed at 42°C under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas until the volume was approximately 0.5 mL. The samples were transferred to 1 mL glass culture tubes, which were again placed at 42°C under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas until all solvent had evaporated. The glass tubes containing the dried lipids were immediately capped, flash frozen with liquid nitrogen, placed on dry ice, and stored at −80°C until they were shipped on dry ice to the Kansas Lipid Core for detailed analysis of polar lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and sphingomyelinase (SMase) treatment of RBCs</title><p>Washed RBCs (1.6 × 10<sup>8</sup> RBCs) in 300 μL were incubated with PLA2 (40 U/mL) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in Ringers buffer (active PLA2) or divalent ion free PBS (inactive PLA2) in a final volume of 1 mL and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature.

SMase was diluted in Ringers buffer (active enzyme) or in PBS buffer (inactive enzyme). Washed RBCs (1.6 × 10<sup>8</sup> RBCs) were brought up to a final volume of 1 mL and incubated with SMase (0–20 mU/mL) for 1 hr at 37°C on a rotator. RBCs were washed three times and then fALOD4 binding assays were performed on 3 μL aliquots (~2 × 10<sup>5</sup> RBCs) of SMase-treated cells. A similar experiment was performed using SMase (0.195 mL in 0.25 M PBS containing 50% glycerol, pH 7.5), which was diluted 100-fold in Ringers lactate (300 mL total volume). Reaction mixtures containing 300 μL washed RBCs (1.6 × 10<sup>8</sup> RBCs) and 0–20 milliunits/mL of SMase in a final volume of 1 mL with Ringers buffer were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C on a rotator. RBCs were then washed three times with 1 mL ice-cold PBS buffer and a 3 μL aliquot (1.6 × 10<sup>5</sup> RBCs) was used to measure fALOD4 binding as described above. The remainder of the SMAse treated RBCs were pooled and RBC ghost membranes were prepared. Protein and lipid analysis of ghost membranes was performed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± SEM, mean ± SD, or median (25th – 75th percentile), as indicated. Continuous characteristics were compared using t-tests or ANOVA adjusted for age and gender where appropriate; categorical variables were compared using chi-square tests. Variables with non-normal distributions were logarithmically or inverse-normally transformed before analysis. The relationships between fALOD4 binding and lipid levels and RBC indices were assessed using linear regression adjusted for age, gender, and ethnicity. Multivariable-adjusted regression models were used to determine which factors jointly contributed to variability in fALOD4 binding. We used a forward selection procedure to build the fully adjusted model. Briefly, our baseline model included age, gender and ethnicity as covariates, to account for differences in age and gender distribution between the ethnic groups. Next, we added plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels, RBC indices, and RBC lipids to the baseline model, one at a time. The factor with the most significant contribution to the model (lowest p-value) was added to the model, and the procedure was repeated, until no more variables were significantly associated with fALOD4 binding. Partial R<sup>2</sup> values were calculated based on the final model, to assess the proportion of variance in fALOD4 binding explained by each factor. All statistical analyses were performed using the software package Prism 6 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) or R statistical analysis software version 3.2.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org/">www.R-project.org/</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank Stephanie Spaeth for excellent technical assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your manuscript will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its present form.</p><p>All three reviewers agreed the current version of the manuscript was not acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, each reviewer thought that the general topic was novel and potentially important. The main concern is that the observations were predictable and/or descriptive. Also, the link between the observations and plasma lipid metabolism was not strong. Each of the three reviewers had suggestions for improvements (see comments below). I believe that all of the reviewers would be interested in reviewing a revised version of the manuscript at a later time point, but only if the concerns were fully addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The group at UT-Southwestern has already published groundbreaking biochemistry on the binding of cytolysins to cholesterol in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. Some of the experiments in the current study in erythrocytes shows the validity of earlier biochemical findings (for example, reduced binding with cyclodextrin and more binding after sphingomyelinase treatment). What is nice (and novel) is extending studies with ALOD4 to a mammalian cell type (red blood cells). A lot of the paper is descriptive, showing that the binding depends on ethnic background, the presence of renal disease, HDL levels, triglyceride levels, and phospholipid species in the erythrocyte membrane. However, despite this important progress, a lot of the variation in binding of ALOD4 remains unexplained. The authors speculated that the accessibility of cholesterol to ALOD4 is relevant to plasma cholesterol transport, but a strong connection was not made.</p><p>A plus is the novelty of this line of investigation, and the promise that it will be the beginning of a new chapter in understanding plasma membrane cholesterol and plasma cholesterol transport. However, there are some negatives. One is that a lot of the results are predictable from the earlier papers from UT Southwestern. Another is that the work, although quite interesting, remains largely descriptive. A stronger link to metabolism is needed. Also, I would like to see quantitative analysis of ALOD4 binding to individual erythrocytes. They show median levels of binding. What is the variation in binding to different erythrocytes? What is the level of heterogeneity in ALO binding to erythrocytes? What is the correlation between RFP-ALO binding and GFP-ALO binding in the same experiment? What accounts for variation in binding? If some erythrocytes in a population display more ALO binding than others, then I would like to see some explanation for the difference. Do cells that bind more ALO have more plasma membrane cholesterol? Very high resolution images of the binding of fluorescent ALO are needed.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper presents the very interesting finding that binding of a fluorescent anthrolysin O derivative to red blood cells varies by about 10-fold in individuals – even in individuals without known health issues. This fALOD4 binding is reflective of &quot;accessible&quot; cholesterol in the exofacial leaflet of the RBCs. It is not correlated with total cholesterol, which indicates that other features of the RBC membrane are responsible for these differences. This suggests the possibility that differences in RBC accessible cholesterol could relate to other parameters such as reverse cholesterol transport.</p><p>While this is a very interesting and potentially important observation, the rest of the paper does little to explain mechanistically how this difference is driven or what the consequences of high or low accessible cholesterol might be.</p><p>There were some general issues and some technical issues with the paper, which are listed below separately.</p><p>Overall. I found the paper reports one very interesting observation but it does not provide either a clear mechanism for the phenomenon or a clear relation to human health.</p><p>Technical</p><p>1) The dependence on number of cells in the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is very peculiar and needs to be explained. Individual 1 and 2 actually cross at high RBC concentrations. Is it possible that the fALDO4 is being depleted? Why does the concentration dependence vary so dramatically for different people? This phenomenon, which is not explained, could lead to variations between samples.</p><p>2) It is very disappointing that the fatty acid saturation of the lipids was not reported in the lipidomics analysis.</p><p>3) It is surprising that PA has such a large effect since it is reported to be a very minor lipid (0.4%). Also SM is described as affecting fALOD4 binding even though the text states it has 0.01% effect. These analyses along with the lack of measurement of lipid saturation leave one with very little understanding of what is responsible for difference in accessible cholesterol.</p><p>General</p><p>1) In the studies comparing ethnic groups, there were large disparities in% male and in the age distribution among the groups. While it is claimed that there were adjustments made to account for these differences, it is not at all clear that there are enough data to make such adjustments with high confidence.</p><p>2) The authors state that the relationship between blood type and fALOD4 binding will require further sampling. Since no firm conclusions were drawn aside from an unexplained Rh correlation, it isn't clear why this is included.</p><p>3) The authors state that the populations used in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref> show a similar trend in fALOD4 binding. It would be helpful to have a more complete analysis of the similarities and differences in these populations.</p><p>4) Other studies have found that differences in diet can affect RBC lipid composition (e.g., DOI: 10.5584/jiomics.v3i1.123). This may have an unknown impact on the differences among ethnic groups, and it could lead to non-genomic influences on the accessible cholesterol.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript by Hobbs and colleagues describes methods for measuring the chemical activity of cholesterol in human RBCs. Using this assay, the authors report several interesting, new observations. Notably, the chemical activity of cholesterol in RBCs: (1) is stable within fasted individuals although there is variance among cells, (2) varies 10-fold between individuals, (3) positively correlates with HDL-C and Rh antigen, (4) negatively correlates with plasma TG, (5) is higher in patients on hemodialysis but unaffected acutely by the procedure, and (6) that Tangiers individuals have extremely low chemical activity. In addition, they report that RBCs behave like other cells in having a threshold for fugacity and that depletion of phospholipids and SM increase the chemical activity of cholesterol. The manuscript is well-written, experiments employ appropriate statistical tests, the methods are clear, and the conclusions are supported by the data.</p><p>However, the general significance and impact of this study is moderate. The authors discuss that RBCs may participate in RCT and therefore this assay may be a useful tool in these studies, but experiments in the manuscript do not address this exciting hypothesis. The assay is robust, but no data indicate its predictive value. Furthermore, no experiments test whether chemical activity changes within an individual which would suggest that it may play a role in pathological processes. For example, does chemical activity change in response to refeeding or diet? I am left asking, what open question was answered by these studies?</p><p>In summary, this is an excellent study that describes the development of an assay that in the future will be used to test an important hypotheses</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23355.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All three reviewers agreed the current version of the manuscript was not acceptable for eLife.

Also, the link between the observations and plasma lipid metabolism was not strong.”</p><p>We concur in part with these comments of the reviewers. The basic characteristics of cholesterol accessibility in RBC membranes, as determined by the fALOD4 assay, are consistent with those described in the literature. We included these experiments to show that the assay we have developed to analyze RBCs from humans has the same characteristics as similar assays that have been used to analyze other membranes and cellular organelles. The fact that the behavior of the assay is consistent with predictions supports the contention that we are measuring cholesterol accessibility.</p><p>However, it is not obvious to us that the major findings reported in this paper are predictable. To our knowledge this is the first time that the cholesterol accessibility in RBC membranes has been evaluated as a phenotype in humans, and the finding that fALOD4 binding differs over a fold range among healthy individuals was not predicted previously. This amount of variability exceeds that seen for most quantitative traits in humans (for example, levels of plasma HDL-C or levels of circulating liver enzymes).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers, however, that the results described in this paper are largely descriptive. Like many quantitative traits that vary between individuals, many factors, both genetic and nongenetic, contribute to the variability. In this paper we have identified some of the factors contributing either directly or indirectly to the variability in RBC cholesterol accessibility in humans. Importantly, we show that the cholesterol accessibility is not correlated with RBC cholesterol content. However, due to the largely descriptive nature of the paper, we ask that the paper now be considered for publication in the Tools and Resources category.</p><p>We have changed the title accordingly to:</p><p>“Variability of cholesterol accessibility in human red blood cells measured using a bacterial cholesterol-binding toxin”</p><p>We deleted the data from the Tangier and the LCAT deficient families since it is not pertinent to the description of the assay and the characterization of factors contributing to variation in the assay and in the trait in humans.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>The group at UT-Southwestern has already published groundbreaking biochemistry on the binding of cytolysins to cholesterol in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum.

The major findings of the paper are not predictable.

We are not aware of a human quantitative trait for which the variation in levels has been fully explained. As a comparison, plasma levels of LDL-C vary over a 4-5 fold range in the general population and despite this trait first being shown to vary in humans over 65 years ago, we still cannot account for most of the factors contributing to its variability. Here we describe a new trait that varies over 10-fold and have identified factors that explain ~50% of the variability.</p><p>Our intent in this paper is to describe a well-validated assay that provides a new tool to examine an understudied aspect of sterol metabolism and trafficking. A major strength of the assay is that it can be performed easily using a readily accessible tissue in large numbers of humans.</p><p>We have speculated in the discussion how differences in RBC cholesterol accessibility may be related to both cholesterol trafficking and to cholesterol homeostasis (and disease) in humans. Testing these hypotheses will be the focus of subsequent papers from us, and hopefully from others.</p><p><italic>There were some general issues and some technical issues with the paper, which are listed below separately.</italic></p><p><italic>Overall. I found the paper reports one very interesting observation but it does not provide either a clear mechanism for the phenomenon or a clear relation to human health.</italic></p><p>We essentially agree with these comments.

This phenomenon, which is not explained, could lead to variations between samples.</italic></p><p>The reviewer raises an excellent point. Depletion of the fALOD4 probe could lead to variations in fALOD4 binding. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> addresses this possibility, and we have rewritten the last paragraph of subsection “RBC cholesterol accessibility varied between individuals in a reproducible and stable manner” to clarify our interpretation of the figure. We have also flipped the x-axis to make the figure more intuitive (going from fewer to more RBCs. A fixed amount of fALOD4 was used in the assay, and an ~5-fold variation in fALOD4 binding/cell was observed between individuals 1, 2, and 3. This variation is only observed when the RBCs/reaction ranged from 105 to 106.</p><p>When more RBCs were added in the reaction, fALOD4 binding/cell decreased in all 3 cases, likely because the fALOD4 probe became limiting. In the rest of the studies, we avoided these extreme ratios of RBCs to fALOD4 where the probe could be limiting, and used 2.5 x 105 RBCs/assay.</p><p><italic>2) It is very disappointing that the fatty acid saturation of the lipids was not reported in the lipidomics analysis.</italic></p><p>We have now added this data as a supplementary table, which was not very revealing, but given the large number of fatty acids, some of which are present in very low concentrations, additional studies with a larger number of individuals will need to be performed to rule out any effect of fatty acid levels on fALOD4 binding.</p><p><italic>3) It is surprising that PA has such a large effect since it is reported to be a very minor lipid (0.4%). Also SM is described as affecting fALOD4 binding even though the text states it has 0.01% effect. These analyses along with the lack of measurement of lipid saturation leave one with very little understanding of what is responsible for difference in accessible cholesterol.</italic></p><p>We tested the most likely parameters to influence cholesterol accessibility in RBC membranes, which include the intrinsic properties of the RBCs, the plasma lipoprotein levels, as well as protein and phospholipid composition of the RBC membrane. Since this analysis was based on statistical regression procedures, it is by necessity exploratory and correlative. At present, we do not know if the correlation with PA in vivo is primary or secondary. PA levels may be correlated with a more abundant lipid or combination of lipids that determine accessible cholesterol content. Due to extensive inter-correlations among the different phospholipid levels, it is not possible to disentangle the causal and correlative effects of these lipids using statistical tools alone, and other experiments would be needed to determine the true magnitude of these effects.</p><p><italic>General</italic></p><p><italic>1) In the studies comparing ethnic groups, there were large disparities in% male and in the age distribution among the groups. While it is claimed that there were adjustments made to account for these differences, it is not at all clear that there are enough data to make such adjustments with high confidence.</italic></p><p>Although we adjusted for age and gender in our analyses, neither factor was a major determinant of fALOD4 binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Nonetheless, to ensure that disparities in these factors did not bias our main findings, we have performed sensitivity analyses stratified by ethnicity. Similar to our main analysis, age and gender were not major predictors of fALOD4 binding within ethnic groups, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7">Author response table 1</xref>. Age was not significantly associated with fALOD4 binding, and male gender was weakly associated with higher fALOD4 binding, but only in Whites (p=0.038). Thus, it is unlikely that our main conclusions are confounded by differences in age and gender between ethnic groups.</p><p>Similarly, we have repeated the correlation analysis with RBC lipids stratified by ethnicity. In this analysis, LPE and SM were the only lipid classes consistently and significantly associated with fALOD4 binding in both Blacks and Hispanics, after adjustment for demographic factors, and the association for PA approached significance in both groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl8">Author response table 2</xref>). Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that LPE, SM, and PA, remained significant predictors of fALOD4 binding in multivariate analysis.<table-wrap id="tbl7" position="float"><object-id

The only significant change we found was that the relationship between fALOD4 binding and plasma HDL-C levels did not reach statistical significance (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The authors state that the relationship between blood type and fALOD4 binding will require further sampling. Since no firm conclusions were drawn aside from an unexplained Rh correlation, it isn't clear why this is included.</italic></p><p>The data is included because it complements our analysis of the effect of pronase treatment of RBCs on fALOD4 binding. Rh antigen provides an example of a membrane protein that appears to correlate with fALOD4 binding. Others have shown that Rh antigen is resistant to pronase (Satchell TJ et al., Blood 118:182, 2011). There may be other such pronase resistant proteins that contribute to inter-individual differences in RBC cholesterol accessibility. As reviewed in the Discussion, performing an unbiased genetic screen such as a genome wide association study in a population study may reveal other factors that contribute to the variability in the trait.</p><p><italic>3) The authors state that the populations used in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref> show a similar trend in fALOD4 binding. It would be helpful to have a more complete analysis of the similarities and differences in these populations.</italic></p><p>We opted to keep the analysis of the two cohorts separate to avoid technical artifacts due to differences in the time of measurement and other uncontrolled factors. However, we observed very similar ethnic differences in fALOD4 binding between the two populations. In both cohorts, Blacks had significantly higher fALOD4 binding than either Whites or Hispanics (Whites were not included in the manuscript, because phospholipid measurements were not available for this sub-group). Age and gender were not major predictors of fALOD4 binding, and triglycerides were significantly inversely correlated with fALOD4 binding. We believe that the replication of the results across two independent cohorts further increases the confidence in our findings.</p><p><italic>4) Other studies have found that differences in diet can affect RBC lipid composition (e.g., DOI: 10.5584/jiomics.v3i1.123). This may have an unknown impact on the differences among ethnic groups, and it could lead to non-genomic influences on the accessible cholesterol.</italic></p><p>We have now addressed this possibility and added the following sentence to the Discussion. “Dietary differences between the ethnic groups may contribute to differences in RBC cholesterol accessibility.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>This manuscript by Hobbs and colleagues describes methods for measuring the chemical activity of cholesterol in human RBCs. Using this assay, the authors report several interesting, new observations. Notably, the chemical activity of cholesterol in RBCs: (1) is stable within fasted individuals although there is variance among cells, (2) varies 10-fold between individuals, (3) positively correlates with HDL-C and Rh antigen, (4) negatively correlates with plasma TG, (5) is higher in patients on hemodialysis but unaffected acutely by the procedure, and (6) that Tangiers individuals have extremely low chemical activity. In addition, they report that RBCs behave like other cells in having a threshold for fugacity and that depletion of phospholipids and SM increase the chemical activity of cholesterol. The manuscript is well-written, experiments employ appropriate statistical tests, the methods are clear, and the conclusions are supported by the data.</italic></p><p><italic>However, the general significance and impact of this study is moderate. The authors discuss that RBCs may participate in RCT and therefore this assay may be a useful tool in these studies, but experiments in the manuscript do not address this exciting hypothesis.</italic></p><p>We agree with this reviewer. Our discussion regarding the possible role of RBC in reverse cholesterol transport builds upon earlier studies that have suggested this possibility. We have limited our speculation to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>The assay is robust, but no data indicate its predictive value.</italic></p><p>We agree that the predictive value of the assay remains to be demonstrated. The most exciting possibility is that variation in cholesterol accessibility will help to explain why some conditions, such as chronic renal failure and diabetes, are associated with an elevated risk of coronary heart disease that cannot be explained by established risk factors. For this reason we elected to study fALOD4 binding in RBCs from individuals with chronic renal failure. We recognize that our results, though encouraging, are by no means definitive, and we present them as such.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, no experiments test whether chemical activity changes within an individual which would suggest that it may play a role in pathological processes. For example, does chemical activity change in response to refeeding or diet? I am left asking, what open question was answered by these studies?</italic></p><p>We agree that such studies would be potentially interesting, but are beyond the scope of this paper. Given that our fatty acid analysis revealed no correlation with chemical activity, we think it is unlikely that the differences in dietary intake contribute substantially to the differences observed.</p><p><italic>In summary, this is an excellent study that describes the development of an assay that in the future will be used to test an important hypotheses</italic></p><p>We accept this assessment and ask that the paper be considered for publication in the Tools and Resources category.</p></body></sub-article></article>
