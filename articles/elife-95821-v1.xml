Humans studies have implicated the anterior insular cortex (aIC) in subjective fear regulation and its abnormal activity in fear/anxiety disorders. However, the complex aIC connectivity patterns involved in regulating fear remain under investigated. To address this, we recorded single units in the aIC of freely moving male mice that had previously undergone auditory fear conditioning, assessed the effect of optogenetically activating specific aIC output structures in fear, and examined the organization of aIC neurons projecting to the specific structures with retrograde tracing. Single-unit recordings revealed that a balanced number of aIC pyramidal neurons’ activity either positively or negatively correlated with a conditioned tone-induced freezing (fear) response. Optogenetic manipulations of aIC pyramidal neuronal activity during conditioned tone presentation altered the expression of conditioned freezing. Neural tracing showed that non-overlapping populations of aIC neurons project to the amygdala or the medial thalamus, and the pathway bidirectionally modulated conditioned fear. Specifically, optogenetic stimulation of the aIC-amygdala pathway increased conditioned freezing, while optogenetic stimulation of the aIC-medial thalamus pathway decreased it. Our findings suggest that the balance of freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited neuronal activity in the aIC and the distinct efferent circuits interact collectively to modulate fear behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>insular</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021R1A6A1A10039823</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Sanggeon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021R1C1C1006607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huh</surname><given-names>Yeowool</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022M3E5E8018421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Jeiwon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022R1A2C2009265</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Jeiwon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH099073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jeansok J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioral electrophysiology and optogenetics studies reveal that projections from the anterior insula to the medial thalamus mitigate fear, while projections to the amygdala promote fear.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pavlovian fear conditioning is believed to serve a crucial survival function in nature and is widely used as a preclinical model system to understand normal and abnormal fear behavior in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim and Jung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maren and Fanselow, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armony et al., 1998</xref>). Functional brain imaging studies consistently implicate the insular cortex (IC) in processing fear and anxiety in humans. Specifically, healthy subjects show increased IC activity with fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gottfried and Dolan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klucken et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knight et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marschner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morris and Dolan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phelps et al., 2004</xref>), while patients with anxiety disorders exhibit even greater IC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruce et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoehn-Saric et al., 2004</xref>). Animal studies also implicate the IC in fear conditioning. For instance, re-exposure of rodents to a fear-conditioned context increases IC activity as measured by c-Fos or cytochrome oxidase staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck and Fibiger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruchey and Gonzalez-Lima, 2008</xref>). Additionally, microinjection of cobalt chloride, a non-selective synapse blocker, in the IC disrupts fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves et al., 2013</xref>), and post-training electrolytic lesions of the IC attenuate the expression of conditioned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunzell and Kim, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Anatomically, the IC is divided into the anterior IC (aIC) and posterior IC (pIC) by the middle cerebral artery. Although they are reciprocally connected, the aIC and pIC have distinct connections with other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gogolla, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shi and Cassell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gehrlach et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, the pIC receives inputs from the primary somatosensory thalamic nuclei, while the aIC receives strong inputs from the prefrontal cortex and has reciprocal connections with higher order association thalamic nuclei, such as the mediodorsal thalamus. Given its connections with cortical brain regions, the aIC is ideally positioned to integrate high-level information to regulate behaviors. Although both aIC and pIC have been implicated in fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Paiva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casanova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2022</xref>), how the aIC connections to different brain regions modulate fear remains unclear.</p><p>Therefore, in this study, we investigated how the aIC neurons projecting to different brain regions process auditory fear conditioning in male mice. Using single-unit recording, we found that a subset of aIC pyramidal neurons displayed activity that was positively or negatively correlated with a conditioned freezing response, suggesting that the balance of different aIC neuronal activities regulates fear behavior. Neural tracing revealed that distinct population of aIC neurons projects to the amygdala and the medial thalamus. Optogenetic manipulations confirmed that the aIC exerts bidirectional modulation of fear behavior through the aIC-amygdala pathway (increases fear) and the aIC-medial thalamus pathway (decreases fear). Together, our study suggests that different aIC circuits are involved in bidirectional modulation of fear behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>aIC activities correlate with conditioned fear</title><p>To investigate how conditioned fear is processed by individual aIC neurons, we recorded their activity during the expression of auditory fear (conditioned group) or to tone presentation (control group; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Most unit signals were recorded from the AID and AIV. We only used well-isolated unit signals from the aIC for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Of the recorded neurons, we analyzed the activity of 108 putative pyramidal neurons (93% of total isolated neurons) from 11 mice, which were distinguished from putative interneurons (n=8 cells, 7% of total isolated neurons) based on the characteristics of their recorded action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; see Methods for details).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single unit recording of aIC neurons during conditioned fear expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the auditory fear conditioning and single unit recording procedures.

In contrast, control mice that did not undergo auditory fear conditioning showed virtually no freezing during the tone presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).</p><p>The mean of all normalized (z-scored) pyramidal neuronal activities recorded in the aIC remained steady during the experiment in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The conditioned group showed no significant correlation between the normalized firing rate and freezing behavior, nor was there any difference in the mean firing rate between the tone-on and tone-off periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Similar trends were observed in the normalized neuronal activity of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). These results suggest that the mean activity of all recorded aIC pyramidal neurons remains relatively constant, regardless of the fear experience.</p><p>Several studies report reduction in theta frequency in presence of the CS in several brain regions including the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lesting et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>). Similarly, the power of aIC local field potential in the &lt;50 Hz frequency, which includes the theta frequency, tended to be reduced in the conditioned group compared to the control during CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). Quantitative analysis revealed that theta frequency (6 Hz) was significantly reduced during, but not before, CS presentation in the conditioned group compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p><p>To examine the relationship between firing rates of individual neurons and conditioned freezing behavior in detail, we attempted to identify a population of neurons whose activity changed in response to the conditioned tone stimulus. We identified three types of aIC neuronal responses: neurons that decreased firing rate (inhibited cell), neurons that increased firing rate (excited cell), and neurons that did not change their firing rate (no-change cell) at the presence of CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Activity changes of the inhibited and excited cell types showed a tendency to be correlated with freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom row). To further analyze the relationship between neuronal activity changes and freezing, we used the Pearson’s correlation analysis and found three types of aIC neuronal responses: neurons whose firing rate increased in parallel with the freezing response (‘freezing-excited cells’), neurons whose firing rate decreased with freezing (‘freezing-inhibited cells’), and neurons that had no significant changes correlated with freezing (‘non-responsive cells’). The distribution of all coefficients is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Among the neurons recorded from fear conditioned mice, 29.6% were responsive (n=32/108) and 70.4% were non-responsive (n=76/108; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Among the responsive cells, there were proportionally more freezing-excite cells (n=21/32, 65.6%) than freezing-inhibited cells (n=11/32, 34.4%), but the trend was not statistically significant (binomial proportions test, p=0.11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The activity of aIC pyramidal neurons bidirectionally correlates with freezing (fear) behaviors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of aIC neurons that decreased (inhibited-cell, left), increased (excited-cell, center), or did not change (no-change cell, right) their firing rate over five CS presentations (CS1-5).

The freezing-excited cells tended to be recorded in the middle and deep layers (L5 and 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, red dots), while the freezing-inhibited cells tended to be recorded in the superficial and middle layers (L2/3, 4, and 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, blue dots). Tetrodes that recorded both freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited cells tended to be located in the middle layer (L5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, red and blue gradation dot). The non-responsive cells were recorded from all layers of the aIC. To visualize any differences in firing rate changes among different neuronal-response types in fear conditioned and control mice, the mean normalized firing rate of individual aIC neurons was sorted in ascending order of their respective Pearson’s correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Freezing-inhibited cells showed relatively higher tone-off firing rates, which decreased during tone presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, conditioned upper). Freezing-excited cells, in contrast, showed a lower tone-off firing rate that increased during tone presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, conditioned lower). The non-responsive cells, interestingly, showed an intermediate tone-off firing rate between those of the freezing-inhibited and freezing-excited cells and remained relatively constant throughout the recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, conditioned middle). The neuronal activity of control mice was similar to the non-responsive cells of the fear conditioned mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, control). The differences in baseline firing rate before CS presentation of different cell-response types are also reflected in raw, not normalized, values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; one-way ANOVA, <italic>F</italic>=6.65, p&lt;0.001). These results suggest that subpopulations of pyramidal neurons in the aIC may become primed to respond to the fear-conditioned stimulus.</p><p>Pearson’s correlation coefficient between mean normalized firing rate and freezing of each neuronal response type revealed that the activities of the freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited neurons were significantly correlated with freezing behavior in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; freezing-excited cell <italic>r</italic>=0.81, p&lt;0.05; freezing-inhibited cell <italic>r</italic>=–0.68, p&lt;0.05). As expected, no correlation was found for the non-responsive neurons (<italic>r</italic>=0.13, p=0.44). For detailed analysis of each neuronal response type’s activity changes that occurs during CS, we compared the values of freezing-inhibited and freezing-excited cells in smaller time bins (1 s). The tone-induced firing rate peaks of the freezing-inhibited and freezing-excited cells were significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, Mann-Whitney U Test, p&lt;0.05); the freezing-inhibited cells peaked at 10.5 s, while the freezing-excited cells peaked at 17.6 s. We also analyzed additional qualities of the aIC neurons, such as the presence of neurons that precisely signaled the beginning or termination of the tone, the tone-onset and tone-offset cells, respectively. However, none of the recorded aIC neurons, neither the conditioned group’s nor the control’s, were tone-onset or tone-offset cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>We then assessed the correlation between neuronal activity and tone. None of the neuronal activity of control mice (n=14 cells, 3 mice) significantly correlated with the tone (<italic>r</italic>=0.027, p=0.87), but a subset of aIC neurons in conditioned mice showed significant correlation with tone (freezing-excited cells, <italic>r</italic>=0.44, p&lt;0.05, n=9; freezing-inhibited cells, <italic>r</italic>=−0.51, p&lt;0.05, n=5). During the five-tone presentation, however, freezing behavior was still high, and therefore difficult to distinguish whether aIC neuronal activities correlate with freezing, tone, or both. To differentiate what the aIC neuronal activities represents, we carried out a fear extinction experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) where conditioned freezing behavior reduces gradually over the ten trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Just like the five-tone presentation experiment, we found the freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited cells that correlated with freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Pearson’s correlation coefficient between mean normalized firing rate and freezing show that the activities of the freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited cells were significantly correlated with freezing behavior in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>; freezing-excited cells, <italic>r</italic>=0.81, p&lt;0.05; freezing-inhibited cells, <italic>r</italic>=–0.68, p&lt;0.05). Interestingly, none of the recorded cells correlated with tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>).

To investigate this further, we tested whether artificially increasing or decreasing the activity of aIC pyramidal neurons with optogenetics could affect freezing behavior. Viral vectors were used to express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2: AAV-CaMKII-ChR2-eYFP), halorhodopsin (NpHR3: AAV-CaMKII-NpHR3-eYFP), or fluorophore (control: AAV-CaMKII-eYFP) in the aIC pyramidal neurons and we assessed how optical stimulation affects conditioned fear behavior in each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

ChR2 stimulation increased brain rhythms in the 20 Hz and 40 Hz range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, spectrogram) because light stimulation was delivered at 20 Hz pulses. Continuous light was delivered for NpHR3 stimulation, so it did not induce specific frequency modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, spectrogram).

One possible explanation for this is that the aIC circuits that regulate fear behavior in opposing directions were simultaneously activated to cancel out the effects. To investigate further, we looked into aIC projections to various brain areas that could potentially influence fear behavior. The aIC projects to the amygdala (BLA, basolateral amygdala; and CeA, central amygdala) and the medial thalamus (MD, mediodorsal thalamus; and CM, centromedial thalamus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gehrlach et al., 2020</xref>). Of the many brain regions the aIC project to, we focused on these brain areas due to their known involvement in fear regulation and the lack of reciprocal connections between them and the pIC.</p><p>To investigate whether the same or different population of neurons in the aIC project to the medial thalamus and the amygdala, we injected retrograde tracers in respective regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Two different colors of fluorophore-conjugated Cholera toxin subunit B were injected into the medial dorsal thalamus (Alexa Fluor 594, red) and the amygdala (Alexa Fluor 488, green) in each mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). A week later, fluorophore expression was examined in the aIC region. Tracer injection was restricted to the medial dorsal thalamus and the amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly, none of the neurons in the aIC expressed both green and red fluorophores, suggesting that non-overlapping populations of aIC neurons project to the medial dorsal thalamus and the amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The neurons projecting to the medial dorsal thalamus and the amygdala were also located in different layers within the aIC; the aIC neurons projecting to the medial dorsal thalamus appeared mainly in the deep layers (approximately layer 6), while the aIC neurons projecting to the amygdala appeared in a relatively more superficial layer (approximately layer 5). Few aIC→amygdala neurons were present in layer 6, but we found no aIC→medial thalamus neurons in layer 5. The number of aIC neurons projecting to the medial dorsal thalamus was greater than those projecting to the amygdala even though they were populated in a more restricted area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Although the recording location of the freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited cells does not exactly match the tracing results, freezing-excited cells were recorded from deep layers while freezing-inhibited cells were recorded from middle and superficial layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Specifically, we found two types of aIC pyramidal neurons whose activity positively or negatively correlates with conditioned fear behavior, consistent with our previous finding that restraint stress-induced defensive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2022</xref>) correlate with the activity of aIC pyramidal neurons. While previous studies have reported excitatory or inhibitory neuronal responses to conditioned stimuli in different conditioning paradigms and brain areas, including the pIC, this study found that the ratio of these neurons differed in the aIC. In the pIC, a significantly larger population of excitatory neurons was reported compared to inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casanova et al., 2018</xref>), but in the aIC, we found approximately equal number of freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited neurons. Difference in this ratio may partially contribute to the differential roles of the aIC and pIC in processing fear. The brain’s balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) has been proposed to play a crucial role in its normal functioning. An E/I imbalance has been linked to various disorders, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>). Group activity of neurons in the pIC measured with fiberphotometry, interestingly, exhibited fear state dependent activity changes—decreased activity with high fear behavior and increased activity with lower fear behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein et al., 2021</xref>)—suggesting that group activity of the pIC may be involved in maintaining appropriate level of fear behavior. This study has not investigated whether the aIC also show fear state dependent changes in group neuronal activities; however, approximately equal number of neurons were freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited neuron found in our study suggests that the aIC maintains E/I balance at the cellular activity level when processing fear, possibly by activating different circuits.</p><p>While both the freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited aIC cells showed significant correlations with freezing behavior, their temporal firing rate changes during CS presentation were different. Specifically, the activity of the freezing-inhibited cells dropped before the freezing-excited cells increased in response to the CS presentation. Previous studies have demonstrated that temporal differences in the arrival of excitatory and inhibitory inputs can create a time window for local signals to be transmitted while maintaining the global E/I balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vogels and Abbott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatia et al., 2019</xref>). We hypothesize that the observed differences in the temporal activity of the freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited aIC cells may provide such a window for orchestrating signal gating and processing. This suggests that the aIC may play a critical role in regulating the balance between excitation and inhibition during fear conditioning.</p><p>Another distinction between the aIC and pIC may be related with anxiety, as a recent study showed that group activity of aIC neurons, but not that of the pIC, increased when mice explored anxiogenic space (open arms in an elevated plus maze, center of an open field box) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nicolas et al., 2023</xref>). Our previous study also showed that the aIC is involved in stress-induced anxiety and that neuronal activity correlated with stress-induced defensive behavior (burying) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2022</xref>). Since human studies implicated the activity of the aIC to be more correlated with subjective fear experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gogolla, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uddin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Terasawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Torrence et al., 2019</xref>), the aIC may be more specialized in regulating subjective fear and collectively integrating both anxiety and fear information. Although this study was unable to determine what determines an aIC neuron to be a freezing-excited or freezing-inhibited response type, we speculate that inputs from different brain areas may influence the different responses. For instance, freezing-inhibited cells may receive input from the prefrontal cortex since whole-brain connectivity analysis of the IC indicated that the prefrontal cortex provides more inputs to inhibitory neurons in the aIC than to excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gehrlach et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, freezing-excited cells may receive input from the amygdala, as the amygdala provides more input to excitatory neurons in the aIC than inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gehrlach et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Given the potential importance of freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited neurons in conditioned fear processing, we investigated whether disrupting the E/I balance by optogenetically increasing or decreasing the total output of aIC pyramidal neurons could alter fear behavior (freezing). Our findings demonstrated that fear behavior could be bidirectionally modulated by aIC neuronal activity: exciting aIC neurons increased the fear response, while inhibiting aIC neurons had the opposite effect. These findings have significant clinical implications since they suggest that specifically targeting freezing-inhibited or freezing-excited cells for neuromodulation may not be necessary to have a therapeutic effect. Even though the aIC has fine microcircuitry and intricate connections with many brain regions, merely controlling the total output of the aIC may be enough to regulate fear and anxiety disorders.</p><p>During the aIC optogenetic stimulation, we observed a phenomenon where brief excitation or inhibition of aIC pyramidal neurons had a residual effect on behavior during the inter-trial period when optic stimulation was off. Another study also reports the cumulative effects of optical activation of ChR2-expressing neurons on freezing behavior even after optic stimulation ended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2015</xref>), supporting that it can happen. Although further studies will be necessary to verify what causes this phenomenon, our single unit recording and local field potential analysis during optostimulation support that it is not due to seizure produced by optostimulations. It may occur due to the recruitment of several brain areas modulated by the aIC neurons since activating a more specific circuit, the aIC→medial thalamus or the aIC→amygdala projection, did not produce any lasting effects between light stimulations. Activation or inhibition of the aIC may promote or reduce activation of a recurrent circuit that controls behavior, especially since the aIC has connections with motor-related brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gehrlach et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition to our finding that optically controlling the total output of the aIC bidirectionally and cumulatively regulates fear behavior, we found that selective activation of distinct non-overlapping population of aIC neurons projecting to different brain regions produced clear-cut bidirectional changes in fear behavior. Specifically, optical activation of the aIC projection to the amygdala enhanced and sustained fear behavior, while activation of the aIC projection to the thalamus reduced fear behavior. Our results are consistent with previous studies reporting that amygdala activation promotes fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johansen et al., 2010</xref>), while thalamus activation, especially in the burst firing mode of the MD, reduces fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baek et al., 2019</xref>). Although terminal optogenetic stimulation could produce antidromic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2018</xref>), it only activates a subset of aIC neurons projecting to the areas. Our study, therefore, demonstrates for the first time that controlling distinct aIC outputs bidirectionally regulate fear behaviors.</p><p>Although we do not have a direct link between single-unit recording and aIC projections, the recording locations of the freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited cells suggest that medial thalamus projecting neurons could be freezing-excited cells while the amygdala projecting neurons may be freezing-inhibited cells. If so, then the activity of the aIC neurons would work as a mechanism to reduce overexpression of fear. We would like to provide a more direct evidence between the neuronal response types and projection patterns in future studies by electrophysiologically identifying freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited aIC neurons and testing whether those neurons activates to optogenetic activation of amygdala or medial thalamus projecting aIC neurons. Similar to our findings, the insular→central amygdala and the insula→nucleus accumbens differentially regulated fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Since the insular cortex is extensively connected with various brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gehrlach et al., 2020</xref>), several redundant circuits may be present in the aIC to fine-tune fear behavior. How the fear promoting and fear reducing aIC circuits compete and cooperate is still unclear and it would be interesting to investigate this in future studies.</p><p>Another factor to consider is that we have only used male mice in this study. Although many studies report that there is no biological sex difference in cued fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Day and Stevenson, 2020</xref>), the main experimental paradigm used in this study, it does not mean that the underlying brain circuit mechanism would also be similar. The bidirectional fear modulation by aIC→medial thalamus or the aIC→amygdala projections may be different in female mice, as some studies report reduced cued fear extinction in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Day and Stevenson, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the aIC regulates conditioned fear behaviors through bidirectional control on multiple levels, with the balance of freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited neuronal activity operating at the local circuit level and different populations of neurons projecting to different brain regions exerting additional control. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neural circuits underlying fear behavior and have potential implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for fear and anxiety disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Ewha Womans University (EWHA IACUC 21–008 t), and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.

We used F1 hybrids of C57BL/6J×129S4/SvJaeJ male mice (10–18 weeks old; Jackson Laboratory, C57BL/6 J: 000664, 129S4/SvJaeJ: 009104) in our experiments. The mice were housed at a constant temperature (23 ± 1 °C) and humidity level (50 ± 5%). They were kept in home cages with free access to food and water and subjected to an alternating 12 hr dark-light reversal cycle starting at 9 am. Following the microdrive or optic ferrule implantation, the initially group-housed mice were individually caged. All experiments were carried out blinded to groups and the order of subjects in each experiment was randomized. Experiments were replicated at least twice and all data, unless otherwise indicated, were included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Auditory fear conditioning</title><p>All mice were handled for at least one week before the experiments. For conditioning, we used a fear conditioning chamber (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA) equipped with stainless-steel bars on the floor for delivering electric foot shocks, placed inside an isolation box with a camera mounted on its ceiling. A day before conditioning, the mice were habituated in a white acrylic cylinder (context A: diameter * height = 20 * 25 cm) for 10 min. Twenty-four hours after habituation, the mice were exposed to three conditioning tones (CS; 2 kHz, 75 dB) lasting 30 s, which were co-terminated with a foot shock (US: 0.5 mA, 1 s) at 2.5 min inter-trial intervals in the fear conditioning chamber (context B; width * length * height = 18 * 18 * 29 cm). The expression of conditioned fear was tested the following day in context A with five CS lasting 30 s at 2.5 min intervals. For the fear extinction experiments, ten CS were presented at variable intervals (40–60 s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Min et al., 2023</xref>). The freezing response was defined as the absence of any movement (other than breathing) for &gt;1 s and was videotaped and manually scored by two investigators who were blinded to the experimental groups.

The microdrive was equipped with four tetrodes, where 12.5 μm Nichrome polyamide-insulated microwires were intertwined into one tetrode, Kanthal precision technology. The distance between the tetrodes were greater than 200 μm to ensure that distinct single-units will be obtained from different tetrodes. The recording tip of each tetrode channel was gold-plated to have a resistance of 300–400 kΩ measured at 1 kHz (Bak Electronics, USA). After implantation, the microdrive was secured onto the skull with self-tapping stainless-steel screws and dental cement (Vertex Dental, Netherlands).

Screening for neuronal activity was carried out in a square black chamber (width * length * height = 20 * 23 * 14 cm). To obtain unit signals, neural signals were amplified (x10,000), filtered (600 Hz to 6 kHz), and digitized (30.3 kHz) using Digital Lynx (Neuralynx, Tucson, AZ). Upon successful identification of unit signals, mice underwent habituation in context A, followed by the auditory fear conditioning process in context B the next day. No neuronal activities were recorded during this period. The day after conditioning, single neurons were recorded in freely behaving mice during the expression of auditory fear in context A. Neuronal activity and videos were recorded simultaneously and synchronized by the Neuralynx data acquisition system. Tone (CS; 2 kHz, 75 dB, lasting 30 s) event times were saved using Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) signals. The baseline was recorded for 3 min, and then behavior and neuronal activities during five CS (30 s), each separated by a 2.5 min inter-trial interval, were recorded. Neuronal signals were manually isolated into single units using Spike Sort 3D (Neuralynx, USA). The quality of isolated unit signals was assessed by L-ratio, isolation distance, inter-spike intervals in the ISI histogram (ISI &gt;1ms) provided by the software, and cross-correlation analysis. We only used well-isolated units (L-ratio &lt;0.3, isolation distance &gt;15) that were confirmed to be recorded in the aIC (conditioned group: n=116 neurons, 11 mice; control group: n=14 neurons, 3 mice) for the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2019</xref>).

The injection speed was set at 100 nL/min, and injection needles were placed in the target site for 10 min before and after viral injection. Viruses with an alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKIIα) promoter, which targets pyramidal neurons, were injected into the aIC (coordinates from bregma: AP:+1.2 mm, ML: –3.4 mm, DV: –1.8 mm from brain surface) for optogenetic control of excitatory pyramidal neurons. The types of viruses used for the study were AAV2-CaMKIIα-ChR2-EYFP (n=13), AAV2-CaMKIIα-eNpHR3.0-EYFP (n=7), and AAV2-CaMKIIα-EYFP (n=13) (UNC Vector Core, USA). An optic fiber (multimode 62.5 μm core optic fiber) attached to a ceramic ferrule (Thorlabs, USA) was implanted unilaterally into the right aIC (AP:+1.2 mm, ML: –3.4 mm, DV: –1.75 mm).

In a similar vein, fixed intertrial intervals, though common practice in the fear literature, pose a problem for neurophysiological studies. The first is that animals learn the timing of events, and the second is that neural activity is dynamic and changes over time. Thus it is very difficult to determine whether changes in neural activity are due to learning about the tone-shock contingency, timing of the task, simply occur because of time and independently of external events, or some combination of the above.</p></disp-quote><p>Trott et al. (2022) stated that &quot;...freezing was the purest reflection of associative learning.&quot; The nonassociative processes mentioned in the study were related to running and darting behaviors, which the authors argue are suppressed by associative learning. Moreover, considerable evidence from immediate postshock freezing and immediate postshock context shift studies all indicate that the freezing response is an associative (and not nonassociative) response (Fanselow, 1980 and 1986; and Landeira-Fernandez et al., 2006). Thus, our animals' freezing response to the tone CS presentation in a novel context, following three tone CS-footshock US pairings, most likely reflects associative learning.</p><p>Concerning the issue of fixed inter-trial intervals (ITIs), which are standard in fear conditioning studies, particularly those with few CS-US paired trials, we acknowledge the challenge in interpreting the neural correlates of behavior. However, the ITIs in our extinction study was variable and we still found neural activities that had significant correlation with freezing. The results of our extinction study, carried out with variable it is, suggest that the aIC neural activity changes measured in this study is likely due to freezing behavior associated with fear learning, not due to learning the contingencies of fixed ITIs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, the authors aim to understand how neurons in the anterior insular cortex (insula) modulate fear behaviors. They report that the activity of a subpopulation of insula neurons is positively correlated with freezing behaviors, while the activity of another subpopulation of neurons is negatively correlated to the same freezing episodes. They then used optogenetics and showed that activation of anterior insula excitatory neurons during tones predicting a footshock increases the amount of freezing outside the tone presentation, while optogenetic inhibition had no effect. Finally, they found that two neuronal projections of the anterior insula, one to the amygdala and another to the medial thalamus, are increasing and decreasing freezing behaviors respectively. While the study contains interesting and timely findings for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying fear, some points remain to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful for the detailed and constructive comments by the reviewer and addressed the points. Specifically, we included possible limitations of using only male mice in the study, included two more studies about the insula as references, specified the L-ratio and isolated distance used in our study, added the ratio of putative-excitatory and putative-inhibitory neurons obtained from our study, changed the terms used to describe neuronal activity changes (freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited cells), added new analysis (Figure 2H), rearranged Figure 2 for clarity, added new histology images, and added atlas maps with viral expressions (three figure supplements).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- I would suggest keeping the same y-axis for all figures that display the same data type - Figure 5D, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the detailed suggestion. We corrected the y-axis that display the same data type to be the same for all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the methods, it says 30s bins were used for neural analysis (line 435). I cannot imagine doing this, and looking at the other figures, it does not look like this is the case so could you please clarify what bins, averages, etc were used for neural and behavioral analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>Bin size for neural analysis varied; 30s, 5s, 1s bins were used depending on the analysis. We corrected this and specified what time bin was used for which figure in the methods.</p><p>Bin size for neural and freezing behavior was 30s and we also added this to the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I would not make any claims about the fear response here being associative/conditional. This would require a control group that received an equal number of tone and shock exposures, whether explicitly unpaired or random.</p></disp-quote><p>The unpaired fear conditioning paradigm, unpaired tone and shock, suggested by the reviewer is well characterized not to induce fear behavior by CS (Moita et al., 2003 and Kochli et al., 2015). In addition, considerable evidence from immediate post-shock freezing and immediate post-shock context shift studies all indicate that the freezing response is an associative (and not nonassociative) response (Fanselow, 1980 and 1986; and Landeira-Fernandez et al., 2006). Thus, our animals' freezing response to the tone CS presentation in a novel context, following three tone CS-footshock US pairings, most likely reflects associative learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I appreciate the discussion about requiring some inference to conclude that anatomically defined neurons are the physiologically defined ones. This is a caveat that is fully disclosed, however, I might suggest adding to the discussion that future experiments could address this by tagging insula-thalamus or insula-amygdala neurons with antidromic (opto or even plain old electric!) stimulation. These experiments are tricky to perform, of course, but this would be required to fully close all the links between behavior, physiology, and anatomy.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have included that, in a future study, we would like to elucidate a more direct link between physiology, anatomy and behaviors by optogenetically tagging the insula-thalamus/insula-amygdala neurons and identifying whether it may be a positive or a negative cell (now named the freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited cells, respectively) in the discussion.</p><p>[Lines 371-375] We would like to provide a more direct evidence between the neuronal response types and projection patterns in future studies by electrophysiologically identifying freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited aIC neurons and testing whether those neurons activates to optogenetic activation of amygdala or medial thalamus projecting aIC neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) As all experiments have been performed only in male mice, the authors need to clearly state this limit in the introduction, abstract, and title of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>With increasing number of readers becoming interested in the biological sex used in preclinical studies, we also feel that it should be mentioned in the beginning of the manuscript. As suggested, we explicitly wrote that we only used male mice in the title, abstract, and introduction. In addition, we discussed possible limitations of only using male mice in the discussion section as follows:</p><p>[Lines 381-386] Another factor to consider is that we have only used male mice in this study. Although many studies report that there is no biological sex difference in cued fear conditioning (42), the main experimental paradigm used in this study, it does not mean that the underlying brain circuit mechanism would also be similar. The bidirectional fear modulation by aIC→medial thalamus or the aIC→amygdala projections may be different in female mice, as some studies report reduced cued fear extinction in females (42).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors are missing important publications reporting findings on the insular cortex in fear and anxiety. For example, the authors should cite studies showing that anterior insula VIP+ interneurons inhibition reduces fear memory retrieval (Ramos-Prats et al., 2022) and that posterior insula neurons are a state-dependent regulator of fear (Klein et al., 2021). Also, regarding the anterior insula to basolateral amygdala projection (aIC-BLA), the author should include recent work showing that this population encodes both negative valence and anxiogenic spaces (Nicolas et al., 2023).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the detailed suggestions and we added appropriate publications in the discussion section. The anterior insula VIP+ interneuron study (Ramos-Prats et al., 2022) is interesting, but based on the evidence provided in the paper, we felt that the role of aIC VIP+ interneuron in fear conditioning is low. VIP+ interneurons in the aIC seem to be important in coding sensory stimuli, however, it’s relevance to conditioned stimuli seems to be low; overall VIP intracellular calcium activity to CS was low and did not differ between acquisition and retrieval. Also, inhibition of VIP did not influence fear acquisition. VIP inhibition during fear acquisition did reduce fear retrieval (CS only, no light stimulation), but this does not necessarily mean that VIP activity will be involved in fear memory storage or retrieval, especially because intracellular calcium activity of VIP+ neurons was low during fear conditioning and retrieval.</p><p>Studies by Klein et al. (2021) and Nicolas et al. (2023) are integrated in the discussion section as follows.</p><p>[Lines 297-301] Group activity of neurons in the pIC measured with fiberphotometry, interestingly, exhibited fear state dependent activity changes—decreased activity with high fear behavior and increased activity with lower fear behavior (29)—suggesting that group activity of the pIC may be involves in maintain appropriate level of fear behavior.</p><p>[Lines 316-319] Another distinction between the aIC and pIC may be related with anxiety, as a recent study showed that group activity of aIC neurons, but not that of the pIC, increased when mice explored anxiogenic space (open arms in an elevated plus maze, center of an open field box) (32).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors should specify how many neurons they excluded after controlling the L-ratio and isolation distance. It is also important to specify the percentage of putative excitatory and inhibitory interneurons recorded among the 11 mice based on their classification (the number of putative inhibitory interneurons in Figure 1D seems too low to be accurate).</p></disp-quote><p>We use manual cluster cutting and only cut clusters that are visually well isolated. So we hardly have any neurons that are excluded after controlling for L-ratio and isolation distance. The criterion we used was L-ratio&lt;0.3 and isolation distance&gt;15, and we specified this in the methods as follows.</p><p>[Lines 454-458] We only used well-isolated units (L-ratio&lt;0.3, isolation distance&gt;15) that were confirmed to be recorded in the aIC (conditioned group: n = 116 neurons, 11 mice; control group: n = 14 neurons, 3 mice) for the analysis (46). The mean of units used in our analysis are as follows: L-ratio = 0.09 ± 0.012, isolation distance = 44.97 ± 5.26 (expressed as mean ± standard deviation).</p><p>As suggested, we also specified the percentage of putative excitatory and inhibitory interneurons recorded from our study in the results and methods section. The relative percentage of putative excitatory and inhibitory interneurons were similar for both the conditioned and the control groups (conditioned putative-excitatory: 93.1%, putative-inhibitory: 6.9%; control putative-excitatory: 92.9%, putative-inhibitory: 7.1%). Although the number of putative-interneurons isolated from our recordings is low that is what we obtained. Putative inhibitory neurons, probably because of their relatively smaller size, has a tendency to be underrepresented than the putative excitatory cells.</p><p>[Lines 83-87] Of the recorded neurons, we analyzed the activity of 108 putative pyramidal neurons (93% of total isolated neurons) from 11 mice, which were distinguished from putative interneurons (n = 8 cells, 7% of total isolated neurons) based on the characteristics of their recorded action potentials (Figure 1D; see methods for details).</p><p>[Lines 464-467] The percentage of putative excitatory neurons and putative inhibitory interneurons obtained from both groups were similar (conditioned putative-excitatory: 93.1%, putative-inhibitory: 6.9%; control putative-excitatory: 92.9%, putative-inhibitory: 7.1%).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) While the use of correlation of single-unit firing frequency with freezing is interesting, classically, studies analyze the firing in comparison to the auditory cues. If the authors want to keep the correlation analysis with freezing, rather than correlations to the cues, they should rename the cells as &quot;freezing excited&quot; and &quot;freezing inhibited&quot; cells instead of positive and negative cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we used the terms “freezing-excited” and “freezing-inhibited” cells instead of positive and negative cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) To improve clarity, Figure 2 should be reorganized to start with the representative examples before including the average of population data. Thus Panel D should be the first one. The authors should also consider including the trace of the firing rate of these representative units over time, on top of the freezing trace, as well as Pearson's r and p values for both of them. Then, the next panels should be ordered as follows: F, G, H, C, A, B, I, and finally E.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rearranged Figure 2 based on the suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) It is unclear why the freezing response in Figure 2 is different in current panels F, G, and H. Please clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>It was because the freezing behaviors of slightly different population of animals were averaged. Some animals did not have positive/negative (or both) cells and only the behavior of animals with the specified cell-type were used for calculating the mean freezing response. With rearrangement of Figure 2, now we do not have plots with juxtaposed mean neuronal response-types and behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Even though the peak of tone-induced firing rate change between negative and positive cells is 10s later for positive cells, the conclusion that this 'difference suggests differential circuits may regulate the activities of different neuron types in response to fear' is overstating the observation. This statement should be rephrased. Indeed, it could be the same circuits that are regulated by different inputs (glutamatergic, GABA, or neuromodulatory inputs).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and delete the statement from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors mention they did not find tone onset nor tone offset-induced responses of anterior insula neurons. It would be helpful to represent this finding in a Figure, especially, which were the criteria for a cell to be tone onset or tone offset responding.</p></disp-quote><p>We added how tone-onset and tone-offset were analyzed in the methods section and added a plot of the analysis in Figure 2H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Based on the spread of the viral expression shown in Figure 3B, it appears that the authors are activating/inhibiting insula neurons in the GI layer, whereas single-unit recordings report the electrodes were located in DI, AID, and AIV layers. The authors should provide histology maps of the viral spread for ChR2, NpHR3, and eYFP expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the excellent suggestion. Now the histological sample in Figure 3B is a sample with expression in the GI/DI/AID layers and it also has an image taken at higher resolution (x40) to show that viral vectors are expressed inside neurons. We also added histological maps with overlay of viral expression patterns of the ChR2, eYFP, and NpHR3 groups in Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) In Figure 5B, the distribution of terminals expressing ChR2 appears much denser in CM than in MD. This should be quantified across mice and if consistent with the representative image, the authors should refer to aIC-CM rather than aIC-MD terminals.</p></disp-quote><p>Overall, we referred to the connection as aIC-medial thalamus, which collectively includes both the CM and the MD. Microscopes we have cannot determine whether terminals end at the CM or MD, but the aIC projections seems to pass through the CM to reach the MD. The Allen Brain Institute’s Mouse brain connectivity map (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://connectivity.brain-map.org/projection/experiment/272737914">https://connectivity.brain-map.org/projection/experiment/272737914</ext-link>) of a B6 mouse, the mouse strain we used in our study, with tracers injected in similar location as our study also supports our speculation and shows that aIC neuronal projections terminate more in the MD than in the CM. In addition, the power of light delivered for optogenetic manipulation is greatly reduced over distance, and therefore, the MD projecting terminals which is closer to the optic fiber will be more likely to be activated than the CM projecting terminals. However, since we could not determine whether the aIC terminate at the CM or the MD, we collectively referred to the connection as the aIC-medial thalamus throughout the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95821-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Histological verifications for each in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetic, and tracing experiments need to include a representative image of the implantation/injection site, as well as a 40x zoom-in image focusing on the cell bodies or terminals right below the optic fiber (for optogenetic experiments). Moreover, an atlas map including all injection locations with the spread of the virus and fiber placement should be added in the Supplement Figures for each experiment (see Figure S1 Klein et al., 2021). Similarly, the authors need to add a representation of the spread of the retrograde tracers for each mouse used for this tracing experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we added a histology sample showing electrode recording location for in-vivo electrophysiology in Figure 1 and added atlas maps for the optogenetic and tracing experiments in supplementary figures.
