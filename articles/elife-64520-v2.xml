This genus contains human and animal pathogens, including the intracellular <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> (causing Human American Trypanosomiasis or Chagas’ disease), the extracellular <italic>T. brucei rhodesiense</italic> and <italic>T. brucei gambiense</italic> (causing Human African Trypanosomiasis or Sleeping Sickness) and <italic>T. congolense</italic>, <italic>T. vivax</italic> and <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> (causing Animal African Trypanosomiasis or Nagana) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Radwanska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Simpson et al., 2006</xref>). Among these, salivarian trypanosomes such as <italic>T. brucei</italic> ssp. live extracellularly in the bloodstream or tissue fluids of their host. For example, <italic>T. vivax</italic> can multiply rapidly and is evenly distributed throughout the cardiovascular system, <italic>T. congolense</italic> tends to aggregate in small blood vessels, whereas <italic>T. brucei</italic> especially can extravasate and multiply in interstitial tissues (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Magez and Caljon, 2011</xref>). Pathologically, anaemia appears to be a factor common to infections with most if not all trypanosomes although with different underlying causative mechanisms. These include, among others, erythrophagocytosis by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cnops et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guegan et al., 2013</xref>), hemodilution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Naessens, 2006</xref>), erythrolysis through intermembrane transfer of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) from trypanosomes to erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rifkin and Landsberger, 1990</xref>), oxidative stress from free radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mishra et al., 2017</xref>) and mechanical damage through direct interaction of trypanosomes with erythrocytes surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boada-Sucre et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Immunologically, infections with trypanosomes are often associated with dysfunction and pathology related to exacerbated innate and adaptive immune responses (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Radwanska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stijlemans et al., 2016</xref>). Initially, it was believed that antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis was the major protective mechanism involved in early parasite control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krettli et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Musoke and Barbet, 1977</xref>). However, later studies revealed that at low antibody levels, trypanosomes can efficiently remove surface-bound antibodies through an endocytosis-mediated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engstler et al., 2007</xref>), and that complement C5-deficient mice are able to control the first-peak parasitaemia similarly to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">La Greca et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, innate immune mediators such as IFNγ, TNFα, and nitric oxide (NO) were shown to be indispensable for the control of first-peak parasitaemia, through direct and indirect mechanisms (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Radwanska et al., 2018</xref>). In the early phase of infection, the timely induction of IFNγ by NK, NKT, and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cnops et al., 2015</xref> followed by the production of TNFα and NO by IFNγ-primed macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baral et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iraqi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lopez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lucas et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magez et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Magez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Magez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Magez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O'Gorman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sternberg and Mabbott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wu et al., 2017</xref>) leads to effective control of first-peak parasitaemia. Glycosyl-inositol-phosphate soluble variant surface glycoproteins (GPI-VSG) released from the surface of trypanosomes were found to be the major inducers of TNFα in macrophages, and that such response could be primed by IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Magez et al., 2002</xref>). When macrophages would encounter GPI-VSG prior to IFNγ exposure, however, their TNFα and NO response would dramatically be reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coller et al., 2003</xref>) which, depending on the timing, could either lead to macrophage unresponsiveness or prevent exacerbated inflammatory responses during the first-peak of parasite clearance. Altogether, these data made clear that an early innate immune response is crucial to control the acute phase of trypanosome infection, but that its tight regulation is critical to ensure parasite control as opposed to pathology.</p><p>All the findings above took advantage of the availability of several mice models for trypanosome infection using trypanosusceptible or trypanotolerant as well as mutant ‘knock-out’ mice strains. Although mice cannot be considered natural hosts of trypanosomes and do not always recapitulate all features of natural infections, the availability of such models allowed to gain insights into the general biology of trypanosomes, their interaction with and evasion of the host immune system, as well as into various aspects related to vaccine failure, antigenic variation, and (uncontrolled) inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Magez and Caljon, 2011</xref>). The use of knock-out strains for example, shed specific light on the role of various cytokines, particularly TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-10, in the control of parasitaemia and in the induction of pathological conditions during infection (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Magez and Caljon, 2011</xref>). It would be ideal to be able to follow, in vivo, the early host responses to the infection and visualise the trypanosome response to the host’s attack. However, due to the lack of transparency of most mammalian hosts, this has not yet been feasible.</p><p>We recently reported the establishment of an experimental trypanosome infection of zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) with the fish-specific trypanosome <italic>Trypanosoma carassii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dóró et al., 2019</xref>). In the latter study, by combining <italic>T. carassii</italic> infection of transparent zebrafish with high-resolution high-speed microscopy, we were able to describe in detail the swimming behaviour of trypanosomes in vivo, in the natural environment of blood and tissues of a live vertebrate host. This led to the discovery of novel attachment mechanisms as well as trypanosome swimming behaviours that otherwise would not have been observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dóró et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies in common carp (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>), goldfish (<italic>Carrassius aurata</italic>) and more recently zebrafish, demonstrated that infections with <italic>T. carassii</italic> present many of the pathological features observed during human or animal trypanosomiasis, including a pro-inflammatory response during first-peak parasitaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kovacevic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oladiran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oladiran and Belosevic, 2009</xref>) polyclonal B and T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joerink et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joerink et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lischke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ribeiro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Woo and Ardelli, 2014</xref>) and anaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dóró et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Islam and Woo, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McAllister et al., 2019</xref>). These shared features among human and animal (including fish) trypanosomiases suggest a commonality in (innate) immune responses to trypanosomes across different vertebrates.</p><p>Zebrafish are fresh water cyprinid fish closely related to many of the natural hosts of <italic>T. carassii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kent et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Simpson et al., 2006</xref>) and are a powerful model species owing to, among others, their genetic tractability, large number of transgenic lines marking several immune cell types, knock-out mutant lines and most importantly, the transparency of developing embryos allowing high-resolution in vivo visualisation of cell behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertrand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ellett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langenau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lawson and Weinstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Page et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Petrie-Hanson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Renshaw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">White et al., 2008</xref>). During the first 2–3 weeks of development, zebrafish are devoid of mature T and B lymphocytes and thus offer a window of opportunity to study innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Torraca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Torraca and Mostowy, 2018</xref>), especially those driven by neutrophils and macrophages.

Based on a novel clinical scoring system relying, amongst other criteria, on in vivo real-time monitoring of parasitaemia, we could consistently segregate larvae in high- and low-infected individuals without having to sacrifice the larvae. Between these individuals we always observed a marked differential response between macrophages and neutrophils, especially with respect to their proliferative capacity and redistribution in tissues or major blood vessels during infection. Significant differences were observed in the inflammatory response of macrophages in high- and low-infected individuals and in their susceptibility to the infection. In low-infected individuals, despite an early increase in macrophage number, a mild inflammatory response strongly associated with control of parasitaemia and survival to the infection was observed. Conversely, exclusively in high-infected individuals, we describe the occurrence of large, granular macrophages, reminiscent of foamy macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vallochi et al., 2018</xref>), characterised by a strong inflammatory profile and association to susceptibility to the infection. This is the first report of the occurrence of foamy macrophages during an extracellular trypanosome infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Susceptibility of zebrafish larvae to <italic>T. carassii</italic> infection</title><p>We recently reported the establishment of a trypanosome infection in zebrafish larvae using a natural fish parasite, <italic>Trypanosoma carassii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dóró et al., 2019</xref>).

From 4 dpi onwards, we could consistently sort larvae into groups of high- or low-infected individuals based on in vivo observations, without the need to sacrifice animals (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Infection levels were categorised using four criteria: (1) escape reflex (slow vs fast) upon contact with a pipette tip, (2) infection scores (1–10, see details in Materials and methods), based on the ratio of blood cells and parasites passing through an intersegmental capillary (ISC) in 100 events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, 00:06-00:39 s), (3) extravasation, based on the presence of parasites outside of blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, 00:40-1:20 s) and (4) vasodilation, based on the diameter of the caudal vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). The first criterion defined all individuals with a minimal escape reflex (slow swimmers) as high-infected individuals: they were mostly located at the bottom of the tank and showed minimal reaction upon direct contact with a pipette. Larvae with a normal escape reflex (fast swimmers), however, were not exclusively low-infected individuals. Therefore, a second criterion was used based on trypanosome counting in ISC (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, 00:06-00:39 s). Individuals with an infection score of 1 (no parasites) were never observed, indicating that larvae cannot clear the infection, at least not within 4 days. Individuals with an infection score between 2 and 3 (~80%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) were categorised as low-infected and had a high survival rate (relative percent survival, 82%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Individuals with an infection score between 6 and 10 (~20%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) were categorised as high-infected and generally succumbed to the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Individuals with an intermediate score of 4–5 (~5%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) were re-evaluated at 5 dpi and could go both ways: they either showed a delayed parasitaemia and later developed high parasitaemia (common) or recovered from the infection (rare). The third criterion clearly identified high-infected individuals as those showing extensive extravasation at two or more of the following locations: peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, 00, 00:40-00:59 s), interstitial space lining the blood vessels, muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, 00:00-01:07 s) or fins (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, 01:08-01:20 s), in particular the anal fin. At these locations, in high-infected individuals, trypanosomes could accumulate in high numbers, filling up all available spaces. Extravasation however could also occur in low-infected individuals, but to a lesser extent. The fourth criterion, vasodilation of the caudal vein associated with high numbers of trypanosomes in the blood vessels, was a definitive sign of high infection level, and never occurred in low-infected larvae. To validate our scoring system, expression of a <italic>T. carassii</italic>-specific gene was analysed in pools of larvae classified as high- or low-infected. As expected, in individuals categorised as high-infected, <italic>T. carassii</italic>-specific gene expression increased more than 60-fold, whereas in low-infected individuals the increase was less than 20-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Altogether these data show that <italic>T. carassii</italic> infects zebrafish larvae, but that the infection can develop differently among individuals, leading to different outcomes. The clinical scoring system based on numerous criteria is suitable to reliably separate high- and low-infected larvae to further investigate individual immune responses. A preliminary gene expression analysis of a panel of immune-related genes was performed on pools of larvae classified as high- or low-infected according to our clinical scoring system. Analysis revealed a general trend for higher pro-inflammatory genes expression, including <italic>il1b, tnfb</italic>, and <italic>il6,</italic> in the high-infected group, but due to the large variation between pools, the differences were not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, it has to be considered that the analysis was performed on pools of whole larvae, which may have obscured tissue- or cell-specific responses. For these reasons, taking advantage of the transparency of zebrafish larvae and of the established clinical scoring system, subsequent characterisation of the inflammatory response to <italic>T. carassii</italic> infection, was performed on individual larvae, focusing on innate immune cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Progression of <italic>T.carassii</italic> infection in zebrafish larvae.</title><p><italic>Tg(mpeg1:mCherry-F;mpx:GFP)</italic> 5 dpf zebrafish were injected intravenously with <italic>n</italic> = 200 <italic>T. carassii</italic> or with PVP and imaged at 2 dpi (<bold>A</bold>), 5 dpi (<bold>B-C</bold>), 7 dpi (<bold>D-E</bold>).

In the head, macrophages were scattered throughout the region but in infected larvae they were most abundant in the area corresponding to the haematopoietic tissue (head kidney), posterior to the branchial arches, indicative of proliferation of progenitor cells. In the trunk, macrophages were scattered throughout the tissue, and in high-infected larvae in particular, macrophages generally clustered in the posterior cardinal vein and caudal vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right panels). In agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), quantification of total green fluorescence confirmed a significant increase in the head and trunk of low-infected larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). In high-infected individuals, a significant increase was observed in the trunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), whereas in the head the number of macrophages was clearly elevated although not significantly when compared to the PVP-injected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In all groups, total cell fluorescence in the head region was higher than in the trunk region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>), and thus largely contributed to the total cell fluorescence previously measured in whole larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The difference in CTCF values between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> can be attributed to the different microscopes and magnification used for the acquisition as well as fluorescence source (GFP or mCherry in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Alexa-488 fluorophore in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Given the high number of macrophages in the head region, their heterogeneous morphology, the thickness of the tissue and the overall high number of EdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei, it was not possible to reliably count single (EdU<sup>+</sup>) macrophages in this area. Therefore, when quantifying the number of EdU + cells, we focused on the trunk region only. There, EdU<sup>+</sup> macrophages could be observed in all groups, and in agreement with the total cell fluorescence measured in the same region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), their number was higher in low- and high-infected individuals compared to PVP-injected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and corresponding <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

In these images we appreciate that, in zebrafish as in mammals, <italic>tnfa</italic> expression (eGFP) is not exclusive to immune cells only.

Considering the prominent role of innate immune factors in determining the balance between pathology and control of first-peak parasitaemia in mammalian models of trypanosomiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Magez and Caljon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Radwanska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stijlemans et al., 2017</xref>), the use of transparent zebrafish larvae, devoid of a fully developed adaptive immune system, allowed us to investigate the early events of the innate immune response to <italic>T. carassii</italic> infection in vivo. After having established a clinical scoring system of infected larvae, we were able to consistently differentiate high- and low-infected individuals, each associated with opposing susceptibility to the infection. In high-infected larvae, which fail to control first-peak parasitaemia, we observed a strong inflammatory response associated with the occurrence of foamy macrophages and susceptibility to the infection. Conversely, in low-infected individuals, which succeeded in controlling parasitaemia, we observed a moderate inflammatory response associated with resistance to the infection. Altogether these data confirm that also during trypanosome infection of zebrafish, innate immunity is sufficient to control first-peak parasitaemia and that a controlled inflammatory response is beneficial to the host.</p><p>Using transgenic lines marking macrophages and neutrophils, total cell fluorescence and cell proliferation analysis revealed that <italic>T. carassii</italic> infection triggers macrophage division, particularly in low-infected individuals. Although to a much lesser extent, neutrophils also responded to the infection by dividing. The total number of neutrophils, however, was comparatively low and likely did not contribute to the total cell fluorescence measured in our whole larvae analysis. It cannot be excluded however, that neutrophils’ viability was affected by the infection and that the number of newly divided neutrophils is only slightly higher than the dying ones. Although neutrophils were recently implicated in promoting the onset of tsetse fly-mediated trypanosome infections in mouse dermis, macrophage-derived immune mediators, such as NO and TNFα were confirmed to played a more prominent role in the control of first-peak parasitaemia and in the regulation of the overall inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caljon et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The observation that in low-infected individuals the number of macrophages was significantly increased by 4–5 dpi, the time point at which clear differences in parasitaemia were apparent between the two infected groups, suggests a role for macrophages, or for macrophage-derived factors in first-peak parasitaemia control. Phagocytosis however, can be excluded as one of the possible contributing factors since motile <italic>T. carassii</italic>, similar to other extracellular trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caljon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Saeij et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Scharsack et al., 2003</xref>), cannot be engulfed by any innate immune cell (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). A strong inflammatory response is also not required for trypanosomes control, since in low-infected individuals, only moderate <italic>il1b</italic> or <italic>tnfα</italic> expression was observed, mostly in macrophages, as assessed using transgenic zebrafish reporter lines. Our data are in agreement with several previous studies using trypanoresistant (BALB/c) or trypanosusceptible (C57Bl/6) mice that revealed the double-edge sword of pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNFα or IFNγ during trypanosome infection in mammalian models (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Radwanska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stijlemans et al., 2007</xref>).

Conversely, in individuals in which an uncontrolled inflammatory response took place, immunosuppression and inflammation-related pathology occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Namangala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Namangala et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Noël et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stijlemans et al., 2016</xref>). The stark contrast between the mild inflammatory response observed in low-infected individuals and the exacerbated response observed in high-infected larvae, strongly resembles the opposing responses generally observed in the aforementioned studies in mice. Owing to the possibility to monitor the infection at the individual level, it was possible to observe such responses within a population of outbred zebrafish larvae. Although we were unable to investigate the specific role of Tnfα during <italic>T. carassii</italic> infection of zebrafish, due to the unavailability of <italic>tnfα</italic>-/- zebrafish lines or the unsuitability of morpholinos for transient knock-down at late stages of development, we previously reported that recombinant zebrafish (as well as carp and trout) Tnfα, are all able to directly lyse <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forlenza et al., 2009</xref>). In the same study, we reported that also during <italic>Trypanoplasma borreli</italic> (kinetoplastid) infection of common carp, soluble as well as transmembrane carp Tnfα play a crucial role in both, trypanosome control and susceptibility to the infection. Thus, considering the evolutionary conservation of the lectin-like activity among vertebrate’s TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daulouède et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forlenza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lucas et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Magez et al., 1997</xref>), it is possible that the direct lytic activity of zebrafish Tnfα may have played a role in the control of first-peak parasitaemia in low-infected individuals. In the future, using <italic>tnfα</italic>-/- zebrafish lines, possibly in combination with <italic>ifnγ</italic> reporter or <italic>ifnγ</italic>-/- lines, it will be possible to investigate in detail the relative contribution of these inflammatory mediators in the control of parasitaemia as well as onset of inflammation.</p><media id="video7" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-64520-video7.mp4"><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>Motile <italic>T. carassii</italic> cannot be engulfed by innate immune cells.</title><p><italic>Tg(mpx:GFP)</italic> zebrafish larvae were injected intravenously at 5 dpf with n = 200 <italic>T. carassii</italic> and two infected individuals were imaged at 7 dpi with a DMi8 inverted digital Leica microscope.

Using various comparative mice infection models, it became apparent that while TNFα production is required for parasitaemia control, a timely shedding of TNFα Receptor-2 (TNFR2) is necessary to limit TNFα-mediated infection-associated immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Radwanska et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, during <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection in mice and cattle, continuous cleavage of membrane glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inisotol (GPI)-anchored VSG (mVSG-GPI) leads to shedding of the soluble VSG-GIP (sVSG-GPI), while the di-myristoyl-glycerol compound (DMG) is left in the membrane. While the galactose-residues of sVSG-GPI constituted the minimal moiety required for optimal TNFα production, the DMG compound of mVSG contributed to macrophage overactivation (TNFα and IL-1β secretion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Magez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Magez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sileghem et al., 2001</xref>). Although <italic>T. carassii</italic> was shown to possess a surface dominated by GPI-anchored carbohydrate-rich mucin-like glycoproteins, not subject to antigenic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lischke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Overath et al., 2001</xref>), components of its excreted/secreted proteome, together with phospholipase C-cleaved GPI-anchored surface proteins, have all been shown to play a role in immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joerink et al., 2007</xref>), inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oladiran and Belosevic, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oladiran and Belosevic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ribeiro et al., 2010</xref>) as well as immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oladiran and Belosevic, 2012</xref>). Thus, the over-activation caused by the presence of elevated levels of pro-inflammatory trypanosome-derived moieties, combined with the lack of a timely secretion of regulatory molecules (e.g. soluble TNFR2) that could control the host response, may all have contributed to the exacerbated inflammation observed in high-infected individuals.</p><p>Given the differential response observed in low- and high-infected individuals, especially with respect to macrophage distribution and activation, we attempted to investigate the specific role of macrophages in the protection or susceptibility to <italic>T. carassii</italic> infection. To this end, the use of a cross between the <italic>Tg(mpeg1:Gal4FF)<sup>gl2</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ellett et al., 2011</xref>) and the <italic>Tg(UAS-E1b:Eco.NfsB-mCherry)<sup>c26</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davison et al., 2007</xref>) line, which would have allowed the timed metronidazole (MTZ)-mediated depletion of macrophages in zebrafish larvae, was considered. Unfortunately, in vitro analysis of the effect of MTZ on the trypanosome itself, revealed that trypanosomes are susceptible to MTZ, rendering the <italic>nfsB</italic> line not suitable to investigate the role of macrophages (nor neutrophils) during this particular type of infection. Alternatively, we attempted to administer liposome-encapsulated clodronate (Lipo-clodronate) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nguyen-Chi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Phan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Travnickova et al., 2015</xref>). In our hands, however, administration of 5 mg/ml Lipo-clodronate (3 nl) to five dpf larvae (instead of 2–3 dpf larvae), led to the rapid development of oedema.</p><p>Besides differences between the overall macrophage and neutrophil (inflammatory) response, the differential distribution of these cells was also investigated in vivo during infection utilising the transparency of the zebrafish and the availability of transgenic lines marking the vasculature. Neutrophils were never observed inside the cardinal caudal vein although in infected individuals they were certainly recruited and were observed in close contact with the outer vessel’s endothelium. Conversely, macrophages could be seen both outside and inside the vessel and the total proportion differed between high- and low-infected individuals. While in low-infected individuals the majority of macrophages recruited to the cardinal caudal vein remained outside the vessel in close contact with the endothelium, in high-infected individuals the majority of macrophages were recruited inside the caudal vein and were tightly attached to the luminal vessel wall. To our knowledge, such detailed description of the relative (re)distribution of neutrophils and macrophages, in vivo, during a trypanosome infection, has not been reported before.</p><p>Interestingly, exclusively in high-infected individuals, by 4 dpi large, round, dark, and granular cells were observed, already under the bright field view, in the lumen of the cardinal caudal vein. These cells were confirmed to be foamy macrophages with high cytoplasmic lipid content. Foam cells, or foamy macrophages have been named after the lipid bodies accumulated in their cytoplasm leading to their typical enlarged morphological appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dvorak et al., 1983</xref>), but are also distinguished by the presence of diverse cytoplasmic organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Melo et al., 2003</xref>). Foam cells have been shown to be typical of atherosclerotic plaques associated to various inflammatory metabolic diseases (e.g. hyperlipidemia, diabetes, insulin resistance and obesity) as well as cancer (e.g. Papillary renal cell carcinoma, Esophageal xanthoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma) and autoimmune diseases e.g. multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guerrini and Gennaro, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Saka and Valdivia, 2012</xref>). Besides inflammatory diseases, they have also been associated with several (intracellular) infectious diseases, including Leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, experimental malaria, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis and other intracellular bacterial infections (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guerrini and Gennaro, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">López-Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vallochi et al., 2018</xref>) but never before with (extracellular) trypanosome infection. For example, during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection of rat, increased numbers of activated monocytes or macrophages were reported in the blood or heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Melo and Machado, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, trypanosome uptake was shown to directly initiate the formation of lipid bodies in macrophages, leading to the appearance of foamy macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Avila et al., 2011</xref>). During human <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infections, foamy macrophages play a role in sustaining the presence of bacteria and contribute to tissue cavitation enabling the spread of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Russell et al., 2009</xref>). Independently of the disease, it is clear that foamy macrophages are generally associated with inflammation, since their cytoplasmic lipid bodies are a source of eicosanoids, strong mediators of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wymann and Schneiter, 2008</xref>). In turn, inflammatory mediators such as Prostaglandin E2 benefit trypanosome survival, as shown in <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>, <italic>Leishmania</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infections (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vallochi et al., 2018</xref>). Our results are consistent with these reports as we show the occurrence of foamy macrophages exclusively in individuals that developed high parasitaemia, characterised by a strong pro-inflammatory response, and ultimately succumbed to the infection. Although we did not systematically investigate the exact kinetics of parasitaemia development in correlation with foamy macrophages occurrence, during our in vivo monitoring, we consistently observed that the increase in trypanosome number preceded the appearance of foamy macrophages. It is possible that, in high-infected individuals, foamy macrophages are formed due to the necessity to clear the increasing concentration of circulating trypanosome-derived moieties or of dying trypanosomes. The interaction with trypanosome-derived molecules, including soluble surface (glyco)proteins or trypanosome DNA, may not only be responsible for the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, but also for a change in cell metabolism. The occurrence of foamy macrophages has been reported for intracellular trypanosomatids (<italic>T. cruzi, Leishmania</italic>), and arachidonic acid-derived lipids were reported to act as regulators of the host immune response and trypanosome burden during <italic>T. brucei</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">López-Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>). To our knowledge, our study is the first to report the presence of foamy macrophages during an extracellular trypanosome infection.</p><p>The possibility to detect the occurrence of large, granular cells already in the bright field and the availability of transgenic lines that allowed us to identify these cells as macrophages, further emphasizes the power of the zebrafish model. It allowed us to visualise in vivo, in real time, not only their occurrence but also their differential distribution with respect to other macrophages or neutrophils. Observations that we might have missed if we for example were to bleed an animal, perform immunohistochemistry or gene expression analysis. Thus, the possibility to separate high- and low-infected animals without the need to sacrifice them, allowed us to follow at the individual level the progression of the infection and the ensuing differential immune response.</p><p>In the future, it will be interesting to analyse the transcription profiles of sorted macrophage populations from low- and high-infected larvae. Given the marked heterogeneity in macrophage activation observed especially within high-infected individuals, single-cell transcriptome analysis, of foamy macrophages in particular, may provide insights in the differential activation state of the various macrophage phenotypes. Furthermore, the zebrafish has already emerged as a valuable animal model to study inflammation and host-pathogen interaction and can be a powerful complementary tool to examine macrophage plasticity and polarisation in vivo, by truly reflecting the complex nature of the environment during an ongoing infection in a live host. Finally, the availability of (partly) transparent adult zebrafish lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antinucci and Hindges, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">White et al., 2008</xref>), may aid the in vivo analysis of macrophage activation in adult individuals.</p><p>Altogether, in this study, we describe the innate immune response of zebrafish larvae to <italic>T. carassii</italic> infection. The transparency and availability of various transgenic zebrafish lines, enabled us to establish a clinical scoring system that allowed us to monitor parasitaemia development and describe the differential response of neutrophils and macrophages at the individual level. Interestingly, for the first time in an extracellular trypanosome infection, we report the occurrence of foamy macrophages, characterised by a high-lipid content and strong inflammatory profile, associated with susceptibility to the infection. Our model paves the way to investigate which mediators of the trypanosomes are responsible for the induction of such inflammatory response as well as study the conditions that lead to the formation of foamy macrophages in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>elongation factor-1α (ef1a)</italic></td><td valign="top">DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48388">10.7554/eLife.48388</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENE-990415–52</td><td valign="top">template for primers for RQ-PCR analysis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>interleukin-1 beta (il1β)</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/">ZFIN.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENE-040702–2</td><td valign="top">template for primers for RQ-PCR analysis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>interleukin-10 (il10)</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/">ZFIN.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENE-051111–1</td><td valign="top">template for primers for RQ-PCR analysis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>tumor necrosis factor alpha, gene a (tnfa)</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/">ZFIN.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENE-050317–1</td><td valign="top">template for primers for RQ-PCR analysis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>tumor necrosis factor alpha, gene b (tnfb)</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/">ZFIN.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENE-050601–2</td><td valign="top">template for primers for RQ-PCR analysis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>interleukin-6 (il6)</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/">ZFIN.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENE-120509–1</td><td valign="top">template for primers for RQ-PCR analysis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Trypanosoma carassii</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>heat-shock protein-70</italic> (<italic>hsp70</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48388">10.7554/eLife.48388</ext-link></td><td valign="top">GeneBank-FJ970030.1</td><td valign="top">template for primers for RQ-PCR analysis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Wild type common carp, R3xR8 strain</td><td valign="top">DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(95)91961%20T">10.1016/0044-8486(95)91961 T</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">used to passage <italic>Trypanosoma carassii</italic> in vivo</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Wild type zebrafish, AB strain</td><td valign="top">Zebrafish International Resource Center</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005065">SCR_005065</ext-link>;

After injection, infected and non-infected larvae were kept in separate tanks at a density of 60 larvae per 1L water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Clinical scoring system of the severity of infection</title><p>Careful monitoring of the swimming behaviour of zebrafish larvae after infection (five dpf onwards) as well as in vivo observation of parasitaemia development in transparent larvae, led to the observation that from 4 dpi onwards larvae could generally be segregated into high- and low-infected individuals. To objectively assign zebrafish to either one of these two groups, we developed a clinical scoring system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The first criterion looked at the escape reflex upon contact with a pipette and was sufficient to identify high-infected individuals as those not reacting to the pipet (slow swimmers). To categorise the remaining individuals, a second criterion based on counting parasite:blood cell ratios in 100 events passing through the intersegmental capillary (ISC) above the cloaca was developed. The infection scores on a scale from 1 to 10 were assigned as follows: 1 = no parasites observed, 2 = 1–10% parasite, 3 = 11–20% parasite, 4 = 21–30% parasite, 5 = 31–40% parasite, 6 = 41–55% parasite, 7 = 56–70% parasite, 8 = 71–85% parasite, 9 = 86–99%, 10 = no blood cells observed. Larvae with infection scores between 1–3 were categorised as low-infected while scores between 6 and 10 were categorised as high infected. Larvae with scores 4–5 were reassessed 1 day later, at 5 dpi, and then categorised as high- or low-infected. Since handing may affect larval behaviour or overall gene expression, larvae with scores 4–5 were re-assessed at 5 dpi only when image analysis was performed and not when survival or gene expression analysis were carried out. Larvae with a score of 1 (no parasites observed in ISC) where immediately assessed using the third criterion (extravasation, see below) and were never found to be parasite-free. Thus, remained assigned to the low-infected group. Next to that, heartbeat of the larvae was monitored and noted if it was slower than the control. The third criterion considered extravasation and the location of extravasated parasites (e.g. fins, muscle, intraperitoneal cavity, and interstitial space lining the blood vessels). Finally, for the fourth criterion the diameter of the caudal vein in the trunk area after the cloaca region was measured in ImageJ 1.49o to quantify the degree of vasodilation. Eventual blockage of tail tip vessel-loop was also noted. In general, the swimming behaviour of larvae was observed and compared to the control group.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of the clinical scoring system used to determine individual infection levels of <italic>T.carassii</italic>-infected zebrafish larvae.</title><p>Zebrafish larvae infected with <italic>T. carassii</italic> can be analysed at 4 dpi; based on up to four different parameters including (1) visual monitoring of larval behaviour, (2) parasite numbers, (3) location, or (4) vasodilation, larvae could be segregated into high- and low-infected individuals.

infection model to investigate innate immune responses to extracellular trypanosome infections. Differences in early macrophage responses in individual animals strongly influenced infection outcomes. In particular, induction of a controlled inflammatory response was associated with low parasitaemia and host survival, while failure to control infection was associated with an exacerbated inflammatory response and the appearance of foamy macrophages. Thus trypanosome infections can be controlled by innate immune responses, although the over-activation of these responses and formation of foamy macrophages exacerbates disease.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Occurrence of foamy macrophages during the innate response of zebrafish to trypanosome infections&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Malcolm J McConville as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Carl De Trez.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates the role of the innate immune response in controlling bloodstream trypanosome infection in the zebrafish infection model recently developed by the authors. The study found that an innate immune response, characterized by controlled inflammatory response was sufficient to control infection in some individuals, while failure to control infection was associated with a strong inflammatory response characterized by expansion of foamy macrophages. The findings highlight the importance of a balanced immune response in controlling bloodstream trypanosome infections that are likely relevant to mammalian infections.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Can the authors provide further quantification and statistical analysis of some of the interesting phenotypes reported in Figure 7, 8, 9 and 10. In particular:</p><p>– The authors report that macrophages, but not neutrophils, infiltrate in the cardinal vein, although both cell populations are accumulating on the outer side of the vasculature during infection. Also, do neutrophils ever interact with trypanosomes in other sections of the vasculature, if not in the cardinal vein? Do trypanosomes ever escape from the circulation and interact with neutrophils elsewhere?</p><p>– The authors report that foamy macrophages occur inside the vasculature and are exclusive to high-infected larvae. Can they quantitate these associations and perform statistical tests (i.e. count foamy/non-foamy mpeg+ cells inside/outside the vessels in the PVP, T. car-low and T. car-high groups)? Is there a possibility that macrophages are scavenging dead Trypanosoma from the circulation, and is this leading to the foamy macrophage phenotype? Trypanosomes are also leading to hemolysis and this could lead to increased phagocytosis of red blood cell debris by macrophages. Could this be linked to the foamy appearance? How specific is BODIPY, to distinguish cholesterol (typical of foamy macrophages), vs lipids derived by phagocytosis of cell debris (i.e. high in membrane phospholipids?)</p><p>– The authors report that foamy macrophages occurring in T. car-infected larvae are characterised by a strong pro-inflammatory profile and are all il1beta and all tnfa positive. Significant differences are observed in the inflammatory response of macrophages in high- and low-infected individuals and in their susceptibility to infection. Can the authors show that foamy macrophages are indeed more frequently il1b positive/tnfa positive than neighbouring non-foamy mpeg+ cells?</p><p>– The authors report that a strong inflammatory profile is associated with the occurrence of foamy macrophages. However, it is not clear how widely spread the inflammation is and only images of macrophages and endothelial cells in the cardinal vein are shown. Moreover, only tnfa and il1b are assessed (using transgenic reporters). The authors also mention that they observe a mild inflammatory response in low-infected individuals and that this is strongly associated with control of parasitaemia and survival to the infection. Can they confirm strong vs mild inflammatory profiles and different association with survival in the 2 infection categories and PVP control with a panel of qRT-PCR for several inflammatory markers (i.e. il1beta, tnfa and other relevant cytokines and chemokines)?</p><p>2. Figure 1 diagram is very useful, but could be enhanced by inclusion of a representative quantification in an additional panel. For example, when injecting 200 <italic>T. carassii</italic>, what % of larvae is classified in the two infection categories? Could the authors also further discuss the % of T. low larvae where no parasites were observed during the clinical scoring? Have these larvae (or some of them) cleared the infection completely?</p><p>3. Figure 2: Is the clinical scoring predictive of early death onset (or likelihood of death)? To show this, can the authors divide the T. car 200 survival curve into 2 separate curves, based on the clinical scoring at day 4-5.</p><p>4. Authors are discouraged from using the term macrophage/neutrophil proliferation In Figure 5 and Figure 6 and related text. Normally &quot;macrophage proliferation&quot; is used to refer to resident tissue macrophages that occasionally are seen to divide/proliferate. The authors are more likely detecting myelopoiesis (in agreement, Edu staining most commonly is seen in hematopoietic tissues) and the EdU staining in mature macrophages/neutrophils is the result of a (recent) cell division of a hematopoietic progenitor cell. In the absence of a more specific mechanistic insight, the use of much broader terms, such as &quot;increased production/number of macrophages/neutrophils&quot; rather than &quot;macrophage/neutrophil proliferation&quot;, is encouraged.</p><p>5. The authors refer to the trypanosuceptible vs. trypanotolerant background of the host observed in non-zebrafish models. However, in this particular setting, all the larvae possess an identical genetic background. Therefore, why would the larvae behave differently in response to a similar pathogen? In addition, there is no clear differences in neither parasitic load at 2 dpi (figure 3F) nor myeloid cells accumulation at 3 dpi (figure 4AB), which could lead to a drastic difference in parasitic load based on mRNA expression at 4 dpi (figure 3F). The authors should discuss this shortly.</p><p>6. Figure 4: the representative pictures from FigB do not seem to clearly match the histograms depicted in Figure 4C. For example, from the pictures in Figure 4B, it seems that there is a decrease in red fluorescence in the representative pictures from 7 dpi to 9 dpi low-infected larvae, which is not reflected in the histogram. Also, representative picture of 7 hi-infected larvae seems to show at least equal or even more red fluorescence compared to 9 dpi low-infected larvae.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64520.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Trypanosomes however are very motile parasites and, especially in compact tissues of the fins and muscle, can tumble very rapidly or swim directionally at speeds ranging between 45 and 57 µm/sec (Video 7 – 27 sec, in Doro et al. 2019, <italic>eLife</italic>). We believe that given the high motility of trypanosomes, either as directional swimmers as well as tumblers, it is unlikely for immune cells to phagocytose, or ‘chase’ and directly interact with trypanosomes.</p><p>Nevertheless, we realize that supplementary video 1 in the current manuscript does not provide a reference for trypanosome motility relative to neutrophil location or motility. Therefore, we now provide an additional supplementary video showing neutrophils surrounded by motile trypanosomes; this video shows how fast a single trypanosome can pass by or swim away from a neutrophil (or any other immune cell). Currently, we find it most suited to add the video in the Discussion section after the current sentence ‘Phagocytosis however, can be excluded as one of the possible contributing factors since motile <italic>T. carassii</italic>, similar to other extracellular trypanosomes (Caljon et al., 2018; Saeij et al., 2003; Scharsack et al., 2003), cannot be engulfed by any innate immune cell (Video 7).’ Line 630.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors report that foamy macrophages occur inside the vasculature and are exclusive to high-infected larvae.

Thus, we established that these are foamy macrophages.

In the revised figure 7, we now also provide a representative image of a lowinfected individual, showing no positivity for the BODIPY FLC5 dye in any of the macrophages present, specifying that BODIPY+ foamy macrophages only occur in high-infected individuals.

However, a third option that may explain the foamy appearance, which does not exclude the previous two and may rather be a consequence of those, is a change in macrophage lipid metabolism in <italic>response</italic> to phagocytosis of trypanosome-derived PAMPs and/or host DAMPs.</p><p>As also referred to later by the reviewers (comment 14), foam cells [macrophages with lipid droplets (LDs) which are stores of triacylglycerols (TAGs) AND/OR cholesterol esters (CEs)], are found in various disease states. CE-rich foam cells are typical of atherosclerotic plaques whereas TAG-rich foam cells are most commonly found in tuberculi formed during <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infections and were described also during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and Leishmania infections (Guerrini et al. 2019. doi:10.1016/j.it.2019.10.002; Saka HA and Valdivia R. 2012. doi:10.1146/annurev-cellbio-092910-153958). Thus both, CE-rich and TAG-rich foam cells exist and represent two different paradigms of foam cell formation during disease, although mixed phenotypes have also been observed.</p><p>Furthermore, most if not all studies investigating foam cells, labelled the lipid droplets in in vitro cell cultures of foamy macrophages or in fixed tissues isolated from individuals post-mortem. Most of these studies used either the neutral lipid dyes Nile Red or BODIPY 493/503, which require short incubation time but are NOT specific for foamy macrophages as they bind to anything which has neutral lipids (cholesterol) in/on it. BODIPY-FLCx (where x indicates the number of carbon atoms in fatty acids moieties of various lengths) can directly bind to lipids but can also be actively incorporated into phospholipids membranes and triacylglycerol (TAG) and can therefore be used to also investigate changes in lipid metabolism within live cells, but requires different kinetics of uptake.</p><p>In our case, wanting to investigate the formation and occurrence of foamy macrophages in vivo, during an ongoing infection in a live developing embryo, we had to consider the presence of several lipid-rich (digestive) organs (intestine, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, etc) in which lipid accumulation occurs (Carten JD, et al. 2011. doi:10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.09.010), as well as the presence of soluble lipid/cholesterol-binding proteins in the serum. As suggested by the reviewers, we also considered that foamy macrophages could be scavenging dead trypanosomes and damaged red blood cells, but we considered these stimuli triggers of a metabolic change leading to the foamy macrophage phenotype and did not consider these stimuli binders of the lipid dye for the reasons explained below.</p><p>Thus, in our study we considered both commonly used dyes, BODIPY 493/503 (labelling mostly CE) and BODIPY FLC5 (actively incorporated in TGA) and allowed them to accumulate in lipid rich cells for 20h. As expected, both dyes labelled lipid-rich organs (as previously shown in zebrafish, Carten JD, et al. 2011. doi:10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.09.010), and both were able to label the large, granular macrophages observed in the vessel of high-infected individuals (see figure 8 in manuscript and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Thus, we used these two labels to confirm that these cells are indeed foamy macrophages rich not only in TGA but also cholesterol. Nevertheless, a higher background was observed when using the neutral-lipid dye BODIPY 493/503, especially in serum of both, infected and non-infected individuals. The background staining was most likely due to the abundance of soluble neutral-lipids (including cholesterol) in the serum of young larvae to which the dye could directly bind. This background staining would not be seen when working with in vitro cell cultures, or with fixed tissues.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> we provide images of a control (PVP) and of a high-infected individual obtained after administration of BODIPY 493/503. In the vessel of the infected individual, accumulation of the dye in foamy macrophages is clearly visible (yellow arrowheads). In the vessel of non-infected individuals, BODIPY 493/503-negative leukocytes rolling on the vessel wall (blue arrowheads) are clearly visible, confirming the absence of staining of other cells residing in the blood stream and thus the specificity of staining for foamy macrophages.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64520-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>For the reasons mentioned above, and since BODIPY FLC5 can be incorporated into de novo TAG, dead parasites or damaged red blood cells that may have been phagocytosed may not contribute to de novo TGA synthesis and thus to the labelling in macrophages. Furthermore, if the dye would specifically bind to cell membranes (phospholipids), at 20h after BODIPY administration we should have observed a much higher background labelling in parasites or red blood cells circulating in the blood stream, or in parasites or cells surrounding the blood vessels, that was the case.In the revised figure 7 it is clearly visible that, except for endothelial cells, which are positively labelled by the Bodipy in all groups, only foamy macrophages in high-infected individuals are positive for the BODIPY FLC5, and none of the neighbouring (non-foamy) macrophages in the same individual, or in PVP or low-infected individuals, are positive for the dye. These observations now have been quantified in Figure 7C.</p><p>For all of the above reasons, we prefer to show in the paper the data obtained using the BODIPY FLC5 dye.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors report that foamy macrophages occurring in T. car-infected larvae are characterised by a strong pro-inflammatory profile and are all il1beta and all tnfa positive. Significant differences are observed in the inflammatory response of macrophages in high- and low-infected individuals and in their susceptibility to infection. Can the authors show that foamy macrophages are indeed more frequently il1b positive/tnfa positive than neighbouring non-foamy mpeg+ cells?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewers, in figure 9C of the revised manuscript, we now quantified the number of foamy and non-foamy macrophages being positive for <italic>Il1b</italic> or <italic>tnfa</italic>. The new data confirm that 100% of the foamy macrophages is positive for <italic>Il1b</italic> or <italic>tnfa</italic> and that high-infected individuals generally have a higher number of <italic>il1b</italic> or <italic>tnfa</italic> positive macrophages then low-infected or PVP individuals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors report that a strong inflammatory profile is associated with the occurrence of foamy macrophages. However, it is not clear how widely spread the inflammation is and only images of macrophages and endothelial cells in the cardinal vein are shown. Moreover, only tnfa and il1b are assessed (using transgenic reporters). The authors also mention that they observe a mild inflammatory response in low-infected individuals and that this is strongly associated with control of parasitaemia and survival to the infection. Can they confirm strong vs mild inflammatory profiles and different association with survival in the 2 infection categories and PVP control with a panel of qRT-PCR for several inflammatory markers (i.e. il1beta, tnfa and other relevant cytokines and chemokines)?</p></disp-quote><p>At the start of our study, prior to the provision of the <italic>tnfa</italic> and <italic>il1b</italic> transgenic lines, we had performed the gene expression analysis also suggested by the reviewers. However, based on the obtained results and the overall pattern of expression of <italic>tnfa:gfpF</italic> and <italic>il1b:gfpF</italic> in zebrafish larvae obtained later, we realized that measuring gene expression in <italic>whole larvae</italic> at this developmental stage may not be very sensitive in revealing (subtle) differences in inflammatory responses during infection. In fact, in fish as in mammals, expression of most immune genes of interest is not specific to immune cells only. For example, when the <italic>il1b:gfpF</italic> transgenic line was established by our collaborators (Nguyen-Chi et al. 2014, <italic>DMM</italic>; doi:10.1242/dmm.014498) it was shown that although GFP expression was highly inducible in cells of myeloid origin (macrophages and neutrophils), a generalized basal expression of <italic>il1b:gfp</italic> was detected in skin keratinocytes, neuromasts and gut enterocytes, all cell types in direct contact with the environment. Those data were supported by in situ hybridization and also by comparison with the ‘spontaneous expression of GFP in the Tg(NFκB:EGFP) reporter transgenic zebrafish line (Kanther and Rawls, 2010), which is in agreement with the well-known contribution of NF-κB to il1b induction (Ogryzko et al., 2014)’. Similar observations were made for the <italic>tnfa:gfpF</italic> line. Furthermore, in our study, we noticed that larvae older than 5 dpf (thus older than in the original study), show <italic>tnfa:gfpF</italic> and <italic>il1b:gfpF</italic> expression also in the developing haematopoietic organs (head kidney and spleen in the head region) and in endothelial cells of the caudal vein.</p><p>Taking all this into account we propose to provide the gene expression analysis data as supplementary figure (Figure 2-supplement 1) with the accompanying text. Lines 219-229.</p><p><italic>“</italic>A preliminary gene expression analysis of a panel of immune-related genes was performed on pools of larvae classified as high- or low-infected. […] For these reasons, taking advantage of the transparency of zebrafish larvae and of the established clinical scoring system, subsequent characterization of the inflammatory response to <italic>T. carassii</italic> infection, was performed on individual larvae, focusing on innate immune cells.”</p><p>To better address the first part of the question of the reviewers (“how widely spread the inflammation is”) we first would like to remind the reviewers that, besides the head region (where haematopoiesis takes place in the developing larvae), the majority of leukocytes in larval zebrafish are concentrated in the trunk and tail region, distributed along the two major blood vessels (dorsal aorta/caudal artery and posterior cardinal vein/caudal vein) including the tail tip loop. See also figure 4 in the manuscript and the examples provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> (4 dpi embryo, macrophages (red) and neutrophils (green)).Also relevant is that, for the images used in the main paper, to be able to reliably count macrophages and neutrophils, or to identify cytokine-expressing macrophages and their specific location (in/outside vessels), we had to work with confocal images acquired at 40x magnification, which explains why often only a small section of the caudal vein is shown.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64520-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We certainly agree that it is interesting to show how widely spread the inflammation is. To this end, in the revised manuscript we now provide an additional supplementary figure (S3 Fig) showing the widespread distribution of <italic>tnfa</italic>:GFP positive (<italic>tnfa</italic>:GFP+) cells in four subsequent locations, covering the entire trunk and tail region. As expected, <italic>tnfa</italic>:GFP+ leukocytes are distributed mostly along the major vessels in the trunk region, and along the tail tip loop and fin of the tail region. The images also show that not only the number of <italic>tnfa</italic>:GFP+ cells but also the intensity of their GFP signal is higher in high-infected individuals, compared to PVP or low-infected individuals, confirming a widely spread and higher inflammatory state in high-infected individuals. It may also be clear from these images that, as mentioned earlier, in zebrafish as in mammals, <italic>tnfa</italic> expression is not always exclusive to immune cells only. The widespread expression of <italic>tnfa</italic> in non-immune cells can have a confounding effect when it comes to measuring gene expression in whole larvae, we therefore think that (also) showing these images can be more informative than showing (only) gene expression. Imaging allows us to maximally take advantage of the zebrafish model to <italic>visualize</italic> and <italic>describe</italic> responses where they occur.Furthermore, based on the comments of the reviewers we realised that we indeed drew attention to the caudal vein, whereas the caudal vein is NOT the only vessel shown in our images. The dorsal aorta (DA) or caudal artery (CA) are right above the posterior cardinal vein (PCV) and caudal vein (CV), respectively and, depending on the orientation of the embryo and specific focus or zoom level shown, all are often visible in our images or in the supplementary videos. In the revised manuscript, whenever possible, and if it did not interfere with the clarity of the image (e.g Figure 2, 6, 7A etc.), we now also indicate the presence of the DA or CA, and when relevant, also refer to these vessels in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 1 diagram is very useful, but could be enhanced by inclusion of a representative quantification in an additional panel. For example, when injecting 200 T. carassii, what % of larvae is classified in the two infection categories? Could the authors also further discuss the % of T. low larvae where no parasites were observed during the clinical scoring? Have these larvae (or some of them) cleared the infection completely?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added a new graph to figure 2 (Figure 2F) showing the proportion of larvae allocated to each clinical score of a total of 350 larvae. In the corresponding Results section, we now mention that larvae with a score equal to 1, in which no parasites were observed using the second criterion (ratio of parasite:RBC in intersegmental capillary (ISC)), where still found to be infected when using the third criterion, extravasation. Thus, although parasites could not be seen in the ISC, they already extravasated to the tissue, indicating that at this point after infection larvae cannot clear the infection. We have further clarified this in the methods section of the revised manuscript and in the corresponding Results section of figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2: Is the clinical scoring predictive of early death onset (or likelihood of death)?

All high-infected individuals succumbed to the infection, whereas low-infected individuals had a high relative percent survival (82%) when compared to the PVP group. Of the low-infected individuals that were removed from the experiment, none displayed high parasitaemia, indicating that they did not succumb due to the infection. Instead, they showed developmental delays such as block in blood circulation, stunt growth, etc., similar to those observed in non-infected control individuals in the PVP group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Authors are discouraged from using the term macrophage/neutrophil proliferation In Figure 5 and Figure 6 and related text. Normally &quot;macrophage proliferation&quot; is used to refer to resident tissue macrophages that occasionally are seen to divide/proliferate. The authors are more likely detecting myelopoiesis (in agreement, Edu staining most commonly is seen in hematopoietic tissues) and the EdU staining in mature macrophages/neutrophils is the result of a (recent) cell division of a hematopoietic progenitor cell. In the absence of a more specific mechanistic insight, the use of much broader terms, such as &quot;increased production/number of macrophages/neutrophils&quot; rather than &quot;macrophage/neutrophil proliferation&quot;, is encouraged.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion, we have now amended the text and either refer to EdU+ or to (recently) divided neutrophils/macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors refer to the trypanosuceptible vs. trypanotolerant background of the host observed in non-zebrafish models. However, in this particular setting, all the larvae possess an identical genetic background. Therefore, why would the larvae behave differently in response to a similar pathogen? In addition, there is no clear differences in neither parasitic load at 2 dpi (figure 3F) nor myeloid cells accumulation at 3 dpi (figure 4AB), which could lead to a drastic difference in parasitic load based on mRNA expression at 4 dpi (figure 3F). The authors should discuss this shortly.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure whether we fully understand this comment of the reviewer, therefore we first would like to clarify the following points. Trypanosusceptible and trypanotolerant mice are inbred and therefore the response to trypanosomes infection will be very similar among individuals within each of these population/strains, but will be contrasted between the two mouse strains. Our zebrafish have indeed a similar genetic background because they come from the same parental line but they are <italic>not</italic> identical, therefore individual differences can and will occur in response to infections, as observed in the current study. Although the parasite load and myeloid cell number did not differ at 2 and 3 dpi, respectively, other factors can be different between individuals, likely due to genetic differences, and may account for part of the observed variation.</p><p>It was not our intention to draw attention to the genetic background of mice or zebrafish, but rather to the fact that by using transparent animals we were able to detect differences in response at the individual level. The contrasting responses in high- and low-infected zebrafish may resemble the contrasting responses in trypanosusceptible and trypanotolerant mice. We merely aimed to address the similarity in <italic>response</italic> rather than address genetic influences. To not confuse the future readership, we therefore removed the specific reference to trypanosusceptible and trypanotolerant mice and simply refer to the studies that have used these mice strains to elucidate the type of response considered beneficial or detrimental to the infection.

Also, representative picture of 7 hi-infected larvae seems to show at least equal or even more red fluorescence compared to 9 dpi low-infected larvae.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for such precise observation.
