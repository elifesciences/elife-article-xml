A single cysteine at position 328 in vimentin plays a crucial role in assembly, organisation, and stability of IFs. However, its exact function during epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression has not been investigated. To investigate this, we have transduced wildtype (WT) and C328S vimentin separately in MCF-7 cells that lack endogenous vimentin. The expression of C328-VIM impacted vimentin–actin interactions and induced EMT-like features that include enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion accompanied by reduced cell adhesion when compared to the wildtype cells. Functional transcriptomic studies confirmed the upregulation of EMT and mesenchymal markers, downregulation of epithelial markers, as well as acquisition of signatures associated with cancer stemness (<italic>CD56, POU5F1, PROCR,</italic> and <italic>CD49f</italic>), thus transforming MCF-7 cells from oestrogen-positive to triple-reduced (<italic>ESR1, PGR,</italic> and <italic>HER2</italic>) status. We also observed a stark increase in the expression of long non-coding RNA, <italic>XIST,</italic> in MCF-7 cells expressing C328-VIM. Targeting the mutant vimentin or <italic>XIST</italic> by RNA interference partially reversed the phenotypes in C328-VIM-expressing MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the introduction of C328-VIM cells into nude mice promoted tumour growth by increasing cancer stemness in an oestrogen-independent manner. Altogether, our studies provide insight into how cysteine 328 in vimentin dictates mechano-transduction signals to remodel actin cytoskeleton and protect against EMT and cancer growth via modulating lncRNA <italic>XIST</italic>. Therefore, targeting vimentin and/or <italic>XIST</italic> via RNA interference should be a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intermediate filaments</kwd><kwd>cancer stem cells</kwd><kwd>breast cancer signature</kwd><kwd>RNA interference</kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004681</institution-id><institution>Higher Education Commission, Pakistan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Usman</surname><given-names>Saima</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01DE024381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yeudall</surname><given-names>William Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Disruption of vimentin–actin interaction induces <italic>XIST</italic> expression and drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stem cell-like traits in breast cancer cells, enhancing oncogenic behaviour in nude mice independent of oestrogen.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein normally expressed in mesenchymal cells. Due to its diverse pathophysiological role(s), it is one of the most extensively studied IFs. It has been proposed to play a role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Usman et al., 2021</xref>). It is a structurally dynamic protein active in cell mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Patteson et al., 2020</xref>), normal positioning of cell organelles, nuclear and DNA integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Danielsson et al., 2018</xref>), stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mónico et al., 2019</xref>), autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Surolia and Antony, 2022</xref>), cell proliferation, migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), adhesion, invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), signalling, angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ridge et al., 2022</xref>). The complete crystal structure of vimentin is still not available; however, crystal structures of small segments have been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Strelkov et al., 2002</xref>). Structurally, vimentin monomer has a central α-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains on each side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chernyatina et al., 2012</xref>). Studies have described its polymerisation in which monomers assemble in parallel to form dimers, with two dimers assembling in antiparallel to form tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>). Eight tetramers combine to form unit length filaments (ULFs) that further assemble head to tail into 10 nm compact mature filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nunes Vicente et al., 2022</xref>). IFs lack polarity and in mature filaments subunits continue to assemble at both ends, and they can be exchanged anywhere along the whole filament length, a process that requires ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robert et al., 2015</xref>). Vimentin directly interacts with actin through its tail domain to maintain mechanical integrity of the cell and cytoskeletal crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Esue et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Vimentin has a single cysteine residue at position 328 in the rod domain, which is reported to be a stress sensor induced by oxidants and electrophiles, resulting in its zinc-mediated modifications and consequently disassembly or rearrangement of filaments as a stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mónico et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pérez-Sala et al., 2015</xref>). Different modifications of C328 that have been reported during cellular senescence, rheumatoid arthritis, cataract, and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Viedma-Poyatos et al., 2020</xref>). Any mutation or modification in C328 can hamper the intracellular stress response of vimentin. As a result, multiple cellular functions can be disrupted due to the inability of the cell to sense and respond to stress. Therefore, this residue has been reported to have widespread pathophysiological implications and is considered a flash point for stress ignition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Viedma-Poyatos et al., 2020</xref>). Although the role of vimenetin C328 in response to cellular stress has been studied in some detail, its role in regulating EMT, tumour growth, and progression has not been studied.</p><p>To investigate the functional implications of vimentin residue C328 in regulating EMT, cancer progression, and stemness, we expressed C328S vimentin in MCF-7 cells, a vimentin-deficient cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Usman et al., 2022a</xref>) commonly employed to study EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guttilla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kondaveeti et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings reveal that C328S-VIM altered cell morphology with disorganised F-actin and induced EMT and cancer stem cell characteristics. A highly significant observation was the upregulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), <italic>XIST,</italic> in C328S-VIM-expressing MCF-7 cells, which are normally oestrogen-dependent for tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soule and McGrath, 1980</xref>), becoming oestrogen-independent by C328S-VIM in nude mice. We show that C328S-VIM can trigger an EMT programme and enhance stemness in MCF-7 cells, in part via <italic>XIST</italic> upregulation. These findings have far-reaching implications, particularly considering the numerous vimentin variants reported in the vicinity of the C328 residue in several solid tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Usman et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>C328S mutant vimentin affects interaction with actin in silico and F-actin formation in cells</title><p>We selected MCF-7, a simple epithelial breast carcinoma cell line, which lacks endogenous vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Usman et al., 2022a</xref>), and transduced it with the full-length vimentin (wildtype, WT-VIM/pLPChygro-VIM) and the mutant vimentin (mutant, C328S-VIM/pLPChygro-C328S-VIM) retroviruses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The immunostaining with mouse anti-vimentin V9 (referred to as V9 from now on) followed by AF-488-labelled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody showed normal appearing polymerised IFs in A431 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, compare a–c with d–f</xref>). This shows that C328S-VIM retains its ability to polymerise into filaments both in A431 and MCF-7 cells; however, in MCF-7 these filaments were drastically reorganised, affecting the cell shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, to confirm that C328S-VIM does not disrupt pre-existing vimentin filaments (dominant negative), we transduced HFF-1 and MCF-7 cells expressing WT vimentin with either untagged C328S-VIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, g–l</xref>) or AcGFP fused with C328S-VIM at its N-terminus (AcGFP-C328S-VIM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, m–r</xref>). Cells were immunostained with V9 antibody. Our data showed that both untagged and AcGFP-C328S-VIM constructs were not dominant negative as they did not disturb the pre-existing filaments and appeared to integrate into the pre-existing network. However, the limitation of using the V9 antibody was that it detected both endogenous vimentin and C328S-VIM.</p><p>Next, to assess the impact of the C328S mutation on vimentin’s interaction with actin, in silico structural analysis was conducted for both the WT and mutant vimentin proteins. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) file corresponding to the wildtype vimentin (PDB ID: P08670) was obtained from the RCSB PDB database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/">https://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>). The specific mutation of interest, C328S, which replaces the cysteine residue at position 328 with a serine, was introduced into the WT structure, and energy minimisation steps were performed for best rotor fit to optimise the geometry of the mutant protein and resolve any steric clashes or unfavourable conformations resulting from the mutation. Subsequent structural simulation analyses were performed to evaluate the interactions between vimentin (both WT and C328S) and actin. These analyses focused on key binding sites, interaction energy, and potential structural changes caused by the C328S substitution. It should be noted that the thiol group of C328 enables specific hydrogen bonding and potential disulphide-mediated interactions with actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">González-Jiménez et al., 2023</xref>). The computational results revealed that the C328S mutation induced alterations within the coiled-coil rod domain of vimentin, particularly in regions critical for actin binding. The substitution of cysteine with serine likely altered the conformation of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, thus weakening the overall binding affinity of the mutant vimentin for actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To further test this, we investigated C328S mutation-mediated structural changes in the cytoskeleton by staining these cells with Phalloidin that selectively labels F-actin. Quantification of stress fibre/F-actin staining pattern as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham-Chakim et al., 2013</xref>) confirmed that actin morphology and organisation was altered with low-level F-actin/stress fibre staining with aggregates/fragments at the cortical margins of the cells. No stress fibres were observed in the centres of the cells in C328S-VIM-expressing cells compared with high-level F-actin/stress fibre staining in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2; compare A with B</xref>). These data show that C328S-VIM when expressed in MCF-7 cells alters cell morphology through remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>C328S-VIM impacts cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration by altering MCF-7 cell morphology</title><p>To compare the effect of C328S-VIM on the MCF-7 cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), cells were fixed and stained with CellMask Deep Red dye and counterstained nuclei with DAPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Different cell morphological features, such as nuclear perimeter, cell diameter, nucleus/cell area, cell major axis, cell major axis angle, and cell minor axis, were analysed. C328S-VIM-expressing MCF-7 cells showed more cellular projections when compared to WT and analysis of nuclear area, nuclear form factor, nuclear major axis, nuclear minor axis, cell area, cell diameter, cell perimeter, cell minor axis, cell major axis, and cell form factor were significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), while the nucleus/cell area ratio and cell compactness were significantly decreased in cells expressing C328S-VIM in comparison to WT-VIM-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results indicate that the expression of C328S-VIM significantly altered nuclear and cell perimeter as evident by more ruffled margins in MCF-7 cells. Next, we investigated the rate of proliferation between WT and C328S cells by colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>), MTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), and CyQUANT proliferation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The analyses showed a highly significant increase in cell proliferation and mitochondrial activity in C328S compared to WT cells. Furthermore, C328S-VIM-expressing MCF-7 cells showed reduced adhesion without substrate coating on the culture vessel as determined by the CyQUANT cell adhesion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). However, when the tissue culture plates were coated with different substrates such as laminin, fibronectin, and collagen, there was no significant difference in cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). The chemotactic migration of the cells towards foetal calf serum (FCS) through 8 µm pore size culture inserts showed the number of cells migrating through the membrane was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in C328S compared with the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>). Similarly, the invasive capacity of the two cell lines was compared by coating the 8 µm pore size culture inserts with Matrigel. The results indicated a significantly higher number of cells invading through Matrigel in C328S-VIM (p&lt;0.05) compared with the WT-VIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M and N</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of C328S-VIM on cell morphology, proliferation, adhesion, and invasion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Morphology of MCF-7-expressing WT-VIM and C328S-VIM in brightfield (scale bar = 100 µm).

Collectively these results imply that C328S-VIM in MCF-7 induces EMT-like characteristics and increases cancer stemness.</p><p>To confirm the expression of breast cancer stem cell markers identified as being differentially expressed in RNA-Seq analysis, FACS analysis was performed. Cells were stained for surface antigens with RY586–conjugated antibody specific for CD56/NCAM1, APC-conjugated antibody specific for CD201/PROCR, and the viability stain FVS575V was used for detecting the live cells.

Data analysis using FlowJo v10 confirmed significant upregulation of breast cancer stem cell markers CD56/NCAM1 and CD201/PROCR in C328S-VIM-expressing MCF-7 cells. MFI of CD56 and CD201 in C328S-VIM cells was significantly higher (p&lt;0.0001) compared with WT-VIM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L–N</xref>).</p><p>Next, to examine tumorigenic potential in vivo, we injected WT and C328S cells subcutaneously and bilaterally into the flanks of 6-week-old female athymic nu/nu mice. C328S cells were able to produce tumours without oestrogen; however, WT cells did not produce any tumour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O and P</xref>). These results confirm the tumorigenic potential of C328S-VIM that is oestrogen independent. Furthermore, to investigate breast cancer stem cell markers expression, routine H&amp;E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q</xref>) and immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R</xref>) were performed on the tumour tissue sections for CD56 and CD201 expression, respectively.

It has a single cysteine residue at position 328 that is considered a preferred site for post-translational modifications, and it is currently being intensely investigated due to its involvement in multiple cell functions, including filament assembly, cell polarity, elongation, and stress response to electrophiles and oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Viedma-Poyatos et al., 2020</xref>). In spite of its likely importance in cellular physiology, the role of C328 in cancer progression and in determining the cancer stem cell phenotype has not been investigated before.</p><p>To investigate the significance of C328 in EMT and cancer, we made a mutant encoding a C328S substitution in vimentin (C328S-VIM) and transduced in MCF-7 cells, which are devoid of endogenous vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Usman et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sivagurunathan et al., 2022</xref>), and are widely used as a model to study EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guttilla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kondaveeti et al., 2015</xref>). Structurally, the two amino acids, cysteine and serine, are similar except an electronegative sulphur atom (atomic radius 0.88 A<sup>o</sup>) in cysteine was replaced by another electronegative oxygen atom (atomic radius 0.48 A<sup>o</sup>) in serine. Although both atoms are electronegative, oxygen is slightly more electronegative (EN = 3.44) than sulphur (EN = 2.58). These seemingly minor differences were unlikely to cause major structural perturbations, so we were surprised when in silico simulations demonstrated that C328S substitution was likely to affect interactions between actin and vimentin. These computational predictions were confirmed by our immunofluorescence analyses of F-actin in C328S cells. Whereas WT vimentin-expressing cells showed normal stress fibres with no fragments or aggregates, in contrast C328S-VIM cells expressed aggregated and fragmented F-actin which was limited to the cortical margins of the cells with no stress fibre formation. These observations highlight the critical interactions of the rod domain of vimentin at C328 with actin that have never been reported, although earlier studies have demonstrated direct binding of the tail domain of vimentin with actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Esue et al., 2006</xref>). It has recently been reported that C328 of vimentin modifies actin organisation in response to oxidants and electrophiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">González-Jiménez et al., 2023</xref>). Our data support these findings and suggest that a local perturbation at C328 (in this case by C328S substitution) can disrupt actin organisation even when cells are not exposed to oxidants and electrophiles. These observations have widespread implications, including cytoskeletal crosstalk, that regulates cell behaviour, especially during cancer development, progression, and spread.</p><p>Our data show that the C328S mutation in vimentin can change the overall morphology of MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Earlier studies have implicated vimentin filaments in the maintenance of cell shape and increasing vimentin levels are positively related to a mesenchymal elongated phenotype and EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mendez et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, we have recently shown that the ectopic expression of the wildtype vimentin in MCF-7 can make them less elongated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Usman et al., 2022a</xref>). A possible explanation for these conflicting reports may be that cancer cells can express a wide spectrum of morphologies depending upon inducing factor and stage of EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leggett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>). As the C328S substitution in vimentin has increased the nuclear size and made the MCF-7 cells more rounded compared to WT vimentin, it is possible that the C328 residue may be an active player in vimentin-linked cell phenotypic changes since downregulation of the mutant vimentin significantly reversed the morphological changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that the expression of WT vimentin in MCF-7 induces cell migration without affecting proliferation or cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Usman et al., 2022a</xref>). Here we show that C328S-VIM enhances cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and reduces cell adhesion, which are features closely associated with EMT-mediated cancer metastasis. Some of these changes could be reversed by RNAi-mediated downregulation of vimentin establishing a direct link between residue 328 of vimentin, or perhaps the surrounding region, in cancer progression, which is a novel finding. The increase in malignant characteristics of C328S cells implies that the original cysteine residue in vimentin acts as a tumour suppressor. In addition, our RNA-Seq, RT-qPCR, and western blot analyses showed upregulation of EMT-associated transcription factors (ZEB1, SNAI2, LEF1, ZEB2, TWIST1, TWIST2) and mesenchymal markers (CDH2, MMP2, FOXC2, FNDC1), as well as downregulation of epithelial markers (cytokeratins, CDH1, CLDN1, EPCAM), indicating possible EMT induction in C328S cells. There are three major keratins, including K8 (type II), K18, and K19 (both type I), that are expressed in MCF-7, and since all of them were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), a central mechanism involved in the expression of all three keratins is likely to be affected by C328-VIM. One such mechanism is the involvement of transcription factor AP-1, which participates in the regulation of most keratin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blumenberg, 2000</xref>). AP-1 is a complex of multiple different subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2021</xref>), but our transcriptomic analysis suggests that none of these are affected by C328S-VIM (DEG lists provided in the supplementary material). It is therefore conceivable that C328S-VIM could suppress AP-1 activity, thereby switching off keratin gene expression. Further investigations are required to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Multiple breast cancer stem cell markers such as <italic>POU5F1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vezzoni and Parmiani, 2008</xref>), <italic>CD56</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moghbeli et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>CD49f</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), and <italic>CD201/PROCR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hwang-Verslues et al., 2009</xref>) were also upregulated by C328-VIM, demonstrating increased stemness characteristics in MCF-7 cells as judged by the RNA-Seq analysis. Higher expression of the two stem cell markers, CD56 and CD201, was further validated by flow cytometry and also observed in vivo. RNA-Seq analysis also showed that MCF-7, which is a triple-positive (expression of ESR1, PGR, and HER2) cell line, became triple reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Usman et al., 2021</xref>) in the presence of the C328S-VIM. Breast oncologists broadly stratify breast cancers into triple positive, borderline, and triple negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Orrantia-Borunda et al., 2022</xref>), which is indicative of their susceptibility to metastasise and their clinical course. Triple-positive breast cancers have a relatively good prognosis, followed by borderline and triple-negative lesions having by far the worst prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Orrantia-Borunda et al., 2022</xref>). We have previously shown that wildtype vimentin does not affect the expression of these receptors in MCF-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Usman et al., 2022a</xref>). In the present study, however, C328S-VIM makes MCF-7, a triple-positive cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Comşa et al., 2015</xref>), into triple reduced, which has important clinical implications. It also suggests that a mechanism exists whereby disruption of molecular interactions between vimentin and actin caused by C328S, directly or indirectly, regulates the expression of these receptors, cancer progression, and metastasis.</p><p>The gene most upregulated by the C328S vimentin, as found in the RNA-Seq analysis, which is a long non-coding RNA <italic>XIST,</italic> is known to induce proliferation, invasion, and inhibit apoptosis in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zong et al., 2020</xref>). It is also reported to be upregulated in multiple solid tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Madhi and Kim, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). A recent study has unveiled its gatekeeping role in human mammary epithelium homeostasis, especially the differentiation aspect in human mammary stem cells (MaSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richart et al., 2022</xref>). It therefore appears, based on our observations, that the vimentin C328S mutation is inducing EMT-like changes via <italic>XIST</italic> upregulation as downregulation of <italic>XIST</italic> in C328S cells significantly reduced proliferation and invasion.</p><p>A highly significant and interesting observation was that the presence of C328S-VIM in MCF-7, which are oestrogen-dependent tumorigenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soule and McGrath, 1980</xref>), made these cells oestrogen-independent in nude mice that further supports our in vitro data that C328S substitution had enhanced cancer stemness in MCF-7 cells. Expression of breast cancer stem cell markers CD56 and CD201 was evident in mouse tumours. These data suggest that the C328 in vimentin is an important regulator of cancer cell behaviour and that alterations in this region of the protein promote EMT-like changes and may induce metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Recently, wildtype vimentin has been shown to increase malignant progression in lung cancer. However, our data suggest that wildtype vimentin is non-tumorigenic in breast cancer, inferring that the effect of vimentin in cancer may be tissue specific, which has never been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berr et al., 2023</xref>). Previous studies have described the importance of the C328 residue in filament assembly and organisation, stress response, aggresome formation, and lysosomal positioning only in SW13/cl.2 vimentin-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pérez-Sala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Viedma-Poyatos et al., 2020</xref>). However, the use of SW13/cl.2 cell model may not be appropriate to study the role of C328-VIM in EMT because these cells do not express any IFs. For a cancer cell to undergo EMT, it must be an epithelial cancer cell-expressing keratin. In that respect, the use of MCF-7 in this study is most appropriate because it does not express endogenous vimentin. As mutations in vimentin have been reported in patients around the area of C328 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Usman et al., 2021</xref>), our hypothesis that this mutation induces conformational changes that activate the complex processes of EMT in breast cancer cells would have clinical implications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and cell lines</title><p>MCF-7, A431, and HFF cells were obtained from the cell bank of Cancer Research UK and characterised by the expression of key biomarkers using immunocytochemistry and reverse transcription (RT)/quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).

The strong correlation between the single cysteine residue at position 328 in vimentin with actin organisation, <italic>XIST</italic> induction, and hyperproliferation associated with breast oncogenesis is novel. This suggests that C328 in vimentin remodels actin cytoskeleton and protects against EMT and cancer growth via modulating lncRNA, <italic>XIST</italic>. Taken together, we propose that targeting vimentin via RNA interference should be considered a therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All transplantation experiments were carried out at Augusta University under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol number 2015-0736, in animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL2) conditions.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of upregulated genes (cut off padj =0.00009).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104191-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>List of downregulated genes (cut off padj =0.00009).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104191-supp2-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>List of upregulated lnRNAs (cut off padj =0.00009).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104191-supp3-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>List of downregulated lnRNAs (cut off padj =0.00009).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104191-supp4-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>List of primers used for qPCR.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104191-supp5-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>List of primary and secondary antibodies used in this research work.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104191-supp6-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp7"><label>Supplementary file 7.</label><caption><title>List of primers used for making <italic>XIST</italic> shRNA constructs and site-directed mutagenesis at C328 and Y117.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104191-supp7-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-104191-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files; source data files have been provided in supplementary files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are thankful to the Centre of Oral Immunobiology and Regenerative Medicine and the Blizard Institute for providing the research facilities necessary for this work.

They model the binding between vimentin and actin in silico to demonstrate the potential involvement of C238, due to its location in a rod domain known to bind beta-actin. The phenotype of a non-metastatic breast cancer cell line MCF7, which doesn't express vimentin, could be changed to a metastatic phenotype when mutant C238S vimentin, but not wild-type vimentin, was expressed in the cells. Expression of vimentin was confirmed at the level of mRNA, protein and microscopically. Patterns of expression of vimentin and actin reflected the distinct morphology of the two cell lines. Phenotypic changes were assessed through assay of cell adhesion, proliferation, migration and morphology and were consistent with greater metastatic potential in the C238S MCF7 cells. Changes in the transcriptome of MCF7 cells expressing wild-type and C238S vimentins were compared and expression of Xist long ncRNA was found to be the transcript most markedly increased in the metastatic cells expressing C238S vimentin. Moreover changes in expression of many other genes in the C238S cells are consistent with an epithelial mesenchymal transition. Tumourigenic potential of MCF7 cells carrying C238S but not wild-type, vimentin was confirmed by inoculation of cells into nude mice. This assay is a measure of stem-cell quality of the cells and not a measure of metastasis. It does demonstrate phenotypic changes that could be linked to metastasis.</p><p>shRNA was used to down-regulate vimentin or Xist in the MCF7 C238S cells. The description of the data is limited in parts and data sets require careful scrutiny to understand the full picture. Down-regulation of vimentin reversed the morphological changes to some degree, but down-regulation of Xist didn't. Conversely down-regulation of Xist inhibited cell growth, a sign of reversing metastatic potential, but down-regulation of vimentin had no effect on growth. Down-regulation of either did inhibit cell migration, another sign of metastatic reversal. Most of these findings are consistent with previous work based on ectopic expression of wild-type vimentin in MCF7 cells, but the mechanism of inhibition of cell migration by downregulation of Xist remains speculative. More complete knockdown of vimentin or Xist by CRISPR technology may be helpful.</p><p>Overall the study describes an intriguing model of metastasis that is worthy of further investigation, especially at the molecular level to unravel the connection between vimentin and metastasis. The identification of a potential role for Xist in metastasis, beyond its normal role in female cells to inactivate one of the X chromosomes, corroborates the work of others demonstrating increased levels in a variety of tumours in women and even in some tumours in men. It would be of great interest to see where in metastatic cells Xist is expressed and what it binds to.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The revised manuscript incorporates changes in presentation of the data modelling interaction between the region of vimentin including C238 and F-actin. There is also inclusion of an extra citation supporting the role for Xist in cancer stem cell differentiation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104191.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Usman</surname><given-names>Saima</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre for Oral Immunobiology and Regenerative Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yeudall</surname><given-names>William Andrew</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Oral Biology and Diagnostic Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Augusta</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Teh</surname><given-names>Muy-Teck</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ghloum</surname><given-names>Fatemah</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre for Oral Immunobiology and Regenerative Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tummala</surname><given-names>Hemanth</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre for Genomics and Child Health</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Waseem</surname><given-names>Ahmad</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Queen Mary University of London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary, and Strengths:</p><p>The authors and their team have investigated the role of Vimentin Cysteine 328 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumorigenesis. Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament, and cysteine 328 is a crucial site for interactions between vimentin and actin. These interactions can significantly influence cell movement, proliferation, and invasion. The team has specifically examined how Vimentin Cysteine 328 affects cancer cell proliferation, the acquisition of stemness markers, and the upregulation of the non-coding RNA XIST. Additionally, functional assays were conducted using both wild-type (WT) and Vimentin Cysteine 328 mutant cells to demonstrate their effects on invasion, EMT, and cancer progression. Overall, the data supports the essential role of Vimentin Cysteine 328 in regulating EMT, cancer stemness, and tumor progression. Overall, the data and its interpretation are on point and support the hypothesis. I believe the manuscript has great potential.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors are thankful to the reviewers for carefully reading the manuscript and evaluating the data to make positive comments and supporting our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Minor issues are related to the visibility and data representation in Figures 2E and 3 A-F</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the figures (Figure 2E and Figure 3A-F) to increase the data visibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>The aim of the investigation was to find out more about the mechanism(s) by which the structural protein vimentin can facilitate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells.</p><p>The authors focussed on a key amino acid of vimentin, C238, its role in the interaction between vimentin and actin microfilaments, and the downstream molecular and cellular consequences. They model the binding between vimentin and actin in silico to demonstrate the potential involvement of C238, but the outcome is described vaguely.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the discussion of these results in the manuscript to more explicitly describe the critical role of C238 in the vimentin-actin interaction. Specifically, we highlight that C238 lies within a region of the vimentin rod domain known to mediate key protein-protein interactions. Our modeling shows that the thiol group of C238 enables specific hydrogen bonding and potential disulfide-mediated interactions with actin, which are disrupted upon mutation to serine. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the functional importance of this residue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The phenotype of a non-metastatic breast cancer cell line MCF7, which doesn't express vimentin, could be changed to a metastatic phenotype when mutant C238S vimentin, but not wild-type vimentin, was expressed in the cells. Expression of vimentin was confirmed at the level of mRNA, protein, and microscopically. Patterns of expression of vimentin and actin reflected the distinct morphology of the two cell lines. Phenotypic changes were assessed through assay of cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and morphology and were consistent with greater metastatic potential in the C238S MCF7 cells. Changes in the transcriptome of MCF7 cells expressing wild-type and C238S vimentins were compared and expression of Xist long ncRNA was found to be the transcript most markedly increased in the metastatic cells expressing C238S vimentin. Moreover changes in expression of many other genes in the C238S cells are consistent with an epithelial mesenchymal transition. Tumourigenic potential of MCF7 cells carrying C238S but not wild-type, vimentin was confirmed by inoculation of cells into nude mice. This assay is a measure of the stem-cell quality of the cells and not a measure of metastasis. It does demonstrate phenotypic changes that could be linked to metastasis.</p><p>shRNA was used to down-regulate vimentin or Xist in the MCF7 C238S cells. The description of the data is limited in parts and data sets require careful scrutiny to understand the full picture. Down-regulation of vimentin reversed the morphological changes to some degree, but down-regulation of Xist didn't.</p></disp-quote><p>This is understandable given the fact that vimentin interacts with actin which is known to determine cell shape. <italic>XIST</italic> being a non-coding RNA will not have the same effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conversely, down-regulation of <italic>XIST</italic> inhibited cell growth, a sign of reversing metastatic potential, but down-regulation of vimentin had no effect on growth.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>XIST</italic> is known to get induced in a number of cancers (see Figure 3E) which is consistent with our observation that its downregulation will inhibit cell growth. However, downregulation of vimentin had no effect on growth which is consistent with our previously published observation that ectopic expression of wildtype vimentin in MCF-7 cells did not influence cell growth (Usman et al Cells 2022, 11(24), 4035; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11244035">https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11244035</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Down-regulation of either did inhibit cell migration, another sign of metastatic reversal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously shown that ectopic expression of wildtype vimentin in MCF-7 stimulate cell migration due to downregulation of CDH5 (endothelial cadherins) (Usman et al Cells 2022, 11(24), 4035). Therefore, downregulation of vimentin is expected to inhibit cell migration which is what we observed in this study. Why downregulation of <italic>XIST</italic> inhibited cell migration is not clear. It is conceivable that <italic>XIST</italic> downregulation affects Lamin expression which may suppress intercellular interactions to increase cell migration. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that vimentin expression in MCF-7 affects Lamin expression (Usman et al Cells 2022, 11(24), 4035).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The interpretation of this type of experiment is handicapped when full reversal of expression is not achieved, as was the case in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Full reversal of any biological effect is almost impossible to achieve which is because the shRNAs by nature are not 100% effective. This can however be tested using crispr Cas 9 gene editing to completely knockdown a protein (can’t be used for <italic>XIST</italic> as it is a non-coding RNA). In that case one has to assume that it will have no off-target effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall the study describes an intriguing model of metastasis that is worthy of further investigation, especially at the molecular level to unravel the connection between vimentin and metastasis. The identification of a potential role for Xist in metastasis, beyond its normal role in female cells to inactivate one of the X chromosomes, corroborates the work of others demonstrating increased levels in a variety of tumours in women and even in some tumours in men. It would be of great interest to see where in metastatic cells Xist is expressed and what it binds to.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors fully agree that it is an interesting model of metastasis/oncogenesis that requires further investigation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
