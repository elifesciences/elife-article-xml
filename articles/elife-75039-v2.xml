the peroxisomal membrane. Dysfunction of ALDP leads to peroxisomal metabolic disorder exemplified by X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Hundreds of ALD-causing mutations have been identified on ALDP. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of these mutations are restricted to clinical description due to limited structural and biochemical characterization. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human ALDP with nominal resolution at 3.4 Å. ALDP exhibits a cytosolic-facing conformation. Compared to other lipid ATP-binding cassette transporters, ALDP has two substrate binding cavities formed by the transmembrane domains. Such structural organization may be suitable for the coordination of VLCFAs. Based on the structure, we performed integrative analysis of the cellular trafficking, protein thermostability, ATP hydrolysis, and the transport activity of representative mutations. These results provide a framework for understanding the working mechanism of ALDP and pathogenic roles of disease-associated mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ALDP</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>mutations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3217110084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Guanghui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32130081</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Guanghui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32100759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ying</surname><given-names>Zhengxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005236</institution-id><institution>Chinese Universities Scientific Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15050004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Guanghui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005236</institution-id><institution>Chinese Universities Scientific Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15051002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Guanghui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005236</institution-id><institution>Chinese Universities Scientific Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15050017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Guanghui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Cryo-EM structural and biochemical analysis provides a framework for understanding the working mechanism of ALDP.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an inherited disease characterized by progressive demyelination of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2014</xref>).

Pathogenesis of ALD is tightly associated with mutations on the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP), which transports very-long-chain fatty acid-CoAs (VLCFA-CoAs) from cytosol into the peroxisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mosser et al., 1993</xref>).

ALDP, also known as ABCD1, belongs to the ATP-binding cassette sub-family D.

To address these questions, we first performed ATP hydrolysis assay using purified ALDP. In the presence of C22:0-CoA, ALDP exhibits robust ATP hydrolysis with the V<sub>max</sub> of ~193 ± 8.2 mol Pi min<sup>−1</sup> mol<sup>−1</sup> protein and K<sub>m</sub> value of ~0.17 µM C22:0-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The structure of human ALDP reveals an assembly of two identical subunits that exhibit a domain-swapped arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Each subunit contains six transmembrane helices (TMs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A short helix located at the peroxisomal side (extracellular helix [EH]) is a featured structural element of ALDP based on sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Two coiled-coil domain-like densities at the C-terminus were observed (C-terminal helix [CH]). The local resolution of these densities is estimated to be ~4.0 Å, which is not accurate to build an atomic model.</p><p>During submission of this study, four other groups independently reported ALDP structures in different states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Le et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Our structure is the ligand-free state as no substrates were supplemented during purification. We observed two unknown densities at the crevice of TMDs, which were also reported in the ligand-free structure by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2022</xref>. When superimposed to the oleoyl-CoA- or C22:0-CoA-bound structures, the unknown densities partially overlap with the substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Such observation indicates a probable extrusion of the unknown densities during substrate loading. Structure comparison of our structure with the C22:0-CoA-bound and ATP-bound structure reveals dramatic conformational changes during the transport cycle. For instance, the distance between TM4 and TM6 at the juxta-membrane region changes from 23.6 Å to 13.1 Å upon substrate binding and further gets closed to 5.7 Å in the presence of ATP. The nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) undergo continuously spatial rearrangement. Consequently, the TM4-6 and TM1-2 bend to open the peroxisomal side exit for substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Conformational change of TMDs is accompanied with the movement of NBDs and the disappearance of EH or CH.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Conformational changes of adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) during the whole transport cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural alignments of ALDP in ligand-free, C22:0-CoA-bound (7VZB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2022</xref>), and ATP-bound states (7SHM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).

Among these 232 residues, 88 harbor mutations to two or more types of amino acids, which we defined as hotspot residues. Based on the structural mapping, the 88 hotspot residues can be roughly classified into 3 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The first group of 10 residues lines along the substrate-binding cavity. These residues likely play a role in substrate coordination and delivery.

These mutations include W339R, S342P, G343V, A396T, Q544R, and T693M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Imamura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kemp et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Watkins et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wichers et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, to evaluate the role of different structure elements, we designed four constructs based on structural changes. The S164/Y310 residues on TMDs, anchored by a hydrogen bond, both move quite large distance during the transport cycle but remain relatively static distance between themselves. The E291/R518 residues are mapped to the interface between TMD and NBD. The side chain of E291 stretches into the NBD of another protomer, while R518 binds to the α-phosphate of ATP. These two pairs of residues represent two kinds of dimeric interfaces. We mutated these residues into alanine to examine how disturbance of the dimeric assembly affects the activity. Another two constructs are truncation of EH (Δ364–374) or CH (Δ683–745).</p><p>We first measured the VLCFA-CoA transport. Different mutations are individually expressed in HEK293 cells. The cytosolic C22:0-CoA, C24:0-CoA, and C26:0-CoA were measured by quantitative mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), and the transport ability was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Because the substrate transport is coupled with ATP hydrolysis, we also measured the ATPase activity of these mutants using purified proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the mutants may alter the cellular localization and thermostability compared to wild-type (WT), we investigated their subcellular localization and measured the T<sub>m</sub> values of purified proteins. Compared with A95D, a disease-causing mutation known to not colocalize with peroxisome and reduce the C24:0 β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morita et al., 2013</xref>), all the selected mutants show puncta distribution and colocalize with catalase, suggesting their normal trafficking to the peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The similar T<sub>m</sub> values of purified mutant proteins rule out the instability-caused functional abrogation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The transport activity and the ATP hydrolysis of the mutants are normalized to WT. All six disease-derived mutants exhibit decreased transport toward three species of VLCFA-CoA. Five mutants show abrogated ATP hydrolysis except for the mutation S342P. The ALD mutation T693M is mapped on the CH. Because the CH cannot be observed in the ATP-bound state, to evaluate the potential pathogenic role of the T693M mutant, we generated the homomeric model of ALDP by AlphaFold (hereafter as AF-model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evans et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). The predicted model of ALDP displays similar conformation to the ATP-bound state. Albeit the part of CH in AF-model needs further validation, the prediction may provide potential clues for interpreting the T693M mutation at the current stage. In the AF-model, T693 is located near W664, which is surrounded by ALD mutants on the NBD. The distance between the side chains of T693 and W664 can reach in 3.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Replacement of Thr by Met residue with large side chain may affect the neighboring residues near W664 to disturb the ATP hydrolysis. For the four designed constructs, alanine substitution of S164/Y310 and E291/R518 has negligible influence on the ATP hydrolysis. By contrast, the lipid transport decreased because destabilization of the interaction between these residues may disturb the conformational changes during substrate translocation. As one featured structural element, deletion of the EH (Δ364–374) may generate structural constraints between TM5 and TM6 during the conformational change of ALDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Le et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Truncation of CH (Δ683–745) does not change the assembly of NBD but affects the conformational changes between the two protomers, thus the ATP hydrolysis level slightly decreased with abrogated lipid transport.</p><p>To gain insights into the transport of different lipids by ABC transporters, we compared ALDP with the phospholipid transporter ABCB4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nosol et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olsen et al., 2020</xref>). Typically, ALDP harbors two substrate-binding pockets that expand perpendicularly to the membrane, but ABCB4 binds one phosphatidylcholine (PC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). The dimension of one binding pocket is ~1695 Å<sup>3</sup> for C22:0-CoA and ~1236 Å<sup>3</sup> for PC calculated by ProteinPlus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schöning-Stierand et al., 2020</xref>). The different formulas between VLCFA-CoA and PC may provide clues for the different cavities. Regardless of the flexibility, the length of C22:0-CoA (~55 Å) is larger than PC (~40 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). The PC molecule has two acyl tails that can be coordinated by ABCB4. The VLCFAs have only one hydrophobic tail. More residues in a larger binding pocket of ALDP may help in stabilizing the flexible long tail of VLCFA-CoA. The EH and CH facilitate conformational changes to expand the binding pocket. Taken together, the integrative characterization of ALDP provides a framework to illustrate the molecular basis of VLCFA transport and the function of ALD-derived mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The coding sequence of human <italic>ALDP</italic> was subcloned into the pFastBac1 vector with a N-terminal Flag tag.

participates in the transport of free very long-chain fatty acids and their CoA esters across the peroxisomal membrane. By determining the cryo EM structure of human ABCD1 the study represents a valuable insight into its transport mechanism and the mechanistic basis for mutations causing the severe neurodegenerative disorder, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including David Drew as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Konstantinos Beis (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The modelled two putative Co-A esters lack the positively charged residues for coordinating phosphates. Indeed, the Co-A binding in the human ABCD1 structure by Chen and co-workers make more chemical sense https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.24.461565v2.full.pdf. This study found they same shaped density as you have seen in your ABCD1 structure, but have modelled the lipid 18:0 Lyso PE molecule into this location instead. Judging the deposited maps, we think that this is the more likely lipid for your density, rather than CoA as proposed. We need to see an update of the substrate-binding site and the corresponding mutations to either the new substrate-binding site position as in the competing paper or more solid experimental data for keeping with the currently modelled substrate-binding site.</p><p>2. Certain assumptions have been made but there is no references or experimental validation from this work to warrant such conclusions; eg p6 'Pathogenic mutations on these residues may disturb the stability of ALDP. The residues of the third group are located on the NBDs, which may hinder the hydrolysis of nucleotides. Given the explosion of structural information on ABC transporters (for example, of the ~50 human ABC transporters, structures have been reported for the human A1, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, B6, B8, B10, B11, C7, D4, G2, G5, G8 transporters in addition to D1), it is a challenge to interpret new results in the context of existing knowledge about ABC transporters. The transport assays provide an approach to connecting structure and function, but too little information is provided about the assays to make those connections. Of the ~900 mutants, why were the variants in figure 4B selected? Where are they located in the structure? What do the results of the transport assay mean? For example, is the reduction of C22:S-CoA in the cytosol for the G343V mutant due to impaired transport or to reduced expression, misfolding or some other cause? mutations are mainly mapped to the TMDs, which may affect the conformational changes during substrate transport.</p><p>Please show the correct trafficking, expression (normalised to WT) and folding of all mutations tested in HEK293 cells.</p><p>Please show that the purified protein is capable of turning over ATP and that the basal ATPase activity stimulated by the substrate. We would recommend carrying out complementary ATPase assays on key mutations also. It is critical to better integrate the mutagenesis data with the structure.</p><p>3. Please provide some rationale basis for the additional structural features found in ABCD1 (peroxisomal helix and the C-terminal coil-coiled domain) and how this might be related to its function?</p><p>4. The final model is difficult to follow and this, of course, relates to the &quot;actual&quot; location of the substate-binding site. Is an outward-facing conformation to be expected in ABCD1? Furthermore, the conformational changes as proposed by comparing to AlphaFold models should be made with caution until experimental validation of these states. Please incorporate the AlphaFold models more carefully into the paper, i.e.,what are the state-specific co-evolved residue-pairs predicted in the AlphaFold models, do these make sense, and can these contact pairs be experimentally validated by mutagenesis?</p><p>5. The paper needs to be extensively re-written. We would like to see how the structure uncovers new mechanistic insights. With the additional functional data requested, consider how the ABCD1 structure enables a understanding of why very long chain fatty acids use such an ABC transporter structures for being imported into peroxisomes. How does this differ to other ABC transporters that transport lipids and why?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

We have discussed the transport mechanism of ABC transporters in the revision based on integrative analysis of expression level, ATPase assay and trafficking. We also cited previously literatures that reported ALD-related mutants mentioned in our study. We mapped the mutations selected for transport assay on the structure as suggested. In the original manuscript, we temporarily classified the numerous ALD-associated mutations into four groups based on structural mapping of these mutations (Figure-3). Due to the complexity for preparing the lipid extraction to fulfill the transport assay, we further selected several representative mutations following the structural guidance.

Judged from the ATPase and transport activity, the peroxisomal helix exhibit obstructed ATP hydrolysis and lipid transport (decreased ~50%), whereas deletion of the C-terminal coil-coiled domain have more influences on the lipid transport (decreased ~80%) than ATP hydrolysis. One possible reason is that deletion of the C-terminal domain has influence on the stability of ABCD1 with the NBD domain unaffected. Another possibility is that the C-terminal domain facilitates the conformational change of ABCD1 during the lipid transport.

How does this differ to other ABC transporters that transport lipids and why?</p></disp-quote><p>We compared the differences of the binding cavities between ALDP and ABCB4. ABCB4 is a phosphotidylcholine transporter. Typically, ALDP consists of two binding pockets listed in the large cavity formed by TMDs. ABCB4 harbors one lipid binding pocket. The cavity of ALDP is larger than ABCB4. The different binding manner of these two ABC transporters is associated with distinct conformational changes during lipid transport. The two protomers of ALDP moves away from the cavity center in the presence of ATP. These differences may be attributed to two reasons: (1) ALDP is assembled by two identical protomers whereas ABCB4 is assembled by single chain polypeptides; (2) The chemical shape of the specific substrates. Unlike most fatty acids, VLCFAs are too long to be metabolized in the mitochondria and must be metabolized in peroxisomes. We use C22:0 lipids for the comparison. C22:0-CoA has one acyl tail and a much larger hydrophilic head in contrast to C22:0-PC.</p><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75039-sa2-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

This part has been moved to the supplementary figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is still unclear how they selected their mutants; lines 122-125 do not have any refs of previously identified mutations. Do we know any of them being specific disease related?</p></disp-quote><p>Point accepted. We have rewritten this part to describe how these mutants have been selected. The references have been cited properly as suggested. Briefly, we selected six ALD-derived mutants that localized at the substrate binding site, the NBD and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain. These mutants are W339R, S342P, G343V, A396T, Q544R, and T693M. Additionally, we designed four constructs based on the structural findings, including S164A/Y310A, E291A/R518A, Δ364-374 to delete the peroxisomal helix and Δ683-745 to truncate the whole C-terminal coiled-coil domain. These four mutants are designed for probing how the associated structure elements affect the activity of ALDP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 85-91 contradict each other; they state that there is lipid-like density but at the same time they write that they have an apo structure.</p></disp-quote><p>Point accepted. We compared the structures of ALDP from different groups. Chen et al. also reported two lipid-like densities in the apo-state which have been built as PE in their model. Nonetheless, to avoid inaccurate interpretations, we have change the description as unknown densities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The structure of human ALDP is of significance given the role of this transporter in the transport of VLCFAs across the peroxisomal membrane. Nearly a thousand ALD-causing mutations have been identified for ALDP and the structure provides a framework for assessing their functional consequences. In this revised manuscript, the authors have addressed many of the reviewers' concerns in the rebuttal letter. Given the importance of this transporter, particularly the human version of ALDP, I am sympathetic to the publication.</p><p>The manuscript, however, needs extensive polishing to be suitable for publication, however. Here are a few examples</p><p>line 100: &quot;The TM2 serves as a mechanical lever: the cytosolic side moves towards the central cavity, while the peroxisomal side may move backwards the symmetry axis&quot;</p><p>Two points:</p><p>i. is TM2 really a mechanical level? A lever is a rigid object with a fulcrum point that amplifies an input force to become an output force. Is this what is meant?
