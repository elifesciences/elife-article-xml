proteins into the plasma membrane. The final step of exocytosis in yeast involves the assembly of two t-SNAREs, Sso1/2 and Sec9, with the v-SNARE, Snc1/2, on secretory vesicles. The rate-limiting step in this process is the formation of a binary complex of the two t-SNAREs. Despite a previous report of acceleration of binary complex assembly by Sec3, it remains unknown how Sso2 is efficiently recruited to the vesicle-docking site marked by Sec3. Here, we report a crystal structure of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Sec3 in complex with a nearly full-length version of Sso2 lacking only its C-terminal transmembrane helix. The structure shows a previously uncharacterized binding site for Sec3 at the N-terminus of Sso2, consisting of two highly conserved triple residue motifs (NPY: Asn-Pro-Tyr). We further reveal that the two NPY motifs bind Sec3 synergistically, which together with the previously reported binding interface constitute dual-site interactions between Sso2 and Sec3 to drive the fusion of secretory vesicles at target sites on the plasma membrane.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>crystal structure</kwd><kwd>exocyst</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>membrane trafficking</kwd><kwd>SNARE</kwd><kwd>Sec3</kwd><kwd>Sso2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P28231-B28</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Gang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I4960-B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Gang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM35370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Novick</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001671</institution-id><institution>European Synchrotron Radiation Facility</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Austrian Crystallographic Diffraction Consortium</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Gang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel dual-site binding between the yeast t-SNARE Sso2 and Sec3 (a component of the exocyst tethering complex) facilitates the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells is compartmentalized into distinct membrane bound organelles. Inter-organelle material exchange is carried out primarily through membrane traffic in which membrane bound transport vesicles bud from a donor compartment and are delivered to a specific acceptor compartment. Upon arriving at the destination, cargo-packed vesicles are first recognized and caught by tethering factors situated on the target membrane, which then hand the captured vesicles over to the soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins that drive membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ungermann and Kümmel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chia and Gleeson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bröcker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu and Hughson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>There are several types of SNARE proteins, one of which is attached to the membrane of vesicles (v-SNARE), and the others are on the target membrane (t-SNARE). In neuronal exocytosis, fusion of synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic plasma membrane is driven by the assembly of a four-helix bundle containing two t-SNAREs, syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, on the target membrane and the v-SNARE, synaptobrevin, on synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). Extensive studies have established that SNARE assembly is tightly regulated by multiple auxiliary proteins, including the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family of proteins, tethering factors, and small GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiebig et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demircioglu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takemoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koike and Jahn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2007</xref>). Munc18 is a chaperone protein that maintains syntaxin-1 in an activated conformation and passes it to its cognate SNARE partners for assembly to catalyze membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">André et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The exocytic vesicle-docking site in yeast is marked by the octameric exocyst complex, which belongs to the CATCHR family of multi-subunit tethering proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pleskot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boehm and Field, 2019</xref>). The main function of the exocyst is to capture secretory vesicles at sites of cell surface growth, which include the tip of the daughter cell early in the cell cycle, and the mother-daughter cell junction late in the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lipschutz and Mostov, 2002</xref>). The two t-SNAREs for exocytosis in yeast are Sso1/2 and Sec9, which are homologs of syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, respectively. The v-SNARE attached to secretory vesicles in yeast is Snc1/2, which is equivalent to synaptobrevin in neuronal exocytosis.</p><p>Our previous work showed that one of the exocyst components, Sec3, promotes SNARE assembly by interacting with the t-SNARE Sso2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yue et al., 2017</xref>). Sec3 consists of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a central putative coiled coil, and a C-terminal helical domain. Like syntaxin-1 and other related t-SNAREs, Sso2 consists of four helices, with the first three (Habc) forming an inhibitory domain and the last (H3) serving as the SNARE motif that interacts with the other two SNAREs during membrane fusion. We have shown that the Sec3 PH domain binds to the auto-inhibited four-helix bundle of Sso2 and promotes a conformational change of the linker between Hc and H3 of Sso2 via an allosteric effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yue et al., 2017</xref>). This change promotes the release of the SNARE motif (H3) of Sso2 and substantially accelerates the formation of the initial binary complex between H3 of Sso2 and the two helices of the other t-SNARE, Sec9. However, it remains unclear how Sso2 is initially recruited to the vesicle target sites marked by the exocyst to drive the efficient fusion reaction between secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane.</p><p>Here, we report our structural studies of Sec3-PH in complex with a nearly full-length construct of Sso2 (aa1–270), which lacks only its C-terminal transmembrane region (aa271–295). Our crystal structure of this Sec3/Sso2 complex reveals a previously unknown binding site for Sec3 on Sso2 in addition to the one on its four-helix bundle as reported in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yue et al., 2017</xref>). This extra binding site is located at the N-terminal end of Sso2 and consists of two highly conserved NPY (i.e. Asn-Pro-Tyr) motifs. These NPY motifs are connected to the helical core of Sso2 (i.e. Habc and H3) via a long variable linker. In the two heterodimeric complexes present in the crystal structure, the two NPY motifs of the two Sso2 molecules bind individually to a similar conserved hydrophobic pocket on the two Sec3 molecules. Interestingly, however, our in vitro interaction studies using synthetic polypeptides and recombinant Sec3-PH protein demonstrated that each NPY motif alone bound Sec3 much more weakly than the two NPY motifs together. The importance of the interaction between the NPY motifs of Sso2 and Sec3 was confirmed by a series of in vivo assays in yeast.</p><p>Overall, our work has uncovered a new interaction interface and thus establishes dual-site interactions between Sec3 and Sso2, which also suggests potentially an extra regulatory step in exocytic membrane fusion. Binding of the NPY motifs of Sso2 allows efficient recruitment of the t-SNARE protein to the vesicle-docking site on the plasma membrane to facilitate vesicle fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal structure reveals two NPY motifs at the N-terminus of Sso2 bound individually to the Sec3 PH domain</title><p>We previously reported the structure of Sso2-HabcH3 (aa36–227) in complex with the PH domain of Sec3 (aa75–320) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yue et al., 2017</xref>).

Sec3 is recruited to these sites by binding to the membrane-anchored small GTPases Rho1/Cdc42 and phosphoinositides on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>). Sso2, similar to its homologous t-SNARE in neuronal exocytosis, bears a C-terminal transmembrane helix. We have previously reported crystal structures of the Sec3 N-terminal PH domain in complex with the closed form of Sso2 as a four-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yue et al., 2017</xref>). We found that Sec3 destabilizes the linker between Hc and H3 of Sso2 via an allosteric effect, which promotes the assembly of the binary complex between Sso2 and the other t-SNARE, Sec9, and thus drastically accelerates subsequent full SNARE assembly with the v-SNARE Snc1/2 to drive fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. However, it remains unknown whether the conserved N-terminal extension of Sso2 also participates in the Sso2/Sec3 interaction and how Sso2 is effectively recruited to Sec3.</p><p>Here, we report a new crystal structure of the Sec3 PH domain in complex with a nearly full-length version of Sso2 that contains all sequence except for the C-terminal transmembrane helix. In addition to the interaction between the helical bundle of Sso2 and Sec3 observed in the previous study, we found an extra interaction interface between two conserved NPY motifs at the N-terminal end of Sso2 and a hydrophobic pocket on Sec3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The NPY motifs are connected to the highly conserved helical core of Sso2 via a non-conserved linker with variable lengths (roughly 15–40 residues), which is invisible in our crystal structure, suggesting that it is mobile within the crystal structure.</p><p>There are two copies of the Sso2/Sec3 complex in our crystal structure. The two NPY motifs were independently bound to Sec3 in these two complex structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Despite variations in the flanking residues, the cores of the two motifs, that is, residues Asn, Tyr, and Pro, adopt essentially the same conformation and have similar hydrogen bond networks with the neighboring Sec3 residues and water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our ITC experiments show that either of the two NPY motifs alone could bind Sec3 tightly, although with binding affinities three- to fourfold lower than the polypeptide with both motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Similarly, mutation of either motif to alanine also substantially reduced the interaction of the N-terminal part of Sso2 with Sec3, whereas simultaneous mutation of both motifs completely abolished the interaction. Together, these data suggest that the two NPY motifs bind Sec3 synergistically.</p><p>To further understand the function of the NPY motifs in exocytosis, we carried out a series of in vivo assays using yeast strains carrying mutations of Sso2 in its NPY motifs. While mutation of either NPY motif alone only slightly reduced cell growth, simultaneous mutation of both NPY motifs severely impaired cell growth, particularly at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We also explored how mutations of the NPY motifs of Sso2 influence protein secretion using Bgl2 and invertase as reporters. Our data show that mutation of both NPY motifs simultaneously substantially affects cell secretion efficiency, with a significantly larger internal pool of Bgl2 failing to reach the cell surface, whereas mutation of either motif alone yielded only a modest accumulation of an internal pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar effects were observed in invertase secretion, where the double NPY mutant M7 showed a more substantial defect than all other mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We further checked how the <italic>sso</italic>2 NPY mutations affect fusion of secretory vesicles to the target sites on the plasma membrane. Mutation of both NPY motifs resulted in the accumulation of many vesicles within the cell. Similar results were also observed for the mutation of the first NPY motif, whereas that of the second NPY motif showed no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Consistently, we found that both the double NPY mutation and mutation of the first NPY motif caused accumulation of GFP-Snc1 patches within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that the NPY motifs of Sso2 play an essential role in the secretory pathway. Notably, however, the interaction between Sec3 and the NPY motifs of Sso2 is dispensable for the actin-independent localization of Sec3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports that recruitment of Sec3 to the plasma membrane is determined by its interaction with the small GTPases Rho1 and Cdc42 as well as phosphoinositides on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Although the M7 mutant in the synthetic N-terminal part of Sso2 (aa1–15) disrupts its interaction with Sec3, the major interaction interface between the helical bundle of Sso2 and the Sec3 PH domain remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, it was intriguing to us why the M7 mutant showed such a strong deleterious effect in vesicle trafficking. Our ITC data reveal that the M7 mutant of Sso2 (aa1–270) completely abolished its interaction with the Sec3 PH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). The disrupted binding of the M7 mutant with Sec3 was further confirmed by two other in vitro experiments using purified recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), as well as by our co-immunoprecipitation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). All these demonstrate that the NPY motifs play an essential role in stabilizing the interaction between Sso2 and Sec3. This might be explained by what was observed in the crystal structure of the Sso2/Sec3 complex, where the NPY motifs are in close contact with the C-terminal tip of the SNARE motif (i.e. H3) of Sso2 and may thus stabilize their interaction as explained below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>).</p><p>The dual interaction interfaces between Sso2 and Sec3 are reminiscent of what has been seen in the structures of syntaxin-1 and Tlg2 in complex with their partner SM proteins Munc18 and Vps45, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–C</xref>). In the latter two complex structures, a short peptide at the N-terminus of Munc-18 and Vps45, which was named ‘N-peptide’, forms a short helix and binds distally to the backside of the first domain of Munc18 or Vps45, opposite to their interaction sites with the helical bundles of the SNARE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisemann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhardt et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, the binding site for the NPY motifs of Sso2 is on the same side of the Sec3 PH domain as the aforementioned direct contact with the C-terminal part of H3 of Sso2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Furthermore, the Sec3 PH domain is a single globular domain and much smaller than Munc18 and Vps45, both of which contain three domains that are folded into a horseshoe-like conformation. The helical bundle of syntaxin-1 and Tlg2 is clamped between the two tips of the ‘horseshoe’. Additionally, in those two complex structures, the C-terminal extensions of the SNARE motifs (i.e. H3) form a short helix and insert into a hydrophobic pocket deeply inside the ‘horseshoe’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and C</xref>). These together ensure a strong interaction between the two t-SNAREs and their partner SM proteins. In contrast, the interaction interface between Sec3 and Sso2 is very small, and thus their interaction is presumably much weaker than that in the Munc18/syntaxin-1 and Vps45/Tlg2 complexes. Our ITC data show that double mutation of both NPY motifs completely abolished the interaction between Sso2 and Sec3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). Consistently, our in vivo data demonstrate that simultaneous mutation of both NPY motifs substantially impaired protein secretion as well as recycling of cell surface proteins. We therefore think that the NPY motifs play an important role in stabilizing the interaction of Sso2 with Sec3 by providing an additional binding site, which ensures effective recruitment of Sso2 to vesicle-docking sites on the plasma membrane.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Interaction of the N-terminus of Sso2 with Sec3 in comparison with that in other syntaxin/SM protein complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Crystal structures of the complexes of Sso2/Sec3 (PDB code: 7Q83), syntaxin-1/Munc18 (PDB code: 3C98), and Tlg2/Vps45 (PDB code: 2XHE), respectively.

Once the ‘hooks’ find and bind to Sec3, Sso2 would be locally restrained, which would promote the binding of Sec3 to the helical bundle of Sso2. This would in turn lead to the destabilization of the linker between Hc and H3 of Sso2 and thus promote the assembly of the binary complex between Sso2 and Sec9 to facilitate the final formation of the full SNARE complex with the v-SNARE Snc1/2, which eventually drives the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular cloning of expression constructs for in vitro assays</title><p>The Sso2 sequence excluding only its C-terminal transmembrane domain (aa1–270) was sub-cloned into the pET-15b vector (Novagen) between the <italic>Nde</italic>I and <italic>BamH</italic>I sites using the following two primers: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGCAGCCATATGATGAGCAAC-3</named-content>’ (forward) and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GACCGGATCCTTAACATCTTATTTTG-</named-content>3’ (reverse).

Samples were boiled for 10 min and proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Bgl2 was visualized by western blotting with anti-Bgl2 rabbit polyclonal antibody at 1:5000 dilution (provided by the laboratory of Randy Schekman, University of California, Berkeley). For quantitation of Bgl2, images of western blots were captured using the ChemiDoc system (Bio-Rad) and multiple images were collected to ensure an unsaturated signal. Serial dilutions of a control sample were run in parallel to establish a standard curve. The electrophoretic bands were quantitated using ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov">https://imagej.nih.gov</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Invertase secretion assay</title><p>The invertase assays were performed as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>.

Then, 1 OD<sub>600</sub> unit of cells was transferred to two sets of 15 ml centrifuge tubes and pelleted at 3500 rpm for 5 min. The first set of cells were washed in 0.5 ml sterile water and resuspended in 1 ml ice-cold 10 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>, then kept on ice as 0 min samples. The second set of cells were washed once in sterile water and resuspended in 1 ml YP+0.1% glucose medium, then incubated at 37°C in a water bath with shaking for 45 min. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml 10 mM NaN<sub>3</sub> as 45 min samples; 0.5 ml cells from each 0 or 45 min samples were used to measure the external invertase. Another 0.5 ml cells of 0 or 45 min samples were resuspended in spheroblast buffer containing 50 µg/ml zymolyase and incubated at 37°C in a water bath for 45 min to generate spheroplasts. All internal samples were lysed with 0.5 ml 0.5% Triton X-100. A 20 µl aliquot from each internal and external sample was used for measuring invertase. The percentage of invertase accumulation was calculated by the formula of (Int<sub>45m</sub>-Int<sub>0m</sub>)/[(Ext<sub>45m</sub>-Ext<sub>0m</sub>) + (Int<sub>45m</sub>-Int<sub>0m</sub>)].</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Control (<italic>sso1⊗/SSO2</italic>) or <italic>sso2</italic> mutant cells were grown at 25°C in YPD to an OD<sub>600</sub> of ∼0.5 and then processed for electron microscopy study as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>).

Cells were fixed at room temperature for 1 hr and then shifted to 4°C for 16 hr. The next day, cells were washed twice with 50 mM KPi (pH 7.5), and then digested in 2 ml of 50 mM KPi buffer containing 0.25 mg/mL Zymolyase 100T at 37°C for 40 min in a water bath with gentle shaking. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and resuspended in 1.5 ml of cold 2% (w/v) OsO<sub>4</sub> in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Cells were incubated for 1 hr on ice, washed three times with water, and then incubated in 1.5 ml of 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate at room temperature for 1 hr. Cells were dehydrated by a series of ethanol washes and incubated overnight in Durcupan resin. Cells were embedded in fresh Durcupan resin and baked at 60°C for at least 48 hr.

Following their suggestions, we have reworked our manuscript and added several pieces of new data to address questions from them, including (1) evaluation of how M7 mutant of Sso2 affects its interaction with Sec3 using three independent methods (in vitro); (2) investigation of how the M7 mutant affects the interaction of Sso2 with Sec3 by co-immunoprecipitation (in vivo). We hope that, with all these further introduced changes, this manuscript will be suitable for publication in your journal. Detailed point-to-point responses are shown below.</p><p>Point-by-point description of the revisions</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Using the entire cytoplasmic domain of Sso2 and protein crystallization, Peer and colleagues show that two N-terminal peptides (NPY) of Sso2 synergistically interact with the Sec3 PH domain. This interaction provides an additional low affinity binding site to the previously published interface between the Sso2 four-helix bundle and the PH domain. Mutagenesis, in particular of both NPY motifs, results in reduced cell growth, in the accumulation of transport vesicles at the budding site, and in decreased secretion of invertase and Bgl2. The paper is well written, the data are convincing and the characterization of these novel peptide interaction sites clearly advances the field. Although, the exact role of the Sec3 NPY – Sec3 interaction still needs to be established, the overall functional relevance is apparent and thus the paper could be published with minor changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate the reviewer for his/her positive comments and clear/constructive feedbacks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nevertheless, the authors may consider to address the following issues to improve the manuscript.</p><p>To strictly exclude the possibility that the Sso2 NPY motif also interacts with other components of the exocytosis machinery (e.g. Sec1), thereby causing the observed phenotypes, Sec3 mutagenesis of the NPY motif-binding site would be required.</p></disp-quote><p>It would be a good idea to generate reverse mutants on Sec3. However, the pocket on Sec3 bound by the NPY motifs of Sso2 is mostly hydrophobic and contains many semi-buried residues that are in close contact with other residues in the hydrophobic core of structure (including L78, Y82, I109, V112, V208, etc.; see <bold>Figure 2-figure supplement 2</bold> D and E) and thus essential in maintaining the folding of Sec3. Making mutations on these residues would destabilize the folding of Sec3. This was why we have not done this as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest that the NPY-peptide binding contributes to the initial interaction/recruitment of Sso2 to the exocytosis site, defined by the localization of Sec3 (exocyst). Further data sustaining this concept/hypothesis could improve the impact of the manuscript. Thus, an experiment analyzing the co-distribution of the Sec3 with Sso2 would directly support the authors' conclusion. (In Figure 7, the authors already show the highly polarized distribution of Sec3-3xGFP.) The M7 mutant could impact the distribution of Sso2. In addition, it would be helpful to determine to which degree the Sso2 NPY – Sec3 PH domain interaction increases the overall affinity of Sso2 for the Sec3 PH domain; e.g. comparison of the binding of Sso2 (1-270) wt and M7 to Sec3 PH domain using ITC.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly value the reviewer’s suggestion. For the suggestion to investigate how the M7 mutant affects the co-distribution of Sso2 with Sec3 in yeast, we have tried a variety of conditions with both the original serum and affinity purified Sso antibodies. In neither case did we see a clear concentration at sites where we would expect to see Sec3, such as the tips of small buds. We were able to see some detectable concentration of HA-tagged Sso2 in small buds using antiHA Ab, but it would be difficult to tag the M7 mutant at the same site since it is so close to the M7 mutation. We are also worried that the tag might interfere with Sec3 binding due to the proximity. Given the lack of detectable concentration of WT Sso2, it would not be possible to see a loss of localization in M7.</p><p>For the suggestion to check the binding of Sec3 with either the WT or M7 mutant of Sso2 (aa1-270), we have generated M7 mutant within the same fragment of Sso2 as the WT (i.e. aa1-270) and carefully checked how this M7 mutant affects the interaction of Sso2 with the Sec3 PH domain using three independent methods. Our ITC data show that WT Sso2 bound Sec3 very robustly, with a Kd of approximately 2 µM (Figure 8C). Surprisingly, however, the M7 mutant of Sso2 (aa1-270) completely abolished its interaction with Sec3 (Figure 8D). To further verify this observation, we carried out electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Our EMSA data on a native PAGE gel shows that WT Sso2 (aa1-270) bound Sec3, whereas the M7 mutant did not (<bold>Figure 8-figure supplement 1</bold> A and B). Similarly, our SEC data demonstrate that Sec3 was coeluted with WT Sso2 in the higher molecular weight peak; in contrast, Sec3 and the M7 mutant of Sso2 (aa1-270) were eluted in separate peaks and no stable complex of the two was formed (<bold>Figure 8-figure supplement 1</bold> C and D). All these new data confirm that the NPY motifs play an essential role in maintaining the stable interaction between Sso2 and Sec3, which would explain why the M7 mutant gave such dramatic phenotype in vivo (Figure 4 B-E; Figure 5 D-F; Figure 6 D and E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor point: In the discussion, the authors should mention to which degree the NPY binding site within Sec3 is accessible for / occupied by other known exocyst components, or PI(4,5)P2, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. A new diagram has been added to Figure 9E to compare the structures of the previously reported Sec3/Rho1 complex and the Sso2/Sec3 complex determined by us. It shows that the NPY binding site on Sec3 is on the opposite side of the membrane-binding surface patch. The NPY binding site is also far away from the Rho1 interacting site on Sec3 and thus does not interfere with Rho1 binding either.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The manuscript significantly contributes to our understanding of how the vesicle tethering machinery interacts and coordinates the assembly of the membrane fusion machinery and will be of broad interest in the field of membrane trafficking. I am not an expert in X-ray crystallography.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate this reviewer’s positive feedbacks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>I agree with the comments of the other reviewer. It would be nice to show the effect of the M7 mutant in a reconstituted liposome fusion assay, but as already mentioned this may require an additional collaboration. Whether the relatively weak Sec3 – NPY interaction can be resolved in the liposome fusion assay needs to be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Please check our detailed answer to the other reviewer’s question about this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The manuscript of Peer et al. Describe the structural characterization of the interaction of the syntaxin-like Sso2 protein with the exocyst subunit Sec3. The authors identify here a dual NPY motif at the N-terminal part of Sso2 that binds to Sec3 and thus confers functionality. Using x-ray crystallography, they show a nearly full-length Sso2 in complex with Sec3, which reveals how Sso2 binds to Sec3. Subsequent mutagenesis shows that both NPY motifs act together in binding, and are both required for functionality in vivo, using established assays in localization of exocyst subunits, secretion assays and growth tests. Their data suggest an overall model how Sso2 is efficiently recruited by exocyst to promote vesicle secretion.</p><p>This is an overall very complete and clear manuscript, where the authors nicely demonstrate, how the two NPY motifs both contribute to efficient Sso2 interaction with Sec3. Their data further show that each motif alone can contribute to function, whereas loss of both motifs (the M7 mutant) result in deficient binding. Likewise, their established assays to determine cellular importance of the NPY motifs in Sso2 show that trafficking and localization in the secretory pathway is strongly impaired in the mutant. I only have a few questions and suggestions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the positive feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors present in Figure 4 the mutants. I recommend to show the alignment of the mutants (M5,M6,M7) similar to panel A in Figure S4 here to orient the reader. They could also be listed in Figure 3, since the authors have here the sequences.</p></disp-quote><p>Alignment of M5-M7 has been added in Figure 4A as suggested. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors previously showed that Sso2 mutants affect the Sec3 driven assembly and also the fusion. I am wondering if they have the tools ready to also conduct this assay with their M7 mutant, which has the strongest defect. I am aware that this may be challenging if the tools are not established here as in the previous collaboration (Yue et al., 2017). It may provide additional information on the functional crosstalk.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. However, we do not think it is necessary to perform such assay based on our new results. As shown in Figure 8 C and D and Figure S5, we found that the M7 mutant of Sso2 (aa1-270) completely abolished its interaction with Sec3, which is in contrast to the robust interaction between the WT Sso2 (aa1-270) and Sec3. Therefore, we expect that the M7 mutant would fail to accelerate liposome fusion in the same way as we had previously seen for the WT Sso2.</p><p>On the other hand, we have to admit that to perform such assay would indeed be challenging for us as the PhD student who had carried out the in vitro liposome fusion assay has left our previous collaborator’s lab and it would take quite a while to re-establish the assay in our own group and to optimize various parameters in that assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Along the same line, it would be good if the authors show that the mutation also impairs the interaction of Sec3 and Sso2 in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and have carried out coimmunoprecipitation of Sec3-3×Flag and Sso2 from yeast extract to find out how the M7 mutant affects Sso2’s interaction with Sec3 (Figure S6). Our results show that in contrast to the clear signal of WT Sso2 pulled down by Sec3-3×Flag, the pull-down band for the M7 mutant was much weaker and at a similar level to the negative control. This is consistent with what we saw in our in vitro binding assays (Figure 8D; <bold>Figure 8-figure supplement 1</bold>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I really like the similarity of the different Munc18-Syntaxin interactions and the Sec3Sso2 interaction. Do the authors think that Sec3 is an ancestral fragment of a Sec1 like protein, which just maintained this interaction?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting idea. However, it seems too speculative to us to draw such conclusion. It could also be due to co-evolution in function for Sec3 to use a simpler structure (i.e. PH domain) to mimic syntaxin binding of SM proteins and to employ the extra “add-on” NPY motifs as a handle to facilitate and regulate their interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Small mistake in the discussion Responses: &quot;plasmas membrane&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Important advance in our understanding of Exocyst function, which deserves publication. I only had minor issues that can be addressed quickly.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s positive feedbacks and constructive suggestions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
