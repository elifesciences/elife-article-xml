neuron types. These intrinsic factors known as temporal factors dictate timing of neuroblast transitions in response to steroid hormone signaling and specify early versus late temporal fates in neuroblast neuron progeny. After completing their temporal programs, neuroblasts differentiate or die, finalizing both neuron number and type within each neuroblast lineage. From a screen aimed at identifying genes required to terminate neuroblast divisions, we identified Notch and Notch pathway components. When Notch is knocked down, neuroblasts maintain early temporal factor expression longer, delay late temporal factor expression, and continue dividing into adulthood. We find that Delta, expressed in cortex glia, neuroblasts, and after division, their GMC progeny, regulates neuroblast Notch activity. We also find that Delta in neuroblasts is expressed high early, low late, and is controlled by the intrinsic temporal program: early factor Imp promotes Delta, late factors Syp/E93 reduce Delta. Thus, in addition to systemic steroid hormone cues, forward lineage progression is controlled by local cell-cell signaling between neuroblasts and their cortex glia/GMC neighbors: Delta transactivates Notch in neuroblasts bringing the early temporal program and early temporal factor expression to a close.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuroblast</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>temporal patterning</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>termination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM141886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegrist</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Notch signaling regulates the neuroblast intrinsic temporal program to determine when neuroblasts terminate their cell divisions during development.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In most metazoans, termination of neurogenesis is an essential part of organism development, ensuring the formation of functional neural circuits and an adult brain of proper size and structure. Prolonged or ectopic neurogenesis can lead to cortical malformations and has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hazlett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marchetto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patzlaff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casingal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ossola and Kalebic, 2022</xref>). While the vast majority of neurons are generated during development, it still remains unclear how neurogenesis becomes progressively restricted and, in most cases, ends altogether after development is completed.</p><p>We use the genetically tractable model organism, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, to determine how extrinsic cues, local and systemic, integrate with neural stem cell intrinsic cues to control neurogenesis timing and termination during development. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS consists of two bilaterally symmetric brain hemispheres and a ventral nerve cord that is functionally equivalent to the mammalian spinal cord. Each brain hemisphere contains an optic lobe and an equally sized central brain (CB) region that harbors distinctive neuropils for information processing. Neurons in the CB region are generated during development from the asymmetric cell divisions of a defined number of neural stem cells known as neuroblasts (NBs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. NBs in the CB region (referred to as CB NBs) are specified during embryogenesis and undergo stereotypic patterns of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito and Hotta, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Homem and Knoblich, 2012</xref>). Except for the mushroom body (MB) NB subset, all CB NBs enter and exit quiescence during the embryonic to larval transition and terminally differentiate or die 4–5 days later during early pupal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito and Hotta, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Once CB NBs reactivate from quiescence in response to dietary nutrients, they divide continuously while changing gene expression over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Britton and Edgar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Syed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>). These controlled transitions of gene expression over time, referred to as temporal patterning, allow for a restricted set of neural stem cells to generate a pool of molecularly and functionally diverse neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahrampour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Syed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyares and Lee, 2019</xref>). Early larval temporal factors include the Zinc finger transcription factor, Castor (Cas), the orphan nuclear receptor, Seven-up (Svp), the RNA-binding protein, IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (Imp), as well as others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Syed et al., 2017</xref>).

Late temporal factors include the RNA-binding protein, Syncrip (Syp), the steroid hormone-induced transcription factor, Eip93F (E93), as well as others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Syed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pahl et al., 2019</xref>).

Imp keeps CB NBs ‘young’ by inhibiting Syp and Mediator complex activity, whereas Syp inhibits Imp and promotes nuclear accumulation of the pro-differentiation transcription factor Prospero (Pros) in most CB NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). During early pupal stages, CB NBs undergo reductive divisions and terminally differentiate, except for the MB NB subset, which divides several days longer and undergo autophagy/apoptosis prior to adult eclosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pahl et al., 2019</xref>). Independent of neurogenesis timing and the mechanism by which CB NB stop divisions, temporal patterning plays a key role in controlling numbers and types of neurons made within each of the NB lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahrampour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pahl et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>From a targeted RNAi screen aimed at identifying genes required to terminate CB NB divisions and neurogenesis, we identified Notch and Notch pathway components. Notch is an evolutionarily conserved cell-cell signaling pathway classically known for regulating binary cell fate decisions, ‘A’ versus ‘B’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muskavitch, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cau and Blader, 2009</xref>). Here, we show that Notch signaling also regulates binary temporal decisions, ‘early’ versus ‘late’. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there is one Notch receptor and two ligands, Delta (Dl) and Serrate (Ser). Notch receptor is proteolytically cleaved after ligand binding, first by Kuzbanian (Kuz), an ADAM metalloprotease, and then by γ-secretase. Cleaved Notch ICD (intracellular domain) relocates to the nucleus where it binds to Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] and Mastermind to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rebay et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fortini and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pan and Rubin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Strooper et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mumm et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitagawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). We recently reported that Notch signaling regulates CB NB quiescence during the embryonic to larval transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sood et al., 2022</xref>). When Notch is knocked down, some CB NBs continue dividing during this transition. We also reported that Notch activity becomes attenuated in quiescent CB NBs because CB NBs are no longer dividing and producing Delta-expressing GMC daughters for Notch pathway transactivation. Moreover, low Notch is necessary for CB NBs to reactivate from quiescence in response to dietary nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sood et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that Notch signaling also regulates neurogenesis termination during pupal stages. When Notch is knocked down, CB NBs maintain early temporal factor expression longer resulting in a delay of late temporal factor expression with prolonged neurogenesis into late pupal stages and early adulthood. This defect in temporal patterning (switching from early to late) occurs well after CB NB exit from quiescence suggesting that Notch is required at multiple times throughout development in controlling CB NB proliferation decisions. Furthermore, we determine that Delta is the Notch ligand that activates Notch in CB NBs and reductions in Delta also lead to defects in CB NB temporal patterning. Moreover, we find that Delta in CB NBs, which is segregated to GMCs after cell division to transactivate Notch, is regulated by CB NB temporal factors. Early factor Imp promotes Delta, whereas late factors Syp and E93 reduce Delta. Together, we report that Notch signaling positively regulates forward lineage progression by closing off the early temporal window and control of Notch pathway activity is regulated by CB NB intrinsic temporal factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Notch signaling is required for CB NB elimination and termination of neurogenesis</title><p>All CB NBs, except the MB NB subset (four per brain hemisphere) terminally differentiate or die during early pupal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito and Hotta, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).

From a targeted RNAi screen aimed at identifying genes required to terminate NB divisions and neurogenesis, we identified Notch (N) and Notch pathway components. At 48 hr APF (after pupal formation), midway through pupal stages, control animals have only the four MB NBs remaining in each brain hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). In contrast when Notch was knocked down in NBs (<italic>worGAL4,UAS-N RNAi #HMS00001</italic>), on average five additional CB NBs remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In 1-day old <italic>N RNAi</italic> adults, CB NBs were also present, but not the MB NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Ectopically persisting <italic>N RNAi</italic> CB NBs (CB NBs at 48 hr APF and beyond) expressed the NB transcription factor Deadpan (Dpn), the S-phase indicator <italic>pcnaGFP</italic>, and were small on average compared to control CB NBs during earlier developmental stages (L3 control, average diameter 10–15 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C, and E</xref>). However, at 30 hr APF when control CB NBs are still present, <italic>N RNAi</italic> CB NBs were larger on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C, and E</xref>).

This is because Notch regulates early temporal patterning and defects in early temporal patterning transmit to late temporal defects including the time at which CB NBs stop divisions. Notch curtails expression of at least three early temporal factors (Cas, Svp, and Imp), suggesting that Notch may function broadly to close the early temporal window. It is known that the early to late temporal transition is dependent on both early intrinsic temporal factors, Cas and Svp, and on extrinsic steroid hormone signaling (ecdysone) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Syed et al., 2017</xref>). Cas overexpression is sufficient to prolong Svp expression, but Cas is not required for Svp expression, and Svp primes CB NBs to respond to ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ren et al., 2017</xref>). Whether Notch pathway activity curtails both Cas and Svp or just Cas remains an open question, however it has been reported that both Cas and Svp are associated with at least one enhancer that is responsive to Notch activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zacharioudaki et al., 2016</xref>). Also, it remains unknown whether Notch directly inhibits Imp or whether Notch indirectly inhibits Imp through Syp expression in response to ecdysone or a yet unidentified factor. Notch was recently shown to regulate timing of Sloppy-paired expression in the optic lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ray and Li, 2022</xref>).</p><p>While some CB NBs maintained early Imp expression, others co-expressed both Imp and Syp, or expressed Syp alone. This suggests that Notch function is lineage-dependent and/or suggests that more than one pathway regulates lineage progression. While Cas is likely expressed in all CB NBs, Svp appears to be more restricted. Whether Notch inhibits early temporal progression only in Svp expressing CB NBs is not yet known. Somewhat unexpectedly, we also found a significant percentage of ectopically persisting CB NBs expressing the late temporal factor Syp. Syp promotes accumulation of nuclear Pros in CB NBs during pupal stages to induce terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that either a Pros-independent mechanism exists to eliminate CB NBs and/or that Syp regulates expression of additional unknown temporal factors required for Pros nuclear accumulation. As we report here, Syp and E93 inhibit expression and localization of Delta and decreased Delta leads to ectopic persistence of CB NBs. This is consistent with the notion that once CB NBs transition from early to late temporal factor expression in response to ecdysone, late temporal factors (Syp/E93) inhibit Delta. Whether this changes Notch activity and/or transcription of Notch target genes is not yet known. Nevertheless, it will be important to identify the Notch transcriptional target genes that regulate lineage progression. One good place to start will be to follow up on the eight transcription factors we identified from data mining.</p><p>During early larval stages, CB NBs reactivate from quiescence and produce GMCs that express Delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zacharioudaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sood et al., 2022</xref>). This leads to the transactivation of Notch in CB NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sood et al., 2022</xref>). The early temporal factor Imp positively regulates Delta in CB NBs and their GMC progeny. In developing egg chambers, Imp positively regulates Notch pathway activity by controlling Kuz localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fic et al., 2019</xref>). Whether Imp in CB NBs also regulates Kuz localization remains an open question. Delta is also expressed in cortex glia and regulates CB NB Notch activity. Whether Delta expression in cortex glia changes over time as is the case for CB NBs remains an open question. Hedgehog signaling in CB NBs promotes lineage progression downstream of Cas and Hedgehog ligands are produced in cortex glia and GMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chai et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, CB NBs integrate cues from their GMC progeny and neighboring cortex glial cells to control temporal progression and lineage termination.</p><p>Although the exact course of temporal progression is yet to be defined in the mammalian nervous system, mammalian NSCs temporally express several factors including microRNAs, mRNA-binding proteins, and transcription factors, allowing them to produce deep layer neurons (early-born neural progeny), superficial layer neurons (late-born neural progeny), and glial cells sequentially throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okano and Temple, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MuhChyi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oberst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Telley et al., 2019</xref>). COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII, orthologs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Svp, function as late temporal factors allowing NSCs to switch from producing early-born neural fates to late-born neural fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Naka et al., 2008</xref>). This is similar to the function of Svp in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain where Svp mutants failed to switch from early Chinmo positive daughters to late Broad-complex positive daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, mammalian NSCs temporally express RNA-binding protein Imp-1, ortholog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Imp, and in Imp-1 deficient animals, NSCs are lost prematurely similar to premature loss of CB NBs seen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pahl et al., 2019</xref>). As in <italic>Drosophila</italic> NBs, temporal progression of mammalian NSCs is not completely dependent on cell-intrinsic cues but also requires cell-extrinsic cues like feedback signals from the lineage and environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okamoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oberst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), however, very little is known about the signaling pathways regulating the transitions from early to late temporal fates. Even though Notch activity is required for the temporal switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in mammalian NSCs, it remains unclear whether Notch function extends to regulation of temporal progression required for the switch from early-born to late-born neuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morrison et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grandbarbe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohtsuka and Kageyama, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

In brief, dissected tissues were fixed in 4% EM grade formaldehyde in PEM buffer for 20 min (larvae) or 30 min (pupae and adults) and rinsed in 1× PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBT). Tissues were blocked overnight at 4°C in 10% normal goat serum in PBT followed by antibody staining. Primary antibodies used are listed in the Key resources table. To detect primary antibodies, Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher) listed in the Key resources table were used. Images encompassing the entire brain hemispheres were acquired using a Leica SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 63×/1.4 NA and 40×/1.3 NA oil immersion objectives and analyzed using Fiji software. All images were processed using Fiji and Adobe Photoshop software and figures assembled using Adobe Illustrator software. NBs were identified based on Dpn expression and superficial location. The Fiji ‘cell counter’ plugin was used to count and track number of Dpn positive NBs. NB size was calculated by averaging the lengths of two perpendicular lines through the center of the NB in Fiji. Quantification of fluorescence was performed in Fiji. Nuclear E93 levels were quantified as follows: CB NB nuclei labeled with Dpn were manually traced and the average E93 ﬂuorescence intensity measured in the nucleus. Normalized E93 nuclear fluorescence intensity was determined as a ratio of nuclear E93 fluorescence intensity in a clone NB to nuclear E93 fluorescence intensity in a control NB in the same z-plane. All data is represented as mean ± standard error of the mean and statistical significance was determined using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests or ANOVAs in Prism 9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA-sequence data analysis</title><p>Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed using the publicly available dataset published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref> (GSE71103). We aligned FASTQ data to a reference Dm genome using STAR (version 2.7.2b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Read count tables were generated using the htseq-count package from bioconda, and DGE was performed using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Love et al., 2014</xref>). We made contrasts between 24 hr ALH and 84 hr ALH antennal lobe NBs in order to identify DEGs of interest (adj. p-value &lt;0.1 and log fold change &gt;1). The list of 1861 DEGs was compared to the list of downstream genetic interactions of Notch pathway from FlyBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0004647">https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0004647</ext-link>) to obtain the list of 59 DEGs of interest. Finally, VST (variance-stabilizing transformation) normalized counts of the 59 genes were used to generate the heatmaps using heatmap.2 from the ggplot2 package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org">https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org</ext-link>). To obtain common target genes between Notch and Imp, we compared our list of 59 genes to the top 1000 Imp target genes obtained via RIP-seq by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Samuels et al., 2020</xref>.

Here they show that continuous depletion of Notch in NBs from early embryogenesis leads to cycling NBs in the adult. This - cycling NBs in the adult - is not seen in controls. The assumption here is that these Notch-RNAi NBs in adults are those that did not undergo terminal differentiation in pupal development. The authors show that Notch is activated by its ligand Delta which is expressed on the GMC daughter cell and on cortex glia. They determine that the temporal requirement for Notch activity is 0-72 hours after larval hatching (ALH) (i.e., 1st instar through mid-3rd instar at 25C). In NBs/GMCs depleted for Notch, early temporal markers were still expressed at time points when they should be off and late markers were delayed in expression. These effects were observed in ~20-40% of NBs (Figures 5 and 6). Through mining existing data sets, they found that the early temporal factor Imp - an RNA binding protein - can bind Delta mRNA. They show that Delta transcripts decrease over time, leading to the hypothesis that Delta mRNA is repressed by the late temporal factors. Over-expressing late factors Syp or E93 earlier in development leads to downregulation of a Delta::GFP protein trap. These results lead to a model in which Notch regulates expression of early temporal factors and early temporal factors regulate Notch activity through translation of Delta mRNA.</p><p>There are several strengths of this study and no major weaknesses. The authors report rigorous measurements and statistical analyses throughout the study. Their conclusions are appropriate for the results. Data mining revealed an important mechanism - that Imp binds Delta mRNA - supporting the model that that early temporal factors promote Delta expression, which in turn promotes Notch signaling.</p><p>An appraisal: The authors use temperature shifts with Gal80TS to show that Notch is required between 0-72 hours ALH. They show with the use of known markers of the temporal factors and Delta protein trap, that Imp promotes Delta protein expression and the later temporal factors reduce Delta, although the molecular mechanisms are not clearly delineated. Overall, these data support their model that the reduction of Delta expression during larval development leads to a loss of Notch activity.</p><p>As noted in the Discussion, this study raises many questions about what Notch does in larval CB NBs. For example, does it inhibit Castor or Imp? Is Notch required in certain neural lineages and not others. These studies will be of interest in the community of developmental neurobiologists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88565.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>As I indicated in the initial review, the experiments are well conceived and executed, and the data are clear.

It is my opinion that the authors fall short of demonstrating how Notch signaling and temporal identity genes at the chromatin levels. I find this disappointing given the availability of various tools for looking at dynamic regulation of gene activity at high resolution. Given these weaknesses, my opinion is that the study is descriptive and lacks mechanistic explanation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88565.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study, the authors investigate the effects of Notch pathway inactivation on the termination of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts at the end of development. They find that termination is delayed, while temporal patterning progression is slowed down. Forcing temporal patterning progression in a Notch pathway mutant restores correct timing of neuroblast elimination. Finally they show that Imp, an early temporal patterning factor promotes Delta expression in neuroblast lineages. This indicates that feedback loops between temporal patterning and lineage-intrinsic Notch activity fine tunes timing of early to late temporal transitions and is important to schedule NB termination at the end of development.</p><p>The study adds another layer of regulation that finetunes temporal progression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cells. This mechanism appears to be mainly lineage intrinsic - Delta being expressed from NBs and their progeny, but also partly niche-mediated - Delta being also expressed in glia but with a minor influence. Together with a recent study (PMID: 36040415), this work suggests that Notch signaling is a key player in promoting temporal progression in various temporal patterning system. As such it is of broad interest for the neuro-developmental community.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The data are based on genetic experiments which are clearly described and mostly convincing. The study is interesting, adding another layer of regulation that finetunes temporal progression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cells. This mechanism appears to be mainly lineage intrinsic - Delta being expressed from NBs and their progeny, but also partly niche-mediated - Delta being also expressed in glia but with a minor influence. A similar mechanism has been recently described, although in a different temporal patterning system (medulla neuroblasts of the optic lobe - PMID: 36040415). It is overall of broad interest for the neuro-developmental community.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>The mechanisms by which Notch signaling regulates temporal patterning progression are not investigated in details. For example, it is not clear whether Notch signaling directly regulates temporal patterning genes, or whether the phenotypes observed are indirect (for example through the regulation of the cell-cycle speed). The authors could have investigated whether temporal patterning genes are directly regulated by the Notch pathway via ChIP-seq of Su(H) or the identification of potential binding sites for Su(H) in enhancers. A similar approach has been recently undertaken by the lab of Dr Xin Li, to show that Notch signaling regulates sequential expression of temporal patterning factors in optic lobes neuroblasts (PMID: 36040415), which exhibit a different temporal patterning system than central brain neuroblasts in the present study. As such, the mechanistic insights of the study are limited.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88565.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sood</surname><given-names>Chhavi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Virginia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nahid</surname><given-names>Md Ausrafuggaman</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Virginia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Branham</surname><given-names>Kendall R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Virginia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pahl</surname><given-names>Matt</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Virginia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Doyle</surname><given-names>Susan E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Virginia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Siegrist</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Virginia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We very much appreciate the constructive comments provided by the reviewers. We have incorporated many of their suggestions and believe the manuscript is much improved.</p><p>In brief, we updated the text as suggested and have included three additional panels in supplementary fig. S2E-G. This additional data provides further support that the ectopically persisting neuroblasts are actively dividing and that cell cycle defects alone do not account for temporal patterning phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors are building on their previous work showing Delta-Notch regulates the entrance and exit from embryo-larval quiescence of neural stem cells of the central brain (called CB neuroblasts (NB) (PMID: 35112131)). Here they show that continuous depletion of Notch in NBs from early embryogenesis leads to cycling NBs in the adult. This - cycling NBs in the adult - is not seen in controls. The assumption here is that these Notch-RNAi NBs in adults are those that did not undergo terminal differentiation in pupal development. The authors show that Notch is activated by its ligand Delta which is expressed on the GMC daughter cell and on cortex glia. They determine that the temporal requirement for Notch activity is 0-72 hours after larval hatching (ALH) (i.e., 1st instar through mid-3rd instar at 25C). In NBs/GMCs depleted for Notch, early temporal markers were still expressed at time points when they should be off and late markers were delayed in expression. These effects were observed in ~20-40% of NBs (Figures 5 and 6). Through mining existing data sets, they found that the early temporal factor Imp - an RNA binding protein - can bind Delta mRNA. They state that Delta transcripts decrease over time (without any reference to a Figure or to published work), leading to the hypothesis that Delta mRNA is repressed by the late temporal factors. Over-expressing late factors Syp or E93 earlier in development leads to downregulation of a Delta::GFP protein trap. These results lead to a model in which Notch regulates expression of early temporal factors and early temporal factors regulate Notch activity through translation of Delta mRNA.</p><p>There are several strengths of this study. The authors report rigorous measurements and statistical analyses throughout the study. Their conclusions are appropriate for the results. Data mining revealed an important mechanism - that Imp binds Delta mRNA - supporting the model that early temporal factors promote Delta expression, which in turn promotes Notch signaling.</p><p>There are also several weaknesses:</p><p>1. The activation of Notch in NBs by Delta in GMCs was already shown by this group in their Dev 2022 paper, reducing some of the impact of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous work, we reported that Delta-expressing GMCs transactivate Notch in neuroblasts during the embryonic to larval transition. In the current manuscript, we show that Delta is expressed in GMCs and cortex glia and both sources transactivate Notch in neuroblasts during later developmental stages. This is in agreement with work published by others and while not novel per se, is a necessary first step for understanding which neighboring cell types control Notch pathway activity. During the embryonic to larval transition, glia do not contribute likely because they have not yet grown to ensheath CB NBs and their recently born progeny.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors do not explain their current results in context of their prior paper (2022 Dev) until the Discussion, but this would be useful to read in the Introduction. Similarly, it would be good to mention that in the 2022 paper, they find a significant number of wor&gt;Notch RNAi NBs at 2 AHL that are cycling. Are the adult Notch RNAi in this study descended from those NBs at 2 hours ALH in the 2022 study? In other words, how does the early requirement for Notch between 0-72 hours ALH reported in the current study relate to the Notch-depleted NBs identified in the 2022 paper?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the following text in the intro: “We recently reported that Notch signaling regulates CB NB quiescence during the embryonic to larval transition (Sood et al., 2022). When Notch is knocked down, some CB NBs continue dividing during this transition. We also reported that Notch activity becomes attenuated in quiescent CB NBs because CB NBs are no longer dividing and producing Delta-expressing GMC daughters for Notch pathway transactivation. Moreover, low Notch is necessary for CB NBs to reactivate from quiescence in response to dietary nutrients (Sood et al., 2022).</p><p>Here we report that Notch signaling also regulates neurogenesis termination during pupal stages. When Notch is knocked down, CB NBs maintain early temporal factor expression longer resulting in a delay of late temporal factor expression with prolonged neurogenesis into late pupal stages and early adulthood. This defect in temporal patterning (switching from early to late) occurs after CB NB exit from quiescence suggesting that Notch is required at multiple times throughout development in controlling CB NB proliferation decisions.”</p><p>We do not know whether the neuroblasts that fail to enter quiescence are the same that fail to terminate divisions during pupal stages, however there are many more that fail to terminate divisions during pupal stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Most of the experiments rely upon continuous depletion of Notch from embryonic stage 8 until adulthood using the wor-GAL4 driver. There is no lineage tracing of this driver and there is no citation about the published expression pattern of this driver. The inclusion of these details is important for a broad audience journal.</p></disp-quote><p>The reference for the driver is included in supplementary data, under the heading “Experimental model:<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>”. This GAL4 driver is widely used and one of the most accepted in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Most of the experiments utilize a single RNAi transgene for Notch, Delta, Imp, Syp, E93. There are no experiments demonstrating the efficacy of the RNAi lines and no references to prior use and/or efficacy of these lines.</p></disp-quote><p>All RNAi lines used in these studies have been published previously, by our group as well as others and sources for the lines are listed in supplementary data, under the heading “Experimental model:<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>”. Efficiency of these lines have been verified using antibody labeling (data not shown) and by assaying activity of Notch activity reporters (shown in Fig. 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An appraisal: The authors use temperature shifts with Gal80TS to show that Notch is required between 0-72 hours ALH. They show with the use of known markers of the temporal factors and Delta protein trap, that Imp promotes Delta protein expression and the later temporal factors reduce Delta, although the molecular mechanisms are not clearly delineated. Overall, these data support their model that the reduction of Delta expression during larval development leads to a loss of Notch activity.</p><p>As noted in the Discussion, this study raises many questions about what Notch does in larval CB NBs. For example, does it inhibit Castor or Imp? Is Notch required in certain neural lineages and not others. These studies will be of interest in the community of developmental neurobiologists.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Embryonic stem cells extensively proliferate to generate the necessary number of cells that are required for organogenesis, and their proliferation must be timely terminated to allow for proper patterning. Thus, timely termination of stem cell proliferation is critical for proper development. Numerous studies have suggested that cell-extrinsic changes in the surrounding niche environment drive the termination of stem cell proliferation. By contrast, cell-intrinsic mechanisms that terminate stem cell proliferation remain poorly understood. Fruit fly larval brain neuroblasts provide an excellent model for mechanistic investigation of intrinsic control of stem cell proliferation due to the wealth of information on molecular marks, gene functions and lineage hierarchy. Sood et al. conducted a genetic screen to identify genes that are required for the termination of neuroblast proliferation in metamorphosis and found that Notch and its ligand Delta contribute to their exit from cell cycle. They showed that knocking down Notch or delta function in larval neuroblasts allows them to persist into adulthood and remain proliferative when no neuroblasts can be detected in wild-type adult brains. By carrying out a well-designed temperature-shift experiment, the authors showed that Notch is required early during larval development to promote timely exit from cell cycle in metamorphosis. The authors went on to show that attenuating Notch signaling prolongs the expression of temporal identity genes castor and seven-up perturbing the switch from Imp to Syp/E93. Finally, they showed that knocking down Imp function or overexpressing E93 can restore the elimination of neuroblasts in Notch/delta mutant brains.</p><p>Overall, the experiments are well conceived and executed, and the data are clear. However, the data reported in this study represent incremental progress in improving our mechanistic understanding of the termination of neuroblast proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with this statement. Because Notch signaling is implicated in neurogenesis termination and Notch activity is regulated by GMCs and glia, it strongly suggests that NB proliferation and timing cues are controlled in a non-autonomous manner through direct interactions with NBs and their neighbors. This is in contrast to temporal patterning during embryogenesis which is largely believed to be controlled NB-autonomously. In addition, to our knowledge, no one has yet reported that CB NBs fail to terminate cell divisions on time when Notch activity is reduced during normal development. In fact, reported NB phenotypes associated with Notch loss of function have been surprisingly subtle until now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the data seem to represent more careful analyses of previously published observations described in the Zacharioudaki et al., Development 2016 paper while others seem to contradict to the results in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>The Zacharioudaki et al., Development 2016 paper is terrific. One key difference between our work and theirs, is that we look at Notch pathway knockdown and loss of function phenotypes, whereas in the Zacharioudaki 2016 paper, the authors report phenotypes associated with Notch constitutive activation. It has been known for some time that constitutively active Notch leads to tumorigenic phenotypes particularly in type II lineages. Zacharioudaki and colleagues further determined that some of the classically known temporal transcription factors were ectopically expressed in these stem cell tumors.Here we show that under normal developmental conditions, Notch pathway activity controls CB NB temporal patterning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Gaultier et al., Sci. Adv. 2022 suggested that Grainyhead is required for the termination of neuroblast proliferation in a neuroblast tumor model, and grainyhead is a direct target of Notch signaling. Thus, Grainyhead should be a key downstream effector of Notch signaling in terminating castor and seven-up expression. Identical to Notch signaling, Grainyhead is also expressed through larval development. Grainyhead can function as a classical transcription factor as well as a pioneer factor raising the possibility that temporal regulation of neurogenic enhancer accessibility might be at play in allowing Notch signaling in early larval development to set up termination of castor and seven-up expression in metamorphosis. Diving deeper into how dynamic changes in chromatin in neurogenic enhancers affect the termination of neuroblast proliferation will significantly improve our understanding of termination of stem cell proliferation in diverse developing tissue.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, the authors investigate the effects of Notch pathway inactivation on the termination of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts at the end of development. They find that termination is delayed, while temporal patterning progression is slowed down. Forcing temporal patterning progression in a Notch pathway mutant restores the correct timing of neuroblast elimination. Finally, they show that Imp, an early temporal patterning factor promotes Delta expression in neuroblast lineages. This indicates that feedback loops between temporal patterning and lineage-intrinsic Notch activity fine tunes timing of early to late temporal transitions and is important to schedule NB termination at the end of development.</p><p>The study adds another layer of regulation that finetunes temporal progression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cells. This mechanism appears to be mainly lineage intrinsic - Delta being expressed from NBs and their progeny, but also partly niche-mediated - Delta being also expressed in glia but with a minor influence. Together with a recent study (PMID: 36040415), this work suggests that Notch signaling is a key player in promoting temporal progression in various temporal patterning system. As such it is of broad interest for the neuro-developmental community.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The data are based on genetic experiments which are clearly described and mostly convincing.

A similar mechanism has been recently described, although in a different temporal patterning system (medulla neuroblasts of the optic lobe - PMID: 36040415). It is overall of broad interest for the neuro-developmental community.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>The mechanisms by which Notch signaling regulates temporal patterning progression are not investigated in details. For example, it is not clear whether Notch signaling directly regulates temporal patterning genes, or whether the phenotypes observed are indirect (for example through the regulation of the cell-cycle speed). The authors could have investigated whether temporal patterning genes are directly regulated by the Notch pathway via ChIP-seq of Su(H) or the identification of potential binding sites for Su(H) in enhancers.</p></disp-quote><p>This is already known for svp and cas and we have now included this information in the discussion.Thank you.</p><p>“Whether Notch pathway activity curtails both Cas and Svp or just Cas remains an open question, however it has been reported that both cas and svp are associated with at least one enhancer that is responsive to Notch activity (Zacharioudaki et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A similar approach has been recently undertaken by the lab of Dr Xin Li, to show that Notch signaling regulates sequential expression of temporal patterning factors in optic lobes neuroblasts (PMID: 36040415), which exhibit a different temporal patterning system than central brain neuroblasts in the present study.

Because we examine brains over time, these cells can be tracked using the markers, Scrib, Dpn, and pcna. These cells also undergo asymmetric cell division (Refer to Fig. S2F) and express other markers characteristic of CB NBs (mir and insc-not shown). We have made clones and see the same phenotype (ectopic persistence) in both MARCM clones and in “flip-out” clones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have a few issues that need to be addressed to reinforce some of the conclusions:</p><p>1. It is unclear whether NBs that persist in late pupal or adult stages have just failed to differentiate or whether they continue to divide, leading to supernumerary progeny (as shown for NBs that are stalled in temporal patterning like in svp mutant NBs (Maurange et al. 2008)). EdU or PH3 staining could be done in adults to clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>In this manuscript, we make use of pcna:GFP, a reporter for E2F activity as an indicator of cell proliferation. We certainly observe Dpn positive cells that only weakly express the reporter, suggesting that these cells are not actively dividing or dividing at a reduced rate. However, by far most of the ectopically persisting CB NBs strongly express the reporter and generate pcnaGFP expressing progeny, indicating that these cells are dividing. We have also stained tissues with PH3 and have included an image of a telophase dlRNAi expressing CB NB at 48 hours APF (Fig. S2F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is unclear whether Notch signaling directly or indirectly regulates temporal transitions. One possibility is that knockdown of Notch signaling decreases cell-cycle speed leading to delayed temporal transitions. The authors should test whether Notch KD affects cell cycle speed using EdU incorporation or PH3 staining. This could be done best using Notch mutant MARCM clones as wt NBs can be used as controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the number of PH3 positive CB NBs during wandering L3 stages in control and dlRNAi animals. We find that dlRNAi CB NBs are indeed proliferating at reduced rates compared to controls. To test whether reduced cell cycle times are causative for termination delay, we expressed a constitutively active form of PI3-kinase in dlRNAi animals to drive cell growth and proliferation. We found that CB NBs still ectopically persist (Fig. S2E-G).</p><p>We have included the following in the text:</p><p>“Defects in timing of temporal transitions could be due to defects in cell cycle progression, although embryonic NBs still transition independent of cell division (Grosskortenhaus et al., 2005). We used PH3 to assay CB NB mitotic activity. In Delta knock down animals, the percentage of PH3 positive CB NBs was reduced compared to control (Fig. S2E). At 48 h APF however, Delta knock down CB NBs were still dividing based on PH3 expression (Fig. S2F). To determine whether CB NBs ectopically persist due to defects in cell cycle rate, we co-expressed dp110 to constitutively activate PI3-kinase in Delta knock down animals. A significant number of pcnaGFP expressing, Dpn positive CB NBs were still observed, suggesting that defects in cell cycle timing and growth rates alone cannot account for ectopic persistence of CB NBs into later developmental stages and adulthood (Fig. S2G).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Cas is expressed in NBs either during quiescence and shortly after quiescence. It is possible that the maintenance of Cas in Figure 5D, E is due to NBs that have not re-entered the cell-cycle or have exited quiescence with a strong delay.</p></disp-quote><p>Knockdown of Notch pathway has no effect on CB NB reactivation from developmental quiescence. In fact, low levels of Notch are required for CB NBs to reactivate in response to dietary nutrients (Sood, 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indeed, the authors have previously shown that Notch signaling is important for NB cell cycle reentry during early larval stages (PMID: 35112131).

The authors have revisited some previously published RNA-seq data showing that Delta is temporally regulated in NB lineages. This is not clearly shown by the authors that the same is true at the protein level.</p><p>Moreover, they find that mis-expression of late temporal factors or Imp knockdown in early larval brains appear to decrease Delta expression. Such semi-quantitative analysis of gene expression by immunostainings in different conditions can be a bit complicated and not very convincing because variations on intensity levels can be due to slight variations in antibody concentration, or different parameters of image acquisition.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree, but in this case the difference compared to controls was so readily apparent, that we felt it was not necessary to carry out experiments in clones. All images were acquired with the same confocal settings, experiments were repeated, and we consistently observed the same results. The data shown in Fig. 7D-G is representative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I suggest that the authors use clonal analysis rather than pan-neuroblast manipulation in order to have internal controls. For example, blocking temporal progression in Syp-RNAi clones (MARCM or Flp-out) and/or svp MARCM clones should lead to maintenance of Imp expression in late larval clones and maintenance of high levels of Delta, which would be easily assessed compared to surrounding NBs.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>Fig 5: the sequential expression of Cas and Svp expression in larval NBs was first described by Maurange et al. 2008.
