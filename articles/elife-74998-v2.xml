attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined neuronal discharge characteristics in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of IRSp53/Baiap2-mutant mice, which show social deficits, during social approach. We found a decrease in the proportion of IRSp53-mutant excitatory mPFC neurons encoding social information, but not that encoding non-social information. In addition, the firing activity of IRSp53-mutant neurons was less differential between social and non-social targets. IRSp53-mutant excitatory mPFC neurons displayed an increase in baseline neuronal firing, but decreases in the variability and dynamic range of firing as well as burst firing during social and non-social target approaches compared to wild-type controls. Treatment of memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist that rescues social deficit in IRSp53-mutant mice, alleviates the reduced burst firing of IRSp53-mutant pyramidal mPFC neurons. These results suggest that suppressed neuronal activity dynamics and burst firing may underlie impaired cortical encoding of social information and social behaviors in IRSp53-mutant mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>firing variability</kwd><kwd>IRSp53</kwd><kwd>medial prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>social behavior</kwd><kwd>BAIAP2</kwd><kwd>social deficit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2022M3E5E8018388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Eunee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003625</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KHDI HI21C1659</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Eunee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2019R1A2C4069863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paik</surname><given-names>Se-Bum</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010446</institution-id><institution>Institute for Basic Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IBS-R002-D2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>Min Whan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010446</institution-id><institution>Institute for Basic Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IBS-R002-D1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Eunjoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Social deficits in IRSp53/Baiap2-mutant mice accompany decreases in prefrontal neuronal firing variability, burst firing, and social information decoding accuracy, and memantine-dependent NMDAR inhibition, which rescues social deficits, alleviates burst firing, suggesting that burst firing links NMDAR dysfunction with social deficits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Social dysfunction is a key feature of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). Among the various brain regions involved in social regulation, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays critical roles in integrative and higher cognitive brain functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yan and Rein, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yizhar and Levy, 2021</xref>). Previous studies identified a number of mechanisms associated with dysfunctions under a social context. Examples include an imbalance of neuronal excitation/inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Selimbeyoglu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelson and Valakh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019</xref>), impaired cortical social representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miura et al., 2020</xref>), and the disruption of local oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>). Given that social behaviors represent outcomes of complex interactions among multiple underlying neural processes, further mechanistic explorations are needed to be investigated in the context of additional genes and various psychiatric disorders.</p><p>Insulin receptor substrate protein 53 kDa (IRSp53) encoded by the <italic>BAIAP2</italic> gene is a postsynaptic scaffolding and adaptor protein at excitatory synapses that interacts with other key components of the postsynaptic density such as PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soltau et al., 2004</xref>).

Functionally, IRSp53 regulates actin filament dynamics at excitatory synapses and dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scita et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>IRSp53 deficiency in mice leads to excitatory synaptic deficits and various behavioral deficits, including hyperactivity, cognitive impairments, and social deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bobsin and Kreienkamp, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sawallisch et al., 2009</xref>). IRSp53 knockout (KO) mice have fewer dendritic spines and enhanced NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function; they show impaired social behavior that is rescued by pharmacological NMDAR suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, mPFC neurons in IRSp53-KO mice show reduced neuronal firing under urethane-anesthesia, which is acutely normalized by pharmacological NMDAR suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). However, it remained unknown whether and how the social behavioral deficits are associated with altered mPFC neural activity in waking-state animals engaged in social interaction.</p><p>To study the neural abnormalities of the mPFC associated with social dysfunction in IRSp53-KO mice, we herein performed single-unit recordings in freely moving mice engaged in social interactions in a linear social-interaction chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). We found that excitatory neurons in the mPFC of IRSp53-KO mice display narrower dynamic ranges of firing rate and reduced burst firing. As a consequence, they showed lower discrimination between social and object targets compared to those of wild-type (WT) control. Our results uncover a novel social coding deficit associated with IRSp53-KO.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Social impairments in IRSp53-KO mice in the linear-chamber social-interaction test</title><p>To compare neuronal activities in the mPFC of WT and IRSp53-KO mice during social interaction, we performed single-unit recordings in mice engaged in social interaction in a linear-chamber social-interaction apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The chamber, a long corridor connected with two side chambers with targets, was designed to measure neuronal activity during social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). A subject mouse was first placed in a separate circular rest box for 5 min for recording of resting neural activity. The mouse was then placed into the linear social-interaction chamber and allowed to explore the chamber with both side chambers being empty (empty-empty/E-E session) for 10 min. This was followed by a session in which one of the side chambers contained a novel social target (S; a conspecific male mouse) and the other contained a novel inanimate object (O) (first S-O session), and another session where the S and O were switched (second S-O session), which was included to control for side (or location)-specific as opposed to target-specific neural activity. The positions of mice in the linear chamber during experiments were determined using the DeepLabCut program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lauer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>), which automatically marked the subject mouseâs nose, ears, body center, and tail base as well as the social targetâs nose and body center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Sniffing time was defined as the time when the mouseâs nose was within a distance of 3 cm from the front face of the target chamber. In-zone time was defined as the time when the body center (midpoint between the nose and tail base) fell in the area within 9 cm from the front face of the target chamber.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Social impairments in IRSp53-KO mice in the linear-chamber social-interaction test.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the linear-chamber social-interaction test used to measure social approach towards a novel conspecific mouse (S, social) versus a novel non-social target (O, object).

After the last recording, the locations of all tetrodes were assessed via histology, and data from those falling within the area of interest were used for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>In the E-E session, WT and IRSp53-KO mice showed a preference for neither chamber, as assessed by sniffing and in-zone durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>).

The latter suggests that the impaired social preference is less likely to be caused by genotypic differences in olfactory processing speeds. In fact, a previous report has shown that IRSp53-KO mice display normal olfactory function in the buried food-seeking test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>).

Total durations of both proximal and distal social interactions were reduced in IRSp53-KO mice during the first, but not second, S-O session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). For object interaction, the distance between the subject mouseâs nose and the center of the object chamber face was assessed.

In contrast, there was a trend for higher minimum instantaneous firing rates in IRSp53-KO pExc neurons than WT pExc neurons (p=0.0544; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Consequently, the dynamic range of firing rate (the difference between the maximum and minimum instantaneous firing rates) during the linear chamber test was significantly narrower for IRSp53-KO pExc neurons than WT pExc neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>We next examined whether the limited firing-rate range is specific to social conditions. While the firing-rate range significantly increases from the E-E session to the first and second S-O sessions in WT neurons, these changes in firing-rate range were not observed in KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Although the firing-rate range is comparable between genotypes in the resting state, it was significantly narrower in IRSp53-KO than WT mPFC neurons in both E-E (non-social) and S-O (social) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1DâG</xref>). These results suggest that the limited firing-rate range in IRSp53-KO neurons is most salient during, but not restricted to, the social condition.</p><p>Another difference we noticed was that while WT neurons often remain silent and show abrupt increases in firing rate at specific time points, IRSp53-KO neurons tended to be active more chronically with their instantaneous firing rates fluctuating around the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To test whether this is indeed the case, we examined the distribution of instantaneous firing rates of WT and IRSp53-KO neurons (normalized to the maximum firing rate). As expected, IRSp53-KO neurons had a significantly lower proportion of time-bins in the lowest firing rate (0â0.1) and instead higher proportions in mid-range firing rates (0.2â0.6) compared to the WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Given the reduced firing-rate range, we hypothesized that the firing rate variability of IRSp53-KO pExc neurons may also be decreased. We defined the firing rate variability of each neuron by the sigma value (1 standard deviation around the mean) of its instantaneous firing rates. We found that the instantaneous firing rates of IRSp53-KO neurons were indeed less variable, as indicated by a decrease in the sigma value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In order to test if this decrease in variability in IRSp53-KO neurons is dependent upon the mean firing rate, the relationship between mean firing rates and sigma values was compared between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). As indicated by the significant decrease in the interceptâand comparable slopeâ of the linear regression, IRSp53-KO neurons were generally less variable in instantaneous firing activity regardless of their mean discharge rate. This decrease in sigma value was observed consistently across the analyses using variable sizes of time window for calculating instantaneous firing rate, ranging from 0.5 to 5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>The reduced variability was specific to the recordings from social conditions but not the rest period and non-social conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1IâL</xref>). Similar to firing-rate range, WT neurons showed increased variability in instantaneous firing rate during the first S-O session compared to the E-E session, while IRSp53-KO neurons showed similar levels of variability across the three sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The increase in the variability of IRSp53-KO neuronal activity during the first S-O session could not be accounted for by the difference in mean firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1M</xref>).

We therefore alternatively eliminated the tonic spikes (ISI &gt;10ms) to assess whether burst alone is sufficient to support the observed genotypic differences in firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2H</xref>).

A key finding of the study is that decreased firing rate variability, limited dynamic range, and decreased burst firing in IRSp53-KO putative excitatory mPFC neurons are accompanied by significant decrease in social-responsive neurons and reduced decoding performance discriminating social and non-social cues. Memantine, known to rescue social deficits in IRSp53-KO mice, increases burst firing in IRSp53-KO neurons, whereas it decreases burst firing in WT neurons, without affecting total firing in both WT and IRSp53-KO neurons.</p><p>The most salient feature observed herein for IRSp53-KO mPFC neurons is a low proportion of social neurons, but not the other target neurons. This finding suggests that reduced ratios of social/non-social encoding neurons may contribute to social deficits. Similar disruptions in cortical representation of social contexts have been reported in previous studies on mouse models of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levy et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, weakened response during social exploration is observed in mouse models with social deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brumback et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The decreased firing-rate range and burst firing in IRSp53-KO mPFC putative excitatory neurons were observed in both social (S-O session) and non-social (E-E session) conditions, although they were not observed in resting conditions. It is conceivable that, as the subject mice are repeatedly exposed to the linear chamber test, the subject mice in the E-E session may remember the interaction with another social target in the past S-O sessions and may expect a social target in advance. Therefore, E-E sessions may have some aspects of social context, which might have been manifested as decreases in firing rate range and burst firing in IRSp53-KO neurons in the E-E session.</p><p>IRSp53-KO mPFC putative excitatory neurons display increased firing rates under resting conditions. It is unclear how this increase is caused. A change in the intrinsic excitability is unlikely because baseline firing was not changed in IRSp53-KO mPFC layer 5 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Although further details remain to be determined, the increased baseline firing in resting conditions might make the mutant neurons ânoisierâ or have limited dynamic firing range, disrupting the reliable filtration and transduction of important signals, such as, social and sensory cues, as reported previously for <italic>Cntnap2-</italic>mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levy et al., 2019</xref>) and <italic>Ptchd1</italic>-mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakajima et al., 2019</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Notably, a previous study reports that IRSp53-KO mPFC neurons display decreased firing rates, compared with WT neurons, under urethane anesthesia conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). Brain circuits are known to be more active during the awake state, compared to an anesthetized state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht and Davidowa, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shumkova et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, urethane has diverse effects on neurotransmitter receptors (GABA, glycine, acetylcholine, NMDA, and AMPA receptors) and neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accorsi-MendonÃ§a et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hara and Harris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sceniak and Maciver, 2006</xref>). Given the broad effects of urethane, it would be difficult to narrow down and specify the key mechanism underlying the difference between awake and anesthetized states in IRSp53-KO mice.</p><p>The fact that social deficits are induced by IRSp53 deletion in mice may help us better understand social-related neural mechanisms at multiple levels, including actin dynamics at excitatory synapses, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic balance, NMDAR modulation, and burst firing. IRSp53 is a signaling adaptor and scaffolding protein that regulates excitatory synaptic actin dynamics and dendritic spine morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2016</xref>). IRSp53/BAIAP2-related mutations in humans have been implicated in ASD, ADHD, and schizophrenia. IRSp53 deletion in mice alters excitatory synapse number and function in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bobsin and Kreienkamp, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sawallisch et al., 2009</xref>). IRSp53 deletion also abnormally strengthens excitatory synaptic actin filaments and NMDAR activity through impaired long-term depression of NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, inhibiting the NMDAR hyperactivity by memantine treatment rapidly normalizes the social deficits in IRSp53-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggest that (1) actin modulatory proteins could have strong impacts on NMDAR function, supporting the reported link between dysregulated actin and mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yan et al., 2016</xref>), (2) excessive NMDAR function could lead to social deficits, corroborating the NMDAR dysfunction hypothesis for ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2015a</xref>), (3) altered balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission could lead to social deficits, supporting the excitation/inhibition imbalance hypothesis for ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelson and Valakh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>), and (4) NMDAR modulators have a therapeutic potential for social dysfunction-related psychiatric disorders.</p><p>Our current results extend these findings by proposing that decreased firing variability and burst firing may connect NMDAR dysfunction with prefrontal social encoding and behavioral social deficits in IRSp53-KO mice. In support of this hypothesis, memantine, which rescues social deficits in IRSp53-KO mice, normalizes the decreased burst firing in mPFC neurons. Burst firing has been implicated in stronger presynaptic release, reliable synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, information processing, and neuropeptide release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krahe and Gabbiani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lisman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Payeur et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, burst firing can be regulated by NMDARs in various types of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark and Chiodo, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grienberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zweifel et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, Shank2-KO mice with NMDAR hypofunction display social deficits accompanying impaired prefrontal social representation that are responsive to pharmacological NMDAR activation or optogenetic burst activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Won et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, it remains unclear how IRSp53-KO prelimbic neurons show impaired target-induced burst firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) despite that their NMDAR function is increased in layer 5 prelimbic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noh et al., 2022</xref>), and how acute memantine treatment increases and decreases burst firing in WT and IRSp53-KO neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>). Memantine is known to act on extrasynaptic NMDARs but not on synaptic NMDARs at low concentrations, which was found to be useful for suppressing the neurotoxic effects of extrasynaptic NMDAR activation in Alzheimerâs and Huntingtonâs diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Okamoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xia et al., 2010</xref>). It is therefore possible that the amount and balance of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs might have been altered in IRSp53-KO mice in a way that memantine acts more strongly on extrasynaptic NMDARs relative to synaptic receptors, leading to strong memantine-induced disinhibition of synaptic NMDARs, whereas, in WT synapses, memantine acts more strongly on synaptic NMDARs relative to extrasynaptic NMDARs. This difference might involve excessive accumulation of NMDARs at IRSp53-KO synaptic sites, caused by abnormal actin stabilization and limited LTD of NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>), which might induce extrasynaptic accumulation of NMDARs. This might induce suppressed burst firing in mutant neurons and enhanced burst firing in memantine-treated mutant neurons, given the reported synergistic effects between synaptic NMDARs and burst firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It should be pointed out, however, that because neural activity and behavior occurs in a simultaneous manner, it remains unclear whether the changes in neural activity cause social deficit, or rather, social deficit results in changes in neural activity. For instance, we do not know whether the reduced proportion of social encoding neurons represents the cause of limited social brain functions, or rather, is an outcome of reduced social interaction or even limited sensory input. In addition, although our research focuses on the mPFC, we cannot rule out the possibility that the differences in firing in IRSp53-KO pExc mPFC neurons may have stemmed from deficits other brain regions.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that IRSp53-KO mice display elevated spontaneous firing and reduced firing variability and burst firing in mPFC neurons, which may suppress cortical social representation and induce behavioral social deficits. In addition, memantine that can rescue social deficits in IRSp53-KO mice improves reduced burst firing in mPFC neurons, suggesting that burst firing may link NMDAR dysfunction with social deficits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>IRSp53 (Baiap2</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2009</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DeepLabCut</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lauer et al., 2022</xref>;

The instantaneous firing rates at the center zone across the E-E, first S-O and second S-O sessions were also calculated. To calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (auROCs), we generated histograms comparing the distribution of instantaneous firing rates across target sniffing trials and the distribution of instantaneous firing rates at the center zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Britten et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The target sniffing and center zone firing rate distributions were compared by moving a threshold from minimum to the maximum firing rate (x-axis of the histogram). The range of threshold was divided into 100 bins. ROC curves were generated by plotting the probability that the target sniffing firing rate was greater than the threshold against the probability that the center zone firing rate was greater than the threshold. The calculated auROCs (0â1.0) indicate the response of each neuron to targets relative to the center zone. Neurons with less than 40 instantaneous firing rates (i.e. shorter than 20 s) for any targets or center zone were removed from analysis.</p><p>We also randomly shuffled these target sniffing and center zone instantaneous firing rates and then calculated the shuffled auROC for 1000 times.

neocortical neural activity, as related to social behavior and in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders. These results provide new data on how the loss of the postsynaptic scaffolding and adaptor protein IRSp53 impacts prefrontal cortex activity and social interaction in mice. The authors propose the interesting idea that suppressed neuronal activity dynamics and burst firing may contribute to the impaired cortical encoding of social information and social behaviors in IRSp53-mutant mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74998.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Xiang</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02v51f717</institution-id><institution>Peking University</institution></institution-wrap><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.11.17.468945">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.17.468945v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. More evidence of social impairments in IRSp53 KO mice. Based on the results of Figure 1, the authors stated that KO animals 'display social impairments', but this may not be the only interpretation of their data. In Figure 1E, time spent sniffing the objects during the first S-O session is not significantly different between wild-types and KOs, although variability is higher in KOs; similarly, social sniff times are also variable. Perhaps the KO animals have somewhat stronger sniffs, or are faster at processing the olfactory information, requiring them to spend less time sniffing and remaining in the in-zone. Please address this comment by providing further data demonstrating social impairments in KO mice.</p><p>2. Stronger evidence that the observed changes in firing rate really reflect differences in response to social and non-social targets in WT and IRSp53 KO mice. In the identified single-units in the mPFC of either WT or IRSp53 KO, only 10% were responsive to social and/or object targets, while 90% of the recorded units are not responsive to either target (Figure 7E). Consistently, the mean firing rate in E-E, fS-O and sS-O are similar in both WT and KO mice (Figure 3-supplement 1E), indicating that the presence of social targets had little effect in regulating most of the recorded mPFC neurons. Therefore, it is not convincing that the recorded mPFC neurons play an essential role in discriminating social targets. Please examine whether the FR range and burst firing proportion are different between WT and KO in resting and non-social conditions.</p><p>3. Suggestions for further data analysis. Perhaps moving the classification in Figure 7 to earlier in the manuscript, and analyzing firing rate statistics separately for 'social' vs 'non-social' neurons. Does unit classification (i.e., of 'social' or not) hold up across sessions or episodes of engagement within a session? If these really are 'social' units, presumably that aspect should be reliable across interactions with different mice.</p><p>4. Further analysis of firing rate data. To what extent are changes in the max firing rate during social task / the discrimination index explained by changes in bursting explain all of this? If one takes out the bursts, e.g., eliminate bursts in the spike trains â do changes in the discrimination index, etc. go away? Please also assess the proportion of social and object neurons in shuffled data to rule out the possibility that changes in the proportions of these neurons is due to nonspecific changes in activity. Other suggestions for further analysis include looking at single cell metrics, e.g., area under the receiver operator curve, mutual information, etc.</p><p>5. Cleaner analysis relating the unit spike trains to moment-to-moment features of social interaction or other behaviors occurring during the S-O sessions. The authors use machine learning to classify mouse part position, but only seem to mark where the mouse is in the track. The unit activity over time might be much more interesting if correlated with DeepLabCut-based analysis of what the animal was doing (or perhaps what the social interaction partner was doing) during the sessions. Please correlate behavior to activity, both of individual units and of simultaneously-recorded populations.</p><p>6. The authors found that the average resting firing rates of excitatory mPFC neurons in awake IRSp53-KO mice are larger than that in WT mice (Figure 1C and 1D). These results are opposite to their previous findings obtained from anaesthetized mice (Chung et al., 2015, Figure 8b and 8c). However, no such difference was observed between awake and anaesthetized WT animals. Please discuss.</p><p>7. Additional data on the contribution of NMDA receptors to observed changes in firing, Additional data on the effects of NMDAR antagonists could significantly strengthen the manuscript by potentially providing some mechanistic information and strengthening the correlation between changes in these physiological measures and changes in behavior.

Further discussion on social behavior deficits in IRSp53 KO mice and how components of excitatory synapses contribute to autism. While there may be few autism patients with IRSp53 mutations, IRSp53 is an important component of excitatory synapses. If IRSp53 KO mice have social deficits similar to autism-related genes with similar physiological functions, the findings of this study may have more general significance.</p><p>9. Further discussion on how changes in activity related to abnormal social behavior, or whether abnormal social behavior cause decreased release e.g., of a neuromodulator, that cause these changes in neural activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The broader significance of these findings is questionable because the relevance of this model to autism is unclear, the actual magnitudes of differences between genotypes are very small, and the relationship of changes in neural activity to either underlying mechanisms or behavior is unclear. When you put all of these things together, it's unclear how these findings lead to a general insight into how the brain works or autism. These issues could be addressed if a) the link between this gene and autism was much stronger, b) there was some exploration of the effects of NMDAR antagonists which reverse behavioral deficits such as memantine, and/or c) there was substantially greater exploration of how bursting contributes to encoding social information that lead to new insights into fundamental biology. As it stands, while I find the results interesting, it's hard to see what is the big insight that would justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic> vs. a more specialized neuroscience journal.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1. There is a lot of discussion about 'decoding' but the authors do not actually examine this, e.g., by building a decoder, or even looking at single cell metrics, e.g., area under the receiver operator curve, mutual information, etc. This is critical because the dynamic range of a neuron is not the only determinant of how much information is transmitted about a stimulus. In particular, it is possible that decreased variability, either at the single cell or population level, compensates for changes in dynamic range (which are not accounted for in the discrimination index).</p><p>2. To what extent are changes in the max firing rate during social task / the discrimination index explained by changes in bursting explain all of this?

Some intuition for / discussion about how increased NMDAR function or other neurobiological mechanisms cause decreased bursting is warranted.</p><p>4. As the authors allude to, it can be difficult to disentangle cause and effect in studies like this. E.g., are changes in activity a cause of abnormal social behavior, or does abnormal social behavior cause decreased release e.g., of a neuromodulator, that cause these changes in neural activity. This is very difficult to work out, and I don't think it is a fatal issue but some additional discussion / acknowledgement of this is warranted.</p><p>5. The authors might want to assess the proportion of social and object neurons in shuffled data to rule out the possibility that changes in the proportions of these neurons simply reflect nonspecific changes in activity. This does not seem to be the case because the proportion goes up for the empty chamber but it is easy enough to do this.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Suppressed prefrontal neuronal firing variability and impaired social representation in IRSp53-mutant mice&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

More evidence of social impairments in IRSp53 KO mice. Based on the results of Figure 1, the authors stated that KO animals 'display social impairments', but this may not be the only interpretation of their data. In Figure 1E, time spent sniffing the objects during the first S-O session is not significantly different between wild-types and KOs, although variability is higher in KOs; similarly, social sniff times are also variable. Perhaps the KO animals have somewhat stronger sniffs, or are faster at processing the olfactory information, requiring them to spend less time sniffing and remaining in the in-zone. Please address this comment by providing further data demonstrating social impairments in KO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and attempted to take a closer look at the genotypic differences in sniffing behaviors. We divided the social interactions into two groups (proximal and distal), in which proximal interaction is defined as bi-directional social interaction in which the distance between the noses of the subject mice and social target mice is less than 2.5 cm while distal interaction is defined as social interaction occurring in the range of nose distance between 2.5 and 10 cm (Figure 1G). We found, in the first S-O session, that KO mice showed decreased social interactions in both proximal and distal zones, as compared with WT mice (Figure 1G). Intriguingly, KO mice showed significantly increased object interaction in the distal but not proximal zone (Figure 1I). In the second S-O session, KO mice showed social and object interactions comparable to those in WT mice (Figure 1H,J). The ratio of time spent in the proximal versus distal zone during target sniffing was not different between genotype (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A,B). These results collectively suggest that KO mice show suppressed social interaction in both proximal and distal zones and enhanced object interaction in the distal but not proximal zone, further suggesting impaired social interaction in KO mice.</p><p>In addition, we have already shown that the mean sniffing durations per single sniffing event are comparable between genotypes for empty, social, and object targets (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E). Instead, the number of visits to the social targets is significantly lower in the KO mice compared to the WT mice (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D). If KO animals have somewhat stronger sniffs, or are faster at processing olfactory information, the duration per sniffing event is highly likely to be shorter in the KO mice, which is not the case in IRSp53 KO mice for both social and object targets.</p><p>Other lines of evidence supporting social deficits in IRSp53-KO mice used in the present study have been previously reported, which include the results from the three-chamber test, reciprocal dyadic social-interaction test, and ultrasonic vocalization test (Chung et al., 2015). In addition, IRSp53-KO mice have been demonstrated to have normal olfactory function, as supported by the buried food seeking test (Chung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). We commented on these results in the Results section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Stronger evidence that the observed changes in firing rate really reflect differences in response to social and non-social targets in WT and IRSp53 KO mice. In the identified single-units in the mPFC of either WT or IRSp53 KO, only 10% were responsive to social and/or object targets, while 90% of the recorded units are not responsive to either target (Figure 7E). Consistently, the mean firing rate in E-E, fS-O and sS-O are similar in both WT and KO mice (Figure 3-supplement 1E), indicating that the presence of social targets had little effect in regulating most of the recorded mPFC neurons. Therefore, it is not convincing that the recorded mPFC neurons play an essential role in discriminating social targets. Please examine whether the FR range and burst firing proportion are different between WT and KO in resting and non-social conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment as well. We performed additional analysis and now clearly show that although the firing rate range is comparable between genotypes during the resting condition, it is significantly lower in KO neurons in both E-E session (non-social condition) and S-O sessions (social conditions) (Figure 6â figure supplement 1DâG). We additionally show that the firing rate range increases during the S-O sessions compared to that during the E-E session only in WT neurons but not in KO neurons (Figure 6â figure supplement 1C). These results suggest that although reduced firing rate range in the KO mice is not absolutely specific to social conditions, its reduction is most salient in the social context.</p><p>We also show, by additional analyses, that, similar to the firing rate range, decreases in burst are present in both E-E and S-O sessions, but not in the resting session (Figure 7D, Figure 7â figure supplement 1AâC). This result suggests that the reduced burst firing is not specific to social conditions.</p><p>However, there are other possible interpretations of these results as well. Because neural activity was recorded repeatedly over multiple days, subject mice in the E-E session may remember the interaction with another social target in the past S-O sessions, and may expect a social target in advance. Therefore, E-E session may have some aspects of social context as well, which may have appeared in the form of decreased firing-rate range and burst in the KO neurons in the E-E session. In fact, we have added several new findings that suggest the possibility that burst firing may underlie impaired cortical encoding of social information in IRSp53-KO mice, which weâll discuss in our responses to comment #4 and #7.</p><p>We also attempted to address the general concern for the need of stronger evidence for the genotype differences in firing rate using the support vector machine classifier, which is discussed in our responses to comment #4 in detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Suggestions for further data analysis. Perhaps moving the classification in Figure 7 to earlier in the manuscript, and analyzing firing rate statistics separately for 'social' vs 'non-social' neurons. Does unit classification (i.e., of 'social' or not) hold up across sessions or episodes of engagement within a session? If these really are 'social' units, presumably that aspect should be reliable across interactions with different mice.</p></disp-quote><p>In response, we moved the classification of social and object responsive neurons (previously Figure 7) to Figure 3.</p><p>We conducted an additional analysis on the consistency of firing in response to targets. In order to assess whether the unit classifications hold up across sessions, we plotted the mean firing rate responses (z-score) of neurons during target sniffing in the first S-O session against those in the second S-O session. We found positive correlations in both WT and KO neurons for both social and object targets (Figure 3â figure supplement 2A,B), which suggests that the responses of neurons to a target are largely consistent across sessions.</p><p>It was previously reported that the prefrontal neurons that encode social information do not engage in all social behavior epochs but rather show âtrial-to-trial stochasticityâ (Liang et al., 2018). Similarly, we calculated the overall trial consistency of social and object neurons and found that both WT and KO neurons display consistencies over 50%, which suggests that responses of social and object neurons do not occur by chance. In addition, they display comparable levels of trial-to-trial stochasticity (Figure 3â figure supplement 2GâI).</p><p>In order to record different units in each recording experiment, the implanted tetrodes were lowered by 62.5 Âµm after each recording. Because we used the same subject mice for both S-O sessions, we were unable to assess whether our social units are reliable across interactions with âdifferentâ mice. However, we fully appreciate this comment and are eager to address this in our future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Further analysis of firing rate data. To what extent are changes in the max firing rate during social task / the discrimination index explained by changes in bursting explain all of this? If one takes out the bursts, e.g., eliminate bursts in the spike trains â do changes in the discrimination index, etc. go away? Please also assess the proportion of social and object neurons in shuffled data to rule out the possibility that changes in the proportions of these neurons is due to nonspecific changes in activity. Other suggestions for further analysis include looking at single cell metrics, e.g., area under the receiver operator curve, mutual information, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the issue of burst, we attempted to eliminate the bursts (ISI â¤ 10 msec) in the spike trains and were able to clearly show that the decreases in spike variability, firing-rate range, and discriminability between social and object targets still remain after burst elimination (Figure 7â figure supplement 2AâG). However, we were aware that simple elimination of burst spikes, post-recording, do not eliminate the real-time effects of bursts on neighboring neurons during the recording. In fact, it has been reported that burst spikes increase the probability of post-neuronal spike more effectively than tonic spikes (Krahe and Gabbiani, 2004; Lisman, 1997). Therefore, we alternatively assessed whether burst alone is sufficient for the genotypic differences in firing rate by eliminating the tonic spikes. We found that overall spike variability and firing-rate range during linear chamber exploration were still reduced in the KO neurons after tonic spike elimination (Figure 7â figure supplement 2HâL). In addition, the extent of discriminability between social and object targets were maintained in both WT and KO neurons, and still lower in KO neurons compared to WT neurons, after tonic spike elimination (Figure 7â figure supplement 2N). Interestingly, the left versus right side discrimination in the E-E session was intact in WT neurons with burst spikes alone but not in KO neurons, suggesting that burst spikes may also play a role in side discriminability (Figure 7â figure supplement 2M). While decreased burst may affect left versus right side discriminability in KO neurons, tonic spikes may be sufficient for overcoming this weakness. On the other hand, tonic spikes may not be sufficient to overcome the weakened social versus object discriminability in KO neurons. Further issue on burst is additionally addressed in comment #7.</p><p>We fully appreciate and agree that it is essential to eliminate the possibility that the decreased proportion of KO social neurons is due to non-specific factors, such as changes in target sniffing behavior, rather than changes in social target-dependent firing. To address this issue, we performed the same analysis after randomly shuffling the empty, social and object sniffing neural data, which would eliminate the factor of target specificity, only leaving variations in sniffing behavior intact. We found that the shuffling lowers the social and object neuron proportions in both WT and KO mPFC, indicating that both target specificity and behavioral factors contribute to target-dependent neural activity (Figure 3C and D, Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B). To eliminate the effect of behavioral factors, we subtracted the target-shuffled data from the original neuron population. We found that social neuron proportion was still reduced in KO mPFC compared to WT mPFC even after this correction (Figure 3E). Although the genotypic difference in object neuron proportion was not as salient as the social neuron proportion after the correction, we observed a slight increase in KO population at lower z-score thresholds (Figure 3F). In addition, empty neuron proportion was generally increased in KO mPFC (Figure 3â figure supplement 1C). An increase in neuronal population encoding non-social target information was observed in Shank2-KO mice, an animal model of autism also displaying social deficit (Lee et al., 2021).</p><p>We appreciate this essential comment that we should also take into consideration neural variability as a determinant of how much information is transmitted. We performed both single cell and ensemble decoding analyses using the support vector machine to further assess the ability of neurons to discriminate between social and object targets. We found that while decoding accuracy was comparable between genotypes for left versus right side discriminability in the E-E session (Figure 5F and H), decoding accuracy was significantly lower in KO neurons compared to WT neurons for social versus object target discriminability (Figure 5G and I, Figure 5â figure supplement 1C and D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Cleaner analysis relating the unit spike trains to moment-to-moment features of social interaction or other behaviors occurring during the S-O sessions. The authors use machine learning to classify mouse part position, but only seem to mark where the mouse is in the track. The unit activity over time might be much more interesting if correlated with DeepLabCut-based analysis of what the animal was doing (or perhaps what the social interaction partner was doing) during the sessions. Please correlate behavior to activity, both of individual units and of simultaneously-recorded populations.</p></disp-quote><p>In response, we have newly performed DeepLabCut analysis, additionally labeling the nose and body center of the social target mice (Figure 1B). In the attempt to examine the sniffing behavior in a detailed manner, we calculated the distance between the noses of subject and social target mice (Figure 1G). We noticed that there were two initial peaks in the distribution of nose-distance duration: a first peak at nose-to-nose distance ranging from 0 to 2.5 cm, defined as proximal interaction, and a second peak at nose-to-nose distance ranging from 2.5 to 10 cm, defined as distal interaction. As already mentioned in the response to comment #1, we found, in the first S-O session, that KO mice showed decreased social interactions in both proximal and distal zones, as compared with WT mice (Figure 1G). Intriguingly, KO mice showed significantly increased object interaction in the distal but not proximal zone (Figure 1I). In the second S-O session, KO mice showed social and object interactions comparable to those in WT mice (Figure 1H,J). The ratio of time spent in the proximal or distal zone was not different between genotype (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A,B). These results collectively suggest that KO mice show suppressed social interaction in both proximal and distal zones and enhanced object interaction in the distal but not proximal zone, further suggesting impaired social interaction in KO mice.</p><p>We also found that the firing rate responses during proximal social and non-social target interactions were significantly greater than distal target interactions in both genotypes (Figure 3â figure supplement 2E and F). In addition, by examining the effect of proximity for social versus non-social target discrimination, we found that although the discriminability was generally greater during proximal interaction compared to distal interaction, the discriminability in KO neurons was reduced in both proximal and distal conditions compared to that in WT neurons in first S-O session. It should be noted, however, that the discriminability was no longer significantly different between genotypes during the distal social interaction in the second S-O session (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2AâD).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors found that the average resting firing rates of excitatory mPFC neurons in awake IRSp53-KO mice are larger than that in WT mice (Figure 1C and 1D). These results are opposite to their previous findings obtained from anaesthetized mice (Chung et al., 2015, Figure 8b and 8c). However, no such difference was observed between awake and anaesthetized WT animals. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Brain circuits would be more active during the awake state, compared to an anesthetized state (Albrecht and Davidowa, 1989; Shumkova et al., 2021). In addition, urethane has been shown to have diverse influences on neurotransmitter receptors (GABA, glycine, acetylcholine, NMDA, and AMPA receptors), synapses, and neuronal excitability (Accorsi-Mendonca et al., 2007; Hara and Harris, 2002; Sceniak and Maciver, 2006). Because of this broad activity of urethane, it would be difficult to narrow down and specify the key mechanism underlying the difference between the awake and anesthetized states in IRSp53-KO mice. In addition, we found, by additional slice electrophysiology experiments, that prefrontal layer 5 pyramidal neurons in IRSp53-KO mice show altered baseline properties and memantine (NMDAR antagonist)-induced changes in intrinsic excitability and burst firing (Figures 8AâG, Figure 8âsupplement figure 1AâH), which may contribute to the altered responses of IRSp53-KO neurons to urethane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Additional data on the contribution of NMDA receptors to observed changes in firing, Additional data on the effects of NMDAR antagonists could significantly strengthen the manuscript by potentially providing some mechanistic information and strengthening the correlation between changes in these physiological measures and changes in behavior. Please also provide some discussion about how increased NMDAR function or other neurobiological mechanisms cause decreased bursting.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this thoughtful comment. Although it would be best if we could test the effects of memantine treatment on the activity of mPFC neurons of WT and KO mice in the linear chamber, because tetrode single-unit recording requires repeated recordings, we expected repeated intraperitoneal injections right before the experiment to be too stressful for the mice. Instead, we attempted slice electrophysiology to find out how firing properties change upon memantine treatment by measuring the intrinsic excitability-related parameters in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic region of the mPFC in WT and IRSp53-KO mice (3â6 months) in the presence and absence of memantine treatment. We chose layer 5 pyramidal neurons because deep cortical layers have been implicated in cognitive and social functions (Brumback et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2020; Murugan et al., 2017; Paulsen et al., 2022; Peixoto et al., 2016; Phillips et al., 2019; Rapanelli et al., 2019; Willsey et al., 2013; Yamamuro et al., 2020; Yan and Rein, 2021).</p><p>There were no baseline genotype differences in the parameters associated with intrinsic excitability, including current-firing curve, action potential (AP) threshold, input resistance, AP amplitude, full width at half maximum (FWHM), and afterhyperpolarization (AHP) (Figure 8A-F).</p><p>Upon memantine treatment, WT or IRSp53-KO neurons did not display strongly altered current-firing curve or AP-related parameters (Figure 8B,C; Figure 8âfigure supplement 1AâF). However, memantine treatment induced increases in FWHM in both WT and IRSp53-KO neurons and in AP amplitude in IRSp53-KO but not WT neurons (Figure 8âfigure supplement 1D,E), which may contribute to the increasing tendency of current-firing curve in WT and IRSp53-KO neurons (Figure 8B,C).</p><p>Importantly, when burst firing was analyzed by interspike interval (ISI) analysis of all spikes, memantine treatment decreased burst firing in WT neurons whereas it increased burst firing in IRSp53-KO neurons (Figure 8DâG).</p><p>These results collectively suggest that memantine treatment does not affect total firing in WT or IRSp53-KO neurons whereas it induces opposite changes in burst firing. Therefore, memantine seems to shift the balance towards tonic (non-burst) firing in WT neurons, but towards burst firing in IRSp53-KO neurons. In addition, these results suggest that decreased firing variability and burst firing may connect NMDAR dysfunction with social deficits in IRSp53-KO mice, and, more broadly, suggest that firing variability and burst firing may be a key modulator of prefrontal social encoding and regulation.</p><p>However, it remains unclear how IRSp53-KO prelimbic neurons show impaired target-induced increase in burst firing (Figure 7) despite that their NMDAR function is increased in layer 5 prelimbic neurons (Noh et al., 2022), and how acute memantine treatment increases and decreases burst firing in WT and IRSp53-KO neurons, respectively (Figure 8F,G). We made related discussion points in the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Further discussion on social behavior deficits in IRSp53 KO mice and how components of excitatory synapses contribute to autism. While there may be few autism patients with IRSp53 mutations, IRSp53 is an important component of excitatory synapses. If IRSp53 KO mice have social deficits similar to autism-related genes with similar physiological functions, the findings of this study may have more general significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments. In the revised Discussion, we discussed how deletion of IRSp53, a component of excitatory synapses, may lead to social deficits with a focus on the impacts of IRSp53 deletion on excitatory synaptic actin dynamics, synaptic excitation/inhibition imbalance, NMDAR modulation (synaptic vs. extrasynaptic NMDARs), and firing mode (burst vs. tonic) in prefrontal neurons. These results at different mechanistic levels may have general significance on the etiology of ASD. We admit that IRSp53 is not a strong ASD-risk gene, but we updated additional clinical information on IRSp53-related neurodevelopmental disorders in the introduction of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Further discussion on how changes in activity related to abnormal social behavior, or whether abnormal social behavior cause decreased release e.g., of a neuromodulator, that cause these changes in neural activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and agree with the impacts of the changes in neural activity (i.e., discriminability and burst firing) on social behaviors, and the feedback influences of social behaviors on neural activity and related neuromodulators.

I think using different z-score cut-offs to define social and object neurons is artificial. In Figures 3C and 3D, target shuffled data compared between WT and KO mice were significantly different, suggesting the comparison between non-linear fits could be oversensitive in revealing statistical significance that is unreal. Based on the data, I would suggest the authors perform an auROC analysis to define neurons responsive to either social or object cues (see Li et al., 2017 Cell from Catherine Dulac's lab).</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we re-analyzed the proportion of neurons responsive to social and object targets using an auROC analysis (referring to Li et al., 2017 Cell paper). Because the results of the current analysis matched those of the z-score analysis, we decided to replace the z-score results with the auROC results (Figure 3). We believe that the current results are clearer than before, thanks to the comment of the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript remains difficult to read and the rationale behind different analyses could be more clear.
