Infection is ubiquitous in infancy and induces inflammation, a key cardiometabolic risk factor, but the relationship between infection, inflammation, and metabolic profiles in early childhood remains unexplored. We investigated relationships between infection and plasma metabolomic and lipidomic profiles at age 6 and 12 months, and mediation of these associations by inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Matched infection, metabolomics, and lipidomics data were generated from 555 infants in a pre-birth longitudinal cohort. Infection data from birth to 12 months were parent-reported (total infections at age 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months), inflammation markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]; glycoprotein acetyls [GlycA]) were quantified at 12 months. Metabolic profiles were 12-month plasma nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics (228 metabolites) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry lipidomics (776 lipids). Associations were evaluated with multivariable linear regression models. In secondary analyses, corresponding inflammation and metabolic data from birth (serum) and 6-month (plasma) time points were used.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>At 12 months, more frequent infant infections were associated with adverse metabolomic (elevated inflammation markers, triglycerides and phenylalanine, and lower high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1) and lipidomic profiles (elevated phosphatidylethanolamines and lower trihexosylceramides, dehydrocholesteryl esters, and plasmalogens). Similar, more marked, profiles were observed with higher GlycA, but not hsCRP. GlycA mediated a substantial proportion of the relationship between infection and metabolome/lipidome, with hsCRP generally mediating a lower proportion. Analogous relationships were observed between infection and 6-month inflammation, HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A1.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Infants with a greater infection burden in the first year of life had proinflammatory and proatherogenic plasma metabolomic/lipidomic profiles at 12 months of age that in adults are indicative of heightened risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest potentially modifiable pathways linking early life infection and inflammation with subsequent cardiometabolic risk.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>The establishment work and infrastructure for the BIS was provided by the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI), Deakin University, and Barwon Health.

Infection has been recognised as a potential contributor to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), one of the leading causes of adult morbidity and mortality, since the 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nieto, 1998</xref>). More recent adult studies link previous infection with long-term risks of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cowan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The mechanisms are largely unknown, but likely include immune activation and heightened inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shah, 2019</xref>), which are pathways central to CVD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donath et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferrucci and Fabbri, 2018</xref>) and therefore offer potentially druggable targets in high-risk individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Donath et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ridker et al., 2017</xref>). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been extensively used as a marker of chronic inflammation in adult studies but is an acute phase reactant in children and may not reflect chronic inflammation in early life. Glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA) is a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) composite measure that is suggested to better reflect cumulative, chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Connelly et al., 2017</xref>). GlycA is an emerging biomarker for cardiometabolic risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Connelly et al., 2017</xref>) that outperforms hsCRP as a predictor of CVD events and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akinkuolie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duprez et al., 2016</xref>), and of infection-related morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). For example, in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (n = 6523), higher GlycA was associated with increased risk of incidence CVD and death, even after adjustment for hsCRP and other inflammatory markers. Conversely, prediction of these outcomes by hsCRP attenuated to null after mutual adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duprez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Cardiovascular and metabolic (cardiometabolic) disease pathogenesis begins in early life and accrues across the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakashima et al., 2008</xref>).

The cohort details and inclusion/exclusion criteria have been detailed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vuillermin et al., 2015</xref>); in brief, mothers were eligible if they were residents of the Barwon region in south-east Australia and planned to give birth at the local public or private hospital. Mothers were recruited at approximately 15 weeks’ gestation and provided informed consent. They were excluded if they were not a permanent Australian resident, aged &lt;18 years, required an interpreter to complete questionnaires, or had previously participated in BIS. Infants were excluded if they were very preterm (&lt;32 completed weeks gestation) or had a serious illness or major congenital malformation identified during the first few days of life. Ethics approval was granted by the Barwon Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 10/24).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Parent-reported infections</title><p>At the 4-week, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month time points following birth, mothers were asked to report each episode of infant illness or infection since the previous time point using standardised online questionnaires. The number of parent-reported infections from birth to 12 months was defined as the total number of respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, and acute otitis media episodes. In secondary analyses, numbers of parent-reported infections from birth to 6 months and from 6 to 12 months were considered. It was not possible to identify the proportion of parent-reported infections that lead to health service utilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rowland et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Other maternal and infant measures</title><p>Questionnaires during pregnancy and at birth were used to collect self-reported data on maternal age, household income, maternal education, and prenatal smoking (considered here as a dichotomous any/none exposure). Residential postcode was used to determine neighbourhood disadvantage using the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD) from the 2011 Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pink, 2013</xref>), with a lower score corresponding to greater socioeconomic disadvantage. Pre-eclampsia (based on International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tranquilli et al., 2014</xref>) and gestational diabetes (based on International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy criteria; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nankervis et al., 2013</xref>) diagnoses were extracted from hospital records. Infant gestational age, birth weight, and mode of delivery (categorised as vaginal, planned caesarean section, or unplanned caesarean section delivery) were collected from birth records, and the age- and sex-standardised birth weight z-score was calculated using the 2009 revised British United Kingdom World Health Organisation (UK-WHO) growth charts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cole et al., 2011</xref>). Postnatal smoking data was collected from questionnaire data, with mothers asked the average number of hours each day someone smoked near or in the same room as the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gray et al., 2019</xref>). This was dichotomised as any postnatal smoke exposure if &gt;0 hr reported at any time point up to 12 months of age, or no postnatal smoke exposure. Breastfeeding duration up to 12 months of age was collected from maternal questionnaire data. As most evidence for the protective effect of breastfeeding on early life infection is from comparisons between any breastfeeding and no breastfeeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Victora et al., 2016</xref>), and in light of previous evidence in BIS for an association between even a short duration of breastfeeding and lower odds of infection in early infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rowland et al., 2021</xref>), we first looked at breastfeeding as a binary (any/none) measure in models (presented in the main text). As most infants (98.2%) were breastfed to some extent, and it is unknown the degree to which breastfeeding, and the timing of breastfeeding, might affect infant metabolomics and lipidomics, we also considered duration of breastfeeding as a continuous variable for sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Metabolomic and lipidomic profiling</title><p>Venous peripheral blood was collected from infants at the 6- and 12-month time points in sodium heparin and generally processed within 4 hr, with a minority (197 of 555) of 12-month samples processed after 4 hr (median time for those 197 samples = 19.9 hr, inter-quartile range [IQR] [18.7, 21.4]). The time interval between collection and post-processing storage of samples was included as a covariate in analyses. Due to the bimodal distribution of 12-month sample collection times as samples were either processed same day of collection or the following day, sensitivity analysis excluding participants with a plasma storage time greater than 4 hr (197 out of 555 infants, predominantly processed the following day) was performed, as described in the Statistical analysis section below. Plasma was stored at –80°C, and aliquots were shipped on dry ice to Nightingale Health (Helsinki, Finland) for NMR metabolomic quantification and Baker IDI (Melbourne, Australia) for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) lipidomic quantification, as described below. For secondary analyses investigating possible ‘reverse causality’, that is, whether metabolomic or lipidomic profile at birth was associated with number of parent-reported infections from birth to 6 months of age, metabolomics and lipidomics data using the same platforms from venous cord blood collected at birth, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burugupalli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mansell et al., 2021</xref>), was used.</p><p>The NMR-based metabolomics platform has been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kettunen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soininen et al., 2015</xref>), and quantified a broad range of metabolic measures including lipoprotein size subclasses, triglycerides, cholesterols, fatty acids, amino acids, ketone bodies, glycolysis metabolites, and GlycA. In brief, plasma samples were mixed with a sodium phosphate buffer prior to NMR measurements with Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz and Bruker AVANCE III HD 600 MHz spectrometers (Bruker, Billerica, MA). Samples were kept at 6°C using the SampleJet sample changer (Bruker) to prevent degradation. After initial measurements, samples went through a multiple-step lipid extraction procedure using saturated sodium chloride solution, methanol, dichloromethane, and deuterochloroform. The lipid extracts were then analysed using the 600 MHz instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soininen et al., 2015</xref>). The utility of this platform in epidemiological research has been detailed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Würtz et al., 2017</xref>). Using the Nightingale Health 2016 bioinformatics protocol, 228 metabolomic measures were generated for the 12-month samples. From a subset of participants, replicate samples were quantified, and these showed a low percentage coefficient of variation (&lt;10%). Subsequently, the Nightingale Health 2020 bioinformatics protocol was used to generate 250 metabolomic measures for the 6-month samples, with 224 of these measures also present in the 12-month data. As a large proportion of the NMR metabolomic measures are ratios and are strongly correlated with each other in children and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ellul et al., 2019</xref>), an informative subset of 51 measures that captured the majority of variation in the metabolomic dataset, primarily absolute metabolite concentrations, were included in analysis presented in the main text. Analyses for excluded metabolomic measures are presented as supplementary data. To complement GlycA as a measure of inflammation, hsCRP was also quantified in 6- and 12-month plasma using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, cat. no. DY1707), as per the manufacturer’s instruction.</p><p>The details of the high-performance LC/MS lipidomics platform have been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyene et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, we used medronic acid to passivate the LC/MS system to avoid peak tailing for acidic phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hsiao et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, this platform quantified 776 lipid features in 36 lipid classes, including sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, sterols, glycerolipids, and fatty acyls. Analysis was performed on an Agilent 6490 QQQ mass spectrometer with an Agilent 1290 series high-performance liquid chromatography system and two ZORBAX eclipse plus C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm 1.8 mm) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with the thermostat set at 45°C. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed in both positive and negative ion mode with dynamic scheduled multiple reaction monitoring.</p><p>Quantification of lipid species was determined by comparison to the relevant internal standard. Lipid class total concentrations were calculated as the sum of individual lipid species concentrations, except in the case of triacylglycerols (TGs) and alkyl-diacylglycerols, where we measured both neutral loss and single ion monitoring (SIM) peaks, and subsequently used the SIM species concentrations for summation purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analyses were performed in R (version 3.6.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">R Development Core Team, 2018</xref>). All metabolomic and lipidomic measures had their lowest observed non-zero value (considered the lower limit of detection) added to their value before they were natural log-transformed and scaled to a standard distribution (standard deviation units). Pearson’s correlations were calculated for number of infections from birth to 12 months with 12-month GlycA and hsCRP.</p><p>The estimated effect of number of parent-reported infections from birth to 12 months as an exposure on 12-month metabolomic and lipidomic profile was investigated using linear regression models for each metabolomic/lipidomic measure. Standard errors were used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for estimated effects. All models were adjusted for infant sex, exact age at 12-month time point, birth weight z-score, gestational age, maternal household income, exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and time from collection to storage for the plasma sample. Linear regression models adjusted for the same covariates were used to investigate 12-month GlycA and hsCRP as exposures and each metabolomic/lipidomic measure as an outcome. Two-tailed p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons within each dataset (NMR metabolomics, LC/MS lipidomic species, and LC/MS lipidomic classes) using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). To investigate the robustness of the estimates, mean model coefficients and bias-corrected accelerated percentile bootstrap confidence intervals were calculated from nonparametric bootstrap resampling (1000 iterations) using the ‘boot’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davison and Hinkley, 1997</xref>) (version 1.3–25) in R, included in Source Data. The assumption of linearity was investigated post hoc using plots of residual values for the top 10 metabolomic and lipidomic differences (ranked by p-value) for each of number of infections, GlycA, and hsCRP.</p><p>To further investigate the other sources of potential confounding and variation that could affect findings from the primary models, several sensitivity analyses were performed. These were: (i) additional adjustment of the primary model for postnatal smoking exposure, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia; (ii) analyses excluding twins (five infants); (iii) analyses excluding infants with hsCRP &gt;5 mg/L (24 infants) as a marker of acute infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemiengre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verbakel et al., 2016</xref>); (iv) analyses excluding plasma samples with &gt;4 hr from collection to storage (197 samples); and (v) analyses adjusting for breastfeeding duration instead of any breastfeeding. Analyses of the primary models adjusted for different measures of socioeconomic position (SEIFA or maternal education) instead of household income were also considered. These models are presented as supplementary forest plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A-1F</xref>).</p><p>Secondary analyses to investigate 6-month periods of infections were performed. The birth to 6-month models investigated the relationship between infections up to 6 months of age, 6-month inflammation, and 6-month metabolomic/lipidomic measures. The 6- to 12-month models investigated the relationship of infections between 6 and 12 months of age, 12-month inflammation, and 12-month metabolomic/lipidomic measures, with adjustment for the corresponding 6-month measures. For secondary analyses to investigate reverse causality, quasi-Poisson regression models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zeileis et al., 2008</xref>) were used, either for (i) each metabolomic/lipidomic measure from cord blood at birth as exposure and total number of infections from birth to 6 months of age as outcome or (ii) each 6-month metabolomic/lipidomic measures as exposure and total number of infections from 6 to 12 months of age as the outcome, with adjustment for number of infections from birth to 6 months of age. All secondary models were adjusted for the same covariates as the primary models described above: that is, infant sex, gestational age, exact age (at 6- or 12-month time point), birth weight z-score, maternal household income, exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy, and sample time between collection and post-processing storage. Models with birth metabolomic/lipidomic measures as the exposure were additionally adjusted for mode of delivery, which is associated with differences across many NMR metabolomic measures in cord serum in this cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mansell et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the potential role of inflammation in mediating associations between infection and metabolic differences, the ‘medflex’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Steen et al., 2017</xref>) (version 0.6–7) in R was then used in a counterfactual-based framework to estimate the natural direct effect (not mediated by inflammation) and natural indirect effect (mediated by inflammation) of infection. Specifically, 12-month GlycA or hsCRP were considered separately as mediators for the effect of number of infections from birth to 12 months of age on metabolomic and lipidomic differences at 12 months, for all metabolomic and lipidomic measures associated with number of infections with an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.1 from the linear regression models described above.

Similar but more marked effects on these profiles were evident when considering GlycA, a cumulative inflammation marker, as an exposure. In contrast, differences in metabolomic and lipidomic profiles associated with higher hsCRP were largely distinct from, and less marked than, those for GlycA, suggesting that GlycA may be superior to hsCRP as an early life marker of infection burden. There was evidence that inflammation (with GlycA generally showing stronger evidence as a mediator than hsCRP) may partly mediate many of the largest metabolomic and lipidomic differences.</p><p>These findings are novel and of potentially considerable significance; the burden of infection falls largely in infancy and early childhood, and these are among the first data to explore the cardiometabolic associations with common infections in this age group. Cardiometabolic risk accrues across the entire life course; the American Heart Association states that ‘with primordial and primary prevention, CVD is largely preventable’ and that risk stratification and intervention are more likely to be successful if done earlier in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weintraub et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, understanding associations in early life in general populations is an important step towards risk stratification and targeted interventions. There are few data investigating LC/MS lipidomics in response to common infections in high-income countries; indeed some of the only analogous studies investigated lipidomics following Ebola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kyle et al., 2019</xref>) or acute lower respiratory tract infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gao et al., 2019</xref>) in adults.

Acute and chronic infection-related metabolic differences have been implicated in atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khovidhunkit et al., 2000</xref>), including increased carotid intima-media thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgner et al., 2015c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liuba et al., 2003</xref>) and arterial stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charakida et al., 2009</xref>) in older children, and in adult CVD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgner et al., 2015a</xref>). The mechanisms underpinning the link between inflammation and metabolism are not well characterised, but there is evidence they may share regulatory pathways. For example, lipid-activated nuclear receptors such as peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors and liver X receptors regulate both lipid metabolism and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bensinger and Tontonoz, 2008</xref>). Synthesis of leptin, a key regulatory hormone of metabolism, including energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park and Ahima, 2015</xref>), is increased by proinflammatory cytokines during acute infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behnes et al., 2012</xref>), and is in turn implicated in many inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abella et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In lipidomic analyses, infection burden was associated with lower levels of several ether phosphatidylethanolamine species (PC(O) and PC(P)), consistent with the reported decrease in these polyunsaturated-fatty acid (PUFA)-containing species in SARS-CoV-2 infected adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schwarz et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, these decreases contrast with observed increases in diacyl-phosphatidylethanolamine species, and this discordance in phosphatidylethanolamine species is characteristic of conditions characterised by inflammation, including Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huynh et al., 2020</xref>). The role of phosphatidylethanolamines in infection is incompletely understood, but omega-3 fatty acids (a major class of PUFA) have been implicated in anti-inflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calder, 2013</xref>) and ether phosphatidylethanolamine species are a potential source of PUFAs. Lower trihexosylceramide lipid class, associated with more infections, has been linked to increased BMI and pre-diabetic phenotypes in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meikle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weir et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The different relationships of the two inflammatory markers GlycA and hsCRP with metabolomic and lipidomic profiles are consistent with a recent study in pregnant women reporting GlycA was more strongly correlated with NMR metabolomic differences than hsCRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mokkala et al., 2020</xref>). While hsCRP has been widely used as a measure of chronic inflammation, primarily in adults, it is an acute phase reactant that increases rapidly following acute stimulus and returns to baseline levels within a matter of days and is therefore mostly used as a diagnostic adjunct in children with acute infection or inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gabay and Kushner, 1999</xref>). In contrast, there is evidence that GlycA can remain elevated for up to a decade in young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>), and it is considered a superior marker of cumulative inflammation burden, though data of GlycA in early life are sparser. Several studies in adults have reported that these two markers are only moderately correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akinkuolie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gruppen et al., 2015b</xref>), and it is suggested that these markers reflect different (albeit overlapping) inflammatory processes. This is consistent with our findings of distinct metabolomic and lipidomic profiles for these two markers and reflects other findings that show different relationships of GlycA and hsCRP with cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes. For example, GlycA is independently associated with risk of CVD and with enzymatic esterification of free cholesterol, even after adjustment for hsCRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duprez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gruppen et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Muhlestein et al., 2018</xref>). Associations between GlycA and lipolysis rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Levine et al., 2020</xref>) and gut microbiome diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mokkala et al., 2020</xref>) are also stronger than those reported for hsCRP.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This large prospective cohort study is the first to examine the relationship between infection, inflammation, and plasma NMR metabolomic and LC/MS lipidomic profiles in early life, with implications for later CVD risk. The associations were consistent using either parental-reported infections (potentially prone to reporting bias) or 12-month GlycA as a measure of cumulative inflammatory burden. We found no evidence that birth plasma metabolomic or lipidomic profiles were associated with infection burden in the first 6 months of life (i.e. reverse causation; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3A and C</xref>). There was some limited evidence that GlycA at 6 months may be associated with subsequent number of infections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3B</xref>), but we were able to adjust for this in mediation models to avoid exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vanderweele and Vansteelandt, 2009</xref>). The use of metabolomics and lipidomic data from three early life time points (birth, 6 months, and 12 months) is unique and allowed longitudinal analyses to be performed.</p><p>Limitations include the use of cross-sectional data for mediation analyses (i.e. 12-month inflammatory markers and 12-month metabolomics/lipidomics), which we addressed in part with mediation models adjusted for infections from birth to 6 months of age and 6-month inflammation. Moreover, GlycA is a marker of cumulative inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) and is believed to reflect inflammatory events occurring prior to the 12-month time point. Evidence from randomised controlled trials in adults support a causal role of inflammation in CVD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chunfeng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ridker et al., 2017</xref>), however this study in infants is observational. While we have used a casual framework for mediation analyses, our findings do not demonstrate causality. Despite rigorous adjustment and sensitivity analyses, there may be unmeasured confounding, such as from environmental factors that may modify changes in metabolomic/lipidomic measures following infection. We considered total parent-reported infections, as defining clinical categories of infection given the non-specific symptoms and signs in infancy is challenging. Validation of all parent-reported infections was not feasible and only a minority (70 infections in 555 infants) resulted in medical attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rowland et al., 2021</xref>). However, the strong correlation between metabolomic and lipidomic differences for number of reported infections and for GlycA suggests that parent report is a reasonable measure of infection-induced inflammatory burden. Most childhood infections are viral, and microbial testing is impractical in non-hospitalised children and cannot necessarily differentiate between colonisation and infection. Notwithstanding, distinct lipid differences have been reported for children with bacterial versus viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), and different infectious aetiologies in adults have been linked to differential CVD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cowan et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, the relative lack of racial/ethnic diversity in our cohort may limit generalisability of our findings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we present evidence for higher infection burden in early life leading to proatherogenic and prodiabetic plasma metabolome and lipidome at 12 months of age, and for inflammation partly mediating these relationships. GlycA may be a better marker of early life infection and inflammation burden than hsCRP. These findings suggest that the impact of the cumulative infection and inflammation burdens previously implicated in adult cardiometabolic disease may begin in infancy, thereby offering opportunities for early prevention. Further work is required to determine the potential consequences these adverse metabolomic profiles in early life have on later risk of disease, and how the relationships between infections, inflammation, and metabolomic and lipidomic profiles might differ across age groups, pathogen type, and clinical severity of infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data availability</title><p>Given the ethics for this study, the individual participant data cannot be made freely available online.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Noah Snyder-Mackler (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The paper contains a number of grammatical, spelling and structural errors. The authors are strongly encouraged to review the paper carefully prior to resubmitting the paper.</p><p>2. Figures 4 and 5 are difficult to understand. What do each point in the blot represent? What does the line around the data points represent? It is important the authors provide more explanation for readers who do not have familiarity with these plots.</p><p>3. The authors need to better define the significance of their findings. For example, although the link between inflammation and changes in metabolomics and lipidomics is known, the authors need to provide a better explanation on why their specific findings are important in the setting of infection in infants.</p><p>4. The background and rationale of the introduction should clarify the importance of transient inflammation with infections compared with cumulative burden of inflammation. The authors are suggesting that a higher burden of infections, which are common in the first year of life, are associated with long-lasting inflammation. This does not pan out in terms of hsCRP but does in terms of GlycA but this is not a known robust marker of long-term inflammation. This should be tempered.</p><p>5. Are social factors available? For example, a child with two working parents who is placed in daycare is likely to have a higher burden of infections in contrast with one with a stay at home parent? Household income and daycare status would be useful covariates to consider.</p><p>6. Are pregnancy-related covariates available? Particularly adjustment for gestational age at delivery, chronic or gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and/or chronic or gestational diabetes.</p><p>7. All results in the text should include measures of imprecision such as 95% CI.</p><p>8. Were the children screened and excluded if they had an active infection at the time of measures of inflammatory markers, metabolomics, and lipidomics? How was this assessed?</p><p>9. The authors may consider the following reference to align with the AGReMA guidelines for reporting mediation analyses. Lee et al. A Guideline for Reporting Mediation Analyses of Randomized Trials and Observational Studies: The AGReMA Statement. JAMA. 2021;326(11):1045-1056. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.14075; Particularly, a DAG would be useful.</p><p>10. Table 2 should include direct effects and clarity on what unit of change for each exposure, mediator, and outcome are the statistics based on? What is a 1-unit change in hsCRP reflect? since these units may vary significantly, use of 1 SD change would be optimal.</p><p>11. One technical concern is the variation in the amount of time the blood samples spent between post-processing and storage at -80C (and how they were held during that interval). The authors should be commended for their sensitivity analysis looking at just those samples that were stored for &lt; 4 hours. However, the justification for using only those &lt; 4 hours is not clear. It is also unclear and a bit difficult for a reader to look at Supplementary files (1A and 1B) and draw the authors' conclusion that &quot;this had little difference on the estimated effect sizes observed in analyses with the full cohort&quot;. Could the authors make more direct comparisons between the effect sizes to hammer this point home? Given that the sample size is smaller for this analysis, the p-values should be higher (less power), but the effect sizes should be unbiased and relatively similar. Perhaps calculating the correlation between effect sizes would help improve this sensitivity analysis and be good to report in the main text.</p><p>12. The authors show that while the correlation between GlycA (or CRP) and number of infections is relatively low (albeit a bit higher for GlycA), the effect sizes of GlycA and infections on the metabolome and lipidome are strongly correlated (and to a lesser extent between CRP and infections). A third comparison here that would be very useful, would be between GlycA and CRP effects on the metabolome and lipidome.</p><p>13. The mediation analysis is the least convincing part of the manuscript. It is appreciated that the authors are trying to identify how infections might be translating to adverse metabolomic and lipidomic profiles. However, the justification for GlycA or hsCRP being the mediating mechanisms is not convincing. The authors are implying (statistically through their mediation models) that the effect of the number of infections on many metabolites and lipids is due to the changes in GlycA (or hsCRP). Since both GlycA and number of infections are cumulative measures at 12mo, it is unlikely that one (e.g., GlycA) precedes the other. Rather, as the authors state, GlycA is a marker of cumulative infections. This would preclude it from being a mediator unless the authors have data from earlier timepoints (like previous months) that would provide more support for a mediation effect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting paper and a large amount of data are provided. I have the following comments:</p><p>1. The paper contains a number of grammatical, spelling and structural errors.

Additional environmental variables and their link to changes in childhood serum lipids and metabolome after infection need to be studied and included in the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Mansell et al. report on associations between infections between birth and 12 months of age and metabolomic/lipidomic profiles. There are several suggestions that may strengthen the study and manuscript:</p><p>1) The background and rationale of the introduction should clarify the importance of transient inflammation with infections compared with cumulative burden of inflammation. The authors are suggesting that a higher burden of infections, which are common in the first year of life, are associated with long-lasting inflammation. This does not pan out in terms of hsCRP but does in terms of GlycA but this is not a known robust marker of long-term inflammation. This should be tempered.</p><p>2) The introduction suggests that inflammation may be a causal target but this analysis can only identify potential markers. This should be tempered to distinctly argue against any causal findings in this observational analysis?</p><p>3) Are social factors available? For example, a child with two working parents who is placed in daycare is likely to have a higher burden of infections in contrast with one with a stay at home parent? Household income and daycare status would be useful covariates to consider.</p><p>4) Are pregnancy-related covariates available? Particularly adjustment for gestational age at delivery, chronic or gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and/or chronic or gestational diabetes.</p><p>5) Are higher order gestations (e.g., twins, triplets) excluded from the analysis? If not, a sensitivity analysis excluding them should be considered due to confounding from relatedness and shared maternal characteristics in models</p><p>6) All results in the text should include measures of imprecision such as 95% CI</p><p>7) Were the children screened and excluded if they had an active infection at the time of measures of inflammatory markers, metabolomics, and lipidomics?

I think the authors should take care in avoiding technical jargon and/or explaining it before using it. For instance, there are multiple points where acronyms are introduced without being first defined, like NMR, TGs, and TG-Os (which I think are nuclear magnetic resonance, and two types of triglycerides). Additionally, technical modifications like lines 211-213 are difficult to parse. What does &quot;used medronic acid to passivate… to avoid peak tailing..&quot; mean to a non-expert?</p><p>2. L229: I understand that 1 is added so that you can log-transform any zero values, but is 1 a good value for all metabolites and lipids? Could this offset be scaled to each individual metabolite and lipid based on their lowest non-zero value, such that it doesn't affect the results as much? Additionally, what proportion of the metabolites/lipids measures had 0 values in the samples (and how many 0 values)? In other words: how big of an issue could this +1 offset be?</p><p>3. The reverse-causality analysis is really interesting. It would be great if the authors had intermediate time-points (6mo?) rather than just birth to see if there could be some link between inflammatory levels at 6mo (controlling for infection burden) and later life levels.</p><p>4. The use of the forest plots is much appreciated, but the effect sizes and CIs are overlapping, so it's really hard to interpret. Especially the lipidomic figures (Figures4 and 5). Here, it might be best to just show the &quot;class totals&quot; and not every species underlying those classes.</p><p>The mediation analysis results could also be presented as a forest plot instead of a table. That would make interpretation much easier for the reader.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75170.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>S1.

E.g., from the old Figure 4 (now Figure 5): ‘Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. In (a) and (b), black points represent class totals, closed dark grey points represent the top 10 species differences by p-value, and hollow points with a black outline represent other species with adjusted p&lt;0.05.’ In response to this comment and the suggestion by Reviewer #3 (see comment R3.4 below), these forest plots have now been simplified; we now only show the lipid class totals in the main figures, instead presenting the forest plot with individual lipid species as a figure supplement. We have also updated these figures to indicate whether a difference in lipid class total has adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 by using closed points, consistent with the NMR metabolomics figures (Figures 3 and 4). For the figure supplement forest plots showing lipid species, we now do not highlight the top 10 species associations by p-value and now do not show the confidence intervals for individual species. We have also revised the description in the figure legends for clarity.</p><p>Eg, now for Figure 5: ‘In (a) and (b), error bars are 95% confidence intervals. Closed points represent adjusted p-value&lt;0.05. All models were adjusted for infant age, sex, gestational age, birth weight, maternal household income, smoking during pregnancy, breastfeeding status, and sample processing time. Forest plots depicting individual lipid species within each group are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>S3. The authors need to better define the significance of their findings. For example, although the link between inflammation and changes in metabolomics and lipidomics is known, the authors need to provide a better explanation on why their specific findings are important in the setting of infection in infants.</p></disp-quote><p>The evolving COVID-19 pandemic has brought the relationship between acute infection and cardiometabolic risk into sharp focus. Notwithstanding, data linking metabolomic and lipidomic perturbations following infection are almost exclusively from adults and older children (Alvarez and Ramos, 1986; Bruzzone et al., 2020; Gallin, Kaye, and O'Leary, 1969; Liuba, Persson, Luoma, Ylä-Herttuala, and Pesonen, 2003; Madsen, Varbo, Tybjærg-Hansen, Frikke-Schmidt, and Nordestgaard, 2018). We therefore consider the findings to be novel and of potentially considerable significance for the following reasons: First, the burden of infection falls largely on pre-school children and ours are among the first data to explore the cardiometabolic associations with common infections in this age group. Second, cardiometabolic risk accrues across the entire life course, as recognised by the American Heart Association who have stated that “<italic>with primordial and primary prevention, CVD is largely preventable</italic>” and that risk stratification and intervention are more likely to be successful if done earlier in life (Weintraub et al., 2011); therefore understanding associations in early life in general populations is an important step towards risk-stratification and targeted interventions. Third, there are few data investigating mass-spec lipidomics in response to common infections in high income countries; indeed, some of the only analogous studies investigated lipidomics following Ebola (Kyle et al., 2019) or acute lower respiratory tract infection (Gao et al., 2019) in adults. Finally, these are the only analyses to explore the potential mediation of these associations by inflammation.</p><p>We have therefore added a paragraph to the Discussion that summarises these points (page 7-28, line 510-523):</p><p>“The findings are novel and of potentially considerable significance; the burden of infection falls largely on pre-school children and these are among the first data to explore the cardiometabolic associations with common infections in this age group.

We are well aware that (especially in early childhood) hsCRP is an acute phase reactant and in unlikely to reflect chronic inflammation; in part we included hsCRP as it is so widely used in the adult cardiovascular literature and therefore gives a familiar frame of reference to the use of the more novel marker, GlycA. We acknowledge that GlycA is a suggested rather than proven marker of chronic inflammation, especially in childhood (although we have previously published some evidence from this cohort (Collier et al., 2019)). We have edited the introduction to reflect these points as follows (page 6, line 69-78):</p><p>“High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been extensively used as a marker of chronic inflammation in adult studies, but is an acute phase reactant in children and may not reflect chronic inflammation in early life. Glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA), is a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) composite measure that is suggested to better reflect cumulative, chronic inflammation (Connelly, Otvos, Shalaurova, Playford, and Mehta, 2017). GlycA is an emerging biomarker for cardiometabolic risk (Connelly et al., 2017) that out-performs hsCRP as a predictor of CVD events and mortality (Akinkuolie, Buring, Ridker, and Mora, 2014; Duprez et al., 2016), and of infection-related morbidity and mortality (Ritchie et al., 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>S5.

As suggested, child care utilisation may be associated with greater number of infections, but in the opinion of the authors does not seem likely to be itself a confounder of metabolomic/lipidomic outcomes. However, we agree that socio-demographic factors warrant further consideration, we have now performed sensitivity analyses adjusting for two other measures of socioeconomic position and disadvantage available in this cohort instead of household income: (i) <italic>maternal education</italic>, collected by questionnaire at the time of recruitment, and (ii) <italic>the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage</italic> (IRSD) from the 2011 Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) (Pink, 2013), which is a composite of socioeconomic indexes for postcodes within Australia and is based on census data collected every 5 years.

Previously, we used the ‘mediation’ package to estimate average causal direct and indirect effects and calculate percentage mediation from those. However, we felt it would be more appropriate in the context of the AGReMA guidelines and review comment S.10 to instead estimate the natural direct and indirect effects and include those in the results alongside the percentage mediation. For this, we have now used the ‘medflex’ package (Steen, Loeys, Moerkerke, and Vansteelandt, 2017) in R, and have revised the methods text accordingly (page 15-16). Note that we have now calculated percentage mediation based on the natural direct and indirect effects. These percentages are similar (within ~3%) to those using the previous method with average casual effects, and this change in mediation method has not impacted on our overall findings. However, while this revised method has not changed our findings, we feel it is more appropriate with regards to aligning with reporting principles laid out in the AGReMA guidelines.</p><p>b) The addition of a representative DAG for the mediation model as a new Figure (Figure 1).</p><p>c) Clarification in the methods that a counterfactual-based framework has been used for mediation analyses, and that we are estimating natural direct and indirect effects (page 15, line 297-298).</p><p>We have also revised the display item: we have now included a new Figure (Figure 7) to visually display these total and indirect effects as requested in R3.4.

One technical concern is the variation in the amount of time the blood samples spent between post-processing and storage at -80C (and how they were held during that interval). The authors should be commended for their sensitivity analysis looking at just those samples that were stored for &lt; 4 hours. However, the justification for using only those &lt; 4 hours is not clear. It is also unclear and a bit difficult for a reader to look at Supplementary files (1A and 1B) and draw the authors' conclusion that &quot;this had little difference on the estimated effect sizes observed in analyses with the full cohort&quot;. Could the authors make more direct comparisons between the effect sizes to hammer this point home? Given that the sample size is smaller for this analysis, the p-values should be higher (less power), but the effect sizes should be unbiased and relatively similar. Perhaps calculating the correlation between effect sizes would help improve this sensitivity analysis and be good to report in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>The &lt;4-hour threshold was selected as a relatively conservative cut-off given the long tail of the sample processing time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> for a histogram of sample processing time). The majority of samples that were processed within the same day were processed within 4 hours, while samples with &gt;4h processing time were predominantly samples processed the following day after collection. We have now clarified this in the methods section (page 10, lines 170-174). We agree that visually comparing the effect sizes would make the comparison between models easier and have now included a visual comparison for these as a forest plot including this and other supplementary analyses that have been added (e.g., responses to S.6 and S.7) as a supplementary file (Supplementary Files 1A to 1F). We feel that direct comparison of the forest plots may be more readily informative than providing correlation coefficients.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of 12-month plasma processing times for the participants in this study.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75170-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>S12. The authors show that while the correlation between GlycA (or CRP) and number of infections is relatively low (albeit a bit higher for GlycA), the effect sizes of GlycA and infections on the metabolome and lipidome are strongly correlated (and to a lesser extent between CRP and infections). A third comparison here that would be very useful, would be between GlycA and CRP effects on the metabolome and lipidome.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added this comparison between GlycA and hsCRP for both the metabolomic and lipidomic data to the results text (page 21, line 369, and page 24, line 445) and as additional panels in the relevant figures for hsCRP effect sizes (Figures 4C, 6C, and corresponding figure supplements).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>S13. The mediation analysis is the least convincing part of the manuscript. It is appreciated that the authors are trying to identify how infections might be translating to adverse metabolomic and lipidomic profiles. However, the justification for GlycA or hsCRP being the mediating mechanisms is not convincing. The authors are implying (statistically through their mediation models) that the effect of the number of infections on many metabolites and lipids is due to the changes in GlycA (or hsCRP). Since both GlycA and number of infections are cumulative measures at 12mo, it is unlikely that one (e.g., GlycA) precedes the other. Rather, as the authors state, GlycA is a marker of cumulative infections. This would preclude it from being a mediator unless the authors have data from earlier timepoints (like previous months) that would provide more support for a mediation effect.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we agree that the distinction between infections and GlycA was not made as clearly in the previous version of this manuscript as it should have been. For clarity, we do not consider early life GlycA to solely reflect cumulative infections, but rather consider that early life infections may be a key determinant of early life GlycA, with other non-infectious (and unquantified infectious and non-infectious) exposures also contributing to GlycA levels. Therefore, the intention was not to convey GlycA as a marker solely of cumulative infection burden. We appreciate that describing GlycA in parts of the manuscript as a marker of infection burden did not make this distinction clear, so we have revised these parts to describe GlycA as a marker of inflammation burden instead (e.g., lines 334, 343, 400, 628).</p><p>There are few studies that have considered longitudinal changes in GlycA, however studies with longitudinal GlycA measurements in adolescents and adults have reported that recent infection (within 2-3 weeks prior of blood collection) was associated with higher GlycA (Chiesa et al., 2022; Ritchie et al., 2015). There are also several studies investigating COVID-19 that have reported higher GlycA following acute infection compared to non-infected controls or reference populations (Ballout et al., 2021; Bizkarguenaga et al., 2022; Lodge et al., 2021). Together, these studies support the direction of the mediation model we have investigated in this manuscript. However, there is also some evidence in adults that GlycA may predict subsequent risk of infection (Julkunen, Cichońska, Slagboom, Würtz, and Initiative, 2021; Ritchie et al., 2015), and it has been speculated that higher GlycA may reflect a heightened responsiveness of the immune system or immune ‘training’, as we have recently reported from this cohort (Collier et al., 2022).</p><p>While originally we did not anticipate having data from an earlier time point than 12 months of age for this study, we very recently received NMR metabolomics data from 6-month plasma, sooner than anticipated, so we have now been able to perform additional analyses utilising these 6-month data. We believe this additional time point greatly strengthens the main findings of this manuscript and in particular addresses the valid queries raised by the reviewers in relation to the causal model.</p><p>While some of these additional analyses were not directed requested by the reviewers, we felt it important to include these to strengthen the paper alongside the analyses that were suggested.</p><p>Specifically, we have added the following additional analyses to address specific points as follows:</p><p>a) We present the additional cross-sectional analysis to provide evidence for a relationship between infection burden from birth to 6 months, 6-month inflammation, and 6-month metabolomic/lipidomic profiles to highlight that some of these associations between infection and omic profiles are evident at 6 months, albeit less so than at 12 months of age.</p><p>We therefore provide analysis investigating the relationship between number of parent reported infections from birth to 6 months of age, 6-month inflammation, and 6-month metabolomic/lipidomic measures (methods on page 14, lines 274-276; results on pages 21 and 24, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 2, Figure 6—figure supplement 2).</p><p>b) To provide evidence that the relationship between infection and adverse omics profiles is less likely to be confounded by unmeasured/unknown early life factors, we further analysed the associations between infections from 6-12 months with 12 month omics, adjusting for the corresponding exposure at 6-months (number of infections from birth to 6 months of age, 6-month GlycA, or 6-month hsCRP) and the corresponding 6-month metabolomic/lipidomic measure (methods on page 14-15, lines 277-280; results on pages 21-22 and 24-25, Figure 3—figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 5—figure supplement 3, Figure 6—figure supplement 3).</p><p>c) To investigate reverse causality in greater detail, we provide an extension of the previous models of birth metabolomic/lipidomic measures potentially associating with subsequent number of infections. We now have additional data investigating the association of the 6-month metabolomic/lipidomic measurements with number of infections from 6 to 12 months of age, with adjustment for number of infections from birth to 6 months of age (as suggested in comment R3.3) (methods on page 15, lines 283-286; results on pages 22 and 25, Supplementary Files 3B and 3D). Please note that as part of these more in-depth analyses, we have revised the previous reverse causality models with birth metabolomic/lipidomic measures to have infections from birth to 6 months as the outcome instead of infections from birth to 12 months (Supplementary Files 3A and 3C).</p><p>d) To strengthen the mediation analyses by adjusting for potential confounding by earlier inflammation, we provide additional mediation analyses investigating 12-month inflammation as a mediator of the effect of number of infections from 6 to 12 months of age on 12-month metabolomic/lipidomic measures, with adjustment for number of infections from birth to 6 months of age, 6-month inflammation, and corresponding 6-month metabolomic/lipidomic measure (to address the concerns raised in this comment and in R2.11) (methods on page 16, results on page 26, Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Of particular relevance to this specific comment, is evidence from these additional analyses that indicates some limited evidence that 6-month GlycA is modestly associated number of infections from 6 to 12 months of age, after adjustment for number of infections from birth to 6 months of age. This is in keeping with data from adults that GlycA may be a marker of inflammatory potential and predicts long-term risk of severe infection and infection-related mortality (Julkunen et al., 2021; Ritchie et al., 2015). Therefore, we have now included the additional mediation analyses (as mentioned above) investigating 12-month inflammation as a mediator in the relationship between infections from 6-12m and 12-month metabolomic/lipidomic measures, with adjustment for birth-6m infection, 6-month inflammation, and 6-month metabolomic/lipidomic measures. We believe that we have now controlled for the potential of reverse causality of 6-month GlycA on 6m-12m infections and reduced the risk of exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounding and similar confounding. The estimates of proportion mediated in these additional models were similar to those considering infections from birth to 12 months of age.</p><p>With these clarifications and additional analyses, we feel these additional analyses strengthen both the rationale and the findings from the mediation analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an interesting paper and a large amount of data are provided.
