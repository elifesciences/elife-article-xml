Knockdown of PCBP2 in HCT116 cells leads to significant downregulation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2).

The functional recovery experiments were performed to verify whether PCBP2 regulates cell function through ROS/FGF2-dependent ways.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>PCBP2 expression was significantly lower in P10-hBMSCs. Knocking down the expression of PCBP2 inhibited the proliferation while accentuated the apoptosis and cell arrest of RS-hBMSCs. PCBP2 silence could increase the production of ROS. On the contrary, overexpression of PCBP2 increased the viability of both P3-hBMSCs and P10-hBMSCs significantly. Meanwhile, overexpression of PCBP2 led to significantly reduced expression of FGF2. Overexpression of FGF2 significantly offset the effect of PCBP2 overexpression in P10-hBMSCs, leading to decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and reduced G0/G1 phase ratio of the cells.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study initially elucidates that PCBP2 as an intrinsic aging factor regulates the replicative senescence of hBMSCs through the ROS-FGF2 signaling axis.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82172474).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>hBMSCs</kwd><kwd>PCBP2</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd><kwd>FGF2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82172474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Leisheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The intrinsic factor of cell senescence, PCBP2, was identified by unlabeled quantitative proteomics, and its biological role in in vitro replication senescence of human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells was characterized in vitro.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>With the aging of the population, the incidence of osteoporosis is increasing globally. It is believed that the decrease in the number and ‘adaptability’ of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) is one of the key factors leading to osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ganguly et al., 2017</xref>). With aging, the proliferation and function of BMSCs are impaired due to intrinsic and environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibon et al., 2016</xref>), however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown.</p><p>The poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) is an RNA-binding protein and regulates gene expression at multiple levels including mRNA metabolism and translation. It has been reported that knockout of PCBP2 led to decreased expression of p73 in a variety of cell lines, which in turn led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and accelerated cell aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ren et al., 2016</xref>). However, whether PCBP2 influences cell aging through a ROS-dependent way is still unknown. ROS is a by-product of aerobic metabolism, including superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>-), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and hydroxyl radical (OH·), and has a wide range of biological targets and reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schieber and Chandel, 2014</xref>). The disorder of ROS affects many cell functions, such as cell proliferation, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30485137/">cell apoptosis</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30485137/">autophagy,</ext-link> and cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schieber and Chandel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2019</xref>). In our pilot study, we found that the expressions of PCBP2 was significantly lower in P10-human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) than in P3-hBMSCs. Therefore, we speculate that PCBP2 may be one of the intrinsic factors of aging of the BMSCs and participates in the regulation of the cellular function of the cells by acting on the production of ROS.</p><p>In GSE95024 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we analyzed by bioinformatics methods and found that after knockdown of PCBP2 in HCT116 cells, the expression of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) was significantly downregulated in the cells. FGF2 has been reported to have functions in cell proliferation, senescence, and G2/M arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Salotti et al., 2013</xref>). FGF2 was also crucial to the stemness maintenance of BMSCs with fibronectin and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). FGF2-induced inhibition of RhoA/ROCK signaling played a key role in BMSCs differentiation into endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2018</xref>). FGF2 isoforms were also found to be able to inhibit the mineralization of BMSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>). Meanwhile, it has been reported that ROS could mediate FGF2 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kalghatgi et al., 2010</xref>). IL-1β promoted FGF-2 expression in chondrocytes through the ROS/AMPK/p38/NF-κB signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chien et al., 2016</xref>). FGF-2 could be released by plasma-produced ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arjunan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned above, our understanding of the interactions among PCBP2, ROS, and FGF2 in the aging process of BMSCs seems to be insufficient. The in-depth exploration of the mechanism of aging of the BMSCs is expected to provide additional information for the pathogenesis and clinical intervention of osteoporosis. We hypothesize that PCBP2 is an intrinsic aging factor of BMSCs and regulates the senescence of hBMSCs through a ROS- and FGF2-dependent pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hayflick model of cellular aging</title><p>The hBMSCs were obtained from healthy male individuals who underwent traumatic femoral or tibia shaft fracture treatment by intramedullary nailing.

It is well accepted that the expansion of BMSCs in culture will accelerate senescence, and the differentiation potential will decrease from the sixth generation. In the tenth generation, the average number of cumulative population doublings drops from 7.7 to 1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonab et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, after passage of the hBMSCs, the third-generation cells were labeled as P3 (in vitro non-senescence model, P3-hBMSCs) and the tenth-generation cells were labeled as P10 (in vitro replication senescence model, P10-hBMSCs).

Low expression of PCBP2 in the replicative senescent hBMSCs inhibited the proliferation, promoted the apoptosis and the cell cycle arrest through a ROS-FGF2-dependent pathway.</p><p>Generally, cell senescence is regarded as an irreversible cell cycle arrest, which is considered to be an evolutionary process established and maintained by the p16 <sup>INK4A</sup> and/or p53-p21 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). However, with the suppression of p53 expression, senescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts rapidly re-entered the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dirac and Bernards, 2003</xref>), which inspired us with new understanding of cell senescence. The phenotype of cellular senescence is triggered by a variety of senescence stressors, which in turn affect multiple signaling pathways and gene expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). In order to validate the results of our pilot study, we used qRT-PCR and WB analysis and confirmed that both the mRNA and protein expressions of PCBP2 were substantially lower in the senescent P10-hBMSCs than in the non-senescent P3-hBMSCs. Therefore, PCBP2 should be an intrinsic factor for cell aging and participate in the senescence of hBMSCs.</p><p>Cell cycle arrest, loss of cell proliferation, and increase of cell apoptosis are the main characteristics of cell senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dodig et al., 2019</xref>). In present study, we found that PCBP2 silencing significantly promoted the retention of hBMSCs in the G0/G1 phase and significantly reduced the proportion of cells in the S and G2/M phases. These results are consistent with previous reports that in MEFs, the loss of PCBP2 leads to the decrease of p73 expression, which in turn leads to the acceleration of cell senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ren et al., 2016</xref>). Meanwhile, we found that the apoptosis of replicative senescent hBMSCs increased after PCBP2 was silenced, while decreased after PCBP2 was overexpressed. After multiple proliferation and division of cells, the telomeres shorten, the cells reach the limit of normal cell division and turn into replicative senescence. This process is also known as Hayflick limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Overexpression of PCBP2 in the P10-hBMSCs promoted the proliferation of the replicative senescent cells, suggesting that PCBP2 might have the ability to extend the Hayflick limit or waken the cells from replicative senescence. Further studies are needed to verify these findings.</p><p>Cell senescence can be induced by many factors, such as oxidative stress, cell culture and telomere shortening, and disturbances in mitochondrial homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Regulski, 2017</xref>). Abnormal mitochondrial homeostasis leads to an increase in the production of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Victorelli and Passos, 2019</xref>). Meanwhile, mitochondrial ROS aggravate cell senescence by enhancing DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Passos et al., 2010</xref>), which in turn forms the characteristic phenotype of senescent cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ren et al., 2016</xref>, reported that PCBP2 could inhibit the production of ROS by regulating the mRNA stability of p73 in MEFs. By interfering with the expression of PCBP2, we investigated the role of PCBP2 on the production of ROS in hBMSCs and obtained similar results. It is reported that PCBP2 is a versatile adaptor protein that binds iron and delivers it to ferritin for storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frey et al., 2014</xref>). The main components of iron are stored in mitochondria, lysosomes, cytosol, and nucleus, at concentrations of ~16 μM, ~16 μM, ~6 μM, and ~7 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Paul et al., 2017</xref>). Iron overload at the cellular level leads to an increase in ROS production and results in oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews, 1999</xref>). However, the expression of PCBP2 was low in the replicative senescent hBMSCs, suggesting that the increase of ROS production in the senescent cells with low expression of PCBP2 might not depend on the transfer of iron. Future studies on the regulation mechanism of PCBP2 on ROS production are needed.</p><p>We found that downregulating the expression of PCBP2 in hBMSCs could increase the ROS production in the cells. ROS are involved in regulating the activity of multiple signaling pathways, which are related to cell growth, cell apoptosis, and the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Moderate level of ROS initiates the differentiation of stem cells, while high level of ROS leads to cell senescence and cell death of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bigarella et al., 2014</xref>). Through functional recovery experiments, we found that overexpression of PCBP2 promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of P10-hBMSCs in a ROS-dependent way. This result not only challenges the traditional theory that cell senescence is irreversible cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Magalhães and Passos, 2018</xref>), but also indicates that the replicative senescent hBMSCs can be wakened in some extent by interventions on the production of ROS.</p><p>As mentioned in the Introduction, FGF-2 can be released by ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kalghatgi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chien et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arjunan et al., 2012</xref>). Our experiment also demonstrated that the increase of FGF2 induced by decreased PCBP2 expression can be reversed by oxidative stress inhibitors. Therefore, we concluded that PCBP2 inhibits ROS expression to a certain extent, and low ROS expression reduced FGF2 production, thus, regulating the aging of hBMSCs. FGF2 promotes catabolism and subsequent anabolism by specifically binding to FGFR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yan et al., 2011</xref>) and is involved in regulating multiple downstream signal pathways, including PI3K/AKT, STAT1/p21, and RAS/MAPK kinase pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Teven et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, FGF2 plays an important role in regulating cell function. Through sequencing analysis, we found that when PCBP2 was knocked down, the expression of FGF2 was significantly increased, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR and WB. Combined with the functional recovery experiment, we found that overexpression of PCBP2 in the P10-hBMSCs could promote cell proliferation and make the cells re-enter the S phase and G2/M phase, while inhibiting the apoptosis of the cells by inhibiting FGF2. However, whether FGF2 mediates the cellular functions of hBMSCs through PI3K/AKT, STAT1/p21, and RAS/MAPK kinase pathways remains to be confirmed.</p><p>In conclusion, this study initially elucidates that PCBP2 as an intrinsic aging factor regulates the replicative senescence of hBMSCs through the ROS-FGF2 signaling axis. However, how does FGF2 interact with ROS in hBMSCs? In addition to FGF2 and ROS, does PCBP2 have other potential mechanisms for the aging of hBMSCs? These questions remain unanswered in future research.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The experimental protocol adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the Helsinki Declaration, including respect for individuals, beneficence, non maleficence, and justice.
