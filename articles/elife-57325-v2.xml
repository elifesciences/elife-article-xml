balance between maintenance and differentiation of airway progenitor cells during development and regeneration. Here, we describe patterning of the mouse proximal airway epithelium by SOX21, which coincides with high levels of SOX2 during development. Airway progenitor cells in this SOX2+/SOX21+ zone show differentiation to basal cells, specifying cells for the extrapulmonary airways. Loss of SOX21 showed an increased differentiation of SOX2+ progenitor cells to basal and ciliated cells during mouse lung development. We propose a mechanism where SOX21 inhibits differentiation of airway progenitors by antagonizing SOX2-induced expression of specific genes involved in airway differentiation. Additionally, in the adult tracheal epithelium, SOX21 inhibits basal to ciliated cell differentiation. This suppressing function of SOX21 on differentiation contrasts SOX2, which mainly drives differentiation of epithelial cells during development and regeneration after injury. Furthermore, using human fetal lung organoids and adult bronchial epithelial cells, we show that SOX2+/SOX21+ regionalization is conserved. Lastly, we show that the interplay between SOX2 and SOX21 is context and concentration dependent leading to regulation of differentiation of the airway epithelium.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lung development</kwd><kwd>SOX2</kwd><kwd>SOX21</kwd><kwd>epithelial differentiation</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>proximo-distal patterning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sophia Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S14-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eenjes</surname><given-names>Evelien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sophia Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S17-20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edel</surname><given-names>Gabriela G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sophia Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S16-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The balance between SOX2 and SOX21 is evolutionary conserved and is important for cell fate decision during lung epithelium development and repair after damage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lungs are composed of a highly branched tubular system of airways lined with specialized cell types, which together moisten and warm the air and filter out inhaled substances. The alveoli are located at the distal end of the airways. They consist of a thin layer of epithelium encircled by a network of blood vessels to facilitate an exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. During lung development, growth and differentiation along the proximal-distal axis occur simultaneously. A well-regulated balance between progenitor cell maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation is essential to ensure fully functional lungs at birth.</p><p>The formation of lung endoderm starts from the ventral anterior foregut by the development of two lung buds, forming the left and right lung. As the growing lung buds expand, the future trachea is separated from the esophagus proximally of the lung buds. Through a repetitive process of branching of the growing tips and outgrowth of the newly formed branches, a complex bronchial tree develops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Metzger et al., 2008</xref>). Regionalization of the branching structures occurs along the proximal-distal axis. Distal progenitors expressing the SRY-box protein SOX9 and the HLH protein ID2 generate new branches and will ultimately give rise to alveolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rawlins et al., 2009a</xref>). While the buds grow and expand, SOX9+ progenitor cells gradually become more distant from the branch-inducing FGF10 signal secreted by the distal mesenchymal cells, resulting in loss of SOX9 expression and initiation of SOX2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Park et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weaver et al., 1999</xref>). These SOX2+ progenitor cells mark the non-branching epithelium and give rise to the airway lineages.</p><p>SOX2 is a critical transcription factor in the development of the airway and epithelial lineages. SOX2 deficiency results in aberrant tracheobronchial epithelium due to the loss of basal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rock et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tompkins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, SOX2 overexpression results in increased basal cell numbers and perturbed branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gontan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ochieng et al., 2014</xref>). The necessity of proper SOX2 levels in airway development is therefore well documented, but it remains unclear how the balance between SOX2+ progenitor maintenance and early cell fate determination is regulated.</p><p>Previously, we showed that increased SOX2 expression during mouse lung development leads to increased SOX21 expression in airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gontan et al., 2008</xref>). While the function of SOX21 in lung development is not known, SOX21 was found to be enriched in SOX2+ stalk (differentiating bronchiole) versus tip progenitor cells of the human fetal lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nikolić et al., 2017</xref>). Concomitant expression of SOX2 and SOX21 results in either a synergistic or antagonistic function depending on the tissue or environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mallanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Freeman and Daudet, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Whittington et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goolam et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we hypothesized that SOX21 is an important regulator of SOX2+ progenitor maintenance during development and regeneration of airway epithelium. In this study, we demonstrate that during lung development SOX21 marks a region in the proximal-distal patterning of the airway tree. SOX21 defines the epithelium of the airways where SOX2+ progenitor cells differentiate into basal cells. Using SOX2 and SOX21 mutant mice, we show that SOX2 and SOX21 have opposite functions, as SOX21 suppresses and SOX2 promotes the differentiation of airway progenitor cells during lung development. In contrast, transgenic mice with high ectopic expression of either SOX2 or SOX21 during lung development presented both airway branching defects and increased basal cell numbers. In mouse adult lungs, co-expression of SOX2 and SOX21 is maintained in the epithelium of the extrapulmonary airways (trachea and main bronchi), the region where basal cells reside. Adult mouse basal cells with reduced SOX21 levels are more prone to differentiate to ciliated cells, while reduced SOX2 levels decreased differentiation towards ciliated cells. This opposing effect on differentiation is similar to what we observed in airway progenitor cells during lung development. Finally, SOX2 and SOX21 have a conserved expression pattern and function in human airway epithelial cells. In human air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures, both the reduction of SOX21 or SOX2 levels resulted in an increased differentiation to ciliated cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the balance of SOX2 and SOX21 expression regulates airway progenitor cell maintenance and differentiation during lung development and regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SOX2 and SOX21 regionalize the extrapulmonary airways in a proximal–distal pattern during branching morphogenesis</title><p>To gain more insight into the interplay between SOX2 and SOX21, we first examined the spatial and temporal distribution of SOX21 in mouse lung epithelium with respect to the SOX2–SOX9 proximal–distal patterning at different stages of lung development.</p><p>The earliest expression of SOX21 during lung development was found at gestational age E11.5. A few SOX21-expressing cells were found in the most proximal region of the SOX2+ epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). SOX2 expression, which can be detected at E9.5, therefore precedes SOX21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Que et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gontan et al., 2008</xref>). At E11.5, abundant SOX21 expression was seen in cells of the thymus and esophagus, which also co-expressed SOX2. At E12.5, SOX21 expression became more apparent, but stayed restricted to the proximal region of the SOX2+ epithelium, the trachea, and main bronchi. From E13.5 onwards, SOX21 was expressed throughout the trachea and main bronchi, but was absent in the smaller SOX2+ airways. Labeling from proximal to distal, four zones could be distinguished in the developing lung epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): zone 1, the most proximal zone, comprised the developing trachea and main bronchi, which contain SOX2+SOX21+ airway epithelial cells; zone 2, which contains only SOX2+ airway epithelial cells; zone 3, a transition zone, in which distal SOX9+ progenitors transition into SOX2+ airway progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mahoney et al., 2014</xref>); and zone 4, the most distal part of the lung epithelium containing SOX9+ progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rawlins et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). SOX21 was never observed in the distal buds, but always in cells that also express SOX2. SOX21 shows different expression levels among cells during the early developmental stages (E12.5–E14.5), in stark contrast to the more homogeneous distribution of SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At E18.5, SOX21 is homogeneously expressed in the trachea, heterogeneously expressed in the main bronchi and absent in the intrapulmonary airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In summary, SOX21 is expressed specifically in the extrapulmonary airways (trachea and main bronchi) during the formation of the airway tree, which is the most proximal part of the SOX2+ epithelium.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SOX21 is expressed in the proximal region of the SOX2+ non-branching zone of the airway epithelium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Co-staining of SOX9 (green) for distal buds, SOX2 (blue) for proximal epithelium, and SOX21 (red) at different stages of lung development.

SOX21 is abundantly expressed on the medial side of the airway, but almost completely absent on the lateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This unilateral expression pattern is present during branching morphogenesis but becomes less apparent after E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Previously, SOX2 was found to be higher expressed in the dorsal compared to the ventral side of the tracheal epithelium (TE) during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Que et al., 2009</xref>). In the developing trachea, the ventral side is marked by SOX9+ cartilage nodules and the dorsal side by smooth muscle actin+ (SMA+) mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hines et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore made transverse sections from the trachea up to the main bronchi and observed a more abundant expression of SOX21 on the dorsal side, comparable to the location of high SOX2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We hypothesize that the high expression of SOX2 is important to set up the expression pattern of SOX21 during lung development.</p><p>To validate whether high SOX2 levels can induce <italic>Sox21</italic> expression, we ectopically expressed a MYC-tagged SOX2 or -SOX21 in peripheral epithelial lung cells using a doxycycline-inducible transgene and a surfactant protein C (SPC) promoter-driven rtTA (iSox2<sup>SPC-rtTA</sup> or iSox21<sup>SPC-rtTA</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Perl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gontan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Both MYC-SOX2 and MYC-SOX21 expression caused the appearance of cystic structures, albeit much smaller in the MYC-SOX21 model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although a similar phenotype was observed, MYC-SOX2-expressing cells in the distal lung buds lost SOX9 while inducing <italic>Sox21</italic>, but MYC-SOX21-expressing cells in the distal bud retained SOX9+ and did not induce <italic>Sox2</italic> expression. In the airway, MYC-SOX21+ cells were SOX2 positive, although some cells still expressed SOX9, suggesting that these cells are transitioning from a distal to a proximal cell fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We therefore conclude that SOX2 alone can set up <italic>Sox21</italic> expression, but SOX21 alone is not sufficient to induce a SOX2+ airway cell fate in the in the presence of distal mesenchymal signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SOX21 and SOX2 are co-expressed in the zone where progenitor cells differentiate</title><p>SOX21 marks a specific proximal region of the airway tree during development, and we therefore asked the question what the role of SOX21 is in this distinct zone 1 versus zone 2, which only contains SOX2+ cells. Early during development, at E11.5, SOX2 and SOX21 were both expressed in the lung, esophagus, and thymus. At this embryonic age, the esophagus and thymus already contained TRP63+ epithelial cell progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), while TRP63+ basal cells only start to appear in the lung at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Previously, we showed that SOX2 directly regulates <italic>Trp63</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ochieng et al., 2014</xref>), and we therefore analyzed whether SOX21 plays a role in the differentiation of airway progenitor cells to basal cells. We found that TRP63+ basal cells appear in zone 1 from E12.5 onward, but not in zone 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At E14.5, we found higher expression of SOX2 and SOX21 as well as more basal cells in the epithelium in close proximity to SMA+ mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). This localization of basal cells is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Que et al., 2009</xref>). The specific localization suggests that mesenchymal–epithelial crosstalk is involved in the combined SOX21 and SOX2 expression and in the progenitor to basal cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SOX2 and SOX21 are co-expressed in the zone where progenitor cells differentiate to basal cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence of SOX2 (blue), SOX21 (red), and TRP63 (green) on lung sections of E12.5, E13.5, and E14.5 showing a spatial co-localization of the three proteins.

We observed an overall increase of FOXJ1+ cells upon knockdown of <italic>SOX2</italic> or <italic>SOX21</italic> in several independent donor ALI cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This increase in FOXJ1+ cells was also observed when analyzing the mCherry+ cells only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, knockdown of <italic>SOX2</italic> or <italic>SOX21</italic> in the human airway cells favor a FOXJ1+ cell type, partly resembling the mouse ALI experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Despite the increase in FOXJ1+ nuclei, we did not observe an increase in fully differentiated ciliated cells as determined by the formation of TubulinIV+ cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, the increase in FOXJ1+ nuclei is seemingly combined with an impaired ability to differentiate into MUC5B+ goblet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In conclusion, our data suggest that both SOX2 and SOX21 suppress basal to ciliated cell differentiation, while both seem to positively affect goblet cell differentiation in the human airways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>During lung development, a proximal-to-distal epithelial gradient is observed by the separation of proximal SOX2- and distal SOX9-expressing cells. Here we show a further evolutionary conserved regionalization of the proximal epithelium by marking a SOX2+/SOX21+ proximal zone. Within this zone, progenitor cells differentiate into basal cells. With the use of human embryonic lung sections and fetal lung organoids, we confirmed SOX21 expression in SOX2+ progenitor stalk cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nikolić et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, SOX21 becomes more widely expressed when human fetal lung organoids are differentiated into airway organoids. Based on our findings, we propose that (1) SOX2+SOX21+ cells in murine and human fetal lung organoids are progenitor cells in an environment destined for differentiation and (2) that SOX21 is important in balancing maintenance and differentiation of SOX2+ airway progenitor cells.</p><p>SOX2 is a key regulator in regulating proliferation and differentiation in many different stem cells populations; however; the chromatin regions targeted by SOX2 are cell-type specific. The regulation of stem cells by SOX2 is dependent on both its co-factors and expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brafman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hagey et al., 2018</xref>). We observed a correlation between high SOX2 expression and appearance of SOX21 on the dorsal side of the proximal airways and trachea. Additionally, ectopic induction of SOX2 in distal cells resulted in an upregulation of SOX21. We suggest that SOX2 requires a certain threshold level of expression to induce SOX21. Interestingly, SOX21 expression was first observed during the embryonic stage (E10.5–11.5), at a time when cells adopt a proximally restricted fate for the extrapulmonary airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). We suggest that SOX21 is a downstream effector of SOX2 during formation of the extrapulmonary airways, separating extrapulmonary airway progenitors from intrapulmonary airway which are only SOX2 positive. A similar induction of SOX21 by SOX2 has been described in the four-cell-stage embryo, in embryonic stem cells and in neuronal progenitor cells. The function of SOX21 and its synergy or antagonism with SOX2 activity is highly context dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kopp et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mallanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakravarthy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goolam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ohba et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sandberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsuda et al., 2012</xref>). As an example of the context-dependent function of SOX21, we showed that upon ectopic expression of SOX21, SOX9+ distal progenitor cells were maintained, with no differentiation to SOX2+ progenitor cells. Thus, SOX21 itself is not capable of driving differentiation to SOX2+ progenitor cells in the presence of distal mesenchymal signaling. However, when co-expressed with SOX2, SOX21 is present in the region where SOX2 progenitor cells differentiate into basal cells. SOX2 and SOX21 can physically interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mallanna et al., 2010</xref>), and preliminary data of a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation of the human airway ALI cultures showed that SOX2 and SOX21 not only have unique binding sites, but also co-occupy the same genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This supports our findings that SOX2 and SOX21 are involved in the same cellular differentiation processes.</p><p>Using <italic>Sox21<sup>+/−</sup> and Sox21<sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup></italic> mice, we showed that the presence of SOX21 is important to suppress the differentiation of SOX2+ progenitor cells into basal and ciliated cells. Surprisingly, basal cell numbers increased upon deletion of SOX21, but also after ectopic expression of a doxycycline-inducible SOX21 using an SPC-promotor- or SCGB1A1-promotor-driven rtTA during development. This seemingly contradictory result may be caused by the difference in timing between the mouse models. The <italic>Sox21<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice lack expression of Sox21 from the fertilization of the oocyte, whereas the transgenic overexpressing mice only start to express SOX21 when the SPC or SCGB1A1 promoters become active. Thus, the <italic>Sox21<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice lack Sox21 expression from the onset of lung development, which may trigger an expansion of basal cells, whereas the overexpression of SOX21 is induced in differentiated epithelial cells. The SPC or SCGB1A1 promoter-driven expression of SOX21 may cause a reversal of differentiated cells to basal cells. Alternatively, high levels of SOX21 may force cells to lose their identity followed by redifferentiation according to downstream cues received from the surrounding mesenchyme. For example, SPC-promoter-driven induction of SOX21 initiates the reversal of SOX9+ cells to a proximal phenotype, but this only becomes apparent once these SOX9+ cells are sufficiently distanced from distal mesenchymal FGF10 signaling. The latter causes the cells to express SOX2, leading to a more pronounced induction of the proximal fate and an increase in TRP63+ basal cells. The initiation of a proximal cell fate by ectopic expression of SOX21, followed by SOX2 expression, may explain why the cysts in SOX21-expressing lungs are smaller than the cysts observed upon ectopic expression of SOX2, the major proximal cell fate inducer.</p><p>SOX21 and SOX2 co-expression continues in adult TE and SMGs, which are both regions where progenitor cells reside. We used naphthalene injury and in vitro analysis to study whether SOX21 and SOX2 function in adult progenitors is similar to function during development. We showed that reduced SOX2 levels inhibit the contribution of SOX9+ SMG cells to repair of TE injury, while reduced SOX21 levels promote their contribution. Furthermore, reduced SOX2 levels decreased differentiation of basal to ciliated cells in vitro and in vivo, while reduced SOX21 levels only increased basal cell differentiation in vitro but not in vivo. The latter might be explained by the fact that differentiation of progenitor cells in vivo is regulated by an epithelial–mesenchymal interaction, which might inhibit further differentiation to ciliated cells when regeneration is complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Volckaert et al., 2017</xref>). In summary, both during development and regeneration of the airway epithelium, endogenous SOX21 acts as a suppressor of SOX2+ progenitor cell differentiation, while SOX2 levels are important for stimulating differentiation. Using a luciferase assay, we specifically show that SOX21 can antagonize SOX2 function on certain promotor regions. However, to fully understand the function of SOX21 within SOX2+ airway progenitors, signaling/environmental cues, additional co-factors, and expression levels are likely to play a role.</p><p>SOX2 and SOX21 showed a similar but not identical expression pattern in human airway epithelium. As opposed to mouse tracheal epithelium which has a basal and luminal cell layer, the human proximal airway epithelium contains an additional layer of intermediate cells or para-basal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mercer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boers et al., 1998</xref>). Using human primary bronchial epithelial ALI cultures, we showed high SOX21 levels in TP63− FOXJ1− cells and suggest that these cells represent the intermediate layer of para-basal cells transitioning to a luminal cell fate. Besides the different expression pattern compared to mice, SOX2 and SOX21 also act differently on basal cell differentiation, as reduced expression levels of either protein resulted in more ciliated cells and fewer goblet cells. In mouse ALI cultures, reduced SOX2 expression resulted in a decrease in ciliated cells, whereas reduced SOX21 expression resulted in an increase in ciliated cells without affecting secretory cell numbers. Recently, human basal cells were shown to comprise at least four basal cell types, whereas mice only have one basal cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Travaglini et al., 2020</xref>). For future studies, it is important the understand which genes are regulated by SOX2 and SOX21 in human and mouse, and how they subsequently affect airway epithelial homeostasis and regeneration.</p><p>Our data provide a new understanding of proximal–distal patterning of the airways and the regulation of SOX2 progenitor cells within development and regeneration of airway epithelium. De-regulation of SOX2 and SOX21 expression levels can alter branching morphogenesis and differentiation of airway epithelium. We show that SOX21 can act as a suppressor of differentiation when SOX2 expression levels are high and when progenitor cells are prone to differentiate.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The HPBECs were transduced with 10–20 µl lentiviral particles in 500 µl BEGM + 1 nM EC23 (retinoic acid analog, Sigma; SML2404) + 2 µg/ml Polybrene in the apical compartment of the insert. After 24 hr, the apical compartment was washed once with PBS and the PBECs were put to ALI. Medium was changed in the lower chamber to BEGM + 50 nM EC23. Transduced HPBECs were cultured on ALI for 14 days, after which they were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence staining.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Prism5 (GraphPad). For all measurement, three or more biological replicates were used. Data are represented as means ± standard error of mean (SEM) with the data points present in each graph. Statistical differences between samples were assed with Student’s unpaired or paired t-test, one-way ANOVA (post-test: Tukey), or two-way ANOVA (post-test: Bonferroni). p-values below 0.05 are considered significant.

The authors describe a new role for Sox21 downstream of the key airway development transcription factor <italic>Sox2</italic>. They suggest opposing roles for these genes based on analysis of <italic>Sox2</italic> and Sox21 heterozygous knock-out mice whereby Sox21 prevents and <italic>Sox2</italic> promotes differentiation of immature airway progenitors into basal cells. This raises interesting questions regarding the role of Sox21 in the biology of airway progenitors and the balance of cell types in the airways. In adult mice no obvious differences are detected in Sox21+/- mice in terms of regenerative capacity. In in vitro assays of adult mouse basal cell differentiation (ALI culture) failed to identify obvious differences in basal cell number of differentiation into specific lineages in Sox21+/- cells. In human ALI cultures the authors identify a similar possible role for Sox21 in differentiating basal cells in humans. Overall, the molecular mechanisms that control airway stem cell maintenance and differentiation are of great interest to the field. However, in its current form the studies remain primarily descriptive and several data inconsistencies remain, which makes it difficult to draw impactful conclusions at the current stage.

Building on prior work they observe a unique distribution of Sox21 expression in the developing airways and through careful and elegant immunostaining and over-expression studies they suggest that Sox21 is downstream of a key airway development transcription factor <italic>Sox2</italic>. They suggest opposing roles for these genes based on analysis of <italic>Sox2</italic> and Sox21 heterozygous knock-out mice whereby Sox21 prevents and <italic>Sox2</italic> promotes differentiation of immature airway progenitors into basal cells. This raises interesting questions regarding the role of Sox21 in the biology of airway progenitors and the balance of cell types in the airways. In adult mice no obvious differences are detected in Sox21+/- mice in terms of regenerative capacity. In in vitro assays of adult mouse basal cell differentiation (ALI culture) failed to identify obvious differences in basal cell number of differentiation into specific lineages in Sox21+/- cells. The authors report an overall similar pattern of SOX21 expression in a human fetal lung organoid platform. Finally, in human ALI cultures the authors identify SOX21 expression most abundant in paranasal cells suggesting a similar possible role for this genes in differentiating basal cells in humans. Overall, the molecular mechanisms that control airway stem cell maintenance and differentiation are of great interest to the field.</p><p>The development data is clear based on the studies presented. The immunostaining and figures are elegant. It does not appear the Sox21 is necessary for airway development. A key question raised by this work is how important and what precisely is the role of Sox21? For example, overexpression of Sox21 in the developing and adult airways might have been more instructive in answering these key questions rather than under the control of the SPC-promoter.</p><p>The adult mouse data and human data seem to overall suggest that <italic>SOX2</italic> and SOX21 are upregulated in differentiating cells in vitro and are expressed at lower levels in basal cells but real mechanism or phenotype related to SOX21 function is observed in the SOX21 het mouse cells.</p><p>The attempt to assess human fetal airways is admirable. However, sections of fetal lungs would be more relevant. Can the authors address how similar fetal lung cultures are to in vivo airways and at what developmental time point ?</p><p>Overall the relevance of SOX21 expression in the adult airways is unclear.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;SOX21 modulates <italic>SOX2</italic>-initiated differentiation of epithelial cells in the extrapulmonary airways&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Additional experiments have been performed including in vivo over expression of Sox21 and Sox 2 (Figure 4) as well as loss of function studies for Sox21 in Figure 7. These data further support a role for Sox21 in inhibiting differentiation of airway progenitors and adult basal cells. Specifically, airway cell transitioning from basal cells to a luminal para-basal cell while cilia cell transition/maturation is suppressed by Sox21. The manuscript is still very hard to read and textual clarification is needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This article is very difficult to read. As currently written I do not understand it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript is of relevance to research into lung development and the mechanisms that relegate the maintenance and differentiation of progenitor cells in the airway epithelium.</p><p>The authors include several new experiments in response to concerns raised in the initial submission. The resubmission is significantly revised.</p><p>To address the role of SOX21 in airways in development and in adult mice under homeostatic conditions the authors over-expressed SOX21under the control of the SCGB1A1 promoter in mice using an inducible system. Over-expression during development led to an increase in basal cells. Over-expression of SOX21 in adult secretory cells led to fewer secretory cells not did not alter basal cell numbers. Interestingly, in both experiments the majority of cell over expressing the MYC-tag were not clearly secretory, basal or ciliated cells. While the experiments are helpful in evaluating the functional role of SOX21 in the airways the latter observation is troubling and not really addressed.</p><p>Concern in initial submission: The adult mouse data and human data seem to overall suggest that <italic>SOX2</italic> and SOX21 are upregulated in differentiating cells in vitro and are expressed at lower levels in basal cells but (no) real mechanism or phenotype related to SOX21 function is observed in the SOX21 het mouse cells. In response the authors performed knockdown of SOX21 and <italic>SOX2</italic> in human ALI cultures which suggest a role for both genes in suppressing the differentiation of basal cells to ciliated cells. While an increase in FOXJ1 was detected in these knockdown experiments, the authors did not detect an increase in multiciliated cells.</p><p>In addition to assessment of SOX21 in human fetal lung organoids sections of human fetal lung and adult human lung are now included.</p><p>Overall, the authors have performed several experiments that have improved the manuscript. It appears that the role of SOX21 is context dependent and despite the authors detailed experiments the biology remains complicated to interpret.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57325.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In particular, the following major points require additional experimental data (details are outlined below):</p><p>1) The functional Sox21 role in the adult lung is not clear.</p><p>– Mouse studies would benefit from inclusion of overexpression of Sox21 in the airways.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the analysis of the effects of overexpressing SOX21 (and <italic>SOX2</italic>) on the epithelial differentiation of the airways late in gestation at E18.5 in figure 3E.

Thus, there is a direct link between the two proteins. Moreover, we performed <italic>SOX2</italic> and SOX21 ChIP-seq experiments using human ALI cultures. However, we will not report on the full data set (yet), but have included four genome tracks to show single <italic>SOX2</italic> or SOX21, and double <italic>SOX2</italic>-SOX21 occupancy at different genomic loci (Figure 7—figure supplement 1H). We included the supplemental figure, and refer to the data in the discussion line (452-457), to underly the importance of studying the interaction between these proteins further. Of note, the human ALI system is a culture method with a diverse range of cell types and all cell types are in different status of differentiation. It is challenging to study the interaction and function(s) of <italic>SOX2</italic> and SOX21 at the cellular level. As described previously and in the discussion (line 446-448), the interaction of both <italic>SOX2</italic> and SOX21 are highly context dependent, emphasizing the importance of obtaining a suitable system to study this interaction in the human and mouse airway epithelium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Presence of Sox9 positive basal cells as additional atypical basal cells needs to be further investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have further investigated the putative presence of <italic>SOX9</italic>+ basal cells in our experiments, and found that there are some rare <italic>SOX9</italic>+ basal-like cells. To acknowledge these findings, we have adapted the text (line 178-184) and added supplemental figure2-supplement 2E. As <italic>SOX9</italic>+ basal cells lack expression of the KRT5 basal marker (Utisyan 2016), we added a KRT5 staining of <italic>Sox2<sup>+/-</sup>, Sox21<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Sox21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> E18.5 lungs to analyze the number of basal cells (Figure 3E and figure 3 supplement 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Quantification the % of club cells in the corn oil and naphthalene treated tracheas of the different mutants as these are the main cells that should be replaced upon naphthalene injury.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the percentage of Club cells before and after the treatment with naphthalene, and we did not observe significant differences between the different genotypes, or between treated and non-treated animals.

In Figure 1C we indeed find that when <italic>Sox21</italic> is induced in the lung bud, <italic>SOX9</italic> remains expressed. Furthermore, in the airway we find some iSOX21 cells that are still low in expression of <italic>SOX9</italic>, but these are scarce and not all iSOX21 expressing cells do.</p><p>We did find the presence of TRP63 expressing <italic>SOX9</italic>+ basal cells in the SPC induced animals. However, we did not elaborate! As described by Ustiyan et al., the observed <italic>SOX9</italic>+ TRP63+ atypical basal cells are KRT5 negative. We included therefore KRT5 in our staining panel to analyze the number of basal cells in the proximal airways upon induction of <italic>Sox2</italic> or <italic>Sox21</italic> using the CC10 rTta (Figure 2B-E). All basal cells analyzed were also positive for KRT5. KRT5 was also added to analyze the number of basal cells in <italic>Sox2<sup>+/-</sup>, Sox21<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Sox21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at E18.5 (Figure 3E).</p><p>We have included these findings in the text and figures:</p><p>“Previously, conditional deletion of βcatenin in SPC+ cells during lung development showed the appearance of cystic structures, similar to the induction of <italic>SOX2</italic> and SOX21.

We have adapted the figure and the text accordingly:</p><p>“To determine whether <italic>SOX2</italic> or SOX21 deficiency affects regeneration after naphthalene injury, we quantified the percentage of secretory, ciliated, non-dividing and dividing basal cells at 20 DPI.

We did not continue these experiments, as the single cell RNA seq of human ALI cultures shows a high expression of <italic>SOX21</italic> in para-basal cells (Figure 7- figure supplement 1E) and the localization of high expressing SOX21 on human sections are found in the intermediate layer (Figure 6D). As there are some FOXJ1+ nuclei high in expression of SOX21 (Figure 7—figure supplement 1D) we interpreted the data as cells transition to ciliated cells. We observed with the added knock-down experiments that SOX21, similar as in mouse, inhibits ciliated cell differentiation in human ALI cultures. We excluded this possibly premature statement from the manuscript and now state the following:</p><p>“We hypothesize that these cells are intermediate cells transitioning from basal cells to a luminal cell fate, the para-basal cell.

The immunostaining and figures are elegant. It does not appear the Sox21 is necessary for airway development. A key question raised by this work is how important and what precisely is the role of Sox21? For example, overexpression of Sox21 in the developing and adult airways might have been more instructive in answering these key questions rather than under the control of the SPC-promoter.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good point, and indeed, the SOX21 knockout mice suggests that SOX21 is not necessary for lung development. However, SOX21 has a clear influence on the distribution of the different cell types, as we report.</p><p>Initially, we choose to use the SPC-driven rtTA, as this transgene is expressed early in development in most epithelial cells (e.g. Gontan et al., 2008). These data were included in the original manuscript. We have now expanded this data set using a mouse model to induce <italic>SOX2</italic> or SOX21 in differentiating epithelial cells, using the rtTA under the control of the CC10 promoter. This resulted in additional embryonic data, as well as new adult data, which we have included. For the embryonic data, we included the following text and accompanying figures:</p><p>“To further investigate the role of <italic>SOX2</italic> and SOX21 in differentiation of airway epithelium during development, we induced expression of the MYC-tagged <italic>Sox2</italic> or Sox21 transgenes in secretory cells using a CC10/SCGB1A1 driven rtTA inducible model (iSox2<sup>CC10-rtTA</sup> and iSox21<sup>CC10-rtTA</sup>) (Tichelaar, Lu et al. 2000). […] So, ectopic expression of <italic>SOX2</italic> and SOX21 during development stimulates the appearance of basal cells and decrease the number of ciliated cells.”</p><p>And for the adult data set:</p><p>“To further understand the role for <italic>SOX2</italic> and SOX21 in adult airway epithelium, we used the iSox2<sup>CC10-rtTA</sup> and iSox21<sup>CC10-rtTA</sup> mice to induce expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> or Sox21 in secretory cells for 6 weeks (Figure 4E). […] Similar as during development, the MYC+ transgene expressing cells were mostly negative for other cell specific markers in both mouse models (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The adult mouse data and human data seem to overall suggest that SOX2 and SOX21 are upregulated in differentiating cells in vitro and are expressed at lower levels in basal cells but real mechanism or phenotype related to SOX21 function is observed in the SOX21 het mouse cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure what the exact question is of the reviewer. In light of this, we have now expanded the human data with knock down experiments using shRNA constructs in human ALI cultures (figure 7 and figure 7—figure supplement 1). These data show comparable effects of reduced <italic>SOX2</italic> or SOX21 as observed in the mouse cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The attempt to assess human fetal airways is admirable.
