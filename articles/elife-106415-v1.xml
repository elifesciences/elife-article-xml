neural circuit function. In the chick brainstem auditory circuit, the pattern of nodal spacing varies regionally along single axons, enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization. Using this model, we investigated the potential factors underlying the biased nodal spacing pattern. 3D morphometry revealed that these axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct morphologies and cell densities across regions after hearing onset. The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant of the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density. Our findings highlight the importance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in fine-tuning neural circuit function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oligodendrocyte heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>oligodendrogenesis</kwd><kwd>3D morphometry</kwd><kwd>internodal length</kwd><kwd>interaural time difference</kwd><kwd>brainstem auditory circuit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00097mb19</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K15915</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Egawa</surname><given-names>Ryo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00097mb19</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23K05986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Egawa</surname><given-names>Ryo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00097mb19</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H04747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuba</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00097mb19</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21H02577</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuba</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00097mb19</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22K19358</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuba</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00097mb19</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24H00584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuba</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00097mb19</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K07039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Egawa</surname><given-names>Ryo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oligodendrocytes with different morphological features work together to support precise binaural integration for sound localization in the chick brainstem auditory circuit.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ranvier nodes are highly excitable domains distributed along myelinated axons and contribute to increased conduction velocity through saltatory conduction. The distance between adjacent nodes (internodal length) affects the speed of saltatory conduction, with longer internodes leading to faster conduction, and hence has a significant impact on neural circuit function by influencing the timing of input arrival at target neurons. The pattern of nodal spacing along axons is not necessarily uniform. Recent studies have shown that the internodal length varies not only among axonal types and brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chong et al., 2012</xref>), but also along individual axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tomassy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>). Despite its potential importance in neural information processing, the mechanisms regulating nodal spacing patterns are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Normand and Rasband, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Various factors could contribute to the emergence of nodal spacing patterns along axons. In the central nervous system (CNS), each Ranvier node is formed through the following processes. Immature oligodendrocytes contact axons with their processes, initiating myelin formation that extends along the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Snaidero et al., 2014</xref>). At the ends of the extending myelin, the paranodal domain, at which the myelin tip contacts the axon, acts as a diffusion barrier and facilitates the clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) and the scaffolding protein ankyrinG (AnkG) to form a heminode. Subsequent restriction of the gap between two neighboring heminodes forms a mature Ranvier node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vabnick et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Susuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rasband and Peles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rasband and Peles, 2021</xref>). Thus, the patterning of nodal spacing along axons is based on multicellular interactions among oligodendrocytes and axons and could be influenced by multiple factors associated with these cells. The factors related to oligodendrocytes include their morphological characteristics (e.g., the number and length of myelin sheaths), and cell density relative to axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chong et al., 2012</xref>), while those related to axons include their branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stedehouder et al., 2019</xref>), diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>), and neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fields, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bechler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Osanai et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the contributions of these factors would vary significantly due to the diversity of both cell types and developmental stages, which obscures our understanding of the mechanisms of determining the nodal spacing patterns.</p><p>To understand the regulatory mechanisms of nodal spacing, the chicken brainstem auditory circuit is an excellent model because the nodal spacing is biased in a region-dependent manner along the same projecting axons, minimizing the effects of neuronal diversity. In addition, this regional difference in internodal length is also important in the computation of neural circuits for sound localization. Sound localization is the ability to identify the direction of sound source and involves detecting the time difference in sound arrivals between the ears (interaural time difference [ITD]) in the order of microseconds. The ITD detection is mediated by an array of coincidence detector neurons in the nucleus laminaris (NL) that receive excitatory synaptic inputs from both sides of the nucleus magnocellularis (NM), a homologue of mammalian anteroventral cochlear nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carr and Konishi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hyson, 2005</xref>). In this circuit, the spacing of nodes along the axon of NM neurons differs among regions; the internodal length is longer at the tract region across the midline than at other regions including the NL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seidl et al., 2010</xref>). The long internodes reduce the conduction time from the contralateral side and compensate for the difference in axonal pathlengths between the two sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seidl et al., 2014</xref>), while the short internodes expand the dynamic range for detectable ITD within the NL. Therefore, this model will be an important stepping stone for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of nodal spacing and their impact on neural circuit function.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development of Ranvier nodes progressed in a similar time course along nucleus magnocellularis (NM) axons after hearing onset.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Axonal projection of NM neurons in the chicken brainstem.

Note that some immature nodes had long nodal domains that exceeded 5 μm. This may correspond to a gap between the two heminodes.

The results showed that NM axons are almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes with distinct morphological features after hearing onset. This morphological difference was not due to axonal structure. Inhibition of vesicular release from NM axons did not affect the internodal length and oligodendrocyte morphology but caused unmyelinated segments on NM axons via a suppression of oligodendrogenesis at the NL region. These results identified that the major factor contributing to the biased nodal spacing pattern in the ITD circuit is the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes. Activity-dependent signaling also contributed to this circuit by ensuring the density of oligodendrocytes through enhanced oligodendrogenesis. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of regulating nodal spacing along single axons and also into the significance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in neural circuit function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ranvier nodes developed in a similar time course along NM axons after hearing onset</title><p>NM neurons in chick embryos form axonal projections to the NL at embryonic day 10 (E10), begin to receive auditory input from around E12, and are functionally mature by the time around hatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), allowing the animals to localize sounds immediately after hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grier et al., 1967</xref>). To clarify how node formation progresses along development and whether there are regional differences in the timing of node formation, we examined the development of nodes at the tract and NL regions by double staining with AnkG and pan Nav antibodies or AnkG and Caspr antibodies, a marker for the paranodal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>).</p><p>At E12, we did not find these molecules at each region. At E15, Nav-positive clusters appeared, and they were localized specifically at one end of the fibrous AnkG signals. The remaining Nav-negative part of AnkG signals would correspond to the paranodal domain, as myelin sheath at the domain shows transient expression of AnkG during the immature period of CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2014</xref>), and these structures were defined as ‘heminode’. At E18, Caspr signals became detectable at the paranodal domain of heminode. In addition, some Caspr signals appeared on both sides of the fibrous AnkG signals, sandwiching the Nav cluster. These structures would be formed through the fusion of adjacent heminodes and were defined as ‘immature node’. At E21, many nodes showed mature patterns, with complete colocalization of Nav and AnkG at a short nodal domain, which was flanked by Caspr-positive paranodal domains (‘mature node’). Triple staining of these molecules confirmed the three stages of nodal development along the axon of NM neurons. Quantification of their abundance revealed that their maturation progressed gradually after hearing onset and was almost completed around hatch. 90% of the node types were heminodes at E15. This decreased to about 50% by E18 and to about 10% by E21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>), suggesting that NM axons are almost fully myelinated by E21. Although the increase in the proportion of immature nodes was slightly preceded at the tract region, the overall tendency did not differ greatly between the regions. These data indicate that the formation of Ranvier nodes progresses in a similar time course along the axon.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Development of myelin sheath along NM axons</title><p>Formation of Ranvier nodes requires maturation of myelin sheaths. To clarify their relationship on NM axons, we also examined the development of myelin with an antibody against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) during the period of node formation.</p><p>The immunosignals for MAG first appeared around the midline of the brainstem at E12 and extended along the axons of NM neurons by E15, becoming more intense at later ages for both tract and NL regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Detectable AnkG-positive clusters along NM axons also emerged at E13 concurrent with MAG signals, albeit very sparsely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations are consistent with the time course of nodal development shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and with the concept that Ranvier nodes form as myelin sheaths mature. Importantly, many oligodendrocytes were situated along the axon, as identified by immunopositivity of Olig2, a marker in the nucleus of oligodendrocyte lineage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, the MAG signals overlapped with the heminodes at E15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that myelin sheaths already exist around the paranodal domains at the very early stage of node formation, in agreement with the idea that the early nodes can shift their position dynamically with myelin maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These raised the questions as to when the biased nodal spacing pattern emerges during development and whether and how oligodendrocytes contribute to the process.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Regional differences in internodal length were evident during development.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Immunostaining of MAG between E9 and E21 (<bold>A</bold>).

We measured the density of OPCs by labeling the cells with Nkx2.2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> bottom, C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu et al., 2000</xref>).

These cells were restricted to the ventral and dorsal fiber layers and almost absent in the somatic and dendritic layers of NL. These results suggest that the density of OPCs increases around the period of hearing onset to a larger extent at the NL region, contributing to the higher density of oligodendrocyte lineage cells at this region. We evaluated the level of proliferation of OPCs with BrdU labeling and found that the density of BrdU-positive cells was significantly higher at the NL region during E12–16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).

Expression of eTeNT in most of the NM axons caused unmyelinated segments by region-specific suppression of oligodendrogenesis without affecting internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, suggesting that primary role of neural activity is to ensure the oligodendrocyte density necessary for full myelination of axons.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Biased nodal spacing pattern reflects regional heterogeneity of oligodendrocyte</title><p>The major factor contributing to regional differences in internodal length along NM axons was regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology. The morphological differences were observed not only in the length of myelin sheaths, but also in the number of myelin sheaths and the size of cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Considering the morphological classification of oligodendrocytes by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Río Hortega, 1928</xref>, oligodendrocytes at the tract and NL regions could be classified into types III and II, respectively. Such morphological heterogeneity could be related to the variation of gene profiles among oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marques et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Osanai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Valihrach et al., 2022</xref>). Differences in the origin and/or the pericellular microenvironment of OPCs during development may contribute to the diverse gene profiles of oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crawford et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foerster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foerster et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boshans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sherafat et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with the idea, OPCs in the brainstem have two developmental origins, derived from the ventral and dorsal sides of the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vallstedt et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, pericellular concentration of some ligands may differ between the tract and NL regions according to the distance from synapses or postsynaptic cells. Whether the gene profiles of oligodendrocytes and OPCs differ between the tract and NL regions and what causes the differences are important issues to be examined in the future.</p><p>The regional differences in the morphology of oligodendrocytes would primarily reflect their intrinsic properties specific to each region; the ability of myelin production is higher, while that of myelin extension is lower at the NL region than at the tract region. Supportively, the axonal factors, such as structure and vesicular release, did not affect the regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6H</xref>). Oligodendrocyte density did not affect the morphology, either; the number and length of myelin sheaths did not increase even when unmyelinated segments appeared after A3V-eTeNT transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J–K</xref>). Another potential factor influencing the regional differences in internodal length could be pre-nodal clusters which are formed by cell-autonomous accumulation of nodal components on the axons of certain types of neurons before myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaplan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freeman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vagionitis et al., 2022</xref>). However, our immunostaining results failed to detect such clusters on the NM axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This may be due to limited detection sensitivity or the unavailability of neurofascin antibodies in chickens. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that fixed pre-nodal clusters pre-determine internodal length prior to myelination, given the facts that the length of unmyelinated segments was far shorter than the internodal length at the NL region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Thus, we consider that the morphology of oligodendrocytes, and hence the length of myelin sheaths, is determined according to the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes at each region, which underlies the regional differentiation of nodal spacing along NM axons. Variations in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes are also reported in other brain regions. Oligodendrocytes in white matter are morphologically distinct from those in gray matter, and their original features did not change even when OPCs were cross-transplanted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Viganò et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, OPCs collected from different brain regions show their original morphological features when cultured on artificial fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>). In summary, our findings provide the perspective that oligodendrocytes with different intrinsic properties work together to fine-tune the neural circuit function involved in ITD detection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Adaptive oligodendrogenesis ensures full myelination of axons at the NL region</title><p>Neuronal activity can affect the proliferation, maturation, and morphology of oligodendrocytes, but the effects are not uniform across different neuronal subtypes and brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Osanai et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, the inhibition of vesicular release had different effects on myelination depending on neuronal subtype; myelination is impaired in some axons, but remains unaffected in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koudelka et al., 2016</xref>). In NM axons, activity-dependent signaling did not affect myelin formation in mature oligodendrocytes but instead facilitated proliferation and differentiation of OPCs. Given that this enhancement of oligodendrogenesis occurred specifically at the NL region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6I</xref>) and that unmyelinated segments were increased only when eTeNT was expressed in a large fraction of the axons via A3V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), exocytosis from the presynaptic terminals of NM axons would cause the effects by altering the perisynaptic microenvironment. Glutamate and several trophic factors such as BDNF, which are released from the terminals of NM axons, may act on the OPC directly via spillover from the synapse and/or indirectly via activation of NL neurons or astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pease-Raissi and Chan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fekete and Nishiyama, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pivoňková et al., 2024</xref>). Supportively, mRNA of NR1, a major subunit of NMDA receptor, is strongly expressed in glial cells, presumably oligodendrocyte lineage cells, at the ventral and dorsal dendritic layers of NL after E10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tang and Carr, 2007</xref>). Future studies are needed to determine what ligands mediate the differentiation and proliferation of OPCs as the activity-dependent signaling at the NL region and whether there are regional differences in the sensitivity of these OPCs to the ligands along the NM axon.</p><p>Adaptive oligodendrogenesis would support the function of brainstem auditory circuits by ensuring the full myelination of NM axons. Full myelination of the auditory pathway enables rapid membrane responses and high metabolic support during high-frequency firing, which are critical for precise and reliable processing of sound information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moore et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the full myelination at the NL region, which is mediated by the adaptive enhancement of oligodendrogenesis, would be particularly important for ITD detection. The contralateral projections of NM neurons have a sequential branching structure called a ‘delay line’ at the ventral area of NL in chickens. This delay line produces an output delay of up to 180 μs for contralateral NL neurons along the medial to lateral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Overholt et al., 1992</xref>). This delay covers the physiological ITD range for the chicken, allowing the ITDs to be encoded in a ‘place map’ within the NL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeffress, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Köppl and Carr, 2008</xref>). This should provide the neural basis for the ability of excellent sound localization in chickens, which can discriminate ITDs of about 20 μs (8.9° minimum audible angle) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krumm et al., 2022</xref>). Reliable myelination of the delay line ensures constant conduction velocity and output delay and hence is critical for precise ITD calculation. Thus, the adaptive oligodendrogenesis at the NL region would be a mechanism that secures the accuracy of ITD calculation in the avian auditory circuit. Interestingly, ITD representation within the NL exhibits plasticity around the period of hearing onset in the barn owl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2024</xref>), which coincides with the period of adaptive oligodendrogenesis, speculating its contribution to the plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Commonalities and differences with the sound localization circuit in mammals</title><p>Regional regulation of conduction velocity has also been reported in mammals. In a brainstem auditory circuit of gerbils, which is involved in the processing of ITDs, several regional differentiations have been observed in the nodal spacing along the axon. In the axon of spherical bushy cells, a mammalian homologue of NM neurons, the internodal length is longer for contralateral side than for the ipsilateral side, presumably compensating for the different axonal pathlength between the two sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seidl and Rubel, 2016</xref>). On the other hand, in the axon of globular bushy cells that project to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, the internodal length is longer for those innervating more medial location (i.e., more distal location), ensuring simultaneous inputs within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ford et al., 2015</xref>). These regional differentiations of nodal spacing would be acquired independently in mammals and birds through evolutionary convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lipovsek and Wingate, 2018</xref>), emphasizing their importance in securing ITD computation in the microsecond order. Notably, in globular bushy cells, neural activity did not alter the nodal spacing, but instead regulated the conduction velocity by adaptively changing the axon diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nabel et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism of action of activity-dependent signaling is different among neurons and species. It will be interesting to examine whether regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant in the biased nodal spacing pattern in mammalian ITD circuits as well. Such comparisons will help to understand the fundamental logic and mechanisms of determining nodal spacing patterns along the axons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study identified the factors mediating the regional differentiation of nodal spacing along single axons in the auditory pathway of chicken; the differentiation of nodal spacing reflects regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology, and the activity-dependent signaling from axons via vesicular release contributes to the full myelination of axons through region-specific enhancement of oligodendrogenesis. The results in this model system provide evidence that oligodendrocyte heterogeneity, which is widely observed in the brain, can contribute to achieving optimal timing of signals and optimal function of local circuits in the nervous system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

In this unique system, the spacing between nodes varies significantly in different regions of the same axon from early stages, which the authors suggest is critical for accurate sound localization. Egawa et al set out to determine which factors regulate this differential node spacing. They do this by using immunohistological analyses to test the correlation of node spacing with morphological properties of the axons, and properties of oligodendrocytes, glial cells that wrap axons with the myelin sheaths that flank the nodes of Ranvier. They find that axonal structure does not vary significantly, but that oligodendrocyte density and morphology varies in the different regions traversed by these axons, which suggests this is a key determinant of the region-specific differences in node density and myelin sheath length. They also find that differential oligodendrocyte density is partly determined by secreted neuronal signals, as (presumed) blockage of vesicle fusion with tetanus toxin reduced oligodendrocyte density in the region where it is normally higher. Based on these findings, the authors propose that oligodendrocyte morphology, myelin sheath length, and consequently nodal distribution are primarily determined by intrinsic oligodendrocyte properties rather than neuronal factors such as activity.</p><p>Significance:</p><p>In our view the study tackles a fundamental question likely to be of interest to a specialized audience of cellular neuroscientists. This descriptive study is suggestive that in the studied system, oligodendrocyte density determines the spacing between nodes of Ranvier, but further manipulations of oligodendrocyte density per se are needed to test this convincingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106415.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have investigated the myelination pattern along the axons of chick avian cochlear nucleus. It has already been shown that there are regional differences in the internodal length of axons in the nucleus magnocellularis. In the tract region across the midline, internodes are longer than in the nucleus laminaris region. Here the authors suggest that the difference in internodal length is attributed to heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes. In the tract region oligodendrocytes would contribute longer myelin internodes, while oligodendrocytes in the nucleus laminaris region would synthesize shorter myelin internodes. Not only length of myelin internodes differs, but also along the same axon unmyelinated areas between two internodes may vary. This is an interesting contribution since all these differences contribute to differential conduction velocity regulating ipsilateral and contralateral innervation of coincidence detector neurons. However, the demonstration falls rather short of being convincing.</p><p>Significance:</p><p>The authors suggest that the difference in internodal length is attributed to heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes.

However, the response regarding pre-nodes is not satisfactory. I understand that the authors prefer to avoid further experimentations, but I think this is an important point that needs to be clarified. Exploring stages between E12 and E15 are therefore of importance. When carefully examining some of the figures (Fig. 1E or 2D) I think that at E15 they may well be pre-nodes formation prior to myelin deposition, on structure the authors considered to be heminodes. To be convincing they should use double or triple labeling with, in addition to the nodal proteins (ankG and/or Nav pan), a good myelin marker such as antiPLP. The rat monoclonal developed by late Pr Ikenaka would give a sharper staining than the anti MAG they used. (I assume the clone must still be available in Okazaki).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your insightful comment regarding the possible presence of pre-nodal clusters along NM axons and your kind suggestion to use the PLP antibody (clone AA3; Yamamura et al., J Neurochem, 1991). We have obtained this monoclonal antibody from Dr. Kenji Tanaka previously in Okazaki and confirmed that it works well in chicken tissues. However, since this clone recognizes both PLP and DM-20 isoforms, it labels not only myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (MFOLs) but also newly formed oligodendrocytes (NFOLs) (Yokoyama et al., J Neurochem, 2025). Therefore, it is not ideal for determining whether nodal protein clusters are formed before myelin deposition.</p><p>Instead, we performed double immunostaining for MAG and AnkG between E12 and E15 to clarify the temporal relationship between myelin maturation and node formation. The results showed that detectable AnkG clusters along NM axons began to appear very sparsely around E13, coinciding with the emergence of MAG signals, and became more prominent with development. This temporal pattern does not match the definition of pre-nodal clusters, which are formed prior to myelination.</p><p>Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of undetectable pre-nodal clusters or those composed of molecules other than AnkG, our results support the view that pre-nodal clusters are unlikely to play a major role in determining the regional difference in nodal spacing along NM axons. These new data have been added as Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and the relevant sections in the Results, Discussion, and Figure legend have been revised accordingly (page 5, line 4; page 10, line 7; page 29, line 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
