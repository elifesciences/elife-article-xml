Here, we investigated whether prolonged Î²-adrenergic stimulation, a hallmark of HF, promotes RyR cluster dispersion and examined the underlying mechanisms. We observed that treatment of healthy rat cardiomyocytes with isoproterenol for 1 hr triggered progressive fragmentation of RyR clusters. Pharmacological inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) reversed these effects, while cluster dispersion was reproduced by specific activation of CaMKII, and in mice with constitutively active Ser2814-RyR. A similar role of protein kinase A (PKA) in promoting RyR cluster fragmentation was established by employing PKA activation or inhibition. Progressive cluster dispersion was linked to declining Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark fidelity and magnitude, and slowed release kinetics from Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation between more numerous RyR clusters. In healthy cells, this served to dampen the stimulatory actions of Î²-adrenergic stimulation over the longer term and protect against pro-arrhythmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. However, during HF, RyR dispersion was linked to impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Thus, RyR localization and function are intimately linked via channel phosphorylation by both CaMKII and PKA, which, while finely tuned in healthy cardiomyocytes, underlies impaired cardiac function during pathology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>calcium sparks</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocytes</kwd><kwd>ryanodine receptors</kwd><kwd>heart failure</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>Î²-adrenergic stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norwegian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>287395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>Yufeng</given-names></name><name><surname>Laasmaa</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>647714</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Kolstad</surname><given-names>Terje R</given-names></name><name><surname>Louch</surname><given-names>William E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prolonged Î²-adrenergic stimulation causes ryanodine receptor clusters to disperse, drastically altering the frequency and kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events called âCa<sup>2+</sup> sparksâ in a process that is dependent on CaMKII and PKA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In cardiomyocytes, the processes underlying initiation of contraction are well described, at least at the macroscale. Sarcolemmal depolarization triggers an influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through voltage-gated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LTCCs) within t-tubules, which in turn elicits a much larger release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol via ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This process of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) depends on the precise organization of LTCCs and RyRs within dyadic junctions of the two membranes, with LTCCs located in nanoscale apposition to RyRs across the dyadic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bers, 2001</xref>). Intrinsically, RyRs are organized into discrete clusters, and these arrangements are thought to be critical in defining channel function. Indeed, RyR clusters located within close proximity are proposed to cooperatively operate as Ca<sup>2+</sup> release units (CRUs) to generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baddeley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sobie et al., 2006</xref>), the elementary units of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>). Recent advances in high-resolution imaging techniques such as 3D dSTORM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shen et al., 2019</xref>), DNA-PAINT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jayasinghe et al., 2018</xref>), and electron tomography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghari et al., 2014</xref> have created an opportunity to understand these dyadic arrangements in unprecedented detail.</p><p>Contractile dysfunction and arrhythmogenesis are hallmarks of heart failure (HF), and considerable data have linked these phenomena to t-tubule disruption in this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Louch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Orchard et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, we reported that pathological changes occur also on the other side of the dyad, as we observed âdispersionâ of RyR clusters in failing cardiomyocytes. This RyR rearrangement specifically included fragmentation of RyR groupings into more numerous, smaller clusters, without any change in overall channel number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolstad et al., 2018</xref>). RyR dispersion was critically linked to low-fidelity spark generation. Furthermore, when Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was successfully triggered by a CRU, propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> between multiple clusters generated sparks with slow kinetics, and the overall Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient was desychronized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolstad et al., 2018</xref>). Similar fragmentation of CRUs has been reported in a sheep model of persistent atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Macquaide et al., 2015</xref>) and in monocrotaline-induced right ventricular failure in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sheard et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, accumulating evidence indicates that RyR mislocalization, and ensuing dysfunction, is a key contributor to pathophysiology.</p><p>What drives changes in RyR organization in diseased cardiomyocytes? Previous work has indicated that nanoscale RyR positioning is fine-tuned by phosphorylation of the channels, at least acutely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asghari et al., 2020</xref>), and that both Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of RyR disrupt its function during HF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marx et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). We presently hypothesized that these two phenomena are intimately linked. We demonstrate that prolonged Î²-adrenergic stimulation, as is well known to occur in HF, promotes RyR dispersion via both CaMKII- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the channel. This RyR reorganization and sensitization are associated with a time-dependent increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak, slowing of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark kinetics, and reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient magnitude. In healthy cells, these actions appear to be aimed at gradually countering the stimulatory effects of increased RyR phosphorylation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity. Indeed, we observed that sufficiently dispersed RyRs inhibit the development of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves that underlie arrhythmia. Conversely, blocking hyperphosphorylation of RyRs reverses channel dispersion in HF cells and associated impairment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, providing new insight into the protective mechanisms of Î²-blockade in this disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prolonged Î²-adrenergic receptor (Î²-AR) activation causes RyR cluster dispersion</title><p>Using 3D dSTORM imaging, we investigated the effects of long-term phosphorylation on RyR organization in cardiomyocytes. We specifically hypothesized that phosphorylation would fragment or âdisperseâ RyR clusters in a time-dependent manner. Numerically, such breaking apart of RyR groupings is expected to be reflected by a reduction in the average number of RyRs contained in each cluster, as illustrated in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This change would be accompanied by a concomitant increase in the total number of clusters as there are now more numerous, smaller clusters in a given 3D space. If marked RyR cluster dispersion occurs, the total number of RyRs contained in a CRU may also be reduced as clusters are no longer located in close enough proximity to be grouped in functional release units (edge-to-edge distances â¤ 100 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, if RyR dispersion occurs without the addition or loss of channels, then the total number of RyRs detected by dSTORM imaging should remain unchanged.</p><p>We compared RyR arrangements in normal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes to those treated with isoproterenol (100 nM) for varying lengths of time (10, 30, or 60 min). For the control group, cells were kept for 60 min following isolation prior to fixation for imaging. 3D dSTORM reconstructions revealed progressive RyR cluster dispersion as the duration of isoproterenol application increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Indeed, following a brief, 10 min bout of isoproterenol exposure, we detected a slight, but non-significant, change in measured cluster parameters. However, after 30 min of isoproterenol treatment, RyR cluster size significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), while cluster density increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). By 1 hr of Î²-AR activation, continued RyR rearrangement was sufficient to reduce CRU size as fewer RyRs remained within clusters located â¤ 100 nm from their neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, see enlargements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> for representative images of CRUs). Since overall RyR density was unchanged by isoproterenol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), the detected differences in RyR organization did not result from channel degradation, but rather indicate progressive dispersion of RyR clusters into more numerous, smaller groupings.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Prolonged Î²-adrenergic receptor (Î²-AR) activation disperses ryanodine receptor (RyR) clusters.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative reconstructions of interior RyR clusters based on 3D dSTORM in isolated rat cardiomyocytes (clusters were cropped from a region measuring 5 x 8 x 0.6 Î¼m).

We therefore hypothesized that isoproterenol-induced cluster dispersion is, at least in part, driven by the actions of CaMKII. To this end, we first tested the effects of the CaMKII competitive inhibitor autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (AIP, 2 ÂµM) following an initial hour-long isoproterenol incubation (i.e., 1 hr isoproterenol followed by 1 hr isoproterenol + AIP). We found that the addition of AIP markedly reversed cluster dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This was reflected by a significant increase in both RyR cluster size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) and CRU size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), as well as a significant reduction in RyR cluster density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).

However, we also noted the occurrence of smaller modeled release events not observable in experiments. These sub-spark events were characterized as Ca<sup>2+</sup> quarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brochet et al., 2011</xref>) (0.1 &lt; ÎF/F<sub>0</sub> &lt; 0.3) or failed sparks if their Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was negligible (ÎF/F<sub>0</sub> â¤ 0.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We defined spark fidelity as the proportion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events that manifested as full sparks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). With baseline model parameters, RyR cluster configuration was observed to have a large impact on spark fidelity. Indeed, the solid CRU arrangement reproducibly generated full sparks, and thus spark fidelity was high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, top panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). However, more quarks and failed sparks were observed in the CRUs with minor and moderate RyR dispersion, and in the CRU with major fragmentation, no full Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks were generated. Indeed, spark fidelity declined steadily with increased fragmentation (95% CI in solid CRU: 28.6â37.8% vs. majorly fragmented CRU: 0â1.2%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). However, Î²-AR stimulation, as performed in experiments, augments both RyR sensitivity and, particularly at early stages, SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content. Increasing channel sensitivity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release flux accordingly in the model increased the likelihood that dispersed CRU configurations successfully triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, bottom panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Thus, inter-RyR communication is improved during Î²-AR stimulation to enable a greater fraction of RyRs to be activated in fragmented CRUs. These findings support the experimental observation that spark-mediated leak is markedly increased even during prolonged Î²-AR when CRU configurations are dispersed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>).</p><p>We further employed the model to calculate the proportion of total RyR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak that is âsilentâ rather than spark-mediated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Due to declining spark fidelity, we observed that although total Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from a given CRU decreased with greater fragmentation, the proportion of leak that is silent increased dramatically. When including the effects of Î²-AR stimulation, the ratio of silent leak was strongly reduced for the mildly to moderately fragmented CRUs. For the majorly fragmented CRU, however, there remained a considerable amount of silent leak (majorly fragmented w/Î²-AR: 37.5% silent leak, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) linked to partial activation of the CRU (Ca<sup>2+</sup> quarks). These results suggest that when CRUs become markedly dispersed during chronic Î²-AR activation, both spark-mediated and silent leak contribute to declining SR content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>) linked to protection against Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4m</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the characteristics of successful sparks generated by the model to more closely interrogate the relationship between CRU structure and function. Individual simulation results are presented alongside experimental data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>. Minor to moderate degrees of RyR dispersion had rather little impact on spark amplitude, and simulated Î²-AR stimulation similarly increased spark magnitude for these CRUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Only majorly fragmented CRUs exhibited smaller Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks reflecting partial activation of RyRs. Given that experimental data showed a range of dispersed CRU configurations following Î²-AR stimulation (see example images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the modeling supports that mean spark amplitude was increased in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). The time to peak (TTP) of sparks increased with the degree of dispersion in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>), and, under simulated Î²-AR activation, this was primarily due to the sensitized RyRsâ improved ability to sustain regenerative release between clusters. Indeed, in simulations where SR load was systematically altered with constant RyR Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity, spark kinetics were not markedly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These findings support that RyR cluster dispersion during prolonged Î²-AR activation is directly associated with larger and slower Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks observed experimentally.</p><p>Taken together, the modeling results critically link changes in CRU configuration and spark morphology; phenomena that were observed separately in experiments. However, the modeling data also support the contention from experimental data that RyR cluster fragmentation can reduce arrhythmogenic spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves). Here, the antiarrhythmic actions of RyR dispersion appear to be linked to a reduction in SR content resulting from an increase in both spark-mediated and silent leak. We postulate that local regions of the cell with dispersed CRUs and lowered SR content may act as a physical barrier or âfire breakâ to impede Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave propagation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CaMKII and PKA activation promote RyR dispersion and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation during HF</title><p>We next examined whether dispersion of RyRs reported during HF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolstad et al., 2018</xref>) similarly results from RyR hyperphosphorylation.

These structural changes are consistent with a previous 2D super-resolution study that utilized the same pathological model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolstad et al., 2018</xref>). Next, we subjected cells to either CaMKII or PKA inhibition to assess whether disrupted RyR organization could be reversed. Indeed, inhibiting CaMKII phosphorylation with AIP in HF cells restored RyR organization to sham values, as evidenced by a 49% increase in cluster size and a 47% increase in CRU size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d and e</xref>). To a lesser extent, the addition of H89 to failing cells also significantly reversed RyR dispersion at the cluster level (28% increase) and CRU level (19% increase). Correlative imaging of RyRs and t-tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) revealed a significantly smaller proportion of dyadic clusters in HF compared to sham (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>); an expected finding since reduced t-tubule density in this model results in the formation of âorphanedâ RyRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frisk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2006</xref>). The smaller RyR clusters observed in failing cells were found to exclusively occur at dyadic sites (sham: 9.09 Â± 0.47 vs. HF: 6.81 Â± 0.44 RyRs/cluster), where dispersed RyR arrangements were again reversible by CaMKII or PKA inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). The striking similarity of these findings to experiments employing prolonged isoproterenol exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) supports that fragmentation of RyR clusters during HF results from increased activation of both CaMKII and PKA, likely as a consequence of the chronic Î²-AR stimulation that is well established in this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganguly et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we examined whether alterations in RyR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release during HF could be linked to RyR phosphorylation and dispersion. Representative recordings of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>, together with temporal profiles shown on right. Failing cardiomyocytes exhibited significantly increased frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>), slower rise time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j</xref>), and longer duration sparks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k</xref>) than in sham cells, which summated to marked augmentation of spark-mediated leak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6l</xref>). All of these changes were reversed by inhibiting CaMKII or PKA, although the effects of CaMKII inhibition were the most marked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6hâl</xref>). Overall Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were of lower magnitude in failing cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6m</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was observed to be slowed and dyssynchronous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6n and o</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref> for representative examples). CaMKII inhibition again reversed changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient kinetics and synchrony in failing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6n and o</xref>). Taken together, these findings identify phosphorylation-dependent RyR dispersion as a key driver of RyR dysfunction in HF and particularly implicate CaMKII overactivity in this process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we identify an important new mechanism by which RyR organization and function are controlled by Î²-AR stimulation. Specifically, we show that during prolonged Î²-AR activation, as occurs during HF, there is a progressive dispersion of RyR clusters. This fragmentation is driven by both CaMKII- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the channel, and is reversible by inhibiting these kinases. Functionally, our results indicate that dispersed CRUs exhibit increased âsilentâ Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak and low spark fidelity. When Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks are successfully generated by dispersed CRUs, they exhibit slowed kinetics and reduced magnitude. These changes are in turn coupled with smaller and desynchronized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which are hallmarks of failing cells. However, we also observed protective actions of CRU dispersion as lowered spark fidelity and declining SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content protected against Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave generation. Thus, RyR dispersal appears to be aimed at curbing arrhythmogenesis during prolonged Î²-AR stimulation, but comes at the expense of systolic function, and this is particularly detrimental in the setting of HF.</p><p>While the precise nature of inter-RyR dynamics remains incompletely understood, several previous studies have suggested that there are important structural determinants of CRU function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galice et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolstad et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Walker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zima et al., 2008</xref>). Of note, recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galice et al., 2018</xref> measured RyR cluster size and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks simultaneously, finding that spark frequency depends steeply on cluster size, while spark amplitudes appear to be independent of size above a certain threshold. The authors argued that RyR cluster sizes must strike a balance between being sufficiently large to ensure high-fidelity CICR, but not so large as to promote arrhythmogenic behavior. When RyR channels are sensitized or Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are elevated, this balance shifts, increasing the propensity for sparks, diastolic leak, and waves. Extending from these findings, our present experimental and mathematical modeling results suggest that RyR cluster dispersion compensates for this shift by physically inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave propagation, but to the detriment of spark fidelity.</p><p>Our data show that marked RyR cluster dispersion occurs only after prolonged Î²-AR stimulation, which likely explains why previous, acute treatment studies have not detected similar changes in RyR arrangement or function. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asghari et al., 2020</xref> recently performed detailed analysis of internal RyR positioning, but within only 10 min of channel phosphorylation. Nevertheless, these authors did observe changes in the precise positioning of neighboring RyRs within this time frame as a checkerboard arrangement of RyRs was favored over side-by-side arrangements. Both arrangements involve SRPY and P1 domainâdomain interactions between adjacent receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabra et al., 2016</xref>). A shift in the configuration of these domains, for example, during phosphorylation, might be envisioned to reduce the stability of RyR dimerization, that is, reducing RyR âstickiness.â Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asghari et al., 2020</xref> observed a modest rightward shift in the RyRâRyR nearest-neighbor distance early after initiation of phosphorylation, which could represent the earliest stages of interior cluster breakup that we have observed at later time points. However, neither we (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>) nor Asghari et al. observed similar rearrangement of RyRs at the cell surface during Î²-AR stimulation. Rather both groups observed a tendency toward <italic>increased</italic> cluster size at the cell surface, starting from early time points after initiation of Î²-AR stimulation. The reason for the disparate response to phosphorylation between surface and interior clusters remains unclear. However, there may be unique features of RyRs and/or their partner proteins that render their positioning phosphorylation-sensitive. FKBP12.6 is one such candidate as it has been shown to be directly involved in domainâdomain interactions between adjacent RyRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabra et al., 2016</xref>) and to fine-tune RyR positions in directions that are opposite those of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asghari et al., 2020</xref>). Another possible explanation is the cellular distribution of different subtypes of Î²-AR. Previously, it has been shown that while Î²<sub>1</sub>-AR is ubiquitously distributed across the cardiomyocyte surface, Î²<sub>2</sub>-AR are only present in the t-tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nikolaev et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it is possible that it is solely Î²<sub>2</sub>-AR activation that is responsible for signaling RyR cluster dispersion; a hypothesis that will be investigated in future work.</p><p>It is well established that prolonged Î²-AR stimulation is linked to time-dependent desensitization of the signaling pathway; a process that involves G protein-coupled receptor kinases and Î²-arrestins that promote internalization and downregulation of the receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kayki-Mutlu and Koch, 2021</xref>). Our results indicate that this process was likely initiated in our experiments since RyR phosphorylation at ser-2814 and ser-2808 both exhibited bell-shaped responses during the 1 hr treatment protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). A similar response was observed in measurements of SERCA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). Importantly, RyR phosphorylation by CaMKII and/or PKA remained elevated above control levels at the end of the protocol. These heightened phosphorylation levels apparently remain sufficient to support RyR dispersion since inhibition of either kinase following Î²-AR stimulation caused RyRs to re-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2aâf</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3a-e</xref>). The regulatory role of CaMKII and PKA on RyR dispersion was additionally corroborated by experiments showing that selective activation of either kinase induced fragmented CRU arrangements. Furthermore, transgenic mice with constitutively active S2814 were found to have significantly dispersed clusters at baseline compared to their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2gâl</xref>). Notably, genetic ablation of S2814 did not appear to inhibit the effects of Î²-AR stimulation, which continued to reduce RyR cluster size and increase cluster density. Taken together, these findings point to a more complicated mechanism responsible for cluster dispersion than direct phosphorylation of the RyR at the S2814 and S2808 residues by CaMKII and PKA, respectively. Rather, it seems likely that CaMKII and PKA act interdependently on the RyR. Other studies have also suggested cross-talk between the two sites, with one observing changes to S2814 phosphorylation in an S2808 mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and another demonstrating increased PKA activity at S2808 following S2814 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haji-Ghassemi et al., 2019</xref>). In HF cells, we detected an increase in RyR phosphorylation at S2814, but only a minor trend towards higher phosphorylation at S2808. Still, inhibition of either CaMKII or PKA reversed cluster dispersion in these cells, although the extent of reversion following AIP administration was more complete than that obtained with H89. These results appear to be consistent with studies suggesting that PKA may not be the principal determinant of RyR hyperphosphorylation in HF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>), but also indicate that CaMKII and PKA control RyR clustering in a coordinated manner.</p><p>Although we observed a close relationship between RyR organization and function in our experiments, we relied on mathematical modeling to directly interrogate the functional implications of cluster dispersion vs. other regulatory effects of Î²-AR stimulation. The modeling results indicated that RyR cluster fragmentation is sufficient to significantly weaken intra-CRU RyR communication. Notably, these structural-driven changes in function were opposite those induced by regulatory changes as increased RyR sensitivity to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and increased SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content increased intra-CRU RyR communication. These observations are consistent with the view that while acute Î²-AR stimulation effectively augments CICR, progressive RyR dispersion and accompanying decline of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content during continued exposure serves to gradually reverse these changes as Ca<sup>2+</sup> release fidelity, magnitude, and kinetics are compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5câf</xref>). In healthy cardiomyocytes, this functional decline was not overly severe as Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients measured experimentally remained somewhat larger than in untreated cells, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release kinetics were only modestly slowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j and k</xref>). However, during HF, more detrimental consequences of RyR dispersion are expected as SR content is reduced below normal levels. Thus, compensatory changes in RyR function observed in healthy cells during Î²-AR stimulation are expected to be less present and impairment of CICR more robust. Future work should be aimed at directly linking Î²-adrenergic tone, RyR dispersion, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling impairments in experimental HF and establish the reversibility of this relationship by the application of Î²-blockers.</p><p>Experimental studies have frequently linked increases in spark frequency to higher incidence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">FernÃ¡ndez-Velasco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Terentyev et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we also report a marked increase in both spark and wave incidence during the early stages of Î²-AR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i and m</xref>). However, while both spark frequency and mass continued to increase with prolonged treatment, wave incidence significantly declined. While this finding may at first seem counterintuitive, a similar âparadoxicalâ observation was reported in a canine model of left ventricular hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Song et al., 2005</xref>). The authors hypothesized that disconnects between junctional SR clusters and LTCCs could lead to spatial heterogeneity in SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, enabling regions with lower SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> to act as âfire breaksâ against wave propagation. We suggest that an analogous mechanism explains our findings, but which may include both reduced SR content and dispersed CRUs acting as a physical barrier to Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave propagation. Since accumulating evidence supports that RyR positioning is tightly regulated, we believe that RyR dispersion in healthy cardiomyocytes is, by design, aimed at curbing wave generation during prolonged Î²-AR stimulation. This is an important consideration if we are to consider targeting RyR localization in disease. While increasing RyRâRyR âstickinessâ in failing cells would be expected to augment RyR clusters sizes, inter-channel collaboration, and systolic function, our data suggest that such effects may also increase susceptibility to arrhythmia.</p><p>In summary, we observed that RyR clusters progressively disperse during protracted Î²-AR activation due to channel phosphorylation by both CaMKII and PKA. Experimental and mathematical modeling results linked this dyadic rearrangement to declining efficacy of CICR, including slowed and reduced magnitude Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, but also protection against pro-arrhythmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. These findings have important implications for HF and other conditions such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which are associated with increased phosphorylation of RyRs and risk of arrhythmia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transgenic mice</title><p>We examined the effects of the CaMKII phosphorylation site S2814 on RyR configuration by employing knock-in transgenic mouse models, where the site was rendered constitutively active (RyR2-S2814D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Oort et al., 2010</xref>) or genetically ablated (RyR2-S2814A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chelu et al., 2010</xref>).

Deconvolution of confocal images was performed using Huygens Essential software (SVI, the Netherlands), with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5. Using the confocally imaged RyR channel as a reference, confocally measured t-tubule distributions were correlated to dSTORM-derived RyR positions. This was done with a custom-written Python script that corrected for both lateral, axial, translational, and scaling differences between the two imaging modalities to optimally align the dSTORM-derived RyR data with the confocal RyR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>3D geometric rendering of RyRs and t-tubules</title><p>To examine the arrangement of RyR clusters in relation to t-tubules, 3D volumetric geometries were constructed from the correlated images of these structures using the same approach as described in our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shen et al., 2019</xref>).

The resulting thresholded structures were skeletonized using a 3D skeletonization algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 1994</xref>), and re-dilated to form 250-nm-wide cylindrical t-tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Soeller and Cannell, 1999</xref>). The correlated dSTORM imaging data of RyRs were then fitted to the same voxel grid and Otsu thresholded. The majority of the thresholded clusters directly overlapped with the defined dyadic RyR face. Due to inaccuracies in the t-tubule reconstruction as well as limited precision in the underlying confocal imaging, all clusters lying within 150 nm of a reconstructed t-tubule were estimated to be dyadic clusters. More distally localized RyR clusters were deemed to be non-dyadic.</p><p>To render the 3D geometric reconstructions and produce geometric meshes for use in mathematical modeling, specific locations of individual RyRs were assigned by projecting the thresholded dyadic cluster data onto a cylindrical shell surrounding the t-tubules, leaving a 1-voxel-wide (10 nm) dyadic cleft. These overlap interfaces were then randomly filled with RyRs such that no channels were closer than a center-to-center distance of 30 nm.

The junctional SR (jSR) terminals for each cluster were defined by iterative morphological binary dilation of the RyRs constrained to a 20-nm-wide cylindrical shell surrounding the t-tubules. Dilation was performed with a structuring element with a square connectivity of one for nine iterations. This method was chosen because it produces a jSR that evenly surrounds the RyR channels in the cluster, defines a well-constrained dyadic cleft space, and has a jSR volume on the order of 3â4 Ã 10<sup>â12</sup> ÂµL, which is in good agreement with the values reported by electron microscopy tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hake et al., 2012</xref>).

These two model parameters and their adjustments were constrained by comparing the amplitude and rise time of simulated sparks to experimental measurements made in control and isoproterenol treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Analysis of spark simulations</title><p>A total of 400 simulations were performed for both baseline and isoproterenol parameter sets, with each CRU geometry.

The probability of each RyR opening and closing was thus based on its own locally sensed Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. The simulations continued until all RyRs in the CRU had been simultaneously closed for at least 1 ms, at which point the simulation was terminated.

To estimate the fidelity, we used the maximum-likelihood predictor of the probability, which is simply the observed ratio of successful sparks to total simulations. Extra care should be taken while calculating a confidence interval for spark fidelity as we might expect the fidelity to be very close to or equal to 0 for severely fragmented clusters.

Statistical significance between sample means was calculated by nested ANOVA (SPSS, IBM), with Fisherâs least significant difference post-hoc comparison where appropriate. p-Values&lt;0.05 were considered to be significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Code availability</title><p>Custom code used in this study is available at the public repository <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/louch-group/ryr-tt-correlative-analsyis">https://gitlab.com/louch-group/ryr-tt-correlative-analsyis</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van den Brink et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Data curation, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Data curation, Validation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Norwegian Animal Welfare Act and NIH Guidelines, and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Oslo and the Norwegian animal welfare committee (FOTS ID 20208). The majority of the experiments were performed on adult male Wistar rats (250â350 g) purchased from Janvier Labs (Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France). Rats were group -housed at 22Â°C on a 12 hr:12 hr lightâdark cycle, with free access to food and water. Cardiomyocytes isolated from transgenic RyR2-S2814D and RyR2-S2814A mice were provided by the laboratory of Xander Wehrens (Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, United StatesTX), where experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academies Press, 2011) and approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. A total of 64 rats and 6 mice were used in this study.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Definition of modeled ryanodine receptor (RyR) cluster geometries.</title><p>From a large number of automatically generated 3D Ca<sup>2+</sup> release unit (CRU) geometries, four were selected to be used in mathematical modeling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.

I leave this as an open question as it isn't clear to me how best to do this and it is perhaps not trivial, possible, or necessary!</p><p>Reviewer 2 makes the comments that:</p><p>â A critical control is missing to demonstrate the effects of 2 hrs ISO treatment on RyR2 arrangements. This will strengthen the conclusions from the CaMKII and PKA inhibitor RYR2 dispersion reversal experiments which utilize a protocol that includes a 1 hr ISO stimulation followed by a 1Hr ISO + inhibitor treatment.</p><p>â The mathematical modeling results would also benefit from more explanation of how they complement, align, and expand on the experimental studies.</p><p>The reviewers also make the following major points:<italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. A brief explanation of how CRU fragmentation would be reflected by changes to the reported dSTORM parameters (RyR cluster size, CRU size, and cluster density) at the start of the Results section would help to orient the reader.</p><p>2. Reconstructions of representative CRUs are presented in Figure 1, 2, and 3, with selected CRUs inset as compelling visual illustrations of CRU fragmentation or reformation. It would be beneficial to allow the reader to decide for themselves if they are truly representative by stating their dSTORM parameter values in the figure or legend. This is especially true where single representative CRUs are presented as in Figure 2a-c and Figure 3a and b.</p><p>3. On line 192 the authors state 'We found that the RyR arrangement in the phosphomimetic S2814D 193 mutant cells at baseline resembled the fragmented RyR organization observed in wild type (WT) 194 animals after isoproterenol treatment (Figure 2g, h). Indeed, cluster size (Figure 2j), CRU size (Figure 2k), and 195 cluster density (Figure 2l) were all similar in WT + ISO and S2814D cardiomyocytes, and significantly 196 different from untreated WT cells. Furthermore, application of isoproterenol to S2814D cardiomyocytes 197 did not lead to significant additional RyR dispersion, and only tendencies toward smaller cluster and 198 CRU sizes (Figure 2h, j-l).'</p><p>The representative CRU reconstructions in Figure 2g and h seem to contradict the quantified dSTORM parameters in Figure 2h, j-l and the description of the results in the text (starting at Line 192). This indicates a possible error in the production of the figure or that the choice of representative CRUs could be improved. In the images, the S214D CRUs appear more similar to wt (aside from the CRU selected for the insert) rather than wt + ISO as expected from the plotted data. There also appears to be significantly greater disruption visible in the S2814D + ISO than S2814D as a result, again counter to the observation made in the text about the plotted data.</p><p>4. There is a minor discrepancy between the naming of CaMKII mutants in Figure 2. panels (2814D and 2814A) and the text (S2814D and S2814A).</p><p>5. A more precise description of the source of the S2814D and S2814A cardiomyocytes is needed for the reader to fully understand the strength of these control experiments. The authors currently state in the text and Materials and methods section that they are isolated from transgenic RyR2-S214D and RyR2-S214A mice provided by the Wehrens lab. The paper reference provided is only partially helpful as it describes the generation of homozygous knock-in mice RyR2-S214A but makes no mention of RyR2-S214D. I would assume that both are isolated from homozygous knock-in mice but please confirm if this is indeed the case and state it explicitly in the manuscript.</p><p>6. Figure 2, 3, 4, and 6 legends refer to various bar charts of quantified dSTORM parameters and ca<sup>2+</sup> spark and wave properties as 'Mean data' and it is not clear what this means. It might be less confusing simply to use the term 'Experimental data' instead.</p><p>7. Connected to the previous point, the bar charts in Figure 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are nicely presented so that the mean, SEM, and variation in the datapoints of a given variable are clear. However, it is not always obvious whether each datapoint represents individual measurements or a cell average and this information should be stated clearly in either the legends or methods section.</p><p>8. A brief description of how spark-mediated ca<sup>2+</sup> leak is calculated from spark mass and frequency is missing from the Materials and methods section.</p><p>9. Figure 5c-f: These panels seem to have shared keys for the data represented by unshaded and shaded bars that only appear in the final panel (Figure 5f). It would be clearer if the difference between unshaded and shaded was described in the figure legend with reference to the applicable panels. The same applies to Figure 6f-g.</p><p>10. The Ethical approval section of Materials and methods needs to be checked for references to other journals.</p><p>11. Supplementary Tables 1-3 would benefit from brief explanations of their contents.<italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors report that a 1 hr ISO stimulation followed by a 1 hr ISO stimulation in the presence of AIP led to a reversal of the ISO-induced RyR2 dispersal and concluded that CaMKII thus mediated RyR2 cluster dispersion downstream of B-AR stimulation. However, in this protocol, the cells are fixed after a 2 hr total exposure to ISO and it is unknown what this duration of ISO treatment does to RyR2 clustering and distribution. To increase confidence in these findings, an important control must be added. RyR2 clusters should be examined after 2 hrs ISO treatment (without any inhibitors on board). Likewise, a similar protocol is employed to test the effects of PKA on cluster dispersal, with the authors reporting that H89 reversed the dispersal. Again, this finding would be strengthened by knowing what 2 hrs of ISO does to RyR2 clustering and distribution. The same 2 hr total ISO stimulation protocol is used when the authors assess whether H89 or AIP can reverse the slowing in spark kinetics. To strengthen confidence in this finding, spark kinetics should also be examined after 2hrs of ISO treatment. The results may be quite different from those seen after a 1 hr treatment especially given the finding that RyR phosphorylation at ser-2814 and ser-2808 both exhibited bell-shaped responses during the 1 h ISO stimulation. If one extends that treatment to 2 hrs, phosphorylation of S2814 and S2808 may continue to fall and this complicates the findings with the inhibitors.</p><p>2) At each ISO-treated time point, the study would benefit from the inclusion of an accompanying no-ISO control. Does the RyR dispersal occur because the cells are deteriorating with more time post-isolation, or is it specifically and exclusively because of the acute ISO-induced stress? These controls would help address that question and strengthen the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>3) There is no indication of statistical significance on any of the summary data plots or mention of P values. This should be addressed.</p><p>4) The modeling results need to be put into context and compared with what is going on in the experimental data. This section is somewhat confusing and is a bit of a jarring shift away from the experimental section. It should be better integrated. The authors state &quot;the modeling results indicate that RyR ca<sup>2+</sup> leak shifts from spark-mediated to silent leak when CRUs are dispersed, reducing the fidelity of spark generation&quot; but in figure 4h, spark-mediated (non-silent) leak is strikingly increased after 60 mins of ISO treatment which leads to the most profound dispersal. Please clarify how these results align. Perhaps there is more of both spark-mediated leak and non-spark leak? What experimental data supports non-spark mediated leak? The idea that there could be localized regions of SR ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion that act as &quot;fire-breaks&quot; to prevent the generation of ca<sup>2+</sup> waves even though there are more ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks is logical and provides a satisfying theory that unifies some of the seemingly paradoxical findings but this is only raised in the second to last paragraph of the discussion. Raising this idea earlier may help the reader connect the dots more easily.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77725.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The reviewers make the following broad points:</p><p>Reviewer 1 would like you to consider the following suggestions:</p><p>First, in the absence of a control with RyR constitutively active at the S2808 (PKA) phosphorylation site, it would be interesting to see if direct activation of PKA using 6MB-cAMP is sufficient to induce disruption of the RyR-S2814A. Conversely, the ability of PKA inhibition to reverse the ISO-induced RyR disruption of RyR-S2814D could also be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions for these additional control experiments, which we have now performed. As expected, 6MB-cAMP remained effective in dispersing RyR clusters in RyR-S2814A cells, supporting that 6MB exerts its actions independent from the CaMKII phosphorylation site on RyR. For the second experiment, we believe you meant to suggest applying PKA inhibition (H89) together with ISO treatment in the S2814A cells, not S2814D cells. This experiment would then show that H89-induced inhibition of RyR dispersion is mediated via PKA inhibition without contribution of the 2814 site. Performing these experiments confirmed this hypothesis. We have added these new data to the bottom of Figure 3, and included the following addition to the main text:</p><p>Page 4, line 228:</p><p>âImportantly, 6MB-induced RyR dispersion in S2814A cardiomyocytes (Figure 3f, h-j) which was comparable to that observed in WT. Similarly, dispersion observed in S2814A cardiomyocytes treated with isoproterenol was reversed by the addition of H89 (Figure 3g-j). These observations support that 6MB and H89 treatments exerted their effects on RyR configuration via modulation of PKA activity, without contribution from the CaMKII phosphorylation site on the RyR. Taken together, these data indicate that prolonged PKA-dependent phosphorylation of RyRs is sufficient to drive RyR cluster fragmentation, but that both PKA and CaMKII concertedly drive this process during Î²-AR stimulation.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along similar lines, after prolonged stimulation of Î²-AR, or in failing cardiomyocytes inhibition of either CaMKII or PKA partially reverses RyR disruption and CICR disruption. Have you tested whether the disruption is completely reversed by the simultaneous inhibition of both?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that inhibition of CaMKII or PKA individually did not fully reverse the effects of ISO treatment on RyR configuration and ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks. We have now tested the combined actions on AIP and H89 in ISO-treated cells. As expected, we observed a significant further reversal of the RyR dispersion induced from ISO treatment (Figure 3 âfigure supplement 5a-c). Similarly, we observed a tendency for further reversal of spark characteristics when AIP and H89 were combined (Figure 3 âfigure supplement 5d-f).</p><p>We have added text accordingly to two parts of the manuscript:</p><p>Page 3, Line 216:</p><p>âAs in experiments investigating effects of CaMKII inhibition (Figure 2), it should be noted that PKA inhibition did not fully restore the RyR configuration at the CRU level. Indeed, simultaneous treatment of cardiomyocytes with AIP and H89 resulted in further reversal of the effects of isoproterenol on CRU size, beyond those observed with either agent alone (Figure 3 âfigure supplement 1a-c). These observations are consistent with summative roles of PKA and CaMKII activation in promoting RyR dispersionâ</p><p>Page 4, Line 252:</p><p>âA tendency toward additive effects was noted when AIP and H89 treatments were combined (Figure 3 âfigure supplement 1d-f). In control experiments, a 2 h treatment period with isoproterenol alone (matching the total treatment time in AIP and H89 experiments) did not alter ca<sup>2+</sup> spark properties beyond values observed at the 1 h time point (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2c, d). Taken together, these data indicate that, during prolonged Î²-AR stimulation, RyR dispersion induced by PKA and CaMKII activity is linked to slowing of ca<sup>2+</sup> spark kinetics and increased ca<sup>2+</sup> leakâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The link between Î²-AR stimulation and phosphorylation-dependent RyR dispersion in heart failure is assumed rather than tested (line 393). I note that care has been taken not to assert this too strongly and that phosphorylation-dependent RyR dispersion is the key claim, but I am curious to know if considered any ways to test it (perhaps by running experiments in post-infarction cells where Î²-AR has been inhibited)?

Although considerable previous work has supported the presence of a hyper-sympathetic state in heart failure, including in post-infarction rats (Ganguly et al., AJP 1997), we have not tested effects of reducing sympathetic tone on RyR configuration. We have now clarified this point, and edited the following sentence in the Results section (Page 7, line 372):</p><p>âThe striking similarity of these findings to experiments employing prolonged isoproterenol exposure (Figures 1-4) supports that fragmentation of RyR clusters during HF results from increased activation of both CaMKII and PKA, likely as a consequence of the chronic Î²-AR stimulation that is well established in this condition (Ganguly et al., AJP, 1997).â</p><p>We have also raised this point in the Discussion, where we mention the importance of examining effects of Î²-blockers in future heart failure studies (page 9, line 480):</p><p>âFuture work should be aimed at directly linking Î²-adrenergic tone, RyR dispersion, and ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling impairments in experimental HF, and establish the reversibility of this relationship by the application of Î²-blockers.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 makes the comments that:</p><p>â A critical control is missing to demonstrate the effects of 2 hrs ISO treatment on RyR2 arrangements. This will strengthen the conclusions from the CaMKII and PKA inhibitor RYR2 dispersion reversal experiments which utilize a protocol that includes a 1 hr ISO stimulation followed by a 1Hr ISO + inhibitor treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>Your point is well taken that the total treatment time for ISO + AIP (Figure 2) or ISO + H89 (Figure 3) is 2 hours. Thus, we have now included a 2 h ISO control, and observed no further RyR cluster dispersion beyond levels present in the 1 h ISO group. These data have been presented in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2a, b rather than the main figures which were becoming quite cumbersome. The follow edit has been made to the text on page 3, line 179:</p><p>âIn control experiments, the longer 2 h treatment period with isoproterenol alone did not alter RyR configuration beyond values observed at the 1 h time point (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2a, b).â</p><p>Similarly, we have included 2 hr ISO control experiments for ca<sup>2+</sup> spark characteristics, and again observed no further effects beyond changes observed at 1 h (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2c, d). Text has been added on page 4, line 253 stating:</p><p>âIn control experiments, a 2 h treatment period with isoproterenol alone (matching the total treatment time in AIP and H89 experiments) did not alter ca<sup>2+</sup> spark properties beyond values observed at the 1 h time point (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2c, d).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The mathematical modeling results would also benefit from more explanation of how they complement, align, and expand on the experimental studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have now edited the description of the mathematical modeling data, and emphasized how these results complement and expand upon experimental findings. Importantly, we have noted how calculations of spark-mediated and silent leak observed in modeling contribute to reduction in SR ca<sup>2+</sup> content, and thereby inhibition of ca<sup>2+</sup> waves following RyR dispersal. Finally, we have included a new paragraph at the end of the modeling Results section summing up our key findings (page 6, line 340):</p><p>âTaken together, the modeling results critically link changes in CRU configuration and spark morphology; phenomena that were observed separately in experiments. However, the modeling data also support the contention from experimental data that RyR cluster fragmentation can reduce arrhythmogenic spontaneous ca<sup>2+</sup> release (ca<sup>2+</sup> waves). Here, the antiarrhythmic actions of RyR dispersion appear to be linked to a reduction in SR content resulting from an increase in both spark-mediated and silent leak. We postulate that local regions of the cell with dispersed CRUs and lowered SR content may act as a physical barrier or âfire breakâ to impede ca<sup>2+</sup> wave propagation.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers also make the following major points:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. A brief explanation of how CRU fragmentation would be reflected by changes to the reported dSTORM parameters (RyR cluster size, CRU size, and cluster density) at the start of the Results section would help to orient the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Your point is well taken, as these changes may be confusing to readers not familiar with previous work describing CRU dispersion. We have now included a brief explanation of how this phenomenon is expected to influence the number of RyRs per cluster and CRU, and the overall cluster and RyR densities, as well as an additional schematic (Figure 1 âfigure supplement 1) to illustrate hallmarks of RyR cluster dispersion. The following text has been added to the beginning of the Results section on page 2, line 129:</p><p>âUsing 3D dSTORM imaging, we investigated the effects of long-term phosphorylation on RyR organization in cardiomyocytes. We specifically hypothesized that phosphorylation would fragment or âdisperseâ RyR clusters in a time-dependent manner. Numerically, such breaking apart of RyR groupings is expected to be reflected by a reduction in the average number of RyRs contained in each cluster, as illustrated in Figure 1 âfigure supplement 1. This change would be accompanied by a concomitant increase in the total number of clusters as there now more numerous, smaller clusters in a given 3D space. If marked RyR cluster dispersion occurs, the total number of RyRs contained in a CRU may also be reduced, as clusters are no longer located in close enough proximity to be grouped in functional release units (edge-to-edge distances â¤ 100 nm; Figure 1 âfigure supplement 1). Notably, if RyR dispersion occurs without the addition or loss of channels, then the total number of RyRs detected by dSTORM imaging should remain unchanged.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Reconstructions of representative CRUs are presented in Figure 1, 2, and 3, with selected CRUs inset as compelling visual illustrations of CRU fragmentation or reformation. It would be beneficial to allow the reader to decide for themselves if they are truly representative by stating their dSTORM parameter values in the figure or legend. This is especially true where single representative CRUs are presented as in Figure 2a-c and Figure 3a and b.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added parameter values below each of the representative CRUs in Figures 1, 2 and 3. We hope that this gives the reader a feeling for how the example images compare with mean observed changes in RyR configuration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. On line 192 the authors state 'We found that the RyR arrangement in the phosphomimetic S2814D 193 mutant cells at baseline resembled the fragmented RyR organization observed in wild type (WT) 194 animals after isoproterenol treatment (Figure 2g, h). Indeed, cluster size (Figure 2j), CRU size (Figure 2k), and 195 cluster density (Figure 2l) were all similar in WT + ISO and S2814D cardiomyocytes, and significantly 196 different from untreated WT cells. Furthermore, application of isoproterenol to S2814D cardiomyocytes 197 did not lead to significant additional RyR dispersion, and only tendencies toward smaller cluster and 198 CRU sizes (Figure 2h, j-l).'</p><p>The representative CRU reconstructions in Figure 2g and h seem to contradict the quantified dSTORM parameters in Figure 2h, j-l and the description of the results in the text (starting at Line 192). This indicates a possible error in the production of the figure or that the choice of representative CRUs could be improved. In the images, the S214D CRUs appear more similar to wt (aside from the CRU selected for the insert) rather than wt + ISO as expected from the plotted data. There also appears to be significantly greater disruption visible in the S2814D + ISO than S2814D as a result, again counter to the observation made in the text about the plotted data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that our previous choice of representative image for Figure 2h did not accurately reflect the mean characteristics of RyR configurations in the 2814D cells. We have now selected a more suitable example. The appropriateness of each representative example is now documented by the presentation of the RyR cluster and CRU measurements below each image (see previous comment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There is a minor discrepancy between the naming of CaMKII mutants in Figure 2. panels (2814D and 2814A) and the text (S2814D and S2814A).</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the figure legend to read S2814D and S2814A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. A more precise description of the source of the S2814D and S2814A cardiomyocytes is needed for the reader to fully understand the strength of these control experiments. The authors currently state in the text and Materials and methods section that they are isolated from transgenic RyR2-S214D and RyR2-S214A mice provided by the Wehrens lab. The paper reference provided is only partially helpful as it describes the generation of homozygous knock-in mice RyR2-S214A but makes no mention of RyR2-S214D. I would assume that both are isolated from homozygous knock-in mice but please confirm if this is indeed the case and state it explicitly in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the reference for the generation of S2814D mice, and clarified that we employed homozygous S2814A and S2814D animals and their wildtype littermates in our study. The following text has been added to the Methods section on page 10, line 521:</p><p>âWe examined effects of the CaMKII phosphorylation site S2814 on RyR configuration by employing knock-in transgenic mouse models, where the site was rendered constitutively active (RyR2-S2814D<sup>45</sup>) or genetically ablated (RyR2-S2814A<sup>46</sup>). Cells isolated from homozygous mutant mice were used for this study, with comparison made to their respective wild-type littermates which served as controls.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 2, 3, 4, and 6 legends refer to various bar charts of quantified dSTORM parameters and ca<sup>2+</sup> spark and wave properties as 'Mean data' and it is not clear what this means. It might be less confusing simply to use the term 'Experimental data' instead.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this was confusing, and have amended the text to clarify this point throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Connected to the previous point, the bar charts in Figure 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are nicely presented so that the mean, SEM, and variation in the datapoints of a given variable are clear. However, it is not always obvious whether each datapoint represents individual measurements or a cell average and this information should be stated clearly in either the legends or methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified this point on page 15, line 792, of the Statistics Analyses section in the Methods:</p><p>âAll results presented are expressed as mean Â± standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise stated. For RyR localisation and ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, the presented bar charts include data points which are averaged measurements from each individual cardiomyocyte.

However, in this protocol, the cells are fixed after a 2 hr total exposure to ISO and it is unknown what this duration of ISO treatment does to RyR2 clustering and distribution. To increase confidence in these findings, an important control must be added. RyR2 clusters should be examined after 2 hrs ISO treatment (without any inhibitors on board). Likewise, a similar protocol is employed to test the effects of PKA on cluster dispersal, with the authors reporting that H89 reversed the dispersal. Again, this finding would be strengthened by knowing what 2 hrs of ISO does to RyR2 clustering and distribution. The same 2 hr total ISO stimulation protocol is used when the authors assess whether H89 or AIP can reverse the slowing in spark kinetics. To strengthen confidence in this finding, spark kinetics should also be examined after 2hrs of ISO treatment. The results may be quite different from those seen after a 1 hr treatment especially given the finding that RyR phosphorylation at ser-2814 and ser-2808 both exhibited bell-shaped responses during the 1 h ISO stimulation. If one extends that treatment to 2 hrs, phosphorylation of S2814 and S2808 may continue to fall and this complicates the findings with the inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>As we have noted above, your point is well taken that the total treatment time for ISO + AIP (Figure 2) or ISO + H89 (Figure 3) is 2 hours. Thus, we have now included a 2 h ISO control, and observed no further RyR cluster dispersion beyond levels present in the 1 h ISO group. These data have been presented in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2a, b rather than the main figures which were becoming quite cumbersome. The following edit has been made to the text on page 3, line 179:</p><p>âIn control experiments, the longer 2 h treatment period with isoproterenol alone did not alter RyR configuration beyond values observed at the 1 h time point (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2a, b)â</p><p>Similarly, we have included 2 hr ISO control experiments for ca<sup>2+</sup> spark characteristics, and again observed no further effects beyond changes observed at 1 h (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2c, d). Text has been added on page 4, line 253 stating:</p><p>âIn control experiments, a 2 h treatment period with isoproterenol alone (matching the total treatment time in AIP and H89 experiments) did not alter ca<sup>2+</sup> spark properties beyond values observed at the 1 h time point (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2c, d).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) At each ISO-treated time point, the study would benefit from the inclusion of an accompanying no-ISO control. Does the RyR dispersal occur because the cells are deteriorating with more time post-isolation, or is it specifically and exclusively because of the acute ISO-induced stress? These controls would help address that question and strengthen the conclusions of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>For the control group, cells were kept for 60 min following isolation prior to fixation for imaging. This 60 min time point then matched the duration of the longest ISO exposure, ensuring that there was not time-dependent run down of cardiomyocyte quality that contributed to observed changes in RyR configuration. This has now been mentioned in the Results section on page2, line 142.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is no indication of statistical significance on any of the summary data plots or mention of P values. This should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Significant differences are now indicated in each plot by the use of comparison bars. Significance was assigned for P &lt; 0.05, as noted in each figure legend, and the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The modeling results need to be put into context and compared with what is going on in the experimental data. This section is somewhat confusing and is a bit of a jarring shift away from the experimental section. It should be better integrated. The authors state &quot;the modeling results indicate that RyR ca<sup>2+</sup> leak shifts from spark-mediated to silent leak when CRUs are dispersed, reducing the fidelity of spark generation&quot; but in figure 4h, spark-mediated (non-silent) leak is strikingly increased after 60 mins of ISO treatment which leads to the most profound dispersal. Please clarify how these results align. Perhaps there is more of both spark-mediated leak and non-spark leak? What experimental data supports non-spark mediated leak? The idea that there could be localized regions of SR ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion that act as &quot;fire-breaks&quot; to prevent the generation of ca<sup>2+</sup> waves even though there are more ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks is logical and provides a satisfying theory that unifies some of the seemingly paradoxical findings but this is only raised in the second to last paragraph of the discussion. Raising this idea earlier may help the reader connect the dots more easily.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important critique. We agree that in the original version of the article, it was difficult to understand the link between experimental and modeling data. We have added a paragraph to address this on page 3, line 282:</p><p>âTo link observed RyR cluster morphologies with measured spark properties we constructed spark models employing experimentally-observed CRU morphologies. We then ran the computational spark model with these geometries to examine the resulting sparks. We also examined the likelihood of âundetectableâ local release events whose amplitude is too small to be detected in confocal images. While difficult to measure experimentally, this non-spark mediated leak can importantly affect local SR load.â</p><p>In addition, we have reorganized this section considerably, changing the order of data presentation, and have repeatedly referred back to previous experimental findings to explain how they are paralleled by modeling results. The Reviewer correctly points out that data concerning spark-mediated and silent leak were not clearly presented. In the revised text, we have clarified that during Î²-AR, the modeling predicts that both types of leak are increased, which would promote reduction in SR content, and inhibition of ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. We do not have experimental measurements of silent leak, so this insight from modeling is quite important. As suggested, we have now included mention of the âfire breaksâ concept in the Results section where these data are first presented on page 6, line 340:</p><p>âTaken together, the modeling results critically link changes in CRU configuration and spark morphology; phenomena that were observed separately in experiments. However, the modeling data also support the contention from experimental data that RyR cluster fragmentation can reduce arrhythmogenic spontaneous ca<sup>2+</sup> release (ca<sup>2+</sup> waves). Here, the antiarrhythmic actions of RyR dispersion appear to be linked to a reduction in SR content resulting from an increase in both spark-mediated and silent leak. We postulate that local regions of the cell with dispersed CRUs and lowered SR content may act as a physical barrier or âfire breakâ to impede ca<sup>2+</sup> wave propagation.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
