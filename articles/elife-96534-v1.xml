Previously we identified that anterior insular cortex (AIC) projections to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) are uniquely sensitive to alcohol-induced neuroadaptations in male, but not female mice, and play a role in governing binge alcohol consumption in male mice (Haggerty et al., 2022). Here, by using high-resolution behavior data paired with in-vivo fiber photometry, we show how similar levels of alcohol intake are achieved via different behavioral strategies across sexes, and how inter-drinking session thirst states predict future alcohol intakes in females, but not males. Furthermore, we show how presynaptic calcium activity recorded from AIC synaptic inputs in the DLS across 3 weeks of water consumption followed by 3 weeks of binge alcohol consumption changes across, fluid, time, sex, and brain circuit lateralization. By time-locking presynaptic calcium activity from AIC inputs to the DLS to peri-initiation of drinking events we also show that AIC inputs into the left DLS robustly encode binge alcohol intake behaviors relative to water consumption. These findings suggest a fluid-, sex-, and lateralization-dependent role for the engagement of AIC inputs into the DLS that encode binge alcohol consumption behaviors and further contextualize alcohol-induced neuroadaptations at AIC inputs to the DLS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>insula</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>Alcohol</kwd><kwd>Binge</kwd><kwd>Photometry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F31AA029297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haggerty</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01AA027214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Atwood</surname><given-names>Brady K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Engagement of anterior insular cortex projections to the dorsolateral striatum underpins sex-differences in binge alcohol consumption behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Binge alcohol consumption, defined as consuming 4–5 or more drinks in about 2 hr for females and males, respectively, represents a large proportion of the deaths associated with problematic alcohol use and is one of the strongest risk factors for developing alcohol use disorder (AUD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mokdad et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Addolorato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanny et al., 2018</xref>). Binge drinking is particularly prevalent among young adults, especially among females who have been increasing their alcohol use rates year after year for the past half-decade that now are similar to or outpacing male use rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keyes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">White, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Modeling binge drinking in rodent animal models is largely accomplished through the behavioral paradigm, Drinking in the Dark (DID), in which mice have ad libitum access to alcohol (20% v/v) in their home cage for 2 hr sessions, 3 hr into their dark-light cycle for 3–4 days a week, and for one 4 hr ‘binge’ session for a single day, followed by 2 or 3 days of abstinence from alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rhodes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thiele and Navarro, 2014</xref>). This procedure has great construct and predictive validity for human binge drinking. Mice display similar drinking patterns to humans like front-loading behavior wherein they consume larger amounts of alcohol early in the task compared to later in the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ardinger et al., 2022</xref>). DID also successfully induces pharmacologically relevant levels of blood alcohol content (BAC) in mice that is equivalent to the legal intoxication limit in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barkley-Levenson and Crabbe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huynh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It is also commonly observed that female mice tend to drink more than males across a wide range of alcohol consumption models, including DID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blednov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hwa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Satta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sneddon et al., 2019</xref>). Possible reasons are that females tend to drink more than males is due to an increased sensitivity to the rewarding and decreased sensitivity to the aversive properties of alcohol, different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of alcohol, and differences in sex hormone expression levels, such as estrogen which fluctuates across the menstrual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czerniak, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Overstreet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schramm-Sapyta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sneddon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vandegrift et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elvig et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, there are also reported instances in which male and female mice consume identical amounts of alcohol in these drinking models, such as for mice genetically selected to consume high binge levels of alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Savarese et al., 2021</xref>). And, while it is known that estrogen plays a role in increasing alcohol intake in some models, there is evidence to suggest there is no effect of the estrous cycle on alcohol intake specifically during DID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Satta et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, when female sex-dependent differences in alcohol intake are present during DID, they are often solely reported in comparison to males and/or other experimental controls (e.g. ovariectomized mice). In some cases, these measures of quantitative intake are also reported in combination with how BACs differ by sex, but ultimately these two metrics are often the only two reported measures of how animals consume alcohol differently by sex. Thus, there remains very little knowledge on the behavioral strategies used to achieve alcohol intake across the sexes.</p><p>Additionally, the neural circuitry that underlies binge drinking remains poorly understood, and descriptions of sex differences for neural circuits currently implicated in binge alcohol consumption remain even more elusive. Of the neural circuits implicated in binge drinking, only a few of these studies to date have included sex as a factor in their analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rinker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferguson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Siciliano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burnham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dornellas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Levine et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haggerty et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Previous work from our laboratory that investigates such circuitry shows that alcohol uniquely alters AIC inputs into the DLS via synaptic alterations in mu opioid and ionotropic glutamate receptors in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haggerty et al., 2022</xref>). Female mice displayed no alcohol-induced changes in ionotropic glutamate receptor function. Optogenetically activating these AIC inputs to DLS inputs during DID also reduces how much alcohol male mice binge consume.</p><p>To further detail the sex differences displayed between male and female mice in DID and build on our understanding of how AIC inputs into the DLS are altered by binge alcohol exposure across time, fluid, and sex, we measured detailed drinking behaviors and presynaptic calcium activity at AIC inputs into the DLS for 3 weeks of water drinking followed by 3 weeks of binge alcohol drinking. Here, we show that males and females consume water similarly, both in amount and behavioral strategy. Next, we described how the drinking mechanics and patterns differ between females and males who binge similar levels of alcohol, such that female mice consume alcohol more efficiently. Also, by measuring inter-DID session water intakes, we show how female, but not male, thirst states predict future alcohol intake. Finally, using intersectional genetic manipulations, we expressed a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP), bilaterally and exclusively in AIC inputs to the DLS to measure how presynaptic AIC input activity changes across time, sex, fluid, and brain circuit lateralization. By recording GCaMP activity from AIC inputs bilaterally in the DLS, we show that the AIC inputs into the left DLS strongly encode binge alcohol drinking in males. Furthermore, an increasing history of alcohol binge drinking alters calcium dynamics in male left AIC inputs into the DLS, suggesting decreased left AIC input engagement as a function of increased drinking history. Together, we establish detailed sex-differences in the behavioral strategies females use to binge consume similar amounts of alcohol compared to males. We describe how AIC inputs to the left DLS encode binge alcohol drinking and how the engagement of these inputs changes over the course of binge drinking history across sex, time, and circuit lateralization. Together these findings represent targets for future therapeutic modalities such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and focused ultrasound (FUS) that seek to leverage the unique alcohol-induced changes to AIC inputs into the DLS to create more targeted, efficacious treatment approaches for those experiencing AUD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sex-dependent differences in water and alcohol drinking in the dark</title><p>We isolated AIC→DLS circuitry by injecting an anterograde adeno-associated virus (AAV) into the AIC encoding a cre-dependent GCaMP and a retrograde AAV to express cre, a recombinase enzyme, in the DLS and implanted bilateral optic cannulas in the DLS to visualize and record calcium activity in synaptic inputs that arise from AIC projections to the DLS in both male and female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

For DID sessions in the first 3 weeks, animals achieved stable levels of water intake across 15 water DID sessions, and there were no sex differences between male and female water drinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>). By averaging water intakes by week, a clearer understanding of weekly water intakes can be computed with no noted water intake differences across the week or by sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–f</xref>). During drinking weeks 4–6, when animals were transitioned from water to alcohol intake, mice reliably consumed binge-like levels of alcohol during the 4 hr sessions, which correlated with pharmacologically relevant levels of intake as based on previous experiments in our laboratory using identical drinking measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haggerty et al., 2022</xref>). We failed to find differences in alcohol intake between males and females across all DID sessions in this paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). Nonetheless, when analyzing alcohol consumption by week, for both sexes, there was a greater amount of alcohol drank during week 4 in comparison to week 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). This could be due to the transition from water to alcohol, in which the total fluid volume consumed during water sessions is larger than alcohol sessions and may be supported by the decreasing levels of alcohol intake seen in early alcohol DID sessions 16–19 as animals adapt to consuming a new fluid type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). By week, both male and female animals experienced this decrease in alcohol intake in weeks 5 and 6 as compared to week 4 of DID, but there were no sex differences or interactions between sex and drinking week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). Ultimately, both sexes consume binge-like levels of alcohol, and in relation to the measured calcium activity at AIC inputs into the DLS presented below, one can be confident that differences in these signals are not a function of the total alcohol intake by sex.</p><p>The amount of water intake between DID sessions was also measured daily using the home cage water bottle. Interestingly, females consumed more water between both water and alcohol DID sessions across all 6 weeks compared to males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>). Previous inter-session DID water intakes were also correlated to the next DID session intake to see if the amount of water consumed before any water DID session had any influence on the amount of water consumed during the upcoming DID session. We found a modest, yet statistically significant negative correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>). This suggests that increased water intake, a proxy measurement for a quenched thirst state, being achieved before a water DID session can predict lower levels of water consumed during the DID session itself. We found no sex differences in this correlation between males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m</xref>). Similarly, we questioned if inter-session water intakes influenced future alcohol DID intakes, which we did not find to be true when looking at the data blind to sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1n</xref>). Yet, the patterning between males and females for thirst states looks strikingly different. While we did not find a statistically significant difference using sex as a covariate in a co-variate analysis of variance (ANCOVA) to determine if the slopes of the regression fit were statistically different, if one a priori separates sex and then runs a regression, the correlation for male intersession water intakes predicting alcohol DID intakes is not significant (p=0.0916), whereas increasing female intersession water intake is negatively and significantly correlated (p=0.0007, <italic>r</italic>=–0.4133) with lower alcohol DID intakes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1o</xref>). Together, this may suggest that the elevated inter-session DID water intakes correlate with decreased levels of alcohol intake during DID sessions for females and may offer another explanation for why females and males binge drank similar levels of alcohol in this behavioral paradigm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sex-dependent differences in water and alcohol drinking mechanics</title><p>We also aimed to understand how well animals’ intakes correlated with both water and alcohol-drinking microstructure measurements made directly from the lickometer in a sex-dependent manner. First, we plotted drinking events, drinking event duration, and number of drinks (i.e. cumulative drinking events that occurred in a 3- s window) and correlated them to water intake across all DID water sessions.</p><p>For water events, event duration, and number of drinks, were all significantly correlated with intake and there were no differences in how male and female mice consumed water out of the lickometers across all DID water sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). Similarly, alcohol events, event duration, and number of drinks were all highly correlated to alcohol intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d–f</xref>). For drinking events, there were no sex differences, yet for the alcohol event duration and number of alcohol drinks, female mice showed an increased correlation with alcohol intake at lower event numbers and drinks compared to males, suggesting they might be more efficient drinkers, such that efficiency measures the ability to consume more alcohol in a single drinking interaction compared to males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Additionally, female mice may also be more exact in titrating their alcohol intakes to achieve the desired dose of alcohol compared to males, which could also be viewed as more efficient behavior.</p><p>We also wanted to see how these microstructure analyses were altered across time between sex. For water intake, across DID weeks 1–3, there were no sex differences in the number of events, event durations, water events, the latency to drink water, the mean inter-drink interval between water events, nor differences in front loading behavior for water intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–f</xref>). For alcohol intake, across DID weeks 4–6 there were no sex differences for the number of alcohol events, but females did have a decreased time for alcohol event durations and number of alcohol drinks compared to males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g–i</xref>). These findings across time further support that females may be more efficient in consuming alcohol, such that it requires less time and drinks to reach similar levels of alcohol intake that males achieve. Females and males displayed the same latency to drink alcohol across time, but as DID weeks progressed, females displayed an increased inter-drink interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j–k</xref>). Finally, both males and females displayed similar levels of front-loading behavior for alcohol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>).

Altogether, it showed that drinking behaviors are largely encoded by male AIC inputs into the left DLS, with alcohol displaying the largest change in magnitude for ΔF/F both across time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We also show robust differences in AIC signals that are sex, fluid, and lateralization-dependent across time during the drink window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). When analyzing the peak amplitude of the calcium signals, we also find that alcohol-left male AIC inputs show the largest magnitude, and water-left AIC inputs the second largest when time locked to drinking events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Since AIC inputs into the DLS display strong lateralized effects, we split the data by left and right AIC inputs into the DLS to zoom in on the sex and fluid comparisons occurring at each input. By looking at all AIC inputs into the left DLS by sex and fluid, calcium activity is increased for alcohol compared to water across time for both sexes, but especially in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). More detailed analyses of the dynamics of the calcium signals also displayed both sex and fluid differences for the peak amplitude of the calcium signal where males show increased peak amplitudes for both water and alcohol compared to females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We also measured the time to the maximum calcium signal, and time to peak, during the drinking event to determine if alcohol or sex displayed a time-dependent shift in the on-kinetics of the calcium signal. Interestingly, a sex-by-fluid interaction shows that for males, binge alcohol consumption, compared to water, increases the amount of time that it takes for the peak calcium signal to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Whereas in females, binge alcohol consumption, compared to water, decreases the time to peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Finally, we measured the area under the curve using ΔF/F values from the time when the peak ΔF/F value occurred to the time when the end of the drink occurred to assess the decay kinetics of the calcium signal. For left AIC inputs, the AUC measurements also showed both sex and fluid differences, such that the AUC for both water and alcohol measures were increased compared to females, suggesting that the calcium signals were larger and remained elevated for longer after the peak occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Sex-dependent calcium dynamics of anterior insular cortex (AIC) inputs into the left and right dorsolateral striatum (DLS) during water and drinking bouts.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) AIC inputs to the DLS are most strongly engaged by alcohol at AIC inputs into the left DLS (ANOVA, Sex × Fluid × Time × Input Side <italic>F</italic><sub>(149, 200.7)</sub>=1.383, p=0.001383, np<sup>2</sup>=0.000786, Power (1 - β)=1.0; *=Time from Drink Start × AIC Input Side, –0.0369128 (s) – 5 (s),<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; ^=Time from Drink Start × Sex-Fluid, –1.308725 (s) – 4.95733 (s),<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and (<bold>b</bold>) peak amplitudes ΔF/F changes are strongly associated with changes in AIC inputs to the left DLS than with the right DLS (ANOVA, Sex x Fluid x Input Side <italic>F</italic><sub>(3,122.6)</sub>=31.15, p=1.298e-19, np<sup>2</sup>=0.05083, Power (1 - β)=1.0).

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). In more detail, an interaction between sex and fluid for peak amplitude shows that males decrease their peak amplitude calcium signals as they transition to binge alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). For time to peak, like left AIC inputs, females see a decrease in time to peak as they switch from water to binge alcohol drinking, yet there is no change in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). Finally, there was only a sex-dependent decrease in males compared to females for AUC, regardless of fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>). In summary, two main findings are apparent, such that (1) for left AIC inputs, regardless of sex, alcohol increases calcium activity compared to water during drinking events and for right AIC inputs, alcohol decreases calcium activity compared to water drinking events, and (2) that male calcium dynamics at both left and right AIC inputs are more strongly altered by alcohol exposure than female calcium dynamics. Together, we also observed a net shift towards increased engagement of AIC inputs into the left DLS during the transition from water to binge alcohol drinking in males, but not females, which is achieved via both increasing AIC engagement to the left DLS and decreasing AIC engagement to the right DLS during drinking events.</p><p>Since we uncovered fluid effects for both left and right AIC inputs across the time from drink start, we wanted to further examine the sex effects observed and to understand how AIC inputs evolved across the drinking task within each fluid. To do this, we filtered the dataset presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to include only water-drinking events and then analyzed for sex differences. Looking at all water events, we failed to detect a sex difference for both left and right AIC inputs into the DLS across the time from drink start (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,e</xref>). For left AIC inputs during water drinking, we did see an increase in peak amplitude, no change in time to peak amplitude, and an increase in AUC for males compared to females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>). For right AIC inputs, similarly, an increase in peak amplitude was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Females also displayed an increased time to peak, but there was no sex effect for AUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1g–h</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, observing how the development of water drinking, across weeks, altered calcium dynamics we found that for water drinking in males, there were no differences by DID week in either the left or right AIC inputs across time from drink starts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,e</xref>). For left inputs in water-drinking males, we observed an increase in the peak amplitude in week 3 compared to weeks 1 and 2, but no change in time to peak or AUC measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–d</xref>). For the right inputs in water-drinking males, we saw the opposite for peak amplitudes, a decrease in week 3 compared to week 1, no change in time to peak, and a decrease in the AUC in week 3 compared to week 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f–h</xref>). For females, there were no differences by DID week in either the left or right AIC inputs across time from drink starts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j,m</xref>). We see similar changes, such that left AIC inputs for water-drinking females also increase peak amplitude, with no change in time to peak by week, like left AIC inputs in water-drinking males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j–k</xref>). Although, increases in AUC are seen in week 3 compared to week 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>). For right AIC inputs, we see an increase in peak amplitude in week 3 compared to week 1, with a decrease in time to peak, and no changes in AUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4n–p</xref>). Together, we see no effect across water drinking weeks when looking at the calcium signal in the entire water drinking window, and only small alterations in calcium signal when looking at specific parts (peak amplitude, time to peak, and AUC) of the calcium dynamics across sex. Generally, as the animals experience more water DID sessions, AIC inputs become more engaged during water drinking events as measured by increases in peak amplitude, with corresponding increases in AUC in some cases.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Calcium dynamics of anterior insular cortex (AIC) inputs into the left and right dorsolateral striatum (DLS) across water drinking weeks.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) For males, left AIC inputs to the DLS do not display a by week-dependent change in ΔF/F (rmANOVA, DID Week × Time from Drink <italic>F</italic><sub>(298,298)</sub> = 0.6953, p=0.5575), but (<bold>b</bold>) peak amplitudes increased in the final week of water drinking compared to the first two (ANOVA, DID Week <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,163.8)</sub>=7.235, p=0.000975, np<sup>2</sup>=0.05062, Power (1 - β)=0.9999; Week 3 – Week 1, p=0.02478; Week 3 – Week 2, p=0.000557).

The pattern of calcium activity in male, left AIC inputs into the DLS during binge alcohol drinking is striking, such that it may be the case that increasing acute intoxication decreases the calcium signal seen at these inputs within single DID sessions. However, we did not find statistical evidence of this in our dataset, but this may be because of how we un-biasedly chose to quartile the number of drinks observed and or increase alcohol tolerance as the number of binge sessions increases for any individual animals’ alcohol history. For the purpose and scope of this work, we thought it was important to quantify some basic drinking metrics within DID sessions to ensure our weekly and between-sex and fluid analyses of calcium dynamics were in large part not driven by acute, intra-session effects. Ultimately, we found this to be true, but future work must be done to look at the acute effects of alcohol on AIC inputs within single DID sessions to follow up on these observations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, here we show how male and female mice can binge consume both water and alcohol in similar amounts, but via different behavioral strategies. Based on these data, we show how female mice may be more efficient alcohol drinkers, more susceptible to inter-session water drinking that modulates future alcohol intake, and time-resolved differences in how their binge drinking behaviors evolve compared to male mice. These robust measurements and resultant sex differences of binge alcohol-associated behavioral strategies must continue to be explored, but we hope these data serve as proof of the diversity between sexes that exist in alcohol consumption models even when animals consume similar amounts of alcohol.</p><p>The calcium imaging at pre-synaptic AIC inputs to the DLS data presented broadly suggest: (1) there is a time-dependent activation of AIC inputs into the DLS that occurs across drinking weeks where calcium activity, depending on the sex and lateralization, becomes more or less engaged to alcohol drinking and (2) lateralization affects insula projections into the DLS, such that insula signals received in the right and left DLS are remarkably different.</p><p>First, we saw strong evidence that AIC inputs into the DLS become engaged around water drinking behaviors, but ultimately most strongly engaged at AIC inputs into the left DLS early in binge alcohol consumption in male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Interestingly, these robust calcium signals encoding binge consumption also decayed more rapidly as binge alcohol exposure history increased, suggesting that insular signals into the DLS can dynamically respond to alcohol across time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Together, these data suggest that while AIC inputs into the left DLS are most strongly engaged during alcohol drinking, that the change in their kinetics and thus what they might be encoding in a behavioral and/or interoceptive context may be altered across time due to increasing, repetitive alcohol consumption. And, while these generalized dynamic changes in calcium activity are interesting observations, we did not find strong statistical evidence for changes in calcium signals by week within both water and alcohol drinking across the entire drinking window alone. Thus, while we did find changes in isolated measures such as peak amplitude, time to peak, and AUC by drinking week within water and alcohol drinking, future studies employing faster and higher resolution imaging techniques at cellular resolution, in combination with behavioral paradigms that provide more power at smaller time scales will be needed to understand these changes in calcium dynamics fully. Furthermore, we only measured calcium activity during water and alcohol drinking at AIC inputs into the DLS, but additional work will be required to tease apart changes to glutamate, GABA, and other specific in-vivo presynaptic neurotransmitter release in this circuitry as alcohol-induced neuroadaptations form, but nonetheless these data represent intriguing initial findings.</p><p>Second, lateralization of insular activity is well documented in human and rat studies, yet few, if any, mouse studies show clear lateralization effects within the insular cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Centanni et al., 2021</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration, in a water or alcohol-drinking paradigm, to show lateralized effects of AIC inputs in the mouse. Also, in our previous work, we did not see lateralization effects when stimulating AIC inputs into the left DLS compared to the right DLS, but it is important to note that the time-resolution in which we were photo activating AIC inputs in the DLS was around 10 orders of magnitudes longer than the time-resolution of the measured calcium activity, suggesting we could have been occluding lateralization effects by stimulating for too long, at a non-biologically relevant frequency, and/or with too much light power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haggerty et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Together, these findings suggest there exist both sex-dependent, fluid-dependent, and brain lateralization effects for AIC inputs into the DLS in how they encode water and alcohol drinking activity. Here, we mainly focused on describing increases in calcium activity and its associated dynamics to demonstrate how male, left AIC inputs into the DLS are more robustly engaged during binge drinking behaviors. But, we also reported many instances where calcium signals were decreased, where shifts in time to peaks occurred, and where sustained decreases in calcium signals occurred for many seconds post-drinking initiation, especially on right AIC inputs in both males and females. It is known that these shifts, pauses, and decreases in firing can also have profound behavioral effects, and likely interact with the increases in calcium activity described to direct a concert of action selection behaviors relevant for both alcohol and water drinking behaviors. Again, work utilizing higher resolution in-vivo imaging and behavioral assays and analyses will be required to resolve these changes, but nonetheless, these observations provide initial evidence for a powerful, complex cortico-striatal circuit that has vast implications in addiction-related behaviors.</p><p>Furthermore, the findings presented here help contextualize our previous work on AIC input control over binge alcohol drinking behaviors such that alcohol exposure in males decreases robust calcium activity from AIC inputs that when restored with photoactivation of AIC inputs into the DLS leads to decreases in binge alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Yet, in females, the lack of perturbed calcium dynamics may correlate with the lack of alcohol-induced changes in synaptic plasticity that were observed in slice electrophysiology at AIC inputs to the DLS after 3 weeks of binge alcohol exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haggerty et al., 2022</xref>). In conclusion, leveraging these sex-dependent differences in AIC circuitry as binge drinking behaviors develop may represent novel biological levers to target in the quest for developing new pharmacotherapies and therapeutic modalities to treat those experiencing AUD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal care and experimental protocols for this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Indiana University School of Medicine and all guidelines for ethical protocols and care of experimental animals established by the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) were followed.

Fluorescence signals from the camera were captured with Bonsai (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bonsai-rx.org/docs">https://bonsai-rx.org/docs</ext-link>), which also integrated and captured lickometer data via an Arduino Uno.</p><p>The fiber photometry signal was processed using a custom Python pipeline (code available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/dlhagger/AIC_Fiber_Photometry">https://github.com/dlhagger/AIC_Fiber_Photometry</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haggerty, 2024</xref>).

Together these preprocessing steps control for photobleaching and motion artifacts in the GCaMP recording. The acquired 470 nm GCaMP data was then divided by the scaled 415 nm isosbestic control fit to compute a corrected observed fluorescence value, or ΔF/F. For each recording, and each brain region, the process was repeated, removing recordings with poor biexponential decay fits, excessive motion artifacts, and/or for recordings in which cabling disconnects or tangles occurred. In total, 820 recordings were acquired and 36 were excluded from the dataset for further analysis. Left and right AIC input ΔF/Fs were then z-scored by session for comparison of signals across fluids, sex, brain side lateralization, and time.</p><p>For peri-event analysis, the initiation of each drinking bout was defined by a 10- s sliding recording window including the 5 s before the bottle contact and 5 s post bottle contact. All z-scored ΔF/F values from both left and right sides were then aligned to the drink start in this window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histology</title><p>Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and trans-cardially perfused with 15 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 25 ml of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Animals were decapitated and the brain was extracted and placed in 4% PFA for 24 hr. Brains were then transferred to 30% sucrose solution until they sank after which they were sectioned on a vibratome at a section thickness of 50 μm. Brain sections were mounted in serial order on glass microscope slides and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize nuclei. Fluorescent images were captured on a BZ-X810 fluorescent microscope (Keyence, Itasca, IL) using 4x and 20x air objectives. Injection site, viral expression, and the location of optogenetic probe implantations were determined from matching images to the Reference Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. Animals that did not have a viral expression in the brain regions of interest and/or did not have fiber optic cannula probe placements within the brain region of interest as confirmed by histology were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Lickometers</title><p>All alcohol and water drinking experiments were performed using custom-built homecage fluid monitors (i.e. ‘lickometers’) that were constructed with the following modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Godynyuk et al., 2019</xref>). Liquid monitoring was constantly sampled as a function of the state (open vs. closed) of an infrared beam directly in front of the fluid bottle valve, and data was written to device memory every 3 s. This 3- s window ensured drinking activity data was reliably saved to the hardware. Therefore, any tube interaction within a 3- s window (defined as a drink) was recorded as the total number of beam breaks (defined as events) for the total duration that the beam was broken (defined as event duration) within that time window.</p><p>The lickometers can hold two bottles, although we only used one for each device during these experiments. We randomized the bottle side location across animals and found no effect on drinking, thus data are presented collapsed on the bottle side.</p><p>Lickometer data was cleaned by fitting a linear model comparing the number of events by the event duration within each bout for every DID session performed by each animal. Events that had a residual value of greater than or less than 3 from the model fit were removed. This cleaning procedure removed events that were due to slow leaks (a new tube was used if a leak was detected for the next DID session) or chews on the bottles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grecco et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haggerty et al., 2022</xref>). Once raw lickometer data were cleaned, no additional outliers were removed when computing events, event durations, drinks, and/or any other microstructure elements.</p><p>For in-vivo fiber photometry experiments that utilized lickometers for time-resolving drinking behaviors with calcium imaging data, the lickometer’s state changes triggered TTL outputs. 5 V TTL signals were read using digital I/O pins on an Arduino Uno board flashed with the firmata firmware. The Arduino Uno’s clock was synchronized to the fiber photometry acquisition software, so timestamps could be aligned to photometry data during data analysis with precise time resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Microstructure feature analyses</title><p>Using events, event duration, drinks, and the timestamps when these events occurred during the DID session, we calculated other drinking features such as latency to drink (time to first bream break after session initiation) and mean inter-drink interval time per session (the mean time between drinks within each DID session). We also calculated features for events in the first 30 min of each DID session as a measure of front-loading behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Modeling and statistics</title><p>Sample sizes for all experiments were determined based on our previously published experimental findings for electrophysiology and in-vivo behavioral assays such as DID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haggerty et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Data preprocessing and machine learning modeling utilized SciPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>), Statsmodels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Seabold and Perktold, 2010</xref>), Scikit-learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>), and TensorFlow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abadi et al., 2016</xref>). Statistical analyses were performed using pingouin (V0.5.4, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vallat, 2018</xref>). Data visualization used matplotlib <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hunter, 2007</xref> and seaborn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Waskom, 2021</xref>) libraries. For time series and repeated measures, we used two-, three, or four-way mixed or repeated measures ANOVAs where appropriate, which represented time (session or week) as the repeated, within-subject variable, and the factor (fluid type, viral expression, bottle side, sex, etc.) as the between-subjects factor. All mixed and repeated measures ANOVAs matched data by subject in the modeling to account for inter-animal variability. All mixed ANOVA data were tested to see if variances between factors were equal and normal using the Levene test. For one-way non-normal ANOVAs, we used Welch ANOVAs. If there was a main effect for factor, we used pairwise t-tests to determine post hoc significance and p-values were Sidak corrected. For correlations between two variables, we tested multivariate normality using the Henze-Zirkler test. If samples were normal, we used a Pearson’s correlation to report r and p-values. If samples failed normality testing, we used a Shepherd pi correlation that returned the Spearman correlation after removing bi-variate outliers. To test for group differences in correlations that were statistically significant, we used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) where the covariate factor was sex. For tests of two factors, we tested for sample normality across factors using the Shapiro-Wilk omnibus test. For normal samples, we used Welch two-tailed t-tests to correct for unequal sample sizes. For samples that failed normality testing, we used the Mann-Whitney U test. For significant statistical tests that generated F values, we reported partial eta squared and power values achieved. For tests that reported T values, we reported Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> and power values achieved. Post-hoc power analyses were performed using G*Power 3.1 to ensure reported significance values were not biased type II errors that could result from over all animal numbers (9 males and 5 females). All significance thresholds were placed at p&lt;0.05 and all data and model fits are shown as mean ± standard error (68% confidence interval) of the mean (SEM) and/or by scatter plot with means and error bars indicating the SEM.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

We do not reference changes in fluid volume or BACs to compare differences in measured lickometry or photometric signals, except in one instance where we suggest that the total volume of water (ml) is greater than the total amount of alcohol (ml) consumed in DID sessions, but this applies generally to all animals, regardless of sex, across all the experimental procedures.</p><p>In Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 1 we show drinking microstructures across single DID sessions, and that males and females drink similarly, <italic>but not identically</italic>, when assessing drinking measures at the smallest timescale that we have the power to detect with the hardware we used for these experiments. Admittedly, the variability seen in these measures is certainly non-zero, and while we are tempted to assume that there exist at least some singular drinks that occur identically between males and females in the dataset that support the idea that females are simply just consuming more volume of fluid per singular drink, we don’t have the sampling resolution to support that claim statistically. Further, even if females did consume more volume per singular drink that males, we do not believe that is enough information to make the claim that such behavior leads to more “intoxication” in females compared males, as we know that alcohol behaviors, metabolism, and uptake/clearance all differ significantly by sex and are contributing factors towards defining an intoxication state. We’ve amended the manuscript to remove any language of referencing these drinking behaviors as identical to clear up the language.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>No conclusions regarding the photometry results can be drawn based on the histology provided. Localization and quantification of viral expression are required at a minimum to verify the efficacy of the dual virus approach (the panel in Supplementary Figure 1 is very small and doesn't allow terminals to be seen, and there is no quantification). Whether these might differ by sex is also necessary before we can be confident about any sex differences in neural activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide hit maps of our fiber placements and viral injection centers, as we have, and many other investigators do regularly for publication based on histological verification. Figure 1A clearly shows the viral strategy taken to label AIC to DLS projections with GCaMP7s, and a representative image shows green GCaMP positive terminals below the fiber placement. Considering the experiments, animals without proper viral expression did not display or had very little GCaMP signal, which also serves as an additional expression-based control in addition to typical histology performed to confirm “hits”. These animals with poor expression or obvious misplacement of the fiber probes were removed as described in the methods. Further, we also report our calcium signals as z-scored differences in changes in observed fluorescence, thus we are comparing scaled averages of signals across sexes, and days, which helps minimize any differences between “low” or “high” viral transduction levels at the terminals, directly underneath the tips of the fibers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors have some previous data on the AIC to DLS pathway, there are many brain regions and pathways impacted by alcohol and so the focus on this one in particular was not strongly justified.

In addition, an exhaustive review of all the different brain regions and pathways that are affected by binge alcohol consumption to justify this pathway seems more appropriate to a review article than an article such as this.</p><p>We make no claims that photometric recordings are anything but observational, but we did observe these signals to be different when time-locked to the beginning of drinking behaviors.

However, individual lick tracking is not a requirement for tracking drinking behaviors more generally. The lickometers used clearly track when the animals are at the bottles, drinking fluids, and we have used the start of that lickometer signal to time-lock our photometry signals to drinking behaviors. We make no claims or have any data on how photometric signals may be altered on timescales of single licks.

So, when comparing consummatory patterns that are similar by sex, we still see the lack of calcium signaling near the drinking bouts, but small shifts in baseline activity that we aren’t truly powered to resolve (using an AUC or similar measurements for quantification) because the shifts are so small. Ultimately, we presume that the AIC to DLS inputs in females aren’t the primary node for encoding this behavior, and some recent work out of David Werner’s group (Towner et al. 2023) suggests that for males who drink, the AIC becomes a primary node of control, whereas in females, the PFC and ACC, are more engaged. Thus, the mapping of the circuit activity onto the drinking behaviors more generally represented in Figures 1 and 2 may be sexually dimorphic and further studies will be needed to resolve how females engage differential circuitry to encode ongoing binge drinking behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What does the change in water-drinking calcium imaging across time in males mean?
