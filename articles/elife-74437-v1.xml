motifs. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Cdk1 phosphorylates Cdc6-T7 to recruit Cks1, the Cdk1 phospho-adaptor in S phase, for subsequent multisite phosphorylation and protein degradation. Cdc6 accumulates in mitosis and is tightly bound by Clb2 through N-terminal phosphorylation in order to prevent premature origin licensing and degradation. It has been extensively studied how Cdc6 phosphorylation is regulated by the cyclin–Cdk1 complex. However, a detailed mechanism on how Cdc6 phosphorylation is reversed by phosphatases has not been elucidated. Here, we show that PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> dephosphorylates Cdc6 N-terminal sites to release Clb2. Cdc14 dephosphorylates the C-terminal phospho-degron, leading to Cdc6 stabilization in mitosis. In addition, Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1 releases Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 from Cdc6 to load Mcm2–7 on the chromatin upon mitotic exit. Thus, pre-RC assembly and origin licensing are promoted by phosphatases through the attenuation of distinct Cdk1-dependent Cdc6 inhibitory mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cdc6</kwd><kwd>PP2A</kwd><kwd>Cdc55</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>phosphatase</kwd><kwd>Cdc14</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>PSC-CUNY Enhanced Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>64657-00 52</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikui</surname><given-names>Amy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM127428</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remus</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM107239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remus</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remus</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>649124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loog</surname><given-names>Mart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Centre of Excellence for 'Molecular Cell Technologies'</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TK143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loog</surname><given-names>Mart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002301</institution-id><institution>Estonian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRG550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loog</surname><given-names>Mart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diffley</surname><given-names>John FX</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pre-RC component Cdc6 is primed for origin licensing by phosphatases and Cdk1 inhibitor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs) are assembled on DNA to license replication origins in M–G1 phase.

Clb2 interacts with Cdc6 through the Clb2 hydrophobic patch (<italic>hp</italic>), a substrate-binding pocket in cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Örd et al., 2019</xref>). The specific binding of Clb2 to Cdc6 is mediated through the <sup>47</sup>LQF<sup>49</sup> motif in Cdc6, which is facilitated by Cks1 docking at phosphorylated T7 in the Cdc6 N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Örd et al., 2019</xref>). The Cdc6–Clb2 binding is also enhanced by a <sup>126</sup>FQSLP<sup>130</sup> motif located in the midregion of Cdc6<sup>14</sup>. Thus, the Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 complex interacts with Cdc6 through multiple elements: Cks1 docking at phosphorylated T7, and Clb2 binding at the <sup>47</sup>LQF<sup>49</sup> and <sup>126</sup>FQSLP<sup>130</sup> motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Örd et al., 2019</xref>). The tight Cdc6–Clb2 interaction potentially shields Cdc6 phospho-degrons, leading to Cdc6 stabilization. These mechanisms could accumulate Cdc6 in mitosis without origin licensing.</p><p>Mitotic exit requires a complete suppression of Cdk1 activity to reset the cell cycle for G1 entry. It has been suggested that Cdc6 acts as a Cdk1 inhibitor together with Sic1 and a coactivator of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), Cdh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calzada et al., 2001</xref>). Sic1 and Cdc6 share similarities in Cdk1 inhibitory function, as both have been shown to associate to cyclin–Cdk1 complexes with low nanomolar affinity, which is partly facilitated by Cks1 docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Örd et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Venta et al., 2020</xref>). Deletion of the Cdc6 N-terminal Cdk1 site (<italic>cdc6Δ47)</italic> shows elevated Clb2–Cdk1 activity in mitosis, indicating that Cdc6 N-terminus plays a role in Clb2–Cdk1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calzada et al., 2001</xref>). A combination of <italic>Δsic1</italic> and <italic>cdc6Δ47</italic> leads to defects in mitotic exit, probably due to high Cdk1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calzada et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Δsic1 Δcdh1 cdc6Δ2–49</italic> triple mutants caused cytokinesis defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Archambault et al., 2003</xref>). Altogether, Cdc6, Sic1, and APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> cooperate to inhibit Clb2–Cdk1 activity for mitotic exit. This was further supported by an in vitro assay that shows the inhibition of Clb2–Cdc28 kinase activity by Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Örd et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Beside these Cdk1 inhibition mechanisms, Cdc6 phosphorylation needs to be removed by phosphatases during late mitosis. It is unknown which phosphatase is responsible for Cdc6 dephosphorylation. It has been reported that Cdc6 physically interacts with Cdc55, a regulatory subunit for protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boronat and Campbell, 2007</xref>). PP2A belongs to a family of serine/threonine phosphatases with a well-conserved role in mitosis from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janssens and Goris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mochida et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the PP2A heterotrimeric complex is composed of a scaffold A subunit (Tpd3), a regulatory B subunit (Cdc55, Rts1, or Rts3), and two largely interchangeable catalytic C subunits (Pph21 and Pph22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Healy et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van Zyl et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shu et al., 1997</xref>). Among these subunits, the regulatory B subunit primarily dictates cellular localization and PP2A substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rossio and Yoshida, 2011</xref>). PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> and PP2A<sup>Rts1</sup> have been implicated in mitotic progression. Cytoplasmic PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> dephosphorylates and inhibits Swe1, a Cdk1 inhibitor, to drive mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin and Arndt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yang et al., 2000</xref>). Nuclear PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> plays a role in the spindle assembly checkpoint and inhibits chromosome segregation by dephosphorylating Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Minshull et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang and Burke, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lianga et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rossio et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, various stresses inhibit the cell cycle via PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tang and Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khondker et al., 2020</xref>).

The stringent regulation of intracellular Cdc6 protein levels by proteolytic degradation in both G1 and S phase severely hampers the purification of endogenous Cdc6 from these cell cycle stages even after galactose-induced overexpression. However, we observed that extended overexpression of TAP<sup>TCP</sup>-tagged Cdc6 upon release from α-factor arrest induces a mitotic arrest phenotype in yeast cells, characterized by a 2C DNA content and the presence of a large elongated bud (data not shown). Intriguingly, Cdc6 isolated from whole-cell extracts of such mitotically arrested cells exists in a stable stoichiometric complex with three additional proteins that we identified as Clb2, Cdk1, and Cks1 by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The formation of this complex after Cdc6 overexpression is consistent with the previous observation of a Cdc6·Clb2·Cdk1 complex in G2/M cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mimura et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, using gel-filtration analysis, we find that Cdc6 is released from the Clb2–Cdk1 complex in the presence of the Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1, which itself forms a stable complex with Clb2–Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Clb2–Cdk1 binding to Cdc6 has been proposed to inhibit the origin licensing activity of Cdc6 as part of cellular re-replication control mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mimura et al., 2004</xref>). We tested the ability of Cdc6·Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 to promote Mcm2–7 loading onto DNA in conjunction with purified ORC and Cdt1·Mcm2–7, analogous to experiments described previously with purified Cdc6<sup>52</sup>. Using this approach, we find that Cdc6·Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 does not support the formation of salt-stable MCM complexes on DNA, indicating that Cdc6 in complex with Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 is inactive for Mcm2–7 loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, lanes 1 + 2). Importantly, normal Mcm2–7 loading was observed in reactions containing both purified Sic1 and Cdc6·Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, lanes 3 + 4), indicating that Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 sequesters Cdc6 and that this form of Cdc6 inhibition can be reversed by release of Cdc6 from the Cdc6·Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 complex by Sic1. However, we noted that Orc6 is efficiently phosphorylated in the presence of Cdc6·Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1, as indicated by the pronounced gel-mobility shift of Orc6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, compare lanes 1 + 3). This Orc6 phosphorylation is inhibited in the presence of Sic1, indicating that Clb2–Cdk1 retains partial kinase activity in the Cdc6·Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 complex. It is known that Cdk1 phosphorylation inhibits the Mcm2–7 loading function of ORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frigola et al., 2013</xref>). It was possible that the inhibition of Mcm2–7 loading in the presence of Cdc6·Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 was due to ORC phosphorylation and not Cdc6 sequestration. However, we noted that not only Mcm2–7 loading, but even Mcm2–7 recruitment to ORC/Cdc6, which can be monitored in the presence of ATPγS, is inhibited in the presence of Cdc6·Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, lanes 5 + 6), and this inhibition is again reversed in the presence of Sic1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, lanes 7 + 8). Since ORC phosphorylation specifically inhibits Mcm2–7 loading but not Mcm2–7 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frigola et al., 2013</xref>), these data demonstrate that the mechanism of licensing inhibition by Cdc6·Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 complex formation is distinct from that by Cdk1 phosphorylation of ORC. In summary, we conclude that Clb2–Cdk1 inhibits Cdc6 by physical sequestration and this inhibition is reversible by the Sic1-mediated release of Cdc6 from the Cdc6·Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Key functional residues/motifs of Cdc6 and Clb2 are located within regions of intrinsic disorder</title><p>The necessary structural elements in Cdc6 responsible for protein binding are not well understood.

We have previously shown that the Cdc6 C-terminal phospho-degron is targeted by Mck1, a yeast homolog of GSK3, for protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Zain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ikui et al., 2012</xref>). Despite high Clb2–Cdk1 activity and an exposed phospho-degron, Cdc6 can be partially stabilized in mitosis until Mck1 phosphorylates Cdc6-T368. It is of interest to study how Mck1 is activated during the cell cycle. Mck1 is involved in DNA damage signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Zain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2019</xref>), therefore the Cdc6 C-terminus, which is available throughout the cell cycle, plays a role in controlling the timing of licensing under stress conditions. We also showed evidence that Cdc6 is degraded in SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup>-independent manner; for example, Cdc6-6A mutant is unstable despite the mutations at phospho-degrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>APC <sup>Cdh1</sup> targets Clb2 for degradation via the KEN- and D-boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pfleger and Kirschner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schwab et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glotzer et al., 1991</xref>). Cdh1 is inhibited until it is dephosphorylated by Cdc14. The KEN- and D-boxes in Clb2 are located in IDRs, which may also enhance interaction with the APC to facilitate Clb2 degradation upon mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Radivojac et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sic1 regulation</title><p>We showed that Sic1 releases Clb2 from Cdc6 which supports origin licensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Sic1 contains multiple Cdk1 phosphorylation sites, which includes a phospho-threonine Cks1 docking site in the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kõivomägi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Venta et al., 2020</xref>). Cks1 docking triggers an N- to C-directed multisite phosphorylation cascade both in Sic1 and Cdc6, which results in the creation of phospho-degrons targeted by SCF<sup>Cdc4 14,18</sup>. Thus, Cdc6 and Sic1 share a functional similarity in their phosphorylation patterns. Since PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> dephosphorylates Cks1 docking site T7 in Cdc6, it is worth examining if PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> dephosphorylates Sic1 at the N-terminal Cks1 docking site. Sic1, Cdh1, and Cdc6 are Clb2–Cdk1 inhibitors as well as Cdc14 substrates and SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup> targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Örd et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calzada et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Visintin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Verma et al., 1997</xref>). Cdc14-dependent Swi5 dephosphorylation also activates Sic1 nuclear import and transcription at the end of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Visintin et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, Cdc14 release from the nucleolus targets at least four components to achieve a complete inhibition of Clb2–Cdk1 activity during mitotic exit, leading to origin licensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Short linear motifs and IDRs</title><p>Recent studies have expanded the role of cyclin-specific short linear motifs (SLiMs), which are short functional sequence motifs often found in IDRs.

Phosphatases also utilize SLiMs for substrate docking. In yeast, Cdc14 scaffolds to a PxL motif in substrates to mediate dephosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kataria et al., 2018</xref>). Currently, there is no identified docking motif for PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> in yeast.

PP2A<sup>B56</sup>-specific SLiMs are defined as LSPIxE in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Future research should focus on docking motifs for phosphatases and their regulatory subunits to understand phosphatase specificity in yeast.</p><p>Our data illustrate multiple IDRs in Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Notably, the N-terminal Cdc6 IDR includes SLiMs such as RxL and LxF motifs, which supports a model that depicts the Cdc6 N-terminus as a hub for multiple protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Cdc6 IDRs are readily available for protein binding in G1/S, during which Cdc6 disengages from ORC and is subjected to SCF-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drury et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Piatti et al., 1995</xref>). Cdc6 is then shifted toward an origin licensing preparation period where Cdc6 is stabilized but not licensed via Clb2 binding. This temporal mode is released when Cdc14 outcompetes with Clb2–Cdk1 activity at the end of mitosis.</p><p>In humans, cyclin A–CDK2 was shown to utilize SLiMs to promote interaction with Cdc6 and ORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hossain et al., 2021</xref>). Our studies on Cdc6 regulation shed light on the dynamics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation that drive DNA replication initiation upon mitotic exit. In this study, we showed first evidence to link PP2A with DNA replication.

Cdc6 is one of four proteins required to license eukaryotic origins of replication and is subject to tight regulation to ensure that this event is restricted to G1. More specifically, the CDK-dependent phosphorylation of two regions of Cdc6 (phospho-degrons) leads to the ubiquitin mediated degradation of Cdc6. Although the degradation of Cdc6 as cells go through the G1/S transition is straightforward to understand, the reaccumulation of Cdc6 at the M/G1 transition is less well understood. Here the authors demonstrate that at least three mechanisms coordinate to stabilize Cdc6 and prepare Cdc6 for helicase loading at the M/G1 transition: Clb2-Cdk1 binding, Cdc14 dephosohorylation, and Sic1 binding. The authors provide the strongest evidence for the first mechanism which they connect to the function of PP2A-Cdc55 phosphatase. The evidence for the role of Cdc14 and Sic1 is less extensive but nevertheless support the conclusions made. Finally, the authors propose a new structure of the Cdc6-Clb2 interaction based on bioinformatic analysis. This part of the paper is not well supported, lacking any experiments to test to proposed model. Overall, the manuscript will be an important contribution to our understanding of the M/G1 transition in yeast cells.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1. There is one particularly confusing aspect of the paper that the authors should resolve. Initially, the authors suggest that the N-terminal phospho-degron is shielded by Clb2-Cdk1 binding (Figure 2). However, if this were the case, then the Cdc6-T7 mutant should no longer be effected by either Clb2-Cdk1 binding or PP2A-Cdc55 function. Despite this expectation, the authors find that deletion of CDC55 results in increased Cdc6-T7 protein levels. Do the authors think that T7 can also act as a phospho-degron? Does this effect involve Clb2-Cdk1? It is important that these questions are addressed by the revised manuscript.</p><p>2. The evidence that the phosphospecific antibody recognizes the T7 site is strong but the test used does not show that it is specific for just that site (there are no other sites present). To show that it is specific for T7 the authors should show that the antibody does not recognize Cdc6 that is mutated at T7 and has all the other sites intact and modified. On a similar note, it is not clear that the very weak signal seen in the presence of Cdc55 is above background (Figure 3D, WT). A similar control showing that it goes away in the absence of the T7 phosphorylation site would make this more compelling.</p><p>3. The data that PP2A-Cdc55 and Cdc14 target different sites is very nice.</p><p>4. The data that Sic1 disrupts the Clb2-Ckd1-Cdc6 complex is clear. What is not shown is the involvement of Cks1 since Cks1 is not shown on any of the gels in D. Either the authors need to add experiments showing Cks1 (maybe a western blot) or limit their conclusions to the proteins that they see.</p><p>5. The last part of manuscript describing a potential structure of the Cdc6-Clb2 interaction is the weakest of the paper. Although the growing power of computational prediction is noteworthy, if the authors want to include this structure in the paper, it seems appropriate to perform a direct test of the proposed structure. For example, mutating regions predicted to mediate the interactions/Cdc6 degron protection and test their impact on the complex.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the paper by Philip et al., Cdc6 is sequentially regulated by PP2A-Cdc55, Cdc14 and Sic1 for origin licensing in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> the authors unravel distinct phosphatases (PP2A and CDC14) and show in detail how they regulate Cdc6 interaction with Clb2 (PP2A) and dephosphorylate a C-terminal degron (Cdc14) to stabilize Cdc14 in mitosis.
