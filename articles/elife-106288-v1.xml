unclear, particularly when a limited number of populations is considered and when there is a lag between the evolutionary event and its investigation. We showed that an unprecedented number of recurrently evolved mutations in an arthropod pest, the two-spotted spider mite <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic>, drive the rapid evolution of resistance to a recently commercialized acaricide, cyetpyrafen. We first observed high levels of resistance that appeared and became widespread within three years. Genome scans revealed genetic heterogeneity of resistance among populations and identified 15 target mutations, including six mutations on five amino acid residues of subunit <italic>sdhB</italic>, and nine mutations on three amino acid residues of subunit <italic>sdhD</italic> of the pesticide target succinate dehydrogenase, with as many as five substitutions on one residue. No mutations were present in 2,317 screened historical specimens, suggesting that mutations arose rapidly through de novo substitutions or from very rare segregating mutations. Identical mutations recurrently appeared in different genetic backgrounds, increasing the likelihood of resistance evolution. The high number of mutational options available for the evolution of target site resistance in this pest challenges resistance management practices.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Chemical pesticides have been widely used for over a century to manage crop pests and disease vectors. However, pests can rapidly evolve resistance to these chemicals, enabling them to survive exposures that would otherwise be lethal.</p><p>Since the first documented case of pesticide resistance in 1914, instances of insecticide resistance have grown rapidly, posing serious threats to agriculture, human health and the environment. Despite a lengthy history of resistance and related research, most studies have been carried out only after resistance became widespread. Consequently, our understanding of how resistance develops under field conditions remains limited.</p><p>Cao et al. studied the two-spotted spider mite, <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic>, to understand how pesticide resistance can emerge. <italic>T. urticae</italic> is considered the most resistant invertebrate pest worldwide due to its ability to develop resistance to a wide range of pesticides. The researchers investigated how resistance to the new pesticide cyetpyrafen emerges in field populations by comparing samples collected before and after cyetpyrafen use. To test the mites’ susceptibility to pesticides, they conducted bioassays on 46 mite population samples collected from various regions in China between 2020 and 2024 and compared the results to previously reported data of earlier collections between 2017 and 2018 during the early release stage of cyetpyrafen.</p><p>The experiments revealed that high levels of resistance to cyetpyrafen emerged and spread across geographically distant populations within just three years of its introduction. Genomic analysis identified 15 distinct mutations in the target protein of cyetpyrafen, which consisted of an unprecedented number of amino acid changes associated with resistance to a single pesticide in a single species. Mutations arising after the release of cyetpyrafen were absent in samples collected before cyetpyrafen use, suggesting they arose only following the pesticide's introduction. Identical mutations appeared independently in multiple populations, indicating that resistance can evolve repeatedly and rapidly. Even a single mutation was sufficient to lead to high levels of resistance.</p><p>Cao et al. provide a rare longitudinal view of resistance development in field populations of an invertebrate pest by demonstrating that resistance in <italic>T. urticae</italic> can arise through multiple genetic pathways rather than solely through the spread of a single rare mutation. These findings underscore the challenges of managing pesticide resistance and highlight the urgent need for alternative pest control strategies and more considered pesticide use.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>population genomics</kwd><kwd>pesticide resistance</kwd><kwd>recurrent evolution</kwd><kwd>selective sweep</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023YFD1401200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Shu-Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007934</institution-id><institution>Program of Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QNJJ202006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jin-Cui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007934</institution-id><institution>Program of Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JKZX202208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Shu-Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000980</institution-id><institution>Grains Research and Development Corporation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thia</surname><given-names>Joshua A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000981</institution-id><institution>Horticulture Innovation Australia Limited</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thia</surname><given-names>Joshua A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The rapid development of pesticide resistance in a mite across wide geographical areas is linked to the independent and repeated emergence of multiple mutations in target genes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of pesticide resistance represents rapid contemporary evolution of organisms in response to human-induced stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ffrench-Constant et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McKenzie and Batterham, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tabashnik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gould et al., 2018</xref>). Since the first instance of pesticide resistance in a scale insect was documented in 1914, cases have exponentially increased in arthropods, weeds, and pathogens, posing threats to agricultural production, human health, and the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sparks et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Melander, 1914</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gould et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fritz, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peterson et al., 2018</xref>). This has led to attempts to stop the evolution of resistance, or at least slow its appearance within populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gould et al., 2018</xref>). A key task in resistance management is to understand the evolution of resistance in field populations, where a given mutation may have originated once and spread via gene flow or evolved through multiple independent substitutions, and where resistance-associated mutations can pre-date (standing genetic variation) or arise subsequent to (de novo mutation) the introduction of pesticide selection pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ffrench-Constant, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daborn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kersten et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>A challenge in understanding the evolution of resistance is that the genetic basis of pesticide resistance observed in laboratory-generated resistant strains often does not reflect that in field populations, especially for arthropod pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Walsh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">ffrench-Constant, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Legan et al., 2024</xref>). Field populations are typically much larger and more genetically heterogeneous than laboratory populations. Because of the greater potential availability of rare mutations with large effect sizes in field populations, monogenic resistance to pesticides involving these rare mutations may occur relatively more frequently than in laboratory-generated strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McKenzie and Batterham, 1994</xref>), though small effect loci can also remain important in field resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schmidt et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lucas et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, artificial selection in the laboratory usually takes place in populations with much smaller effective population sizes, as well as a constant intensity and pattern of selection expected to favor the accumulation of multiple changes of small effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">ffrench-Constant, 2013</xref>). Where alleles with large effects are selected in the laboratory, these may not necessarily reflect the full set of resistant mutations in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Legan et al., 2024</xref>). Such mismatches between laboratory-selected and field-evolved resistance may lead to an inaccurate understanding of resistance evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">ffrench-Constant, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bras et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Legan et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>A further challenge in understanding resistance evolution in the field is that the genetic basis of resistance is often examined retrospectively well after the emergence of resistance in the field. Retrospective studies can fail to capture processes that have occurred in the intervening period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreev et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raymond et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">ffrench-Constant et al., 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adesanya et al., 2021</xref>), such as the introduction of new alleles through gene flow or de novo mutations, and fitness costs as well as changing selection regimes through pesticide rotations that can lead to resistance alleles being transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">ffrench-Constant, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kreiner et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kreiner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Groeters and Tabashnik, 2000</xref>). Preserved specimens before and following the introduction of pesticides can allow for resistance processes to be investigated retrospectively, but samples are often unavailable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hartley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Costa et al., 2011</xref>). Ongoing genetic monitoring of populations can help in overcoming some of these issues, particularly if population processes affecting a species are understood and if the genetic basis and new resistant alleles are identified as they evolve in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Van Leeuwen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pélissié et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pezzini et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we take advantage of the recent evolution of resistance in the two-spotted spider mite (TSSM), <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic> (Acari: Tetranychidae), to a novel acaricide, cyetpyrafen, to provide a detailed understanding of contemporary resistance evolution. TSSM is a global super pest that has evolved resistance to at least 11 groups of acaricides based on their modes of action and is the most resistant invertebrate pest worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Rouck et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Leeuwen et al., 2010</xref>). Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHi) acaricides (IRAC group 25) were first launched in 2007 for mite control. Four chemicals consisting of cyetpyrafen (first launched in 2017 in China), cyenopyrafen (2009 in Japan), cyflumetofen (2007 in Japan), and pyflubumide (2015 in Japan) fall within this group of acaricides globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hayashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakahira, 2011</xref>). Laboratory-selected resistance has already been identified to these new acaricides and is conferred by target-site mutations of the SDH coding <italic>sdhB</italic> and <italic>sdhD</italic> genes, with mutations identified at three positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Njiru et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sugimoto et al., 2020</xref>). In China, three acaricidal SDH inhibitors have been registered over the last decade: cyflumetofen (2013), cyetpyrafen (2017), and cyenopyrafen (2019). Since its release in 2017, cyetpyrafen has become the most popular pesticide for controlling spider mites, though low-level resistance was detected in the field only one year after its release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We have now tracked resistance through repeatedly monitoring field-evolved resistance of TSSM to cyetpyrafen at a time when resistance has developed rapidly to high levels across geographically distant populations. We investigated resistance using a combination of population genomics, laboratory selection, bioassays, and studies on historically preserved specimens before the introduction of cyetpyrafen. We find that multiple and recurrently evolved mutations drive the rapid development of high-level resistance to cyenopyrafen in field populations across a widespread geographical range. We also demonstrate that these mutations likely evolved de novo after the introduction of cyetpyrafen, though they may also have originated from extremely rare mutations segregating in populations before cyetpyrafen selection. We emphasize the benefits of integrating genomics with other approaches in longitudinal studies to capture the dynamics of rapid evolutionary changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Strong resistance evolves rapidly in field and lab-selected populations</title><p>To monitor the evolution and spread of cyetpyrafen resistance in the field, we conducted bioassays on 46 mite population samples collected from various regions in China between 2020 and 2024 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>).

Additionally, the proximity of the mutations was such that multiple recombination events would be required within the same 5–60 bp regions, which seems unlikely even with a high recombination rate of (say) 10 cM/Mb where two mutations might only be expected to occur once in 2.5x10<sup>8</sup> effective individuals across 60 bp; this assumes a population recombination rate <italic>ρ</italic>=2 <italic>c</italic><sub>N</sub><italic>er</italic>, where <italic>r</italic> refers to recombination rate per base-pair per generation, <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> refers to effective population size, and c refers to ploidy of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li and Stephens, 2003</xref>).

Due to the time taken for resistance to be recognized, evolutionary studies of pesticide resistance are often <italic>post hoc</italic>. Here, we conducted field monitoring of resistance to a novel acaricide, cyetpyrafen, following its 2017 release, with the opportunity to track resistance as it develops. We provided a longitudinal picture of resistance development in the field involving multiple and recurrently evolved large-effect mutations. Cross-resistance was found between cyetpyrafen and two other SDHi acaricides—cyflumetofen and cyenopyrafen—which were released in China before and after cyetpyrafen, respectively. Although we could not clearly identify the contributions of these acaricides to resistance evolution, they have only held a very small market share compared to cyetpyrafen, which is expected to be the main contributor to rapid resistance evolution.</p><p>Currently available pesticides mainly act by direct binding to receptors and enzymes, resulting in the inhibition of physiological functions associated with the nervous system, energy production system, growth and development, and midgut absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sparks et al., 2021</xref>). Mutations that alter the binding kinetics of pesticides on these proteins and thus potentially confer pesticide resistance have been widely identified in agricultural pests and disease vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Rouck et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acford-Palmer et al., 2023</xref>). Resistant mutations of some target genes are highly conserved both among populations and among species, perhaps due to the functional constraints of these targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">ffrench-Constant et al., 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hawkins et al., 2019</xref>). However, multiple mutations on single pesticide targets have also been identified in the same pest species and among different species. These cases often involve the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene, where at least 5 and 10 mutations have been cumulatively reported across studies on TSSM and the ectoparasite <italic>Dermanyssus gallinae,</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Rouck et al., 2023</xref>). Similarly, the evolution of resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides exhibits high repeatability across weed species, primarily driven by numerous SNPs within the ALS target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gaines et al., 2020</xref>). To date, 29 distinct target-site mutations have been identified on eight amino acid residues across 67 weed species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tranel et al., 2025</xref>). Notably, even within a single weed species, up to eight different mutations can occur on three amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tranel et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>Here, we found 15 mutations on eight amino acid residues in TSSM that all arose within a few years following the introduction of cyetpyrafen. Notably, five of the substitutions involve R119 of the <italic>sdhD</italic> gene. As far as we know, this is the highest number of both mutations and altered residues ever found in a single pesticide target arthropod pests, all emerging in a short period following initial detection of resistance. These mutations were located at the Q-site of SDH targeted by acaricidal inhibitors of SDH. Among these mutations, I260T was previously found in a cyflumetofen-resistant population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sugimoto et al., 2020</xref>), while I260V (with S56L in subunit C) was found in a pyflubumide and cyenopyrafen-resistant population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maeoka and Osakabe, 2021</xref>). R119L has previously been reported in cyflumetofen-resistant and -susceptible strains of TSSM but had not yet been validated as having a role in resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sugimoto et al., 2020</xref>). These results provide information on the nature of novel mutations in a pesticide target and the high level of resistance to cyetpyrafen that they can confer. It would be interesting to further validate the impacts of the mutations across chemicals to establish patterns of cross-resistance given that the same mutation may confer a different level of resistance to different chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maeoka and Osakabe, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our temporal collections of TSSM preceding cyetpyrafen release in the field indicated that the resistant mutations were not at an appreciable frequency prior to pesticide selection. Sequencing of 13 populations (involving a total of 2,317 TSSMs) from 2013 to 2018 did not recover any of the identified mutations. This points to a possible role of recurrent de novo mutation, although resistant alleles could have been present at very low frequencies before pesticide selection, which can be difficult to detect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hawkins et al., 2019</xref>). In laboratory populations of TSSM, the H258Y mutation arose de novo and was subsequently favored by continuous selection, resulting in resistance to pyflubumide and cyenopyrafen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Njiru et al., 2023</xref>). Our selection experiments also led to new mutations (I260V, R119C) arising over 66 generations (2 years) of cyetpyrafen selection in the LabR population. Although it is hard to completely exclude the possibility of contamination during laboratory selection, because TSSM is tiny and can easily be dispersed passively, the haplotype analysis showed that the two mutations in the lab-selected population likely arose de novo. In the same way, multiple de novo mutations could have contributed to the rapid evolution of resistance in different populations and regions as documented in our field surveys.</p><p>Although few studies have traced resistance evolution in the field, they suggest that both de novo mutations and standing genetic variation can contribute to resistance, with their relative importance depending on the specific pesticides and pests involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hawkins et al., 2019</xref>). Resistant alleles can originate from a single event and spread to distant populations by migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raymond et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daborn et al., 2002</xref>), but resistant mutations can also have multiple origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ilias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Troczka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kreiner et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schmidt et al., 2024</xref>). Direct evidence for multiple origins comes from the presence of the same mutation on multiple haplotypes, assuming that recombination can be excluded as an explanation because insufficient time has elapsed after a resistant mutation is introduced into a new background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Semenov et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, the requisite recombinant haplotypes were rarely found in the same population, and we therefore suspect that recombination is unlikely to be the source of patterns of haplotype variation over short DNA sequences. We suspect that populations of mites like TSSM have a strong evolutionary potential to evolve in situ rather than relying on gene flow, and that there is a repeatability of evolutionary changes when an organism is exposed to the same selection pressure, a long-standing issue in evolutionary biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Konečná et al., 2021</xref>). The recurrent appearance of the same mutation in different genetic backgrounds suggests that the likelihood of resistance evolution is high in TSSM and not dependent on gene flow, and the likelihood of this scenario is further increased by the fact that resistance can develop through several mutational options. We observed 2.7 resistant mutations per population in samples collected in 2024, seven years after the release of cyetpyrafen. The estimated mutation rate (<italic>Θ</italic>) is  0.0193, assuming 20 generations per year for TSSM. An effective population size (<italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub>) of 2.29*10<sup>6</sup> would be necessary to reach the number of de novo mutation observed in this study, given <italic>Θ</italic> =  3<italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub><italic>μ</italic> (haplodiploid sex determination of TSSM) and a mutation rate of <italic>μ</italic>  =  2.8*10<sup>−9</sup> per base pair per generation as estimated for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keightley et al., 2014</xref>). The high reproductive capacity (&gt;100 eggs per female) and short generation time of TSSM make it possible to reach such a large population size in the field.</p><p>Because field populations of TSSM can use multiple mutations to reach the same phenotypic endpoint (resistance), it is unlikely that all resistant mutations will be identified from laboratory selection studies, particularly if these involve a single laboratory population. Even in the case where multiple populations of TSSM have been selected for resistance (to cyenopyrafen and the related chemicals cyflumetofen and pyflubumide), QTL mapping still only identified a few of the relevant mutations providing resistance to each chemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sugimoto et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, mutations identified in laboratory selection may not be involved in resistance in the field because of fitness costs. For instance, H258Y conferred resistance to cyenopyrafen and pyflubumide in laboratory-selected populations and is associated with a high fitness cost in TSSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Njiru et al., 2023</xref>), and also likely reinforces cyflumetofen binding and toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Njiru et al., 2022</xref>). Relying on a limited set of resistance alleles identified in the laboratory for monitoring may bias inferences of resistance evolution in the field where many alleles can produce resistance. Genetic and evolutionary studies on field populations are then essential to develop a full picture of resistance evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Konečná et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lucas et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schmidt et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kersten et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pezzini et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that field-evolved resistance often involves large-effect alleles with a simple genetic basis, while laboratory selection may result in polygenic genetic architectures, due to differences in the occurrence of rare alleles (more likely in large field populations) and different selection pressures (more variable with intense periods in the field on occasions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">ffrench-Constant, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roush and McKenzie, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ffrench-Constant et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McKenzie and Batterham, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crow, 1954</xref>). This could potentially be mitigated by establishing laboratory selection lines using large starting populations from the field with pre-existing resistance alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gould et al., 1997</xref>). Until recently, few studies have directly compared the genetic basis of resistance in laboratory populations with field-evolved resistance across a large geographical scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McKenzie et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ffrench-Constant et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crow, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Legan et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we identified large-effect alleles in both field- and laboratory-selected resistant populations. High-level resistance was generated after lab selection with cyetpyrafen for 33 of 65 generations, almost at the same rate as the field populations where high-level resistance was observed three years after the commercial release of cyetpyrafen. In field populations, it seems that multiple allelic options can be favored by selection due to parallel adaptation, and that the same allele may also end up residing in different haplotypes in different areas. Through migration, these alleles/backgrounds may eventually end up in the same population to produce a polyallelic basis of adaptation where particular alleles may then not reach high frequencies unless one haplotype is favored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ralph and Coop, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Pesticide resistance provides many fascinating examples of rapid and recent evolution under high selection pressure, which can be leveraged to address fundamental issues about the evolutionary basis of adaptations to new environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hawkins et al., 2019</xref>), and also to examine the reliability of commonly used research methods. The development of high-throughput sequencing and population genomics methodologies provides an opportunity to detect selective signatures across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Van Etten et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pélissié et al., 2022</xref>). Although pesticide resistance is a rapid evolutionary process under strong selective pressures, identifying candidate genes directly from genomic signals remains difficult when adaptation occurs via soft sweeps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pennings and Hermisson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schrider et al., 2015</xref>). Soft sweeps may be common in adaptive evolution if the effective mutation rate (4<italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub><italic>μ</italic>)&gt;&gt;0.01, for example through large population sizes (<italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>), and/or high allelic mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hermisson and Pennings, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pennings and Hermisson, 2006</xref>). The multiple haplotypes and distinct evolutionary history of SDH genes among resistant field populations suggest a prevalence of soft selective sweeps through recurrent mutation as implicated in pesticide resistance in other pest systems, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garud and Petrov, 2016</xref>), and the oomycete <italic>Plasmopara viticola</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delmas et al., 2017</xref>). The haplotype diversity is likely to be underestimated, given that only two short fragments of <italic>sdhB</italic> and <italic>sdhD</italic> gene were used in this study. This is congruent with the ‘messier’ signals found in field populations relative to the artificially selected resistant laboratory population. Sweeps around the SDH genes are incomplete, or other contributing loci are undergoing selective sweeps, which may further reduce signal to detect adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pennings and Hermisson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schrider et al., 2015</xref>). Fewer mutation types and haplotypes, along with higher mutation frequency, are more likely to be detected. Clearer signals of selective sweeps could emerge from haplotype-based linkage-disequilibrium methods using individual-level genomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hermisson and Pennings, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We note a few caveats for our study. While we focused on target gene mutations, genes other than the sdh genes may play roles in the rapid resistance response. Environmental factors might influence population responses to cyetpyrafen and the structure of resistance alleles, but these were not examined. Incomplete dominance might also influence the expression of resistance, which could explain the decoupling of total sum frequency of resistance alleles from the percent survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> xii, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Future studies should incorporate functional genetic approaches to characterize allele dominance and environmental influence on resistance, using, for example, isogenic lines or CRISPR-Cas9 technology. However, the overall positive associations between resistance allele frequencies and survival post-cyetpyrafen exposure provide strong evidence that the sdh mutations observed in this study have a strong contributing role to resistance.</p><p>In conclusion, we have captured a detailed picture of contemporary evolutionary processes under pesticide selection in field populations of an invertebrate pest. We demonstrate that the rapid evolution of pesticide resistance is driven by an unprecedented number of population-specific mutations in target genes that arose recurrently. These findings reveal complex origins and diverse genetic bases of pesticide resistance in the field. These findings represent a challenge for SNP-specific molecular monitoring of resistance and for the implementation of effective resistance management strategies. They also highlight the value of amplicon and whole-genome sequencing to detect multiple target-site mutations. Finally, we call for future studies on field-evolved resistance to provide theoretical and practical insights into effective pest control, leveraging the genomics era.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Samples</title><p>We used 72 field-collected and laboratory-selected populations of TSSM across China for bioassays, whole-genome resequencing, Sanger sequencing of target genes, and establishment of mutant strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), including 15 populations collected before (2013–2017) and 55 populations collected after (2018–2024) the release of cyetpyrafen, as well as one laboratory-selected resistant population, and one laboratory-maintained susceptible population.

PBE values were calculated for 5 kb non-overlapping sliding windows. Windows with top 5% PBE value were considered outliers. Patterns of nucleotide diversity (π) estimates and Tajima’s <italic>D</italic> values around the SDH genes were also examined. We expected resistant populations to have lower nucleotide diversity and Tajima’s <italic>D</italic> values near the SDH genes due to directional selection favoring resistant haplotypes.

Since LC<sub>50</sub> of some populations could not be calculated or were inaccurate due to high resistance levels, the survival rate after spraying with 1000 mg/L cyetpyrafen, which is about 6.7–10-fold of field-recommended dose, was used to quantify the resistance level of TSSM to cyetpyrafen. Because multiple target-site mutations existed, we evaluated the associations using different metrics of target-site mutation frequencies: (i) the frequency of the predominant mutation in each population, (ii) the frequency of individuals carrying any mutation in each population, and (iii) the frequency of individuals with homozygous mutations in each population. Regressions were fitted as linear models using the <italic>lm</italic> function from the R package <italic>stats</italic> and visualized with <italic>ggplot2</italic>. We did not adjust associations for relatedness among populations because the evolutionary events leading to resistance appear to be largely independent.

Then, each pair of F<sub>0</sub> female and F<sub>1</sub> male adults with the same homozygous genotypes for the six mutation sites was placed into the same petri dish and left to mate and produce male and female progeny, with females from the line generated defined as a line homozygous for the target resistance mutation(s).

This well-documented introduction of the pesticide-and thus a clearly defined history of selection-offers a powerful framework for studying the temporal dynamics of rapid adaptation. The authors combine resistance phenotyping across multiple populations, extensive resequencing to track the frequency of resistance alleles, and genomic analyses of selection in both contemporary and historical samples. These approaches are further complemented by laboratory-based experimental evolution, which serves as a baseline for understanding the genetic architecture of resistance across mite populations in China.

The authors make use of cyatpyrafen-naive populations collected before that pesticide was first used, as well as more recent populations (both sensitive and resistant) to conduct comparative population genomics. They report 15 different mutations in the insecticide target site from resistant populations, many reported here for the first time, and look at the mutation and selection processes underlying the evolution of resistance, through GWAS, haplotype mapping, and testing for loss of diversity indicating selective sweeps. None of the target site mutations found in resistant populations was found in pre-exposure populations, suggesting that the mutations may have arisen de novo rather than being present as standing variation, unless initially present at very low frequencies; a de novo origin is also supported by evidence of selective sweeps in some resistant populations. Furthermore, there is no significant evidence of migration of resistant genotypes between the sampled field populations indicating multiple origins of common mutations. Overall, this indicates a very high mutation rate and a wide range of mutational pathways to resistance for this target site in this pest species. The series of population genomic analyses carried out here, in addition to the evolutionary processes that appear to underly resistance development in this case, could have implications for the study of resistance evolution more widely.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper combines phenotypic characterisation with extensive comparative population genomics, made possible by the availability of multiple population samples (each with hundreds of individuals) collected before as well as after then introduction of the pesticide cyatpyrafen, as well as lab-evolved lines. This resuts in findings of mutation and selection processes that can be related back to the pesticide resistance trait of concern. Large numbers of mites were tested phenotypically to show the levels of resistance present, and the authors also made near-isogenic lines to confirm the phenotypic effects of key mutations. The population genomic analyses consider a range of alternative hypotheses, including mutations arising by de novo mutation or selection from standing genetic variation; and mutations in different populations arising independently or arriving by migration. The claim that mutations most likley arose by multiple repeated de novo mutations is therefore supported by multiple lines of evidence: the direct evidence of none of the mutations being found in over 2000 individuals from naive populations, and the indirect evidence from population genomics showing evidence of selective sweeps but not of significant migration between the sampled populations.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>As acknowledged within the discussion, whilst evidence supports a de novo origin of the resistance associated mutations, this cannot be proven definitively as mutations may have been present at a very low frequency and therefore not found within the tested pesticide-naive population samples.</p><p>Near-isofemale lines were made to confirm the resistance levels associated with five of the 15 mutations, but otherwise the genotype-phenotype associations are correlative as confirmation by functional genetics was beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>My recommendations have all been addressed in the revised version.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

This will help readers contextualize how the experimental design could influence the role of standing variation.</p></disp-quote><p>The experimental design involved sampling approximately 6,000 individuals from the wild population ZJSX1, which were subsequently divided into two parallel cohorts under controlled laboratory conditions. The selection group (LabR) was subjected to continuous selection pressure using cyetpyrafen, while the control group (LabS) was maintained under identical laboratory conditions without exposure to acyetpyrafen. A dynamic selection regime was implemented wherein the acaricide dosage was systematically adjusted every two generations to maintain a consistent selection intensity, achieving a mortality rate of 60% ± 10% in the LabR population. This adaptive dosage strategy ensured sustained evolutionary pressure while preventing population collapse. The LC<sub>50</sub> values were tested at F1, F32, F54, F60, F62, and F66 generations using standardized bioassay protocols to quantify resistance development trajectories and optimize dosage for subsequent selection cycles. We provided the additional information in subsection 4.1 of the materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The finding that lab-evolved strains show cross-resistance is interesting, but potentially complicates the story. It would help to know more about the other mitochondrial complex II inhibitors used across China and their impact on adaptive dynamics at these loci, particularly regarding pre-existing resistance alleles. For example, a comparison of usage data from 2013, 2017, and 2019 could help explain whether cyetpyrafen was the main driver of resistance or if previous pesticides played a role. What happened in 2020 that caused such rapid evolution 3 years after launch?</p></disp-quote><p>Although the introduction of the other two SDHI acaricides complicates the story, we would like to provide a complete background on the usage of acaricides with this mode of action in China. Although cyflumetofen was released in 2013 before cyetpyrafen, and cyenopyrafen was released in 2019 after cyetpyrafen, their market share is minor (about 3.2%) compared to cyetpyrafen (about 96.8%, personal communication). Since cross-resistance is reported among SDHIs, we could not exclude the contribution of cyflumetofen to the initial accumulation of resistance alleles, but the effect should be minor, both because of their minimal market share and because of the independent evolution of resistance in the field as found in our study. Although the contribution of cyflumetofen and cyenopyrafen cannot be entirely excluded, the rapid evolution of resistance seems likely to be mainly explained by the intensive application of cyetpyrafen. To clarify this issue, we added relevant information in the first paragraph of the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Evolutionary history of resistance alleles:</p><p>- It would be beneficial to examine the population structure of the sampled populations, especially regarding the role of migration. Though resistance evolution appears to have had minimal impact on genome-wide diversity (as shown in Supplementary Figure 2), could admixture be influencing the results? An explicit multivariate regression framework could help to understand factors influencing diversity across populations, as right now much is left to the readers' visual acuity.</p></disp-quote><p>The genetic structure of the populations was examined by Treemix analysis. We detected only one migration event from JXNC to SHPD (no resistance data available for these two populations), suggesting a limited role for migration to resistance evolution. The multiple regression analysis revealed that overall genetic diversity and Tajima’s <italic>D</italic> across the genome were not significantly associated with resistance levels, genetic structure or geographic coordinates (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), which all support a limited role of migration in resistance development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is unclear why lab populations were included in the migration/treemix analysis. We might suggest redoing the analysis without including the laboratory populations to reveal biologically plausible patterns of resistance evolution.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the constructive suggestion. The Treemix analysis was redone by removing laboratory populations and is now reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Can the authors explore isolation by distance (IBD) in the frequency of resistance alleles?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the constructive suggestion. No significant isolation-by-distance pattern was detected for resistance allele frequencies across all surveyed years (2020: P=0.73; 2021: P=0.52; 2023: P=0.16; Mantel test). We added these results to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Given the claim regarding the novelty of the number of pesticide resistance mutations, it is important to acknowledge the evolution of resistance to all pesticides (antibiotics, herbicides, etc.). ALS-inhibiting herbicides have driven remarkable repeatability across species based on numerous SNPs within the target gene.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, which highlights the need to place our findings within the broader evolutionary context of pesticide resistance. We have investigated references relevant to the evolution of resistance to diverse pesticides. As far as we can tell, the 15 target mutations in eight amino acid residues are among the highest number of pesticide resistance mutations detected, especially within the context of animal studies. We have added relevant text to the second paragraph of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 5 A-B. Why not run a multivariate regression with status at each resistance mutation encoded as a separate predictor? It is interesting that focusing on the predominant mutation gives the strongest r2, but it is somewhat unintuitive and masks some interesting variation among populations.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted a multiple regression analysis to explore the influence of multiple mutations on resistance levels of field populations. However of 15 putative resistant mutations, only five were detected in more than three populations where bioassay data are available, i.e. I260T, I260V, D116G, R119C, R119L. The frequency of three of these mutations, I260T (P = 0.00128), I260V (P = 0.00423) and D116G (P = 0.00058), are significantly correlated with the resistance level of field populations. This has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Haplotype Reconstruction (Line 271-):</p><p>- We are a bit sceptical of the methods taken to reconstruct these haplotypes. It seems as though the authors did so with Sanger sequencing (this should be mentioned in the text), focusing only on homozygous SNPs. How many such SNPs were used to reconstruct haplotypes, along what length of sequence? For how many individuals were haplotypes reconstructed? Nonetheless, I appreciated that the authors looked into the extent to which the reconstructed haplotypes could be driven by recombination. Can the authors elaborate on the calculations in line 296? Is that the census population size estimate or effective?</p></disp-quote><p>Because haplotypes could not be determined when more than two loci were heterozygous, we detected haplotypes from sequencing data with at most one heterozygous locus. In total 844 individuals and 696 individuals were used to detect haplotypes of sdhB and sdhD. We detected 11 haplotypes (with 8 SNPs) and 24 haplotypes (with 11 SNPs) along 216 bp of the sdhB and 155 bp of the sdhD genes, respectively. Please see the fifth paragraph of subsection 2.4. We used ρ = 4 × Ne × d (genetic distance) (Li and Stephens, 2003) to calculate the number of effective individuals for one recombination event.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Single Mutations and Their Effect (line 312-):</p><p>- It's not entirely clear how the breeding scheme resulted in near-isogenic lines. Could the authors provide a clearer explanation of the process and its biological implications?</p></disp-quote><p>To investigate the effect of single mutations or their combination on resistance levels, we isolated the females and males with the same homozygous/ hemizygous genotypes for creating homozygous lines. Females from these lines were not near-isogenic, but homozygous for the critical mutations. We revised the description in the methods section to clearly define these lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- If they are indeed isogenic, it's interesting that individual resistance mutations have effects on resistance that vary considerably among lines. Could the authors run a multivariate analysis including all potential resistance SNPs to account for interactions between them? Given the variable effects of the D116G substitution (ranging from 4-25%), could polygenic or epistatic factors be influencing the evolution of resistance?</p></disp-quote><p>We couldn’t conduct multivariate analysis because most lines have only one resistant SNP. The four lines homozygous for 116G were from the same population. The variable mortality may reflect other unknown mechanisms but these are beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Why are there some populations that segregate for resistance mutations but have no survival to pesticides (i.e., the green points in Figure 5)? Some discussion of this heterogeneity seems required in the absence of validation of the effects of these particular mutations. Could it be dominance playing a role, or do the authors have some other explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>We didn’t investigate the degree of dominance of each mutation. The mutation I260V shows incompletely dominant inheritance (Sun, et al. 2022). To investigate survival rate of different populations, the two-spotted spider mite <italic>T. urticae</italic> was exposed to 1000 mg/L of cyetpyrafen, higher than the recommended field dose of 100 mg/L. Such a high concentration may lead to death of an individual heterozygous for certain mutations, such as I260V.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors mention that all resistance mutations co-localized to the Q-site. Is this where the pesticide binds? This seems like an important point to follow their argument for these being resistance-related.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. We revised Fig. 3c to show the Q-site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Statistical Considerations for Allele Frequency Changes (Figure 3):</p><p>- It might be helpful to use a logistic regression model to assess the rate of allele frequency changes and determine the strength of selection acting on these alleles (e.g., Kreiner et al. 2022; Patel et al. 2024). This approach could refine the interpretation of selection dynamics over time.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. A logistic regression model was used to track allele frequencies trajectories. The selection coefficient of each allele and their joint effects were estimated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper investigates the evolution of pesticide resistance in the two-spotted spider mite following the introduction of an SDHI acaricide, cyatpyrafen, in China. The authors make use of cyatpyrafen-naive populations collected before that pesticide was first used, as well as more recent populations (both sensitive and resistant) to conduct comparative population genomics. They report 15 different mutations in the insecticide target site from resistant populations, many reported here for the first time, and look at the mutation and selection processes underlying the evolution of resistance, through GWAS, haplotype mapping, and testing for loss of diversity indicating selective sweeps. None of the target site mutations found in resistant populations was found in pre-exposure populations, suggesting that the mutations may have arisen de novo rather than being present as standing variation, unless initially present at very low frequencies; a de novo origin is also supported by evidence of selective sweeps in some resistant populations. Furthermore, there is no significant evidence of migration of resistant genotypes between the sampled field populations, indicating multiple origins of common mutations. Overall, this indicates a very high mutation rate and a wide range of mutational pathways to resistance for this target site in this pest species. The series of population genomic analyses carried out here, in addition to the evolutionary processes that appear to underlie resistance development in this case, could have implications for the study of resistance evolution more widely.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper combines phenotypic characterisation with extensive comparative population genomics, made possible by the availability of multiple population samples (each with hundreds of individuals) collected before as well as after the introduction of the pesticide cyatpyrafen, as well as lab-evolved lines. This results in findings of mutation and selection processes that can be related back to the pesticide resistance trait of concern. Large numbers of mites were tested phenotypically to show the levels of resistance present, and the authors also made near-isogenic lines to confirm the phenotypic effects of key mutations. The population genomic analyses consider a range of alternative hypotheses, including mutations arising by de novo mutation or selection from standing genetic variation, and mutations in different populations arising independently or arriving by migration. The claim that mutations most likley arose by multiple repeated de novo mutations is therefore supported by multiple lines of evidence: the direct evidence of none of the mutations being found in over 2000 individuals from naive populations, and the indirect evidence from population genomics showing evidence of selective sweeps but not of significant migration between the sampled populations.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>As acknowledged within the discussion, whilst evidence supports a de novo origin of the resistance-associated mutations, this cannot be proven definitively as mutations may have been present at a very low frequency and therefore not found within the tested pesticide-naive population samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we could not definitively exclude the presence of a very low incidence of favoured mutations before the introduction of this novel acaricide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Near-isofemale lines were made to confirm the resistance levels associated with five of the 15 mutations, but otherwise, the genotype-phenotype associations are correlative, as confirmation by functional genetics was beyond the scope of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that future functional studies will validate the effects of these mutations on resistance in both the two-spotted spider mite <italic>T. urticae</italic> and other spider mite species. This could be done by creating near-isogenic female lines or using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, as gene knockouts have recently been established for <italic>T. urticae</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Could the authors elaborate on the environmental context (e.g., climate, geography) of the sampled populations to give more nuance to the analysis of genetic differentiation and resistance evolution?</p></disp-quote><p>We have explored the influence of geographic isolation on the frequency of resistance alleles by Mantel tests (isolation by distance). We didn’t investigate the influence of climate, because most of the samples were from greenhouses, where the climate to which the pest is exposed is unclear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 161: is this supposed to be one R and one S?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we added this information (LabR and LabS).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 207: variation is not saturated at the first two sites because the different combinations are not seen.

We observed 2.7 resistant mutations per population in samples collected in 2024, seven years after the release of cyetpyrafen. The estimated mutation rate (Θ) is 0.0193, given 20 generations per year for <italic>T. urticae</italic>. An effective population size (Ne) of 2.29*10<sup>6</sup> would be necessary to reach the number of de novo mutations observed in this study, given Θ = 3Neμ (haplodiploid sex determination of <italic>T. urticae</italic>) and a mutation rate of μ = 2.8*10<sup>-9</sup> per base pair per generation as estimated for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (Keightley et al., 2014).

What was the applied rate? In general, listing the rates of insecticide used in dose response would be useful to decipher if LD50s are projected outside of the doses used (seems like they are). In this case, authors should limit their estimates to those &gt; the highest rate used in the dose response.</p></disp-quote><p>It is difficult to control mortality precisely. We applied cyetpyrafen every two generations but did not determine the LC<sub>50</sub> every two generations. When mortality was lower than 60%, another round of spraying was applied by increasing the dosage of the pesticide. The LC<sub>50</sub> values were tested at F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>32</sub>, F<sub>54</sub>, F<sub>60</sub>, F<sub>62</sub>, and F<sub>66</sub> generations to establish the trajectories around resistance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The light pink genomic region in Figure 2 was distracting. Why is it included if there is no discussion of genomic regions outside the sdh genes?

In the figure legend, we added a description of the lab selected, field resistant and field susceptible populations. Very little common selection signal was detected among resistant populations on chromosome 2, indicating this region was less likely to be involved in resistance evolution of <italic>T. urticae</italic> to cyetpyrafen.

However, the evolutionary processes examined in the study are applicable to resistance in other systems, and potentially to other cases of rapid contemporary evolution. The authors could show wider significance for their work beyond the subfield of invertebrate pests by including more of this wider context in their introduction and discussion: even if this means they can no longer claim novelty based on the number of mutations alone, the study is a strong example of the use of population genomics combined with functional and phenotypic characterisation to investigate the evolutionary processes underlying the emergence of resistance, so could have wider importance than within its current framing.</p></disp-quote><p>The background was revised as mentioned above to take this into account.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, in lines 48-50, please clarify what is meant by pesticides here (insects/arthropods? weeds and pathogens too?)
