cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, promote the chromosome motion. Yeast SUN-domain protein, Mps3, forms multiple meiosis-specific ensembles on NE, which show dynamic localisation for chromosome motion; however, the mechanism by which these Mps3 ensembles are formed during meiosis remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 protein kinase (DDK) regulate meiosis-specific dynamics of Mps3 on NE, particularly by mediating the resolution of Mps3 clusters and telomere clustering. We also found that the luminal region of Mps3 juxtaposed to the inner nuclear membrane is required for meiosis-specific localisation of Mps3 on NE. Negative charges introduced by meiosis-specific phosphorylation in the luminal region of Mps3 alter its interaction with negatively charged lipids by electric repulsion in reconstituted liposomes. Phospho-mimetic substitution in the luminal region suppresses the localisation of Mps3 via the inactivation of CDK or DDK. Our study revealed multi-layered phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the localisation of Mps3 on NE for meiotic chromosome motion and NE remodelling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>chromosome motion</kwd><kwd>nuclear envelope</kwd><kwd>sun domain</kwd><kwd>Mps3</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22125001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shinohara</surname><given-names>Akira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22125002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shinohara</surname><given-names>Akira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H05973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shinohara</surname><given-names>Akira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H04742</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shinohara</surname><given-names>Akira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H00981</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shinohara</surname><given-names>Akira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cytological analyses combined with in vitro liposome reconstitution reveal that yeast SUN domain protein, Mps3, shows meiosis-specific phosphorylation in the luminal region of the nuclear envelope during meiosis for chromosome motion and nuclear envelope remodelling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair with each other. This pairing leads to juxtaposition of the chromosomes along their entire length, resulting in the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC). SC is a proteinaceous structure comprising two chromosome axes called the axial/lateral element (AE/LE), flanking a central region with a ladder-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hawley and Gilliland, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>). AE formation is initiated in the leptotene stage of meiotic prophase I, accompanied by the assembly of the chromosome axis with multiple chromatin loops. In the zygotene stage, some homologous AE pairs form a short SC, while in the pachytene stage, the SC elongates along the entire chromosome. After the pachytene stage, the SC dismantles in the diplotene stage before the onset of meiosis I.</p><p>Meiotic cells also exhibit a unique arrangement of chromosomes in the nucleus. In most organisms, telomeres attach to nuclear envelopes (NEs) in early meiotic prophase (or premeiotic phase) and occasionally cluster in one area of NE, particularly near the vicinity of the centrosome (a microtubule organising centre) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zickler and Kleckner, 1998</xref>). Telomere clustering is seen only in the zygotene stage and is known as ‘telomere/chromosome bouquet’. In the pachytene stage, telomere bouquets are resolved, and telomeres are dispersed over the entire NE. The bouquet configuration of chromosomes is proposed to promote homologous pairing by restricting the homology search process from three dimensions to two dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zickler and Kleckner, 1998</xref>).</p><p>The dynamic nature of meiotic chromosomes is conserved between yeasts and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hiraoka and Dernburg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koszul and Kleckner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paouneskou and Jantsch, 2019</xref>). The oscillating motion of nuclei during meiotic prophase I has been well described in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chikashige et al., 1994</xref>). Nuclear movement is driven by cytoplasmic microtubule cables, along which the spindle pole body (SPB), an yeast centrosome equivalent, embedded in NE moves together with the clustered telomeres. This telomere-led movement promotes the pairing of homologous loci on chromosomes. Although less coordinated, chromosome motion throughout prophase I has been reported in budding yeast, nematodes, maize, and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Penkner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheehan and Pawlowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shibuya et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Protein ensembles embedded in NE that connect telomeres in the nucleoplasm with the cytoskeleton in the cytoplasm, which are referred to as the linker of nucleocytoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, promote meiotic chromosome motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hiraoka and Dernburg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Starr and Fridolfsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jahed et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wong et al., 2021</xref>). The LINC complex necessary for chromosome motion contains an inner nuclear membrane (INM) protein harbouring the SUN (Sad1/UNc-84) domain and an outer nuclear membrane (ONM) protein with the KASH (Klarsicht, ANC-1, SYNE1 Homology) domain. The SUN and KASH domains interact with each other in a space between the INM and ONM, luminal region, or peri-nuclear space. SUN-domain proteins bind to telomeres and/or nucleocytoskeletons in the nucleoplasm, while KASH-domain proteins bind to cytoskeletons. LINC complexes transmit forces generated by the cytoskeleton to NEs for nuclear positioning and migration in somatic cells and telomeres for chromosome motion in meiotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Starr and Fridolfsson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, telomeres are tethered to NEs as several clusters during mitosis and move around NEs during meiotic prophase I. These telomeres are transiently clustered during prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conrad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koszul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trelles-Sticken et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trelles-Sticken et al., 1999</xref>). Telomere movement on NE drives chromosome motion inside the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koszul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scherthan et al., 2007</xref>). At least three distinct regulatory steps facilitate chromosome motion during budding yeast meiosis. First, meiosis-specific components of the LINC complex, such as Ndj1 and Csm4, are expressed and incorporated. Ndj1 is a meiosis-specific telomere-binding protein necessary for telomere tethering to NEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chua and Roeder, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conrad et al., 1997</xref>), whereas Csm4 is a meiosis-specific ONM protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kosaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wanat et al., 2008</xref>), which interacts with a unique class of KASH protein, Mps2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2020a</xref>). Second, actin cable formation is specifically induced in the cytoplasm of meiotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koszul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taxis et al., 2006</xref>). Third, NE dynamics, including NE remodelling and movement, occur prominently in meiotic prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>; this paper). NE remodelling is accompanied by NE localisation of a yeast SUN-domain protein, Mps3/Nep98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>), and Mps2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2020a</xref>). During mitosis, Mps3 and Mps2 predominantly localise to SPB as a component of the half-bridge as well as SPB-interacting network (SPIN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>) and play an essential role in SPB duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jaspersen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishikawa et al., 2003</xref>). During meiotic prophase-I, in addition to SPB, Mps3 localises as a distinct protein ensemble on NE as a LINC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>). In early meiotic prophase I, Mps3 forms several distinct foci/patches on NE and later shows more dispersed staining around the NE. Mps3 plays an important role in the telomere/chromosome dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>). However, how meiosis-specific Mps3 localisation in NE is induced is poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we showed that cyclin-dependent Cdc28 kinase (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK) are necessary for dynamic telomere movement, particularly for the resolution of telomere clusters. Defects in telomere movement induced by CDK and DDK inactivation are associated with impaired NE localisation of Mps3 and resolution of Mps3 clusters. We also found that the luminal region of Mps3, located near the INM, is important for NE localisation. This region is subject to phosphorylation during prophase I in meiosis. Phospho-defective <italic>mps3</italic> mutant protein showed reduced NE localisation during meiosis. The introduction of negatively charged residues in this region suppresses the defects in the Mps3 resolution in <italic>cdk</italic> and <italic>ddk</italic> mutants. In reconstituted liposomes, an Mps3 peptide containing the luminal region with negatively charged residues showed reduced affinity to the lipid membrane relative to the control wild-type Mps3 peptide. Our results suggest that multiple phosphorylation events, such as CDK and DDK-dependent phosphorylation as well as phosphorylation in the luminal region, control the Mps3 localisation to NE, thereby also controlling the assembly of meiosis-specific canonical LINC complex for chromosome motion and NE remodelling during meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Force-independent localization of Mps3 on NE during meiosis</title><p>We examined the localisation of the Mps3 fusion protein with a green fluorescent protein (GFP), Mps3-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>), in various mutants. Mps3-GFP showed stage-specific distribution and movement in NE during meiotic prophase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). At 0 h, Mps3 predominantly localised as a single focus, probably on SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jaspersen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishikawa et al., 2003</xref>) with little movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). During early prophase I, including meiotic S phase (2–3 h), Mps3 formed 2–5 foci (including one focus in SPB) on NE with slow movement. After 3 h, the number of Mps3 foci increased to more than 5, and several Mps3 foci fused to form a patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">4</xref>), as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>). During this stage, Mps3 foci/patches moved around the NE with oscillatory motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). At 3–5 h, some Mps3 foci/patches were localised to one area of NE with clustering. In late prophase I (e.g. at 5 and 6 h), Mps3 often covered most of the NE and was associated with NE deformation and protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">4</xref>). Mps3 localisation was classified into four classes and quantified at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Treatment of meiotic cells with LatB, which disrupted the cytoplasmic actin cables but not the actin patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), showed normal distribution of Mps3 foci/patches on NE during prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

One hour after washing out LatB, the motion of Mps3 resumed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest that Mps3 dynamics during meiosis can be functionally separated into two processes: force-independent NE localisation and force-dependent motion. Force-dependent motion requires actin polymerisation, Csm4, and a partly, Ndj1. On the other hand, force-independent NE localisation does not require actin polymerisation or Csm4 (Ndj1), suggesting a unique localisation mechanism of Mps3 on NE during meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CDK and DDK promote proper Mps3 localization on NE during meiosis</title><p>Because Mps3-dependent telomere movement is initiated in early meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conrad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>), we analysed the role of two protein kinases that are active during early meiosis: CDK and DDK. Because CDK and DDK are essential for vegetative growth, we used conditional mutant alleles of the catalytic subunits of CDK and DDK (Cdc28 and Cdc7), <italic>cdc28-as1</italic>, and <italic>cdc7-as3</italic>, which are sensitive to specific inhibitors,1 NM-PP1 and PP1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wan et al., 2006</xref>).

To inactivate CDK, 1 NM-PP1, which did not affect Mps3-GFP dynamics in wild-type cells or a steady-state level of Mps3-Flag protein in <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), was added to <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> at 0 h.

CDK inactivation impaired Mps3 localisation and motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>). In the wild type, several Mps3 foci/patches are loosely clustered on one area of NE in a transient manner, which reflects telomere bouquet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>). With CDK inhibition, these loose clusters of Mps3 foci were persistent during prophase I, which largely reduced the spread of Mps3 foci on NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and G</xref>). Tracking the motion of Mps3 foci confirmed persistent clustering with restricted motion of the foci in one region of NE under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>We also measured the speed of Mps3 GFP focus/patches on NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Previous measurement of the motion of a single chromosome locus showed heterologous nature of chromosome motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conrad et al., 2008</xref>). To avoid biased results, we simply measured a step-size of a single Mps3-GFP focus or patch in one-second interval through 20 s in multiple nuclei, and measured an average velocity a maximum velocity during the measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Wild type Mps3-GFP at 5 h showed 0.19 and 0.25 μm/s in average and maximum speeds, respectively. CDK inactivation slightly decreased the average speed, but not the maximum speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video6">Figure 1—video 6</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, 2 h after washing out the inhibitor, NE localisation and Mps3 motion were recovered. CDK inactivation after meiotic S phase (the addition of the inhibitor at 3 h) interfered with the dispersed localisation of Mps3 throughout NE with loose clustering of Mps3 foci/patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, persistent CDK activity is necessary for the establishment and maintenance of the dispersed localisation of Mps3, and thereby the resolution of clustering. We concluded that CDK plays a role in the resolution of Mps3 focus clustering (probably, not in focus/patch formation per se) and a minor role in the motion of Mps3 on NE.</p><p>DDK inactivation (<italic>cdc7-as3</italic>+ PP1) also induced a defect in Mps3 localisation on NE and motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>). PP1 did not affect the localisation of Mps3-GFP in wild-type cells or a steady level of Mps3-Flag protein under DDK inactivation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In its absence, <italic>cdc7-as3</italic> cells showed normal localisation and motion of Mps3 foci/patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>). DDK inhibition by PP1 from 0 h reduced the NE localisation of Mps3 with accumulation of the loose cluster of the foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Removal of the inhibitor restored the NE localisation of Mps3 in <italic>cdc7-as3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The addition of PP1 at 3 h also induced a Mps3 localisation defect similar to that at 0 h. This shows that persistent DDK activity is critical for the efficient resolution of Mps3 clusters on NE. The resolution defect of Mps3 clusters in reduced DDK activity is similar to that in response to decreased CDK activity, suggesting that CDK and DDK work in the same pathway to control Mps3 dynamics during meiosis. In contrast to reduced CDK, reduced DDK activity clearly decreased the velocity of Mps3 foci on NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video7">Figure 1—video 7</xref>). Therefore, DDK appears to play a more critical role in Mps3 motion than CDK.</p><p>We also analysed the Mps3-GFP localisation in the <italic>cdc7 bob-1–1</italic> double mutant, in which the <italic>bob1-1</italic> mutation in the helicase gene <italic>MCM5</italic> suppresses the lethality of the <italic>cdc7</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sasanuma et al., 2008</xref>), A small fraction (~20%) of the <italic>cdc7 bob-1</italic> mutant cells showed a few Mps3 foci on NE, whereas most of the cells did not form any Mps3 foci on NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, E and G</xref>).

Double-staining of Mps3 and Ndj1 in wild-type meiosis showed distinct Mps3- and Ndj1-staining domains on NE together with colocalized foci/patches of both. The reduced colocalization of Ndj1 and Mps3 on NE is clearly seen under CDK and DDK inactivation conditions. Ndj1 was not required for Mps3 localisation on the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest the presence of an Mps3-independent pathway for Ndj1 localisation on NE or telomeres, probably mediated by Ndj1 binding to Rap1/telomeres. Taken together, these results revealed that CDK and DDK activities are necessary for proper Mps3 localisation and efficient motion in NE during meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CDK and DDK promote telomere dynamics during meiosis</title><p>To determine the role of CDK and DDK in telomere movement, we analysed the motion of GFP fusion of a telomere-binding protein, Rap1, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trelles-Sticken et al., 2005</xref>).

Since Mps3 foci are actually formed under CDK and DDK inactivation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the Mps3 complexes on NE are sufficient to ensure some Rap1 motion.

Mps3 contains six potential CDK sites (S/TPXK/R or S/TP) located in the luminal region, two of which seem to be candidates for CDK/DDK phosphorylation (188–190 <underline>TSS</underline>PGK and 450–451 <underline>TS</underline>P; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and E</xref>). Because the 450–451 site is located in the SUN domain, which is not essential for Mps3 localisation on NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rao et al., 2011</xref>), we focused on T188-S189-S190 (hereafter, TSS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We purified a GST fusion protein of an Mps3 fragment (residues 160–260), including TSS. In vitro Cdc28–Clb5 alone, but not Cdc7–Dbf4 alone, promoted phosphorylation of the Mps3 fragment (approximately 10-fold compared to the background; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Co-incubation with CDK and DDK resulted in robust incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P in GST-Mps3, indicating that CDK and DDK cooperate in Mps3 phosphorylation in vitro (~30-fold compared to the background). Triple alanine substitutions (T188A, S189A, S190A; referred to as the <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) made the GST-Mps3 fragment a poor substrate by these kinases.

Furthermore, we raised an antibody against a Mps3 peptide with 189-phosphoserine and 190-phosphoserine (186-GAT<bold>pSpS</bold>PGKSF-195) and found that this phospho-specific antibody could recognise immunoprecipitated Mps3-Flag specifically between 4 and 8 h in meiosis, but not in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left panel). Strong signals were observed during late prophase I (4 and 6 h). This antibody did not recognise precipitated Mps3-AAA-Flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel). These results indicate that 189 S and 190 S are phosphorylated in vivo, specifically during meiosis.</p><p>The Mps3 sequence around the TSS site is similar to that of CDK/DDK-catalysed phosphorylation sites in Mer2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henderson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sasanuma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wan et al., 2008</xref>), including the TSSP sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

We swapped a 10-amino-acid region (GATSSPGKSF) containing the Mps3 phosphorylation sites with the corresponding region of Mer2 (TETSSPFRST; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

This suggests that residues 26–35 of Mer2 are functionally equivalent to residues 185–194 of Mps3.

First, we checked the Rap1-GFP movement in the <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant. In contrast to wild-type cells, the <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant was defective in the localisation and motion of Rap1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). In the mutant, the number of Rap1 foci did not increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and little movement of Rap1-GFP foci was observed during meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Rap1 motion in meiotic prophase I of the <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant is restricted, and the velocity of each Rap1 focus is decreased relative to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that T188, S189, and S190 of Mps3 are important for meiotic telomere dynamics. Indeed, the <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant was defective in chromosome motion, as shown by the analysis of a GFP fusion of Zip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koszul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">White et al., 2004</xref>). During prophase I, Zip1-GFP showed dynamic motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">3</xref>). The <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant reduced the velocity of Zip1 motion by approximately threefold relative to that of the wild type (48 ± 15 vs 130 ± 31 nm/s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the localisation of the Mps3-AAA mutant protein in meiosis as a GFP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). <italic>mps3-AAA-GFP</italic> cells showed 85% spore viability, which was comparable to the mutant strain without the GFP tag. Similar to the wild-type Mps3-GFP, the Mps3-AAA GFP fusion protein normally resided on the SPB as a single focus during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). During meiosis, the Mps3-AAA mutant protein showed reduced NE localisation. Upon entry into meiosis, similar to the wild-type Mps3, the Mps3-AAA mutant protein formed a few (usually two or three small) foci on NE, but showed little increase in the number of Mps3 foci. At late time points, unlike wild-type Mps3, the mutant protein did not form an Mps3 patch or cover on NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H,I</xref>). At 6 h, two or three foci of Mps3 showed limited movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J, K and L</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video4">Figure 4—video 4</xref>). These results suggest that T188, S189, and S190 of Mps3 are necessary for meiosis-specific Mps3 localisation and motion on NE, particularly for efficient localisation on NE accompanied by the formation of large complexes. Interestingly, the Mps3-AAA-Flag mutant protein still bound to Ndj1 and Csm4, similar to the wild-type Mps3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is consistent with the Mps3-AAA protein retaining the N-terminal nucleoplasmic region and SUN domain necessary for Ndj1 and Csm4 binding, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The <italic>Mps3-AAA</italic> mutant is deficient in NE growth</title><p>In addition to localization/movement defects, the <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant showed defects in nuclear morphology.

The nucleus of the wild type grew when the cell underwent meiosis and exhibited a fourfold increase (in area; twofolds in length) at 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). Treatment with LatB did not affect the expansion, indicating that meiosis-specific NE remodelling does not require actin polymerisation. The <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant showed defective NE growth in prophase I; the nuclear area in the <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant was similar between 0 and 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>).

DDD substitution also suppressed the motion defects of Mps3 by DDK inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Importantly, NE localisation and dynamics of Mps3-DDD protein still depend on meiosis, suggesting the presence of additional regulation of meiosis-specific localisation of Mps3. In vegetative cells (0 h, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), Mps3-DDD showed SPB localisation and normal Rap1 localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Here, we utilised a PIP<sub>2</sub>-involving model system to determine whether JM is affected by the membrane, although we are aware of the fact that it is not known whether Msp3 interacts with PIP<sub>2</sub>. This simple model system might provide a possible mechanism of how negative charge on the JM region caused by its phosphorylation affects its behaviour against the membrane.</p><p>For the wild-type peptide, the addition of PIP<sub>2</sub> decreased the peak intensity of the fluorophore at 600 nm up to ~40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The triplicates showed similar results. Decreased fluorescence could be due to quenching of the fluorescence from the dye association (self-quenching) by inter-peptide association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), as shown in a previous study on an ErbB2 peptide containing TM and JM regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsushita et al., 2013</xref>). These results suggest that the JM region of the Mps3-WT peptide is sensitive to changes in the membrane component and that the JM regions interact with the acidic lipid bilayer. On the other hand, the Mps3-DDD peptide decreased the intensity to ~20% (half of the intensity from the WT peptide). The decrease in the change in the fluorescence intensity was due to electrostatic repulsion between the aspartates and acidic lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This repulsion must place the fluorophores apart, preventing self-quenching. The repulsion can reduce the JM region of the Mps3-DDD peptide binding to the bilayers compared to that of Mps3-WT. These results suggest the different conformations of Mps3-WT and -DDD peptides with respect to the interaction of the JM region of Mps3 with the membrane.</p><p>To gain more insight into the behaviour of the JM region with the membrane, we utilised a molecular dynamic (MD) simulation technique.

The results from all the calculations showed that the JM region from Mps3-DDD dissociated from the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In both mitotic and meiotic cells, Mps3 is a major component of a half-bridge as well as the SPB interacting network (SPIN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Meiosis induces the localisation and motion of Mps3 on NE, which is accompanied by the formation of large protein ensembles of the LINC complex in NE, detected as foci/patches. The meiosis-specific LINC complex tethers telomeres and interacts with cytoplasmic actin cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2020b</xref>). In the luminal region between INM and ONM, Mps3 binds to a KASH protein, Mps2, during both mitosis and meiosis, and to a meiosis-specific Mps2-binding protein, Csm4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2020a</xref>). Mps2 and Csm4 cooperate to bind to the motor Myo2 in the cytoplasm. Myo2 on actin cables, whose formation is induced in meiotic cells, generates forces for the motion of the LINC complex on NE, which in turn moves chromosomes inside of meiotic cells (rapid prophase movement; RPM) as well as the clustering of telomeres in the zygotene stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conrad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koszul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trelles-Sticken et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trelles-Sticken et al., 1999</xref>). While Mps3 localisation on NE is independent of actin-generated force (and other meiosis-specific factors, such as Ndj1 and Csm4), Mps3 movement on NE is dependent on the force. Meiosis-specific regulation of Mps3 localisation on NE is a key event in the formation of a LINC complex with Mps3 for chromosome pairing/synapsis and chromosome motion.</p><p>Our studies revealed that, in addition to its role in chromosome dynamics, Mps3 localisation in NE is important for NE remodelling during meiosis. The characterisation of the <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> and <italic>mps3-S189A</italic> and <italic>-S190A</italic> mutants revealed that Mps3 localisation to NE (NE remodelling) plays a unique role in NE expansion in meiotic cells.

Upon entry into meiosis, Mps3 forms a few foci on NE in early prophase I, and phosphorylation of the luminal region of Mps3 and, probably DDK, promotes localisation of more Mps3 proteins as focus/patch on NE. Mps3 foci/patches transiently form a cluster of some Mps3 foci by an unknown mechanism, and CDK and DDK and Rec8-cohesin promote dissociation of Mps3 and Rap1(telomere) clusters. It is likely that positive feedback on Mps3 phosphorylation would increase the localisation of Mps3 on NEs, which results in full NE coverage of Mps3. (<bold>B</bold>) A hypothetical model of the formation of Mps3-containing LINC complex. During mitosis, Mps3 forms a non-canonical LINC complex with <italic>cis-</italic>membrane interactions with Mps2 as a component of the half-bridge and SPIN (left). Upon induction of meiosis, unknown factors promote the formation of Mps3 foci on NE. Then, the JM region of Mps3 is subject to non-canonical phosphorylation, which might in turn weaken the binding of JM to INM, probably by electric repulsion between the JM regions with negative charges and acid lipids. This process promotes the formation of the canonical LINC complex with the <italic>trans-</italic>membrane configuration, in which the Mps3 SUN domain binds to the KASH domain of Mps2 and Csm4. Csm4 may promote structural changes in the luminal region of Mps2. The N-terminal region of Mps3, which is located in the nucleoplasm, binds to a telomere-binding protein, Ndj1. During middle and late prophase I, Mps3 forms a large protein ensemble on the NE, which is seen as a patch.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63119-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In this study, we found that two cell cycle kinases, CDK and DDK, control proper Mps3 localisation on NE during meiosis, particularly by promoting the resolution of clustered Mps3 foci (and, thus, telomere bouquets), suggesting that the phosphorylation of a target protein(s) by these kinases plays a role in the resolution of Mps3 clusters. Moreover, we showed that the JM region of Mps3 near the INM, which is located in the lumen of NEs, is critical for meiosis-specific NE localisation of the protein. S179 and S180 of the JM region in Mps3 are subject to meiosis-specific phosphorylation of Mps3 assembly on NEs. The introduction of negative charges in the JM region changes the binding ability of the region to the membrane in reconstituted liposomes. These results suggest that Mps3 localisation in NE is subject to multi-layered regulation governed by distinct phosphorylation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Can CDK and DDK phosphorylate the lumen of Mps3?</title><p>During meiosis of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the N-terminal nucleoplasmic region of Sun-1 protein is phosphorylated by Chk-1 and Cdk-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Penkner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zuela and Gruenbaum, 2016</xref>). In M phase of human cells, SUN1 protein is phosphorylated at its N-terminal region by CDK and PLK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). Together with results described here, these suggest the importance of the phosphorylation in the regulation of dynamics and/or regulation of SUN-domain proteins.</p><p>Our in vitro study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) showed that CDK and DDK phosphorylate 188-TSS-190 sequence of Mps3 in a collaborative manner, suggesting that CDK and DDK collaborate to catalyze the phosphorylation of the JM region of Mps3 for its NE localization in vivo. However, this is less likely for several reasons. First, it is unlikely that CDK and DDK are responsible for direct phosphorylation reaction in NE lumen. These kinases are not localized to luminal regions of both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and NE since the catalytic subunits (Cdc28 and Cdc7) and its regulatory subunits (Clb5,6 and Dbf4) lack a leader sequence necessary for the luminal localization. Second, defects in Mps3 localization induced by CDK/DDK inactivation are different from those in the <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant. Third, if CDK is a priming kinase on S190 in SSP sequence of Mps3, a mutation in the CDK site (S190) could phenocopy the defect conferred by CDK defect. But this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Fourth, if DDK is the secondary kinase on S-pS-P primed by CDK, S189 substitution would confer similar (or less) defect to S190 substitution. However, the <italic>mps3-S189A</italic> is more defective than the <italic>mps3-S190A</italic>. Rather, S190 and S189 phosphorylation seem to play an overlapping role in Mps3 localization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>What is the target for CDK and DDK in Mps3 localization?</title><p>If CDK and DDK are unlikely to directly phosphorylate the luminal region of Mps3, what are the target(s) of these kinases? Our results indicate that CDK and DDK activities promote the resolution of Mps3 foci/patches and/or telomeres rather than NE localisation per se. Mps3 localisation on NE seems normal, even in the absence of CDK and DDK activities. Phenotypic similarity between <italic>cdk</italic> and <italic>ddk</italic> mutants in Mps3 localisation suggests a common target of these kinases for the resolution of the clusters. Interestingly, telomere-resolution defects under CDK and DDK inactivation are similar to those in the mutant of the <italic>REC8</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Challa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>), which encodes a meiosis-specific kleisin subunit of the cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein et al., 1999</xref>) and cohesin regulator, <italic>RAD61/WPL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Challa et al., 2016</xref>). It is well known that Rec8 is phosphorylated by DDK (and Polo and CK1 kinases), but not by CDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katis et al., 2010</xref>) and Rad61/Wpl1 is phosphorylated by DDK and Polo-like kinase (PLK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Challa et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, there might be another target in cohesin components by the CDK-DDK kinase axis. In mitotic yeast cells, Eco1, which catalyses the acetylation of the Smc3 cohesin subunit, is phosphorylated by CDK and DDK for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seoane and Morgan, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, Eco1 acetylates Mps3 in vegetative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, Eco1 may be a possible target of CDK-DDK for telomere resolution. Alternatively, there might be as yet unknown substrates by these kinases for the Mps3 dynamics.</p><p>Telomere clustering during prophase I persisted with CDK or DDK inactivation, suggesting the presence of a constraint on the resolution of the clustering. The phosphorylation, and thus negative charges in the JM region, might overcome this constraint for resolution. This is supported by the fact that <italic>MPS3-DDD</italic> partially rescued the resolution defect of telomere clustering with CDK or DDK inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, we found that Mps3-DDD, but not wild-type Mps3, showed NE localisation in mitotic cells only in the <italic>cdc7 bob-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting the presence of DDK-dependent constraints on the NE localisation of Mps3 during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Phosphorylation in the NE luminal region of Mps3</title><p>Protein phosphorylation of the luminal region between INM and ONM is very unusual and has not been reported in the past. However, recent studies have shown that the phosphorylation of secreted proteins and oligosaccharides of membrane proteins is catalysed by an atypical kinase, such as Family with sequence similarity 20, member C (Fam20C), in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and ER in vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tagliabracci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tagliabracci et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tagliabracci et al., 2015</xref>). Given that the luminal region of NE is consistent with that of ER, where INM/ONM proteins are synthesised, it is possible that a Fam20C family-like kinase might be present in the lumen between INM and ONM, which may catalyse the phosphorylation of the NE luminal region of Mps3. However, there are no reports on the presence of Fam20C orthologues or relative enzymes in lower eukaryotes, such as yeasts. Alternatively, phosphorylation of the luminal region may be mediated by a novel mechanism. Given that membranes are rich in phospho-lipids, the phosphate group in the lipids might act as a donor for transfer to proteins. Further studies are needed to identify the protein responsible for the phosphorylation of the JM region of Mps3.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The role of negative charges in JM region of Mps3</title><p>Biophysical analysis of synthetic peptides containing TM and JM regions of Mps3 in synthetic liposomes revealed that the JM region of Mps3 has the capability to bind to the lipid bilayers. Importantly, the introduction of three negative charges into the JM region weakens the binding to the membrane, resulting in a change in the geometry of the JM region of Mps3, as an extension, the luminal region of Mps3, including the SUN domain. As a typical LINC complex, the SUN domain of Mps3 in INM binds to the KASH domain of Msp2 in ONM. The connection spans ~20 nm between the INM and ONM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2020a</xref>). Recently, Jasperson and her colleagues showed “atypical” configuration of Mps3-Mps2 in SPB, in which not only SUN-KASH interaction, but also N-terminal regions of both Mps3 and Mps2 bind to each other in SPIN which surrounds SPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2020a</xref>). Typical LINC could accommodate <italic>trans</italic>-membrane configuration in the luminal region, while atypical LINC would have <italic>a cis</italic>-membrane configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This suggests that the luminal regions of Mps3 and Mps2 are quite flexible in accommodating two different SUN-KASH configurations. Our results suggest that the switch from <italic>cis</italic>- to <italic>trans</italic>-membrane configurations of the LINC complex might be regulated by the binding of the JM region of Mps3 to the INM. While the interaction between the JM region of Mps3 and INM promotes the <italic>cis</italic>-membrane form of the noncanonical LINC complex, negative charges induced by phosphorylation may reduce the interaction between JM and INM, which may accommodate a conformation suitable for the <italic>trans</italic>-membrane form. Alternatively, the negatively charged JM region of Mps3 would be a binding site for the other protein which may promote the configuration switch. This idea should be tested in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Meiosis establishes Mps3 localization on NE</title><p>As described above, Mps3 localisation in NE is regulated at distinct stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant retains the ability to form early meiosis-specific Mps3 foci on NE. The Mps3-DDD protein also requires meiosis for NE localisation during meiosis. This suggests that Mps3 localisation on NE is initiated and/or established during very early meiotic prophase I. Given that Mps3 localisation as an ensemble on NE is specific to meiosis, there might be an early meiosis-specific factor or modification that regulates the establishment of Mps3 localisation on NE upon entry into meiosis. We examined two meiosis-specific factors, Ndj1 and Csm4, both of which are involved in chromosome motion and Mps3 dynamics, but it is unlikely that these factors function in the establishment of Mps3 localisation. Further studies are necessary to identify the factors necessary for the initiation of NE remodelling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SK1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMC246633</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-HA(mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Babco</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">16B12</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1/1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Flag (M2)(mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">M2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1/1000), IF (1/2000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-tubulin(rat monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bio-Rad/Serotec, Ltd</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MCA77G</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1/1000), IF (1/2000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Zip1(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18297071/">18297071</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1/200)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Csm4(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMC2533704</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1/1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Mer2(S30P)(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMC2216698</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1/1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Mps3(S189P, S190P)(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1/500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1NM-PP1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cayman Chemical</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #: 13,330CAS-221244-14-0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PP1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #:0040CAS-172889-26-8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Latrunculin B</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Calbiochem</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat-428020</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Imaris</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Oxford Instruments</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tracking/speed measurement</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>All strains described here are derivatives of SK1 diploids and are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. <italic>MPS3-FLAG</italic> and <italic>MPS3-GFP</italic> diploid cells showed wild-type spore viability, but both showed ~2 h delay in the entry of meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rao et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>RAP1-GFP</italic> and <italic>NDJ1-HA</italic> diploids showed wild-type spore viability and normal progression of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kosaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trelles-Sticken et al., 1999</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Owen Richard Davies (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at eLife&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary</p><p>The manuscript by Rao et al., examines the phosphorylation of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> LINC Mps3 and provides evidence that phosphorylation is important for Mps3 meiotic nuclear envelope (NE) localization. Based on biophysical analyses and molecular modeling, the authors present a model that Mps3 phosphorylation alters interaction with membranes for production of a canonical LINC complex, critical for chromosome pairing and synapsis. The authors specifically show: (1) that proper Mps3 NE localization, chromosome movement and telomere clustering is dependent on CDK and DDK kinases; (2) sequences within the Mps3 lumenal domain are phosphorylated and CDK/DDK can phosphorylate these sequences in vitro; (3) mutations that block this phosphorylation result in the predicted meiotic defects; (4) mutations to phosphomimetic amino acids result in a Mps3 version that is localized to the NE to promote chromosome movement and telomere clustering independently of CDK and DDK; (5) in vitro liposome analyses and molecular modeling suggest altered interaction with membranes when the domain is phosphorylated (carries negative charges). Based on this in vitro data, the authors present a model whereby phosphorylation drives formation of a canonical LINC complex in trans to promote NE localization, which in turn is important for chromosome movement and telomere clustering. The finding of a functionally important meiosis-specific phosphorylation on Mps3 will be of interest in the field and conclusions are largely supported by experimental data. However, further experiments are required to support the idea that this region is actively controlling the localization of Msp3 in the manner the authors suggest in the model. Extensive improvements are also required to the text to ensure clarity and brevity.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1. This manuscript studies the nuclear localisation and movement of Mps3 and Rap1 by showing images at 3-second time intervals at various stages during prophase I. Whilst the authors state clear differences in movement, these are not always obvious from the figures, especially when mutants are studied at 5hr, when WT movements are not as apparent. The confidence in these data would be strengthened if the movements were quantified (across multiple nuclei) and statistical analysis performed of the WT and test populations. This could be achieved using the tracking data (e.g. Figure 1F) or by measuring correlations between static images at 3-second intervals. Furthermore, more details on the methodology are required and more cells need to be analysed for the estimated average speed and distance including statistical analysis (Lines 722-723 &quot;Zip1-GFP / Mps3-GFP /Rap1-GFP)…&quot;.</p><p>2. Although it is clear that the removal of cdc28 and cdc7 through the use of mutants sensitive to the analogs impacts the localization of Mps3, it is important to check that the amount of Mps3 protein remains stable. The authors state that the effect is only on the localization, but the stability of Mps3 may be affected and this may cause the phenotype. The analysis of the phosphomutant Mps3-AAA in Supplementary Figure 3, for example, it is not sufficient to rule this out. Indeed, a similar analysis of Mps3-GFP must be performed under cdc28-as1 and cdc7-as3 inhibition to visualize how the loss of this kinase activity affects the stability of Mps3.</p><p>3. Phosphorylation of Mps3: The authors show data that Mps3 is phosphorylated in a CDK and DDK dependent manner. This includes phenotypic analyses of inactivated kinases for Mps3 NE localization, chromosome movement and telomere clustering, direct phosphorylation of the Mps3 luminal domain by these kinases in vitro, and normal NE localization in the phosphomimetic Mps3 mutant in the cdk/ddk background. The authors do not look at the phosphorylation of Mps3 in vivo in the inactivated kinase backgrounds. However, in the discussion, the authors discuss the likelihood that CDK and DDK are NOT responsible for phosphorylating Mps3 due to the luminal localization. This point needs to be clarified with a better explanation for the role of CDK and DDK.

How much of the Mps3 protein is phosphorylated? This is relevant to the generation of the Mps3-DDD version and the finding that there are no mitotic defects.

The authors present a model of the interaction between SUN-KASH domains of the LINC complex based on in vitro liposome experiments in combination with molecular modelling. This is the novel part of the manuscript and if correct is an important finding.

However, it is understood that the experiments are technically challenging as the NE is 20-nm wide so picking out this architecture by super-resolution microscopy would be a significant achievement. In addition, to make the mechanistic claim that phosphorylation is necessary for the interaction to occur (as is suggested in the figure) analysis of Mps2-Mps3 interaction in vivo in the presence of phosphorylation mutants would be required. The authors should clarify the caveats of their model in figure 7, either with appropriate changes to the text, or by the provision of additional data to support it.</p><p>7. The text needs extensive revision. It is frequently difficult to follow and contains numerous errors, mis-labeled figures, omitted error bars etc. – it should be carefully edited for grammar and to improve clarity and precision. The discussion is unusually long and includes much published information that is not necessary for contextualising the findings. It also needs substantial editing to maximise clarity and brevity. Some are listed below, but this is not an exhaustive list.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63119.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1. This manuscript studies the nuclear localisation and movement of Mps3 and Rap1 by showing images at 3-second time intervals at various stages during prophase I. Whilst the authors state clear differences in movement, these are not always obvious from the figures, especially when mutants are studied at 5hr, when WT movements are not as apparent. The confidence in these data would be strengthened if the movements were quantified (across multiple nuclei) and statistical analysis performed of the WT and test populations. This could be achieved using the tracking data (e.g. Figure 1F) or by measuring correlations between static images at 3-second intervals. Furthermore, more details on the methodology are required and more cells need to be analysed for the estimated average speed and distance including statistical analysis (Lines 722-723 &quot;Zip1-GFP / Mps3-GFP /Rap1-GFP)…&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The motion of Mps3 and Rap1 foci/patches on NE is very heterogeneous and very much complicated to track down. As previously shown (Conrad et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2012), the motion analysis even for a single locus marked with GFP such as a telomeric locus showed very complicated patterns of the motion with at least two (or three) distinct classes of maximam velocity. To avoid complicated analysis of the motion, we measured a motion velocity of multiple Mps3-GFP particles in a single focal plane, using the simple tracking analysis in the Imaris software (Oxford Instrument) and presented mean and maximum speeds of each particle of Mps3-GFP (Methods and statistics are shown in Materials and methods). The results are shown in revised Figures 1H, 4L, 6E and S1D for Mps3-GFP, and also in Figures 2C and 4D for Rap1-GFP. More importantly, to show the dynamics nature of the motion, we also provided videos of a representative dynamics of Mps3-GFP and Rap1-GFP in different strains under various conditions (Videos 1-25). It is very clear that the <italic>mps3-3A</italic> as well as <italic>cdc7</italic> deletion (with <italic>bob1-1</italic>) significantly reduces the speeds of Mps3 foci. In addition, interestingly, CDK inactivation showed slight reduction of the velocity of the Mps3 motions; thus, it seems that CDK plays a major role in the resolution of Mps3 foci/patches, but little in the motion (as discussed in our previous version). These are clearly mentioned in the text. Moreover, we replaced tracking results in Figures 1F, 2B, 5H and S1B, in which each focus tracking is shown in different colors (for 20 s tracking instead of previous 120 s tracking).</p><p>We do not include data for tracking distances of Mps3(Rap1)-GFP focus since the distance along which the GFP focus moves depends on duration time of the focus; each focus showed distinct duration time even within 20 second tracking time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although it is clear that the removal of cdc28 and cdc7 through the use of mutants sensitive to the analogs impacts the localization of Mps3, it is important to check that the amount of Mps3 protein remains stable. The authors state that the effect is only on the localization, but the stability of Mps3 may be affected and this may cause the phenotype. The analysis of the phosphomutant Mps3-AAA in Supplementary Figure 3, for example, it is not sufficient to rule this out. Indeed, a similar analysis of Mps3-GFP must be performed under cdc28-as1 and cdc7-as3 inhibition to visualize how the loss of this kinase activity affects the stability of Mps3.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed western blotting analysis of Mps3-Flag in CDK (<italic>cdc28-as1</italic>) and DDK (<italic>cdc7-as3</italic>) inactivation conditions, which is provided in Supplemental Figure S1E and S1G. Compromised CDK and DDK activities did not affect steady state levels of Mps3-Flag protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Phosphorylation of Mps3: The authors show data that Mps3 is phosphorylated in a CDK and DDK dependent manner. This includes phenotypic analyses of inactivated kinases for Mps3 NE localization, chromosome movement and telomere clustering, direct phosphorylation of the Mps3 luminal domain by these kinases in vitro, and normal NE localization in the phosphomimetic Mps3 mutant in the cdk/ddk background. The authors do not look at the phosphorylation of Mps3 in vivo in the inactivated kinase backgrounds. However, in the discussion, the authors discuss the likelihood that CDK and DDK are NOT responsible for phosphorylating Mps3 due to the luminal localization. This point needs to be clarified with a better explanation for the role of CDK and DDK. At a minimum, the authors should indicate on page 10 that &quot;... although CDK/DDK can phosphorylate Mps3 in vitro they are unlikely to phosphorylate Mps3 in vivo (see discussion).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text to distinguish the contribution of the phosphorylation in the luminal region of Mps3 from CDK/DDK-dependent phosphorylation in Mps3 localization. Particularly, the <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant (deficient in the phosphorylation in the luminal region) shows defective NE localization with reduced focus-formation in NE, which is clearly different from resolution defects conferred by CDK/DDK inactivation. We</p><p>emphasize this point together with a revised model in a new model Figure (Figure 8).</p><p>Furthermore, to clarify the relationship of S189, S190 phosphorylation with CDK and/or DDK, we created new mutant alleles of the <italic>mps3-S189A</italic> (a putative DDK site mutant) and <italic>mps3-S190A</italic> (a putative CDK site mutant) mutants and characterized it in details (new Figure 6). As shown in the Figure, the <italic>mps3-S189A</italic> and <italic>mps3-S190A</italic> mutants did not show similar defects seen in CDK/DDK inactivation conditions (little resolution defects, rather showed localization defects); the <italic>mps3-S189A</italic> exhibited more severe in the defects than <italic>mps3-S190A,</italic> but both mutants showed more milder defects in Mps3 dynamics than the <italic>mps3-AAA</italic> mutant. Taken together, we suggest that phosphorylation at S189 and S190 are NOT mediated by CDK and DDK, respectively (CDK/DDK target(s) could be other proteins-See Discussion, page 20-21, line 638-654).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. How much of the Mps3 protein is phosphorylated? This is relevant to the generation of the Mps3-DDD version and the finding that there are no mitotic defects. The authors should be able to resolve this point by quantitative western blotting in the different conditions. It is also unclear based on the provided images whether Mps3-DDD still localizes to the SPB – this should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried quantified how much S189 and S190 are simultaneously phosphorylated in total Mps3 protein in vivo by several methods including western blotting suggested by the reviewers, but could not get convincing results at this point (our anti-phospho-S189, S190 antibody works only in IP factions of Mps3-Flag and we do not have any positive control such as purified phosphorylated full-length Mps3 protein). After consulting with Mass spectrometry specialists, we found quantitative Mass spectrometry of heterogenous multiple phosphorylation is technically difficult, probably due to possible heterogenous phosphorylation status; single, double, triple in the TSS sequence as well as neighboring serine residues (8 T/S residues from 180-200 aa).</p><p>To support the idea on multiple different phosphorylated Mps3 molecules in an indirect way, as shown above, we studied the phenotypes of two new <italic>mps3</italic> point mutants in the phosphorylation sites in the lumen; <italic>mps3-S189A</italic> and <italic>mps3-S190A</italic> single mutants and found that the two mutants showed a defect in the localization (Figure 6), suggesting that single phosphorylation in the luminal region of Mps3 promotes NE localization.</p><p>As pointed out, Mps3-DDD does not show NE localization in mitotic cells, suggesting that DDD substitution is not enough to induce NE localization of Mps3, implying possible phosphorylation on the other sites. Alternatively, an additional layer of the regulation could be operating. In fact, we DO see mitotic NE localization of Mps3-DDD in <italic>cdc7 bob1-1</italic> (but not <italic>cdc7-as3</italic> with PP1; The localization in the cells, uniform NE staining, is different from focus/patch staining in meiotic cells; Figure 5G), suggesting the presence of negative regulation by DDK during vegetative growth. These points are discussed in the text (line 681-684, page 22). We believe complicated phospho-dependent regulation of Mps3 localization for its meiosis-specific NE localization, which is now emphasized in a new revised tile of the manuscript.</p><p>We hope that the reviewers can acknowledge our reasoning on what we are not able to quantify amounts of phosphorylated Mps3 in meiotic cells. Importantly, even without this kind data, we believe that our conclusion in the paper is still valid.</p><p>We showed that Mps3-DDD is localized to SPB in mitosis (double staining with tubulin), which is shown in Supplemental Figure S3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
