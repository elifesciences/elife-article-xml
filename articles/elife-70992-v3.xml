extrinsic signals, with Wnt/β-catenin signaling coordinating multiple aspects of this process. Our knowledge of CNS EC development has been advanced largely by animal models, and human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer the opportunity to examine BBB development in an in vitro human system. Here, we show that activation of Wnt signaling in hPSC-derived naïve endothelial progenitors, but not in matured ECs, leads to robust acquisition of canonical BBB phenotypes including expression of GLUT-1, increased claudin-5, decreased PLVAP, and decreased permeability. RNA-seq revealed a transcriptome profile resembling ECs with CNS-like characteristics, including Wnt-upregulated expression of <italic>LEF1</italic>, <italic>APCDD1</italic>, and <italic>ZIC3</italic>. Together, our work defines effects of Wnt activation in naïve ECs and establishes an improved hPSC-based model for interrogation of CNS barriergenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells that line the inside of blood vessels are called endothelial cells. In the blood vessels of the brain, these cells form a structure called the ‘blood-brain barrier’, which allows nutrients to pass from the blood into the brain, while at the same time preventing harmful substances like toxins from crossing. Faults in the blood-brain barrier can contribute to neurological diseases, but the blood-brain barrier can also restrict drugs from accessing the brain, making it difficult to treat certain conditions. Understanding how the endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier develop may offer insight into new treatments for neurological diseases.</p><p>During the development of the embryo, endothelial cells develop from stem cells. They can also be generated in the laboratory from human pluripotent stem cells or ‘hPSCs’, which are cells that can produce more cells like themselves, or differentiate into any cell type in the body. Scientists can treat hPSCs with specific molecules to make them differentiate into endothelial cells, or to modify their properties. This allows researchers to monitor how different types of endothelial cells form.</p><p>Endothelial cells at the blood-brain barrier are one of these types. During their development, these cells gain distinct features, including the production of proteins called GLUT-1, claudin-5 and LSR. GLUT-1 transports glucose across endothelial cells’ membranes, while claudin-5 and LSR tightly join adjacent cells together, preventing molecules from leaking into the brain through the space between cells. In mouse endothelial cells, a signaling protein called Wnt is responsible for turning on the genes that code for these proteins. But how does Wnt signaling impact human endothelial cells?</p><p>Gastfriend et al. probed the effects of Wnt signaling on human endothelial cells grown in the lab as they differentiate from hPSCs. They found that human endothelial cells developed distinct blood-brain barrier features when Wnt signaling was activated, producing GLUT-1, claudin-5 and LSR. Gastfriend et al. also found that human endothelial cells were more responsive to Wnt signaling earlier in their development. Additionally, they identified the genes that became activated in human endothelial cells when Wnt signaling was triggered.</p><p>These findings provide insight into the development and features of the endothelial cells that form the human blood-brain barrier. The results are a first step towards a better understanding of how this structure works in humans. This information may also allow researchers to develop new ways to deliver drugs into the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>blood–brain barrier</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>barriergenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS103844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palecek</surname><given-names>Sean P</given-names></name><name><surname>Shusta</surname><given-names>Eric V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS107461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palecek</surname><given-names>Sean P</given-names></name><name><surname>Shusta</surname><given-names>Eric V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008349</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gastfriend</surname><given-names>Benjamin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1747503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gastfriend</surname><given-names>Benjamin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_189080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engelhardt</surname><given-names>Britta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bern Center for Precision Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engelhardt</surname><given-names>Britta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Overseas Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishihara</surname><given-names>Hideaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in endothelial progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells partially induces the specialized blood–brain barrier phenotype while the same treatment in matured endothelial cells is less efficacious.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the central nervous system (CNS), vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are highly specialized, with complex tight junctions, expression of a spectrum of nutrient and efflux transporters, low rates of vesicle trafficking, no fenestrae, and low expression of immune cell adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reese and Karnovsky, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Obermeier et al., 2013</xref>). ECs bearing these attributes, often referred to as the blood–brain barrier (BBB), work in concert with the other brain barriers to facilitate the tight regulation of the CNS microenvironment required for proper neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daneman and Engelhardt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Profaci et al., 2020</xref>). During development, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway drives both CNS angiogenesis, during which vascular sprouts originating from the perineural vascular plexus invade the developing neural tube, and the coupled process of barriergenesis by which resulting ECs begin to acquire BBB properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liebner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stenman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daneman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engelhardt and Liebner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Umans et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, neural progenitor-derived Wnt7a and Wnt7b ligands signal through Frizzled receptors and the obligate co-receptors RECK and GPR124 (ADGRA2) on ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuhnert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cullen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vanhollebeke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eubelen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vallon et al., 2018</xref>). Other ligands function analogously in other regions of the CNS, including Norrin in the retina and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) and potentially Wnt3a in the dorsal neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daneman et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for maintenance of CNS EC barrier properties in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tran et al., 2016</xref>), with astrocytes as a major source of Wnt7 ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guérit et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Molecular hallmarks of Wnt-mediated CNS EC barriergenesis are (i) acquisition of glucose transporter GLUT-1 expression, (ii) loss of plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP), and (iii) upregulation of claudin-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daneman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuhnert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Umans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, the Wnt-mediated switch between the ‘leaky’ EC phenotype (GLUT-1<sup>–</sup> PLVAP<sup>+</sup> claudin-5<sup>low</sup>) and the barrier EC phenotype (GLUT-1<sup>+</sup> PLVAP<sup>–</sup> claudin-5<sup>high</sup>) correlates with reduced permeability to molecular tracers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2017</xref>) and is conserved in multiple contexts. For instance, medulloblastomas that produce Wnt-inhibitory factors have leaky vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Phoenix et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, vasculature perfusing circumventricular organs is leaky due to low levels of Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, ectopic activation of Wnt in ECs of circumventricular organs induces GLUT-1 and suppresses PLVAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). However, similar ectopic activation of Wnt in liver and lung ECs produces only very minor barriergenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Munji et al., 2019</xref>), and Wnt activation in cultured primary mouse brain ECs does not prevent culture-induced loss of barrier-associated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sabbagh and Nathans, 2020</xref>). The reasons for the apparent context-dependent impacts of Wnt activation in ECs remain unclear and motivate systematic examination of this process in a simplified model system. Further, given species differences in brain EC transporter expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Uchida et al., 2011</xref>), drug permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Syvänen et al., 2009</xref>), and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Song et al., 2020</xref>), this process warrants investigation in human cells to complement mouse in vivo studies.</p><p>Prior studies have evaluated the impact of Wnt activation in immortalized human brain ECs and observed only modest effects on barrier phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Paolinelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laksitorini et al., 2019</xref>). Combined with the aforementioned deficits observed in primary adult mouse brain ECs that are not rescued by ectopic Wnt activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sabbagh and Nathans, 2020</xref>), one possibility is that mature, adult endothelium is largely refractory to Wnt activation, and that Wnt responsiveness is a property of immature ECs analogous to those in the perineural vascular plexus. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer an in vitro human model system for systematic investigation of molecular mechanisms of BBB phenotype acquisition, especially given their ability to model early stages of endothelial specification and differentiation. However, currently available hPSC-based models of CNS endothelial-like cells are not well suited for modeling the BBB developmental progression as they do not follow a developmentally relevant differentiation trajectory, lack definitive endothelial identity, or have been incompletely characterized with respect to the role of developmental signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lippmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Workman and Svendsen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). As a potential alternative, hPSCs can also be used to generate immature, naïve endothelial progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lian et al., 2014</xref>) that could be used to better explore the induction of BBB phenotypes. For example, we recently reported that extended culture of such hPSC-derived endothelial progenitors in a minimal medium yielded ECs with improved BBB tight junction protein expression and localization, which led to improved paracellular barrier properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nishihara et al., 2020</xref>). However, as shown below, these cells exhibit high expression of PLVAP and little expression of GLUT-1, indicating the need for additional cues to drive CNS EC specification.</p><p>In this work, we aimed to define the effects of activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling in hPSC-derived, naïve endothelial progenitors and assess the extent to which this strategy would drive development of a CNS EC-like phenotype. We found that many aspects of the CNS EC phenotype, including the canonical GLUT-1, claudin-5, and PLVAP expression effects, were regulated by CHIR 99021, a small molecule agonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. CHIR treatment in matured ECs produced a more limited response. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed definitive endothelial identity of the resulting cells and CHIR-upregulated expression of known CNS EC transcripts, including <italic>LEF1</italic>, <italic>APCDD1</italic>, <italic>AXIN2</italic>, <italic>SLC2A1</italic>, <italic>CLDN5</italic>, <italic>LSR</italic>, <italic>ABCG2</italic>, <italic>SOX7</italic>, and <italic>ZIC3</italic>. We also observed an unexpected CHIR-mediated upregulation of caveolin-1, which did not, however, correlate with increased uptake of a dextran tracer. Thus, we provide evidence that Wnt activation in hPSC-derived naïve endothelial progenitors is sufficient to induce many aspects of the CNS barrier EC phenotype, and we establish a model system for further systematic investigation of putative barriergenic cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wnt activation in hPSC-derived endothelial progenitors</title><p>We adapted an existing protocol to produce endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from hPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To achieve mesoderm specification, this method employs an initial activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling with CHIR 99021 (CHIR), a small molecule inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), which results in inhibition of GSK-3β-mediated β-catenin degradation. After 5 days of expansion, the resulting cultures contained a mixed population of CD34<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> EPCs and CD34<sup>–</sup>CD31<sup>–</sup> non-EPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We used magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to isolate CD31<sup>+</sup> cells from this mixed culture and plated these cells on collagen IV-coated plates in a minimal EC medium termed hECSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nishihara et al., 2020</xref>).

In addition to GLUT-1, we evaluated expression of two other key proteins: claudin-5, which is known to be upregulated in CNS ECs in response to Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benz et al., 2019</xref>), and caveolin-1, given the low rate of caveolin-mediated transcytosis in CNS compared to non-CNS ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reese and Karnovsky, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). 4 µM CHIR robustly induced GLUT-1 expression in approximately 90% of ECs while increasing EC number and increasing EC purity to nearly 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, CHIR led to an approximately 1.5-fold increase in average claudin-5 abundance and a 10- to 30-fold increase in GLUT-1 abundance, but also a 2- to 4-fold increase in caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We therefore titrated CHIR to determine an optimal concentration for EC expansion, purity, GLUT-1 induction, and claudin-5 upregulation while limiting the undesirable non-CNS-like increase in caveolin-1 abundance. Although 2 µM CHIR did not lead to increased caveolin-1 expression compared to vehicle control (DMSO), it also did not elevate claudin-5 or GLUT-1 expression compared to control and was less effective in increasing EC number and EC purity than 4 µM CHIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, 6 µM CHIR further increased GLUT-1 abundance but also further increased caveolin-1 abundance and did not improve EC number, EC purity, or claudin-5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we conducted further experiments using 4 µM CHIR. We confirmed that the CHIR-mediated increases in EC purity, EC number, and caveolin-1 and GLUT-1 expression were conserved in an additional hPSC line, although claudin-5 upregulation was not apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also used two hPSC lines with doxycycline-inducible expression of short hairpin RNAs targeting <italic>CTNNB1</italic> (β-catenin) to confirm that CHIR-mediated upregulation of GLUT-1 in ECs was β-catenin-dependent. Indeed, doxycycline treatment in combination with CHIR significantly reduced GLUT-1 abundance in ECs derived from these hPSC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, we confirmed that increased EC number was the result of increased EC proliferation in CHIR-treated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

PLVAP, a protein that forms bridges across both caveolae and fenestrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herrnberger et al., 2012</xref>), is one such canonically Wnt-downregulated protein. We therefore first evaluated PLVAP expression in Passage 1 control (DMSO) or CHIR-treated ECs using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We observed numerous PLVAP<sup>+</sup> punctate vesicle-like structures in both conditions, with CHIR treatment reducing PLVAP abundance by approximately 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). This effect was not apparent in western blots of Passage 1 ECs, likely due to the relatively modest effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

We therefore asked whether the rate of total fluid-phase endocytosis differed between CHIR-treated and control ECs using a fluorescently labeled 10 kDa dextran as a tracer. After incubating Passage 1 cultures with dextran for 2 hr at 37°C, we used flow cytometry to gate CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs and assess total dextran accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). In ECs incubated at 37°C, CHIR treatment did not change the geometric mean dextran signal compared to DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>), but did cause a broadening of the distribution of dextran intensities as quantified by the coefficient of variation (CV), indicative of subpopulations of cells with decreased and increased dextran uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>). We confirmed that the dextran signal measured by this assay was endocytosis-dependent by carrying out the assay at 4°C and with inhibitors of specific endocytic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Compared to vehicle control, chlorpromazine (inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis) and rottlerin (inhibitor of macropinocytosis) both decreased dextran uptake, while nystatin (inhibitor of caveolin-mediated endocytosis) did not significantly affect uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), consistent with the very small number of dextran<sup>+</sup> caveolin-1<sup>+</sup> puncta observed by confocal imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, despite the generally uniform elevation of caveolin-1 and decrease of PLVAP observed by immunocytochemistry in CHIR-treated ECs, our functional assay suggests neither an overall increase nor decrease in total fluid-phase endocytosis. Instead, it indicates that CHIR increases the heterogeneity of the EC population with respect to the rate of endocytosis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Functional properties of CHIR- and DMSO-treated endothelial cells (ECs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometry analysis of CD31 expression in Passage 1 ECs following the dextran internalization assay.

To test this hypothesis, we matured hPSC-derived ECs in vitro for four passages (until approximately day 30) prior to initiating CHIR treatment for 6 days and compared the resulting cells to differentiation-matched samples treated with CHIR immediately after MACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Upon recombination, the <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>flex3</sup> allele produces a dominant mutant β-catenin lacking residues that are phosphorylated by GSK-3β to target β-catenin for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harada et al., 1999</xref>); as such, this strategy for ligand- and receptor-independent Wnt activation by β-catenin stabilization is similar to CHIR treatment, although GSK-3 phosphorylates targets other than β-catenin (discussed below).</p><p>We first used literature RNA-seq data from postnatal day 7 murine brain, liver, lung, and kidney ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sabbagh et al., 2018</xref>) to define core sets of genes in brain ECs that are differentially expressed compared to all three of the other organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Using the resulting sets of 1094 brain-enriched and 506 brain-depleted genes, we asked how many genes in our Passage 1 ECs were concordantly regulated by CHIR: 130 of the brain-enriched genes were CHIR-upregulated and 116 of the brain-depleted genes were CHIR-downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). At Passage 3, 61 genes were concordantly upregulated and 46 downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In pituitary ECs with β-catenin stabilization, 102 of the brain-enriched genes were upregulated and 48 of the brain-depleted genes were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Compared with the pituitary ECs, there were far fewer concordantly regulated genes in liver ECs with β-catenin stabilization, with 25 upregulated and 1 downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Finally, cultured primary mouse brain ECs with β-catenin stabilization exhibited 72 concordantly upregulated and 16 downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). The only gene concordantly regulated in all four comparisons was the canonical Wnt target <italic>AXIN2</italic>.

Notably, the caveolae inhibitor <italic>MFSD2A</italic> was robustly upregulated by β-catenin in pituitary ECs, but not in any other context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–F</xref>), suggesting that other brain-derived factors may cooperate with Wnt to regulate expression of this important inhibitor of caveolin-mediated transcytosis. Complete gene lists from this comparative analysis are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. In sum, the data suggest that the hPSC-derived ECs responded to Wnt activation in a fashion that led to modest induction of CNS transcriptional programs and that the response was most similar to the pituitary β-catenin stabilization model.

We tested lists of upregulated genes in (i) our Passage 1 ECs treated with CHIR versus DMSO, (ii) Passage 3 ECs treated with CHIR versus DMSO, and (iii) pituitary ECs with β-catenin stabilization versus controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), against the Hallmark gene set collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). In all three comparisons, the <italic>Wnt/β-catenin signaling</italic> gene set was significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>Notch signaling</italic>, <italic>TNFα signaling via NF-κB</italic>, <italic>KRAS signaling up</italic>, and several additional gene sets were consistently enriched in all three comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), suggesting similar regulation by GSK-3 inhibition and direct β-catenin stabilization. In contrast, the <italic>PI3K AKT mTOR signaling</italic> gene set was enriched in Passage 1 ECs, but not in Passage 3 ECs or pituitary ECs. Similarly, the gene set <italic>mTORC1 signaling</italic> was enriched in Passage 1 ECs and pituitary ECs, but genes driving this enrichment were distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C</xref>), and this gene set was not enriched in Passage 3 ECs. Thus, given the known, bidirectional interactions of GSK-3 and AKT/mTOR pathway components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hermida et al., 2017</xref>), these results suggest that CHIR-mediated inhibition of GSK-3 may transiently activate this pathway in Passage 1 ECs. Conversely, the gene set <italic>TGF-β signaling</italic> was enriched only in pituitary ECs with β-catenin stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Taken together, these results, coupled with those of our <italic>CTNNB1</italic> knockdown experiments and gene correlation network analysis, suggest a central role for β-catenin as a key effector of CHIR-mediated signaling, but also highlight some potential differences in the pathways activated in response to CHIR treatment versus β-catenin stabilization. Differences in other aspects of these two experimental paradigms (in vitro versus in vivo, naïve versus CNS-proximal, human versus mouse), however, caution against overinterpretation of these results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a central role in CNS angiogenesis and in establishing the unique properties of CNS ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liebner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stenman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daneman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuhnert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cullen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vanhollebeke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). In this work, we investigated the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in induction of BBB properties in a human EC model using naïve endothelial progenitors derived from hPSCs. We reasoned that these immature EPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lian et al., 2014</xref>) would be similar to the immature endothelium in the perineural vascular plexus and thus competent to acquire CNS EC phenotypes in response to Wnt activation. To activate Wnt signaling, we evaluated the widely used ligand Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liebner et al., 2008</xref>) and the GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR.</p><p>We found that CHIR treatment robustly induced several canonical CNS EC molecular phenotypes, including a marked induction of GLUT-1, upregulation of claudin-5, and downregulation of PLVAP, which correlated with differential gene expression in RNA-seq data. We also observed a functional decrease in paracellular permeability. Further, using RNA-seq and western blotting, we identified LSR (angulin-1) as CHIR-induced in this system, supporting the notion that this highly CNS EC-enriched tricellular tight junction protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daneman et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sohet et al., 2015</xref>) is Wnt-regulated. In RNA-seq data, we observed differential expression of known CNS EC-enriched/depleted and Wnt-regulated genes including upregulated <italic>LEF1</italic>, <italic>AXIN2</italic>, <italic>APCDD1</italic>, <italic>ABCG2</italic>, <italic>SOX7</italic>, <italic>ZIC3</italic>, <italic>FLVCR2</italic>, <italic>JAM2</italic>, and <italic>RBP1</italic>, and downregulated <italic>PLVAP</italic>, <italic>FABP4</italic>, <italic>SMAD6</italic>, and <italic>SLIT2</italic>. These RNA-seq data should therefore be useful in generating hypotheses of BBB-associated genes regulated by Wnt activation in ECs for future functional studies. Our work also defines an important set of phenotypes for which Wnt activation in ECs is not sufficient in our system: in the context of vesicle trafficking, we observed caveolin-1 (<italic>CAV1</italic>) upregulation, no change in mean functional endocytosis, virtually no expression of <italic>MFSD2A</italic>, and high absolute <italic>PLVAP</italic> abundance in RNA-seq data despite CHIR-mediated downregulation. Given roles of brain pericytes in regulating PLVAP, MFSD2A, and functional transcytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daneman et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Zvi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stebbins et al., 2019</xref>), and the observation that MFSD2A is Wnt-regulated in pituitary ECs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), where pericytes are present, it is plausible that pericyte-derived cues are necessary in addition to Wnts to achieve the characteristically low rate of CNS EC pinocytosis. Next, while <italic>ABCG2</italic> (BCRP) was Wnt-induced in our system, other hallmark efflux transporters were not Wnt-regulated and either expressed at low levels (e.g., <italic>ABCC4</italic>, encoding MRP-4) or not expressed (e.g., <italic>ABCB1</italic>, encoding P-glycoprotein). Notably, however, <italic>Abcb1a</italic> was Wnt-regulated in the three other β-catenin stabilization experiments from the literature that we evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Munji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sabbagh and Nathans, 2020</xref>). Thus, pericyte-derived cues, astrocyte-derived cues, and/or activation of the pregnane X or other nuclear receptors may be important for complete acquisition of the complement of CNS EC efflux transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berezowski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Praça et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>CHIR is widely used to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Patsch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sakaguchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gomez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pellegrini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2021</xref>). It remains unknown, however, to what extent CHIR-mediated inhibition of GSK-3 in ECs mimics the effects of Wnt ligand-induced inhibition of GSK-3 or direct stabilization of β-catenin. In our system, although the GLUT-1-inductive effect of CHIR was partially inhibited by β-catenin knockdown and our RNA-seq data revealed a transcriptional response characteristic of canonical Wnt signaling, it is possible that CHIR affects other signaling pathways, as suggested by pathway enrichment analysis. Thus, employing ligand-based strategies to activate Wnt signaling will be an important next step. Our RNA-seq data suggest that the receptors and coreceptors necessary to transduce Wnt7 and Norrin signaling (e.g., <italic>FZD4</italic>, <italic>LRP6</italic>, <italic>RECK</italic>, <italic>ADGRA2</italic> [<italic>GPR124</italic>], <italic>TSPAN12</italic>, <italic>DVL2</italic>) are expressed by hPSC-derived ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>). Given evidence that Wnt ligands have poor solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janda et al., 2012</xref>) and our preliminary data suggesting that supplementation of culture medium with Wnt7a and Wnt7b is largely ineffective in activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling in this system, special emphasis should be placed on strategies that present Wnt7a, Wnt7b, and/or Norrin in a manner that concentrates ligands at the cell surface, for example, by using direct cocultures of endogenously Wnt-producing cells (neural progenitors or astrocytes) or Wnt-overexpressing cells. Importantly, neural progenitor cells and astrocytes likely would also contribute other yet-unidentified ligands important for acquisition of CNS EC phenotype. Finally, it would also be informative to directly compare CHIR and/or Wnt ligand treatment to direct stabilization of β-catenin in this system, for example, by generating an hPSC line with inducible expression of a dominant active β-catenin.</p><p>We also directly addressed the hypothesis that immature ECs are more plastic, that is, more competent to acquire BBB properties upon Wnt activation than mature ECs. This hypothesis is supported by existing observations that ectopic expression of Wnt7a is sufficient to induce GLUT-1 expression in non-CNS regions of the mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stenman et al., 2008</xref>), but β-catenin stabilization in adult mouse liver and lung ECs produces only a slight effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Munji et al., 2019</xref>). We repeated our CHIR treatment paradigm in hPSC-derived ECs after an extended period of in vitro culture (Passage 4 ECs) and observed much weaker induction of GLUT-1 and no pro-proliferative effect. Thus, our results support this hypothesis and suggest that the loss of BBB developmental plasticity in ECs is an intrinsic, temporally controlled process rather than a result of the peripheral organ environment. The molecular mechanisms underlying this loss of plasticity remain poorly understood. While previous studies have demonstrated that the level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CNS ECs peaks early in development and subsequently declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corada et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hübner et al., 2018</xref>), this finding does not address mechanisms underlying the competence of ECs (CNS and non-CNS) to respond to Wnt signals. In RNA-seq data of Passage 3 control (DMSO-treated) ECs, <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>TCF7</italic> were strongly downregulated compared to Passage 1 cells. This result suggests that low baseline expression of these transcription factors, which form a complex with nuclear β-catenin to regulate Wnt target genes, may partially explain the poor efficacy of CHIR in matured ECs, although additional work is necessary to assess the functional relevance of these differences. Interestingly, ECs in non-BBB-forming regions of the CNS (i.e., circumventricular organs), and in the anterior pituitary, which is directly proximal to the CNS, retain some of their plasticity in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), possibly as the result of a delicate balance between Wnt ligands and Wnt-inhibitory factors in these regions. Our model should facilitate additional systematic examination of factors that may enhance or attenuate EC Wnt responsiveness.</p><p>Finally, our work establishes an improved hPSC-based model for investigating mechanisms of BBB development in naïve ECs. hPSCs are an attractive model system to complement in vivo animal studies because they (i) are human, (ii) permit investigation of developmental processes in contrast to primary or immortalized cells, (iii) are highly scalable, (iv) can be derived from patients to facilitate disease modeling and autologous coculture systems, and (v) are genetically tractable. While widely used hPSC-based BBB models are useful for measuring molecular permeabilities and have been employed to understand genetic contributions to barrier dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vatine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vatine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lim et al., 2017</xref>), they have not been shown to proceed through a definitive endothelial progenitor intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lippmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2021</xref>) and express epithelial-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Qian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delsing et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vatine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, new models with developmentally relevant differentiation trajectories and definitive endothelial phenotype are needed for improved understanding of developmental mechanisms. Motivated in part by prior use of ECs derived from hematopoietic progenitors in human cord blood to generate BBB models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyer-Di Ponio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cecchelli et al., 2014</xref>), we and others recently showed that hPSC-derived naïve endothelial progenitors or ECs are good candidates for such a system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Praça et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nishihara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roudnicky et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roudnicky et al., 2020b</xref>). For example, Praça et al. showed that a combination of VEGF, Wnt3a, and retinoic acid directed EPCs to brain capillary-like ECs with moderate TEER similar in order of magnitude to that reported here. We previously showed that BBB-like paracellular barrier characteristics are induced in hPSC-EPC-derived ECs after extended culture in a minimal medium. These so-called EECM-BMEC-like cells had TEER and small molecule permeability similar to primary human brain ECs, well-developed tight junctions, and an immune cell adhesion molecule profile similar to brain ECs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nishihara et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we showed it was possible to use the small molecule Wnt agonist CHIR to induce additional hallmarks of CNS EC phenotype in hPSC-EPC-derived ECs, including canonical GLUT-1, claudin-5, and PLVAP effects (both Passage 1 and 3 CHIR-treated ECs). However, it is important to note that despite the improvements in CNS EC character with CHIR treatment, further improvements to functional endocytosis, and efflux transporter and solute carrier phenotype should be targets of future study and may be facilitated by cocultures and/or additional molecular factors. Along these lines, the Passage 1 CHIR-treated CNS-like ECs would be at a differentiation stage well suited to investigate cues subsequent to Wnt signaling that may be key for the induction of additional CNS EC properties. Alternatively, the Passage 3 CHIR-treated CNS-like ECs may be suitable for other BBB modeling applications. In summary, our work has defined the EC response to Wnt activation in a simplified, human system and established a new hPSC-derived in vitro model that will facilitate improved understanding of endothelial barriergenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

A 2.5 mg aliquot of Matrigel was thawed and resuspended in 30 mL DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and the resulting solution used to coat plates at 8.7 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> (1 mL per well for 6-well plates; 0.5 mL per well for 12-well plates). Plates were incubated at 37°C for at least 1 hr prior to use. hPSCs were maintained on Matrigel-coated plates in E8 medium (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. hPSC lines used were IMR90-4 iPSC, WTC11 iPSC, H9-CDH5-eGFP hESC, H9-7TGP-ishcat2 hESC, and 19-9-11-7TGP-ishcat3 iPSC. Medium was changed daily. When hPSC colonies began to touch, typically at approximately 70–80% confluence, cells were passaged using Versene (Life Technologies). Briefly, cells were washed once with Versene, then incubated with Versene for 7 min at 37°C. Versene was removed and cells were dissociated into colonies by gentle spraying with E8 medium. Cells were transferred at a split ratio of 1:12 to a new Matrigel-coated plate containing E8 medium. hPSC cultures were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination using a PCR-based assay performed by the WiCell Research Institute (Madison, WI).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Endothelial progenitor cell differentiation</title><p>EPCs were differentiated according to previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nishihara et al., 2020</xref>) with slight modifications. On day –3 (D-3), hPSCs were treated with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies, San Diego, CA) for 7 min at 37°C. The resulting single-cell suspension was transferred to 4× volume of DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies) and centrifuged for 5 min, 200× g. Cell number was quantified using a hemocytometer. Cells were resuspended in E8 medium supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 dihydrochloride (Tocris, Bristol, UK) and seeded on Matrigel-coated 12-well plates at a density of (1.5–2.5) × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1 mL per well. Cells were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. On the following two days (D-2 and D-1), the medium was replaced with E8 medium. The following day (D0), differentiation was initiated by changing the medium to LaSR medium (Advanced DMEM/F-12 [Life Technologies], 2.5 mM GlutaMAX [Life Technologies], and 60 µg/mL <sc>l</sc>-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate magnesium [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO]) supplemented with 7–8 µM CHIR 99021 (Tocris), 2 mL per well. The following day (D1), medium was replaced with LaSR medium supplemented with 7–8 µM CHIR 99021, 2 mL per well. On the following three days (D2, D3, and D4), the medium was replaced with pre-warmed LaSR medium (without CHIR), 2 mL per well.</p><p>On D5, EPCs were isolated using CD31 MACS. Cells were treated with Accutase for 15–20 min at 37°C. The resulting cell suspension was passed through a 40 µm cell strainer into an equal volume of DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS (Peak Serum, Wellington, CO) and centrifuged for 5 min, 200× g. Cell number was quantified using a hemocytometer. Cells were resuspended in MACS buffer (Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline without Ca and Mg [DPBS; Life Technologies] supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin [Sigma-Aldrich] and 2 mM EDTA [Sigma-Aldrich]) at a concentration of 10<sup>7</sup> cells per 100 µL. The CD31-FITC antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) was added to the cell suspension at a dilution of 1:50. The cell suspension was incubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT), protected from light. The cell suspension was brought to a volume of 15 mL with MACS buffer and centrifuged for 5 min, 200× g. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet resuspended in MACS buffer at a concentration of 10<sup>7</sup> cells per 100 µL. The FITC Selection Cocktail from the EasySep Human FITC Positive Selection Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) was added at a dilution of 1:10, and the cell suspension was incubated for 20 min at RT, protected from light. The Dextran RapidSpheres (magnetic particles) solution from the Selection Kit was added at a dilution of 1:20, and the cell suspension was incubated for an additional 15 min at RT.</p><p>The cell suspension was brought to a total volume of 2.5 mL with MACS buffer (for total cell number less than 2 × 10<sup>8</sup>, the approximate maximum yield from two 12-well plates; for a larger number of plates/cells, a total volume of 5 mL was used). 2.5 mL of cell suspension was transferred to a sterile 5 mL round-bottom flow cytometry tube and placed in the EasySep magnet (STEMCELL Technologies) for 5 min. The magnet was inverted to pour off the supernatant, the flow tube removed, the retained cells resuspended in 2.5 mL of MACS buffer, and the flow tube placed back in the magnet for 5 min. This step was repeated three times, and the resulting cell suspension transferred to a centrifuge tube, and centrifuged for 5 min, 200× g. Cell number was quantified using a hemocytometer. Resulting EPCs were used directly for experiments as described below or cryopreserved in hECSR medium supplemented with 30% FBS and 10% DMSO for later use. hECSR medium is Human endothelial serum-free medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 1× B-27 supplement (Life Technologies) and 20 ng/mL FGF2 (Waisman Biomanufacturing, Madison, WI).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Endothelial cell culture and treatment</title><p>Collagen IV (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 0.5 mg/mL acetic acid to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL.

The plate was tapped to release the ECs while SMLCs remained attached, and the EC-enriched cell suspension transferred to 4× volume of DMEM/F-12 and centrifuged for 5 min, 200× g. Cells were resuspended in hECSR medium and seeded on a new collagen IV-coated plate at approximately 3 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. hECSR medium was replaced every other day until confluent (typically 6 days). The selective dissociation and seeding described above was repeated, and hECSR medium was again replaced every other day until confluent (typically 6 days). We denote this time point as ‘Passage 3.’ In one experiment, these steps were repeated for another two passages. Except where indicated, CHIR 99021 or vehicle (DMSO) was included in the hECSR medium for the entire duration of culture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>RNA-seq was performed on ECs and SMLCs from the IMR90-4 hPSC line. Four independent differentiations were performed, with DMSO- and CHIR-treated ECs at Passage 1 analyzed from all four differentiations. DMSO- and CHIR-treated ECs at Passage 3 were analyzed from three of the four differentiations. DMSO-treated SMLCs at Passage 1 were analyzed from two of the four differentiations. FACS was used to isolate CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs and CD31<sup>–</sup> SMLCs from mixed Passage 1 cultures. Cells were incubated with Accutase for 10 min at 37°C, passed through 40 µm cell strainers into 4× volume of DMEM/F-12, and centrifuged for 5 min, 200× g. Cells were resuspended in MACS buffer and incubated with CD31-APC antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) for 30 min at 4°C, protected from light. The cell suspension was brought to a volume of 15 mL with MACS buffer and centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min, 200× g. Cells were resuspended in MACS buffer containing 2 µg/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technologies). A BD FACSAria III Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was used to isolate DAPI<sup>–</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> cells (live ECs) and DAPI<sup>–</sup>CD31<sup>–</sup> cells (live SMLCs). The resulting cell suspensions were centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min, 200× g, and cell pellets immediately processed for RNA extraction as described below.</p><p>RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Buffer RLT Plus supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol was used to lyse cells (pellets from FACS of Passage 1 cells, or directly on plates for Passage 3 ECs). Lysates were passed through gDNA Eliminator spin columns, loaded onto RNeasy MinElute spin columns, washed with provided buffers according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and eluted with RNase-free water. Sample concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and RNA quality assayed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA) with 5 ng input RNA followed by nine cycles of PCR amplification and library preparation using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina), with approximately 40–60 million 150 bp paired-end reads obtained for each sample.</p><p>FASTQ files were aligned to the human genome (hg38) and transcript abundances quantified using RSEM (v1.3.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>) calling bowtie2 (v2.4.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). Estimated counts from RSEM were input to DESeq2 (v1.26.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Love et al., 2014</xref>) implemented in R (v3.6.3) for differential expression analysis. Elsewhere, transcript abundances are presented as TPM. Differentiation pairing as described above was included in the DESeq2 designs. The Wald test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction was used to generate adjusted p-values. Principal component analysis was performed on counts after the DESeq2 variance stabilizing transformation. Transcription factor annotations were based on the list available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://humantfs.ccbr.utoronto.ca/">http://humantfs.ccbr.utoronto.ca/</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lambert et al., 2018</xref>); secreted and transmembrane annotations were based on the UniProt database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">UniProt Consortium, 2021</xref>). WGCNA (v1.70–3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang and Horvath, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>) was performed on the 14 EC datasets. Genes with an average of fewer than 50 estimated counts across these datasets were excluded, and the DESeq2 variance stabilizing transformation was used to generate the expression matrix for input to WGCNA. The topological overlap matrix (TOM) was constructed using the signed network type and a power of 20. Hierarchical clustering was performed on dissimilarity (1 – TOM) with average linkage. Gene modules were detected by a constant height (0.99) cut of the hierarchical clustering dendrogram with a minimum module size of 30 genes. Module eigengenes (the first principal component of the expression matrix for genes in each module) were computed as described, and the Pearson correlation between module eigengenes and experimental variables (CHIR vs. DMSO: CHIR = 1, DMSO = 0; Passage 3 vs. Passage 1: Passage 3 = 1, Passage 1 = 0) was used to identify modules of interest. Cytoscape (v3.8.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>) was used to visualize the 30 genes in the green module (strong positive correlation with CHIR treatment) with the highest intramodular connectivity.

Cells were washed once with 500 µL DPBS and fixed with 500 µL cold (–20°C) methanol for 5 min, except cells intended for calponin/SM22a and CD31/Ki67 detection, which were fixed with 500 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were washed three times with 500 µL DPBS and blocked in 150 µL DPBS supplemented with 10% goat serum (Life Technologies) for 1 hr at RT, except cells intended for calponin/SM22⍺ detection, which were blocked and permeabilized in DPBS supplemented with 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100, or cells intended for CD31/Ki67 detection, which were blocked and permeabilized in DPBS supplemented with 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.4% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies diluted in 150 µL of the above blocking solutions (see Key resources table for antibody information) were added to cells and incubated overnight at 4°C on a rocking platform. Cells were washed three times with 500 µL DPBS. Secondary antibodies diluted in 150 µL of the above blocking solutions (see Key resources table for antibody information) were added to cells and incubated for 1 hr at RT on a rocking platform, protected from light. Cells were washed three times with 500 µL DPBS, followed by 5 min incubation with 500 µL DPBS plus 4 µM Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies). Images were acquired using an Eclipse Ti2-E epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a 20× or 30× objective or an A1R-Si+ confocal microscope (Nikon) with a 100× oil objective. Confocal images were acquired with 1 µm slice spacing.</p><p>Images were analyzed using FIJI (ImageJ) software. For epifluorescence images, five fields (20× or 30×) were analyzed per well, with 3–4 wells per treatment condition. For quantification of cell number, EC colonies were manually outlined, and the Analyze Particles function was used to estimate the number of nuclei within the EC colonies. Nuclei outside the EC colonies were manually counted. EC purity (% EC) was calculated as the number of nuclei within EC colonies relative to total nuclei. To estimate % GLUT-1<sup>+</sup> ECs, cells within the EC colonies with membrane-localized GLUT-1 immunoreactivity were manually counted. To estimate % Ki67<sup>+</sup> ECs, cells within the EC colonies with at least one nuclear-localized Ki67 punctum were manually counted. For quantification of fluorescence intensity in epifluorescence images, EC colonies were manually outlined, and the Measure function was used to obtain the mean fluorescence intensity for each image channel (fluorophore). A cell-free area of the plate was similarly quantified for background subtraction. Following background subtraction, the mean fluorescence intensity of each protein of interest was normalized to the mean fluorescence intensity of Hoechst to correct for effects of cell density. For confocal images, 3–4 fields (100×) containing only VE-cadherin<sup>+</sup> ECs were analyzed per well, with four wells per treatment condition. The first slice with visible nuclei (closest to glass) was defined as <italic>Z</italic> = 0, and the Measure function was used to obtain the mean fluorescence intensity for each image channel (fluorophore) in each slice from <italic>Z</italic> = 0 to <italic>Z</italic> = 7 µm. A cell-free area of the plate was similarly quantified for background subtraction. After background subtraction, to approximate total abundance (area under the fluorescence versus <italic>Z</italic> curve [AUC]) for each channel, mean fluorescence intensities were summed across all slices. AUCs for the proteins of interest were normalized to Hoechst AUC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell cycle analysis</title><p>Passage 1 cultures were dissociated by treatment with Accutase for 10 min at 37°C. Cell suspensions were passed through 40 µm cell strainers into 4× volume of DMEM/F-12 and centrifuged for 5 min, 200× g. Approximately 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per replicate were resuspended in MACS buffer and incubated with the CD31-APC antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) for 30 min at 4°C, protected from light. Cell suspensions were brought to a volume of 5 mL with MACS buffer and centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min, 200× g. Cells were resuspended in 500 µL MACS buffer containing 2 µg/mL DAPI and 0.5 µL Vybrant DyeCycle Green Stain (Invitrogen) and incubated at RT for 1 hr, protected from light. Cells were analyzed on an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Invitrogen). FlowJo software (BD Biosciences) was used to gate CD31<sup>+</sup> cells and quantify the percentage of S/G2/M phase cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blotting</title><p>To enrich samples from Passage 1 cultures for ECs, the Accutase-based selective dissociation method described above was employed. Dissociated cells were centrifuged for 5 min, 200× g, and resulting cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (Rockland Immunochemicals, Pottstown, PA) supplemented with 1× Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Passage 3 cells were lysed with the above buffer directly on plates. Lysates were centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min, 14,000× g, and protein concentration in supernatants quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of protein were diluted to equal volume with water, mixed with sample buffer, and heated at 95°C for 5 min, except lysates intended for GLUT-1 western blotting, which were not heated. Samples were resolved on 4–12% Tris-Glycine gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 hr in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) supplemented with 5% non-fat dry milk. Primary antibodies (see Key resources table for antibody information) diluted in TBST plus 5% non-fat dry milk were added to membranes and incubated overnight at 4°C on a rocking platform. Membranes were washed five times with TBST. Secondary antibodies (see Key resources table for antibody information) diluted in TBST were added to membranes and incubated for 1 hr at RT on a rocking platform, protected from light. Membranes were washed five times with TBST and imaged using an Odyssey 9120 (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Band intensities were quantified using Image Studio software (LI-COR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Dextran accumulation assay</title><p>A fixable, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated dextran with an average molecular weight of 10 kDa (Invitrogen) was used as a tracer to estimate total fluid-phase endocytosis. Dextran was added at 10 µM to the medium of Passage 1 cultures. Plates were incubated on rotating platforms at 37 or 4°C for 2 hr. For inhibitor experiments, 20 µM chlorpromazine (Sigma), 100 U/mL nystatin (Sigma), or 2 µM rottlerin (Tocris) were added to the medium 30 min prior to addition of dextran. Medium was removed and cells were washed once with DPBS, and then incubated with Accutase for 10 min at 37°C. Cell suspensions were passed through 40 µm cell strainers into 4× volume of DMEM/F-12 and centrifuged for 5 min, 200× g. Cells were resuspended in MACS buffer and incubated with the CD31-APC antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) for 30 min at 4°C, protected from light.

Pellets were resuspended in DPBS supplemented with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated for 15 min at RT, protected from light. Cells were centrifuged for 5 min, 200× g. Pellets were resuspended in MACS buffer and analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). FlowJo software was used to gate CD31<sup>+</sup> cells and quantify geometric mean fluorescence intensity and CV of dextran. For imaging, the dextran accumulation assay was performed on cells cultured on #1.5 glass-bottom plates. After 2 hr of dextran treatment, medium was removed and cells washed with DPBS. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were washed three times with 500 µL DPBS and blocked and permeabilized with DPBS supplemented with 10% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 hr at RT. Cells were stained with the caveolin-1 primary antibody and imaged on a confocal microscope as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Transendothelial electrical resistance and sodium fluorescein permeability</title><p>Transwell inserts (6.5 mm diameter with 0.4 µm pore polyester filters) (Corning) were coated with 50 µL of a solution of collagen IV (400 µg/mL) and fibronectin (100 µg/mL) in water for 4 hr at 37°C. Passage 3 DMSO- and CHIR-treated ECs were seeded on Transwell inserts at 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in hECSR medium supplemented with DMSO or CHIR. Medium volumes were 200 µL for the apical chamber and 800 µL for the basolateral chamber. Beginning the day after seeding, TEER was measured daily for 6 days using an EVOM2 epithelial voltohmmeter with STX2 chopstick electrodes (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Medium was replaced every other day. TEER values were corrected by subtracting the resistance of a collagen IV/fibronectin-coated Transwell insert without cells and multiplying by the filter surface area of 0.33 cm<sup>2</sup>. Permeability of endothelial monolayers to sodium fluorescein was assessed 6 days after seeding cells on Transwell inserts. Medium in both apical and basolateral chambers was replaced and cells returned to the incubator for 1 hr. Medium in apical chambers, including the apical chamber of a collagen IV/fibronectin-coated Transwell insert without cells, was then replaced with medium supplemented with 10 µM sodium fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich), and plates placed on an orbital platform in an incubator. At 15, 30, 45, and 60 min, an 80 µL sample of the basolateral chamber medium was withdrawn from each Transwell, transferred to a 96-well plate, and 80 µL fresh medium replaced in the basolateral chamber of each Transwell. At 60 min, an 80 µL sample of apical chamber medium was also withdrawn from each Transwell and transferred to the 96-well plate. 80 µL of medium lacking sodium fluorescein was also transferred to the 96-well plate for background subtraction. Fluorescence intensity of all samples was measured using an Infinite M1000 PRO plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) with 485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission wavelengths. Background-subtracted fluorescence intensity values at the 30, 45, and 60 min timepoints were corrected for sampling-induced dilution as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stebbins et al., 2016</xref>). The endothelial permeability coefficient (<italic>P</italic><sub>e</sub>), which is a concentration-independent parameter corrected for the permeability of a cell-free Transwell insert, was calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stebbins et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>Individual wells of cultured cells that underwent identical experimental treatments are defined as replicates, and all key experiments were repeated using multiple independent hPSC differentiations. Detailed information about replication strategy is provided in figure legends. Student’s <italic>t</italic> test was used for comparison of means from two experimental groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison of means from three or more experimental groups, followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc test for comparison of multiple treatments to a single control, or Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) post-hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons. When data from multiple differentiations were combined, two-way ANOVA (one factor being the experimental treatment and one factor being the differentiation) was used for comparison of means to achieve blocking of differentiation-based variability, followed by post-hoc tests as described above if more than two experimental treatments were compared. For fluorescence intensities (a.u.), two-way ANOVA was performed prior to normalization of these values to the control group within each differentiation (for visualization in plots). Statistical tests were performed in JMP Pro (v15.0.0). For RNA-seq differential expression analysis, the DESeq2 Wald test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction was used to calculate p-values. Descriptions of the statistical tests used are provided in figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>Inventor on a provisional US patent application (63/185815) related to this work</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70992-transrepform1-v3.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>RNA-sequencing gene expression data for human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle-like cells (SMLCs).</title><p>Abundances are provided in transcripts per million (TPM).</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70992-supp1-v3.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>RNA-sequencing differential expression analysis of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived endothelial cells (ECs).</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) DESeq2-derived average expression (baseMean), log<sub>2</sub>(fold change), Wald statistic, p-value (Wald test), and adjusted p-value (Benjamini–Hochberg correction) are shown.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Maxime Culot (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to explore in more depth the differences in the expression profile between naïve endothelial progenitors and (partially) differentiated ECs by RNA-Seq.</p><p>2) Moreover, the authors should investigate other pathways induced by CHIR (GSK3 substrates; Akt, IκB-α, presenilin etc.) in comparison with dominant-active β-catenin.</p><p>3) Given that the mechanistic insight in the discrepancies between the stimulations with CHIR and Wnt7a/b, as well as with conditioned medium from neurospheres and astrocytes is limited, the authors should omit these data and add this approach to the discussion.</p><p>4) The authors should clearly delineate the aim of the study that, as perceived by the reviewers, appears to be the characterization of the Wnt pathway effects on directing human pluripotent stem cells toward the differentiation to a BBB endothelium.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>See public review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While this paper may be a worthwhile method development paper (as published in PLoS One, Science Reports or Microvascular research; eg. Cecchelli 2014 doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0099733; Linville 2020 doi: 10.1016/j.mvr.2020.104042), it lacks scientific novelty and depth required for a publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Numerous papers have identified Wnt3a for mesoderm induction and Wnt7a as the major brain EC ligand, and the use of a chemical GSK-3 inhibitor for more powerful Wnt signaling pathway activation is not novel or surprising. Indeed many other models and Wnt-pathway response papers have been published, numerous in the last two years (e.g. Laksitorini et al., Sci Rep 2019 9(1):19718. &quot;Modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes blood-brain barrier phenotype in cultured brain endothelial cells&quot;).</p><p>In addition one major claim of archievement is the analysis of EC maturity linked to Wnt-responsiveness. However, it has already been shown that there is a crucial timing difference in the responsiveness to Wnt signals both in vivo and in vitro (including, but not at all limited to the following examples: Hübner et al., Nat commun 2018 Nov 19;9(1):4860 &quot;Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates VE-cadherin-mediated anastomosis of brain capillaries by counteracting S1pr1 signaling&quot;; Corada et al., Circ Res 2019 124(4):511-525 &quot;Fine-Tuning of Sox17 and Canonical Wnt Coordinates the Permeability Properties of the Blood-Brain Barrier&quot;).</p><p>Additionally many of the mentioned examples not only analyze the contribution of WNT signaling, but also link other signaling pathways, whereas this paper identifies other but unknown signaling contributions for establishing ECs with full BBB properties.</p><p>Given the lack of novelty and the following mentioned difficulties of biological sample variations, I do not recommend the paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>Figure 1 shows more than factor2 differences between different differentiation samples (in terms of glut-1 positive cells), making this a less robust model than indicated.</p><p>The overall percentage of Glut-1 positive cells in Figure 1 and 2 is very low, making the comparison between the effectiveness of the different ligands while statistically significant compared to the control, most likely not significant compared between the ligands. Therefore the claims of e.g. Wnt7a being more effective is based on one of 3 samples of the same differentiation. All these comaparative claims will have to be either supported by much more data or taken out. The only clear result is that CHIR can stimulate expression of Glut-1 in around 90% of the cells, whereas the offered Wnt ligands affect 2-4%. To me this suggests that soluble WNT ligands in the culture medium are least effective in stimulating a response. It would have been most interesting to explore if co-cultures and hence the supply in e.g. Cytonems or other vesicle or membrane-bound delivery systems would make a huge difference. However this is not the scope of the paper.The analysis of mean fluorescence intensity of claudin-5, caveolin-1, and GLUT-1 normalized to Hoechst mean fluorescence intensity within the area of claudin-5+ ECs only is less informative, as one highly expressing cell will outweigh many low expressing cells and there is no published link of an endothelial cell resembling a BBB endothelial cells more closely in correlation with their Glut-1 expression intensity.</p><p>Unfortunately, when analysing the effects of conditioned media in Figure3 only those relative quantifications were used and again the spread between the two different differentiation rounds was so high, that a comparative analysis is hindered and not represented by statistical analysis compared to control only. For example the Caveolin/Hoest values of the orange dataset were increased in the CHIR treatment, but unchanged in Control and NR-CM, but in contrast in the green dataset the NR-CM resulted in a higher index compared to CHIR or the control. Again were no statistical comparison was done between samples, the drawn conclusions can not indicate there are any.</p><p>Figure 5 Anal;yses the effect of passage number in combination with CHIR treatment. However the individual differentiation samples again behave partially opposite: the green sample Glut1/ß-actin is only weakle elevated in passage 1 and upregulated after passage3, the purple sample is high in passage 1 and becomes downregulated after passage 3.</p><p>Figure 7 the effects in the mature EC should be directly compared to the effects in more naïve from the same differentiation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although I have a positive opinion on the manuscript, I personally think that the manuscript could be slightly simplified (and shorten). Therefore, I have listed below several points that I think should be addressed (and possibly used to shorten the manuscript) by the authors before publication of the manuscript.</p><p>– Page 8 Line 173- 192 : &quot;In the CNS, neural progenitors ….. ….. the Wnt ligand signal (analyzed further below)”.</p><p>This part and associated figure 3 compare the effects of neural rosette-conditioned medium and astrocyte-conditioned medium to the one of WNT7A and CHIR based on the fact that both cell types were suggested to express WNT7A (Vatine et al., 2016; Shang et al., 2018)..</p><p>Although the data are interesting per se., these data in my opinion, do not really have an added value to the main topic of the study (i.e deciphering the effects of wnt signaling in human endothelial cell progenitor with a focus on barrier formation).</p><p>In addition, the reported effects of neural rosette and astrocyte-conditioned media on endothelial progenitors were weaker than the one of CHIR which the authors suggest could be due to the potency or concentration of ligands in conditioned media. Indeed, there can be numerous hypothesis made here as there can be numerous secreted factors in those conditioned media.</p><p>Therefore, instead of including these data (i.e Figure 3) in this manuscript, I would rather suggest the authors to use it as the basis of a study on the contribition of wnt ligands in the effects of neural rosette and/or astrocyte-conditioned media-effects on ECs derived from hPSC. They could make use of their hPSC lines with doxycycline-inducible expression of short hairpin RNAs targeting CTNNB1 to confirm that neural rosette and/or astrocyte-conditioned media-effects in ECs (notably on GLUT-1, Claudin 5, caveolin-1) are β-catenin dependent.</p><p>In such experiment a comparison of the effects of wnt7A, neural rosette and astrocyte-conditioned media (+ brain pericyte conditioned medium or even coculture) on hPSC-derived endothelial progenitors (including from doxycycline-inducible expression of short hairpin RNAs targeting CTNNB1) would probably clarify the role of wnt ligand in the effects of neural rosette and astrocyte-conditioned media (or even coculture).</p><p>– Page 10-Line 217 (and associated Figure 6C): &quot;We first confirmed that the process of dextran internalization required the membrane fluidity of an endocytosis-dependent process by carrying out the assay at 4C”</p><p>Although I get the idea of comparing fluorescent dextran internalization with or without CHIR treatment, I miss the point of the necessity of comparing the 4C and 37C. I assume 4C would not only affect membrane fluidity but also would reduce any active processes taking place in the cells as well as reduce thermal molecular agitation within the assay.</p><p>Therefore, I would suggest to remove this experiment at 4{degree sign}C which I find confusing and possibly replace it by experiment performed with inhibitors of the caveolin pathway (e.g Filipin, Genistein, Nystatin,.;)</p><p>– Page 21 – Line 483:</p><p>Although I agree with the statement that Praça et al., reported moderate improvement in barrier function using a combination of VEGF, Wnt3a, and retinoic acid, in my opinion TEER values should be used intra assay (e.g as in the manuscript to compare the effects of CHIR on TEER) not from one study to the next as several parameters could influence TEER (e.g Temperature, buffer capacity, surface of the insert,…).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Gastfriend et al., describes a novel approach to generate a blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro model from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) by inducing BBB characteristics in yet undifferentiated, naïve endothelial precursor cells with Wnt/β-catenin activating agents. Specifically, the authors identified the inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) CHIR99021 (CHIR) to consistently induce crucial BBB-relevant genes such as GLUT-1, Cldn5, LEF1, APCDD1 and ZIC3. At the same time GSK3β inhibition lead to reduced expression of PLVAP. Interestingly, the authors also observed, along with the up-regulation of BBB genes, an up-regulation of caveolin-1 (CAV1) that however, did not result in increased transendothelial permeability. Further the authors compared the treatment with CHIR to the stimulation with recombinant Wnt7a, Wnt7b and combinations thereof, as well as to the treatment with conditioned medium (CM) from astrocytes and neuroblast rosettes. Wnt7a and the combination of Wnt7a and Wnt7b showed a pronounced effect on endothelial purity during IPSC differentiation, but considerably lower effects on the expression of barrier genes than CHIR. Neuroblast and astrocyte CM showed effects on endothelial purity and neuroblast CM also some effect on GLUT-1 expression.</p><p>The authors also investigated the barrier characteristics at different stages of endothelial progenitor differentiation, i.e. at passage 1 and passage 3, as well as at a higher maturity at passages 4 and 5. The presented data suggest that at passage 1 and 3 CHIR is able to induce expression of GLUT-1, claudin-5, LSR and barrier properties measured by TEER, whereas at later passages 4 and 5 these effects were considerably lower or absent.</p><p>Consequently, the author interpret this finding as a a result of endothelial differentiation, suggesting that naïve progenitors are susceptible to Wnt induction, whereas terminally differentiated cells are not or at lower level.</p><p>Finally, the authors performed RNA-Seq of CHIR and DMSO treated progenitor cells at passages 1 and 3, as well as comparing Wnt7a and DMSO. Expression profiling demonstrated that CHIR induces crucial BBB genes which essentially overlapped with the inducing effects of Wnt7a. Interestingly, only Wnt7a resulted in the induction of Sox17, which has been shown to be up-regulated in the maturing BBB.</p><p>The concept of a time-dependent induction of BBB characteristics by Wnt/β-catenin induction as a “window of opportunity&quot; is interesting and innovative, although others have already proposed this.</p><p>The presented data are solid and the manuscript is well written with high standard figures. However, some experimental details and interpretation of the data require the authors attention to augment the scientific merit of the manuscript:</p><p>It would be important that the authors clearly claim if the present manuscript describes a novel in vitro model or a basic stem cell biological finding.</p><p>The following critical points are related to this first issue because the that</p><p>The authors show that the treatment with Wnt7a and in particular with Wnt7b only show little or even no effects on Wnt pathway activation (Figure 8—figure supplement 1 B; no AXIN2 induction by Wnt7a/7b!!) and induction of BBB characteristics. It would be important to further investigate this topic to clearly demonstrate that Wnt7a/7b indeed are functional as recombinant proteins in the described experimental setting. Wnt7 has been shown to be only little diffusible, requiring the direct contact of the sending cell to the receiving cells (Eubelen, M. et al., Science (New York, NY) 361, eaat1178, 2018). Therefore, the authors should elaborate on an experimental setting to stimulate the naïve endothelial progenitors with Wnt7a/7b in a paracrine manner. This would help to clarify the question regarding the discrepancy between the CHIR and the Wnt7a treatment.</p><p>Essentially, the same critique can be raised concerning the treatment with conditioned medium from neuroblast rosettes and astrocytes. Although both may express Wnt7a/7b, specifically these Wnts may not accumulate in the CM and hence, the effects may be minor.</p><p>Page 16, line 359-363: The assumption made in the sentence “Upon recombination, the Ctnnb1 flex3 allele produces a dominant mutant β-catenin lacking residues that are phosphorylated by GSK-3β to target β-catenin for degradation (Harada et al., 1999); as such, this strategy for ligand- and receptor-independent Wnt activation by β-catenin stabilization is directly analogous to CHIR treatment.&quot; might be wrong, as blocking GSK3beta potentially has many other effects than “just&quot; activating β-catenin-mediated transcription!! The authors should discuss this topic in more depth.</p><p>One of the highlight of the present manuscript is the inducibility of naïve endothelial progenitors by CHIR compared to differentiated endothelial cells. Hence it would be important to compare the expression pattern by RNA-Seq of these two conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70992.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to explore in more depth the differences in the expression profile between naïve endothelial progenitors and (partially) differentiated ECs by RNA-Seq.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a more comprehensive analysis and discussion of transcriptomics data is warranted.

Finally, we have performed enrichment analyses to compare and contrast CHIR effects to those elicited by direct stabilization of β-catenin. We have substantially revised the corresponding sections of the Results and Discussion to highlight these additional analyses, but given the number of figures that have been edited and added, have not duplicated the revised figures in the response document. In detail:</p><p>– We have highlighted additional genes of interest induced by CHIR in Passage 1 ECs, including additional transcription factors also expressed by brain ECs in vivo (<italic>MSX1</italic>, <italic>EBF1</italic>), and <italic>FLVCR2</italic>, a gene with a known role in brain angiogenesis (Figure 7).</p><p>From Results: “We also identified upregulated transcription factors: <italic>ZIC3,</italic> which is highly enriched in brain and retinal ECs in vivo and downstream of Frizzled4 signaling (Wang et al., 2012; Sabbagh et al., 2018), and <italic>SOX7</italic>, which acts cooperatively with <italic>SOX17</italic> and <italic>SOX18</italic> in retinal angiogenesis (Zhou et al., 2015), were upregulated by CHIR in our system (Figure 7D). <italic>MSX1</italic> and <italic>EBF1</italic>, which are expressed by murine brain ECs in vivo (Vanlandewijck et al., 2018) were also CHIR-upregulated (Figure 7D). Additional CHIR-upregulated genes included <italic>ABCG2</italic> (encoding the efflux transporter Breast Cancer Resistance Protein, BCRP), <italic>APLN</italic>, a tip cell marker enriched in postnatal day 7 murine brain ECs compared to those of other organs, and subsequently downregulated in adulthood (Sabbagh et al., 2018; Sabbagh and Nathans, 2020), and <italic>FLVCR2</italic>, a disease-associated gene with a recently-identified role in brain angiogenesis (Santander et al., 2020) (Figure 7C-D).”</p><p>– We have better enumerated genes induced by CHIR in Passage 3 ECs: In Figure 7—figure supplement 1, we have highlighted genes up- and down-regulated by CHIR in a format analogous to Figure 7; In Figure 7—figure supplement 2, we have identified genes encoding transcription factors, secreted proteins, and transmembrane proteins that are consistently CHIR-upregulated at Passage 1 and Passage 3.</p><p>From Results: “In Passage 3 ECs, many of the CHIR-mediated gene expression changes observed at Passage 1 persisted, including <italic>SLC2A1</italic>, <italic>LSR</italic>, <italic>LEF1</italic>, <italic>AXIN2</italic>, <italic>APCDD1</italic>, <italic>ZIC3</italic>, <italic>EBF1</italic>, <italic>FLVCR2</italic> and <italic>ABCG2</italic> upregulation and <italic>PLVAP</italic> downregulation (Figure 7E; Figure 7—figure supplement 1). […] Conversely, <italic>JAM2</italic>, which encodes junctional adhesion molecule 2, a component of EC tight junctions (Aurrand-Lions et al., 2001; Tietz and Engelhardt, 2015), was upregulated by CHIR at Passage 3, but not at Passage 1, as was the retinol-binding protein-encoding gene <italic>RBP1</italic> (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>– We used Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis to identify highly correlated gene modules with EC passage number and CHIR treatment (Figure 7—figure supplement 3). Importantly, this analysis complements gene-by-gene differential expression analysis by (a) demonstrating that genes central to the module that strongly correlates with CHIR treatment are canonical targets of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, (b) identifying novel genes that strongly correlate with these known targets, and (c) demonstrating that CHIR treatment and passage number have distinct effects on the transcriptome as a whole despite some concordantly regulated genes (e.g., <italic>CLDN5</italic> and <italic>PLVAP</italic>).</p><p>From Results: “We used Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) (Zhang and Horvath, 2005; Langfelder and Horvath, 2008) to identify modules containing genes with highly correlated expression across the 14 EC samples (Figure 7—figure supplement 3A; Supplementary file 3). […] Further, despite some similarly-regulated genes between the passage number and CHIR treatment comparisons (e.g., <italic>CLDN5, CAV1</italic>, <italic>PLVAP</italic>), the transcriptional responses to these two experimental variables were globally distinct as assessed by gene correlation network analysis (Figure 7—figure supplement 3B).”</p><p>– We have performed enrichment analysis to identify pathways that may be upstream of observed transcriptional changes upon CHIR treatment at passage 1 and 3. We have also performed this analysis on literature data from pituitary ECs to investigate how pathways induced by CHIR-mediated inhibition of GSK-3 might differ from pathways induced by direct stabilization of β-catenin (described in additional detail below under point 2.) These data are in Figure 8—figure supplement 2 and Supplementary file 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Moreover, the authors should investigate other pathways induced by CHIR (GSK3 substrates; Akt, IκB-α, presenilin etc.) in comparison with dominant-active β-catenin.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to compare pathways induced by CHIR (in our system) versus stabilized β-catenin (literature data). For stabilized β-catenin, we focused on the RNA-seq data from the mouse pituitary EC system, as this system demonstrated the strongest transcriptional response to β-catenin stabilization (compared to mouse liver ECs and cultured mouse brain ECs). We tested lists of CHIR- and β-catenin-upregulated genes against the Hallmark gene set collection, a curated database of high-confidence links between genes and potential upstream biological processes and signaling pathways. Complete results are shown in Figure 8—figure supplement 2 and Supplementary file 5, and are summarized in the Results section. Briefly, we found that multiple signaling pathways (including <italic>Wnt/β-catenin signaling</italic>, <italic>Notch signaling</italic>, <italic>TNFα signaling via NF-κB</italic>, <italic>KRAS signaling up</italic>) were enriched in both CHIR-treated and β-catenin-stabilized systems. A key potential difference is enrichment of the <italic>PI3K AKT mTOR signaling</italic> gene set in Passage 1 CHIR-treated ECs; such enrichment is not present in pituitary ECs with β-catenin-stabilization, or Passage 3 CHIR-treated ECs. This result may suggest that CHIR transiently activates the AKT/mTOR pathway. Overall, however, the strong and persistent enrichment of the <italic>Wnt/β-catenin signaling</italic> gene set in CHIR-treated ECs at both Passage 1 and 3 (along with upregulation of canonical transcriptional targets of β-catenin, the centrality of such canonical transcriptional targets in gene correlation network analysis, and the attenuation of GLUT-1 induction with <italic>CTNNB1</italic> knockdown), support the notion that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a central mediator of our observed phenotypes. We agree that other GSK-3 targets may participate, and believe a direct comparison of CHIR treatment and β-catenin stabilization in the hPSC-derived EC system could be informative in the future. Finally, we note that β-catenin stabilization is also an imperfect mimic of Wnt ligand-induced signaling, as ligand-induced signaling also involves GSK-3 inhibition; this further motivates future work using Wnt ligands and the endogenous Wnt receptors and intracellular transduction machinery.</p><p>From Results: “Last, because GSK-3 is a component of numerous signaling pathways in addition to Wnt/β-catenin (Eto et al., 2005; Beurel et al., 2015; Hermida et al., 2017), we used RNA-seq data to infer pathways that might be differentially regulated by the two strategies for activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling employed in the experiments above: CHIR treatment, which increases β-catenin stability by inhibiting GSK-3, or direct stabilization of β-catenin. […] Differences in other aspects of these two experimental paradigms (in vitro versus in vivo, naïve versus CNS-proximal, human versus mouse), however, caution against over-interpretation of these results.”</p><p>From Discussion: “CHIR is widely used to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cell culture (Lian et al., 2012, 2014; Patsch et al., 2015; Sakaguchi et al., 2015; Gomez et al., 2019; Pellegrini et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021). It remains unknown, however, to what extent CHIR-mediated inhibition of GSK-3 in ECs mimics the effects of Wnt ligand-induced inhibition of GSK-3 or direct stabilization of β-catenin. In our system, although the GLUT-1-inductive effect of CHIR was partially inhibited by β-catenin knockdown and our RNA-seq data revealed a transcriptional response characteristic of canonical Wnt signaling, it is possible that CHIR affects other signaling pathways, as suggested by pathway enrichment analysis. Thus, employing ligand-based strategies to activate Wnt signaling will be an important next step. […] Finally, it would also be informative to directly compare CHIR and/or Wnt ligand treatment to direct stabilization of β-catenin in this system, for example, by generating a hPSC line with inducible expression of a dominant active β-catenin.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given that the mechanistic insight in the discrepancies between the stimulations with CHIR and Wnt7a/b, as well as with conditioned medium from neurospheres and astrocytes is limited, the authors should omit these data and add this approach to the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now removed these data from the manuscript and instead added a paragraph summarizing these approaches to the Discussion. While Wnt7a/b and conditioned media treatment are rational and important approaches, we agree that there are many potential explanations for their lack of efficacy (lack of ligand bioactivity, lack of necessary cell-cell contact, lack of ligand accumulation in the medium, lack of necessary receptor machinery on endothelial progenitors). We also agree that further mechanistic examination of this phenomena should be the subject of future work.</p><p>From Discussion: “CHIR is widely used to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cell culture (Lian et al., 2012, 2014; Patsch et al., 2015; Sakaguchi et al., 2015; Gomez et al., 2019; Pellegrini et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021). […] Importantly, neural progenitor cells and astrocytes likely would also contribute other yet-unidentified ligands important for acquisition of CNS EC phenotype.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should clearly delineate the aim of the study that, as perceived by the reviewers, appears to be the characterization of the Wnt pathway effects on directing human pluripotent stem cells toward the differentiation to a BBB endothelium.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion to clarify the aim of the study. We have reworded the thesis statement in the final paragraph of the introduction to better convey the goal of the work:</p><p>From Introduction: “In this work, we aimed to define the effects of activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling in hPSC-derived, naïve endothelial progenitors and assess the extent to which this strategy would drive development of a CNS EC-like phenotype.”</p><p>Statements in the Abstract and Discussion also emphasize this overarching aim:</p><p>From Abstract: “Together, our work defines effects of Wnt activation in naïve ECs and establishes an improved hPSC-based model for interrogation of CNS barriergenesis.”</p><p>From Discussion: “In this work, we investigated the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling on induction of BBB properties in a human EC model, using naïve endothelial progenitors derived from hPSCs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While this paper may be a worthwhile method development paper (as published in PLoS One, Science Reports or Microvascular research; eg. Cecchelli 2014 doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0099733; Linville 2020 doi: 10.1016/j.mvr.2020.104042), it lacks scientific novelty and depth required for a publication in eLife.</p><p>Numerous papers have identified Wnt3a for mesoderm induction and Wnt7a as the major brain EC ligand, and the use of a chemical GSK-3 inhibitor for more powerful Wnt signaling pathway activation is not novel or surprising. Indeed many other models and Wnt-pathway response papers have been published, numerous in the last two years (e.g. Laksitorini et al., Sci Rep 2019 9(1):19718. &quot;Modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes blood-brain barrier phenotype in cultured brain endothelial cells&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a substantial body of previous research has demonstrated the ability of Wnt signaling to both induce mesoderm differentiation and to induce EC BBB properties, and that many previously reported methods have used GSK-3 inhibition as a Wnt activation strategy. We wish, however, to emphasize the novelty of our work in applying Wnt activation to achieve a BBB-like phenotype in hPSC-derived definitive ECs, and in comprehensively profiling the resulting transcriptome and other aspects of cellular phenotype.</p><p>Several previous papers have examined the effects of Wnt activation in immortalized ECs (Laksitorini et al.,) or hematopoietic stem cell-derived ECs (Cecchelli et al.,). In contrast to these cell sources, hPSCs offer the opportunity to track EC differentiation along the entire developmental trajectory, and probe temporal aspects of Wnt activation (discussed further below). We have clarified this point in the Introduction:</p><p>From Introduction: “Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer an in vitro human model system for systematic investigation of molecular mechanisms of BBB phenotype acquisition, especially given their ability to model early stages of endothelial specification and differentiation.”</p><p>The few papers that have attempted Wnt activation in hPSC-derived ECs have not isolated the effects of Wnt and/or performed comprehensive analysis of Wnt-mediated changes. For example, Linville et al., evaluated Wnt7a only in combination with VEGF, and then only on “sprouting” and not on BBB phenotype. Praça et al., demonstrated a slight impact of Wnt3a on permeability, but analyzed protein/gene expression changes with Wnt3a in combination with VEGF or VEGF and retinoic acid. Further, none of the above works have used RNA-sequencing to comprehensively profile the Wnt-regulated EC transcriptome. Other hPSC-derived BBB models for which RNA-seq data are available do not address the impact of Wnt signaling on the transcriptome, do not proceed through definitive endothelial progenitors, and have an underlying epithelial gene signature (Vatine et al., 2017, <italic>Cell Stem Cell</italic>; Qian et al., 2017, <italic>Sci Adv</italic>).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first report that activation of Wnt signaling in hPSC-derived ECs can partially achieve BBB phenotype. We further suggest that our transcriptome data defining Wnt-regulated genes, and importantly, BBB-associated genes not regulated by Wnt, will be an important addition to the literature for those studying human BBB development and those wishing to continue to improve our ability to recapitulate the BBB in the dish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition one major claim of archievement is the analysis of EC maturity linked to Wnt-responsiveness. However, it has already been shown that there is a crucial timing difference in the responsiveness to Wnt signals both in vivo and in vitro (including, but not at all limited to the following examples: Hübner et al., Nat commun 2018 Nov 19;9(1):4860 &quot;Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates VE-cadherin-mediated anastomosis of brain capillaries by counteracting S1pr1 signaling&quot;; Corada et al., Circ Res 2019 124(4):511-525 &quot;Fine-Tuning of Sox17 and Canonical Wnt Coordinates the Permeability Properties of the Blood-Brain Barrier&quot;).</p><p>Additionally many of the mentioned examples not only analyze the contribution of WNT signaling, but also link other signaling pathways, whereas this paper identifies other but unknown signaling contributions for establishing ECs with full BBB properties.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and we have now expanded the Discussion to incorporate these concepts and citations. We note that these reports have primarily characterized the endogenous temporal profile of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the context of CNS angiogenesis and barriergenesis, and used loss of function approaches (e.g., dominant negative TCF, IWR-1 treatment) to identify timepoints during normal CNS vascular development at which Wnt/β-catenin is necessary for specific phenotypes. A major conclusion is that the level of Wnt/β-catenin in CNS ECs peaks early in development and subsequently declines, but this result does not directly address the <italic>competence</italic> of ECs to respond to Wnt signals, which varies across different contexts, including time (embryo versus adult), organ (CNS versus CNS-proximal versus non-CNS), and in vitro versus in vivo (e.g., Munji et al., 2019, <italic>Nat Neurosci</italic>; Wang et al., 2019, <italic>eLife</italic>; Sabbagh et al., 2020, <italic>eLife</italic>). To address this gap in understanding of the role of Wnt/β-catenin in imparting BBB properties to ECs, we performed gain of function experiments by activating Wnt/β-catenin with CHIR at different timepoints during the hPSC differentiation to ECs, and found that early ECs were more responsive than those after extended culture. As discussed above, hPSCs are particularly well suited to this type of longitudinal analysis; we further contend that this treatment paradigm is novel and that the results will be a useful contribution to the literature.</p><p>From Discussion: “Thus, our results support this hypothesis and suggest that the loss of BBB developmental plasticity in ECs is an intrinsic, temporally-controlled process rather than a result of the peripheral organ environment. The molecular mechanisms underlying this loss of plasticity remain poorly understood. While previous studies have demonstrated that the level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CNS ECs peaks early in development and subsequently declines (Corada et al., 2018; Hübner et al., 2018), this finding does not address mechanisms underlying the competence of ECs (CNS and non-CNS) to respond to Wnt signals. In RNA-seq data of Passage 3 control (DMSO-treated) ECs, <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>TCF7</italic> were strongly downregulated compared to Passage 1 cells. This result suggests that low baseline expression of these transcription factors, which form a complex with nuclear β-catenin to regulate Wnt target genes, may partially explain the poor efficacy of CHIR in matured ECs, although additional work is necessary to assess functional relevance of these differences.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the lack of novelty and the following mentioned difficulties of biological sample variations, I do not recommend the paper for publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the above description of novelty and impact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>Figure 1 shows more than factor2 differences between different differentiation samples (in terms of glut-1 positive cells), making this a less robust model than indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the percentage of GLUT-1<sup>+</sup> ECs resulting from Wnt3a treatment appears to differ between the two differentiations performed; in each case, however, Wnt3a significantly increased the percentage of GLUT-1<sup>+</sup> ECs over control (Differentiation 1, control: 1.3±0.4%, Wnt3a: 9.1±1.0%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.00028, Student’s <italic>t</italic> test; Differentiation 2, control: 0.5±0.3%, Wnt3a: 2.9±0.4%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.00096, Student’s <italic>t</italic> test). We feel it is important to present both differentiations to provide a realistic picture of expected variability, which, unlike with immortalized cell lines, is an inherent aspect of hPSC differentiation. We also believe that this variability, as well as the small proportion of GLUT-1<sup>+</sup> ECs elicited by Wnt3a treatment, motivates our subsequent use of CHIR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The overall percentage of Glut-1 positive cells in Figure 1 and 2 is very low, making the comparison between the effectiveness of the different ligands while statistically significant compared to the control, most likely not significant compared between the ligands. Therefore the claims of e.g. Wnt7a being more effective is based on one of 3 samples of the same differentiation. All these comaparative claims will have to be either supported by much more data or taken out. The only clear result is that CHIR can stimulate expression of Glut-1 in around 90% of the cells, whereas the offered Wnt ligands affect 2-4%. To me this suggests that soluble WNT ligands in the culture medium are least effective in stimulating a response. It would have been most interesting to explore if co-cultures and hence the supply in e.g. Cytonems or other vesicle or membrane-bound delivery systems would make a huge difference. However this is not the scope of the paper.The analysis of mean fluorescence intensity of claudin-5, caveolin-1, and GLUT-1 normalized to Hoechst mean fluorescence intensity within the area of claudin-5+ ECs only is less informative, as one highly expressing cell will outweigh many low expressing cells and there is no published link of an endothelial cell resembling a BBB endothelial cells more closely in correlation with their Glut-1 expression intensity.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed under “Essential Revisions” point 3, we have removed data on Wnt7a/b from the manuscript and instead focus now in Figure 2 on the effect of CHIR. Because CHIR induces GLUT-1 expression in ~90% of ECs, and images do not indicate substantial heterogeneity in claudin-5 or caveolin-1 immunofluorescence across ECs, we believe mean fluorescence intensity within EC colonies is a reasonable metric for comparison of the DMSO and CHIR conditions. We have added replicates from several additional differentiations to Figure 2 to accurately convey robustness of these effects. Moreover, the protein level increases are also quantified in Figure 4 and are concordant with those determined by quantitative image analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unfortunately, when analysing the effects of conditioned media in Figure3 only those relative quantifications were used and again the spread between the two different differentiation rounds was so high, that a comparative analysis is hindered and not represented by statistical analysis compared to control only. For example the Caveolin/Hoest values of the orange dataset were increased in the CHIR treatment, but unchanged in Control and NR-CM, but in contrast in the green dataset the NR-CM resulted in a higher index compared to CHIR or the control. Again were no statistical comparison was done between samples, the drawn conclusions can not indicate there are any.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the discrepancy between two differentiations in the conditioned medium-elicited changes in caveolin-1 (and claudin-5) fluorescence intensity motivates additional replication of these treatments. As discussed under “Essential Revisions” point 3, we have removed the conditioned medium data from this manuscript and will instead address this in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 Anal;yses the effect of passage number in combination with CHIR treatment.

We recognize that the color scheme may have implied this, and we have adjusted the colors accordingly. Thus, quantitative comparison of data in panels B and D is not possible.

In a direct comparison of GLUT-1 fluorescence intensity in ECs from the same differentiation, CHIR treatment initiated at the early timepoint (D5; “Passage 0”) led to a ~70-fold increase, while no statistically significant increase was observed when treatment was carried out at Passage 4. Similarly, CHIR-mediated increases in EC number and claudin-5 abundance were observed when treatment was carried out at D5, but not when treatment was carried out at Passage 4. These results strengthen the conclusion that EC responsiveness to Wnt activation decreases with extended culture.</p><p>From Results: “To test this hypothesis, we matured hPSC-derived ECs in vitro for 4 passages (until approximately day 30) prior to initiating CHIR treatment for 6 days, and compared the resulting cells to differentiation-matched samples treated with CHIR immediately after MACS (Figure 6A). Both Passage 1 DMSO-treated ECs and Passage 5 DMSO-treated ECs, which are analogous to EECM-BMEC-like cells we previously reported (Nishihara et al., 2020), did not have detectable GLUT-1 expression (Figure 6B). Compared to DMSO controls, the CHIR-treated Passage 5 ECs exhibited no increase in GLUT-1 abundance (Figure 6B-D), which contrasts with the marked increase observed when CHIR treatment was initiated immediately after MACS (Figure 6B-D). Furthermore, CHIR treatment in matured ECs did not increase claudin-5 expression and did not increase EC number (Figure 6B-D), in contrast to the increases observed in both properties when treatment was initiated immediately after MACS (Figure 6B-D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Although I have a positive opinion on the manuscript, I personally think that the manuscript could be slightly simplified (and shorten).

We do not believe the two goals described by the reviewer are mutually exclusive, however, and we would suggest that others consider this hPSC-based definitive EC in vitro model system for future studies of CNS EC barriergenesis.</p><p>From Introduction: “In this work, we aimed to define the effects of activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling in hPSC-derived, naïve endothelial progenitors and assess the extent to which this strategy would drive development of a CNS EC-like phenotype.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following critical points are related to this first issue because the that</p><p>The authors show that the treatment with Wnt7a and in particular with Wnt7b only show little or even no effects on Wnt pathway activation (Figure 8—figure supplement 1 B; no AXIN2 induction by Wnt7a/7b!!) and induction of BBB characteristics. It would be important to further investigate this topic to clearly demonstrate that Wnt7a/7b indeed are functional as recombinant proteins in the described experimental setting. Wnt7 has been shown to be only little diffusible, requiring the direct contact of the sending cell to the receiving cells (Eubelen, M. et al., Science (New York, NY) 361, eaat1178, 2018). Therefore, the authors should elaborate on an experimental setting to stimulate the naïve endothelial progenitors with Wnt7a/7b in a paracrine manner. This would help to clarify the question regarding the discrepancy between the CHIR and the Wnt7a treatment.</p><p>Essentially, the same critique can be raised concerning the treatment with conditioned medium from neuroblast rosettes and astrocytes. Although both may express Wnt7a/7b, specifically these Wnts may not accumulate in the CM and hence, the effects may be minor.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the lack of upregulation of canonical transcriptional targets (e.g., <italic>AXIN2</italic>, <italic>LEF1</italic>) in the RNA-seq data of Wnt7a/b-treated ECs is strong evidence that these ligands are not effective in activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling in this system. As described under “Essential Revisions” point 3, we have thus removed these data from the paper. In the Discussion, we have also added suggestions of coculture-based strategies that may mitigate the poor solubility/diffusability of Wnt ligands:</p><p>From Discussion: “Given evidence that Wnt ligands have poor solubility (Janda et al., 2012) and our preliminary data suggesting that supplementation of culture medium with Wnt7a and Wnt7b is largely ineffective in activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling in this system, special emphasis should be placed on strategies that present Wnt7a, Wnt7b, and/or Norrin in a manner that concentrates ligands at the cell surface, for example, by using direct cocultures of endogenously Wnt-producing cells (neural progenitors or astrocytes) or Wnt-overexpressing cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 16, line 359-363: The assumption made in the sentence “Upon recombination, the Ctnnb1 flex3 allele produces a dominant mutant β-catenin lacking residues that are phosphorylated by GSK-3β to target β-catenin for degradation (Harada et al., 1999); as such, this strategy for ligand- and receptor-independent Wnt activation by β-catenin stabilization is directly analogous to CHIR treatment.&quot; might be wrong, as blocking GSK3beta potentially has many other effects than “just&quot; activating β-catenin-mediated transcription!! The authors should discuss this topic in more depth.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reworded the sentence to clarify this important difference between the two approaches, and added additional data analysis and discussion of this topic to both the Results and Discussion sections (as discussed above under “Essential Revisions” point 2).</p><p>From Results: “this strategy for ligand- and receptor-independent Wnt activation by β-catenin stabilization is similar to CHIR treatment, although GSK-3 phosphorylates targets other than β-catenin (discussed below).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the highlight of the present manuscript is the inducibility of naïve endothelial progenitors by CHIR compared to differentiated endothelial cells.

Although we do not have RNA-seq data perfectly matched to these two time points, we can use our RNA-seq data of Passage 1 and Passage 3 control (DMSO-treated) ECs as a surrogate for this comparison. We found marked downregulation of <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>TCF7</italic> at Passage 3, and suggest this as a possible explanation for the attenuated CHIR-responsiveness of matured ECs. We have added these data to Figure 7—figure supplement 4 and to the Results section. We also added this observation to the Discussion section and clearly highlighted the imperfect nature of the comparison and the need for additional follow-up studies:</p><p>From Results: “We also evaluated transcript-level expression of components of the Wnt signaling pathway in Passage 3 control (DMSO-treated) ECs as a first step towards understanding the relative lack of responsiveness observed when CHIR treatment was initiated in matured (Passage 4) ECs (Figure 7—figure supplement 4). While <italic>CTNNB1</italic>, <italic>GSK3B</italic>, and genes encoding components of the destruction complex were not significantly different between Passage 3 and Passage 1, <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>TCF7</italic> were strongly downregulated in Passage 3 cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 4B).”</p><p>From Discussion: “In RNA-seq data of Passage 3 control (DMSO-treated) ECs, <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>TCF7</italic> were strongly downregulated compared to Passage 1 cells. This result suggests that low baseline expression of these transcription factors, which form a complex with nuclear β-catenin to regulate Wnt target genes, may partially explain the poor efficacy of CHIR in matured ECs, although additional work is necessary to assess the functional relevance of these differences.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
