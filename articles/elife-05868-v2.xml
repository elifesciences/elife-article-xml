In plants, the encapsulating cell wall literally binds neighbouring cells to each other and limits cellular sliding/migration. In contrast to its developmental importance, growth regulation is poorly understood in plants. Here, we reveal that the phytohormone auxin impacts on the shape of the biggest plant organelle, the vacuole. TIR1/AFBs-dependent auxin signalling posttranslationally controls the protein abundance of vacuolar SNARE components. Genetic and pharmacological interference with the auxin effect on vacuolar SNAREs interrelates with auxin-resistant vacuolar morphogenesis and cell size regulation. Vacuolar SNARE VTI11 is strictly required for auxin-reliant vacuolar morphogenesis and loss of function renders cells largely insensitive to auxin-dependent growth inhibition. Our data suggests that the adaptation of SNARE-dependent vacuolar morphogenesis allows auxin to limit cellular expansion, contributing to root organ growth rates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05868.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05868.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05868.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In plants and animals, the way that cells grow is carefully controlled to enable tissues and organs to form and be maintained. This is especially important in plants because the cells are attached to each other by their cell walls. This means that, unlike some animal cells, plant cells are not able to move around as a plant's organs develop.</p><p>Plant cells contain a large storage compartment called the vacuole, which occupies 30–80% of a cell's volume. The volume of the vacuole increases as the cell increases in size, and some researchers have suggested that the vacuole might help to control cell growth. A plant hormone called auxin can alter the growth of plant cells. However, this hormone's effect depends on the position of the cell in the plant; for example, it inhibits the growth of root cells, but promotes the growth of cells in the shoots and leaves. Nevertheless, it is not clear precisely how auxin controls plant cell growth.</p><p>Here, Löfke et al. studied the effect of auxin on the appearance of vacuoles in a type of plant cell—called the root epidermal cell—on the surface of the roots of a plant called <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The experiments show that auxin alters the appearance of the vacuoles in these cells so they become smaller in size. At the same time, auxin also inhibits the growth of these cells.</p><p>Löfke et al. found that auxin increases the amount of certain proteins in the membrane that surrounds the vacuole. These proteins belong to the SNARE family and one SNARE protein in particular, called VTI11, is required for auxin to be able to both alter the appearance of the vacuoles and restrict the growth of root epidermal cells. Enzymes called PI4 kinases were also shown to be involved in the control of the SNARE proteins in response to the auxin hormone.</p><p>Löfke et al.'s findings suggest that auxin restricts the growth of root epidermal cells by controlling the amount of SNARE proteins in the vacuole membrane. The next challenge will be to understand precisely how the shape of the vacuole is controlled and how it contributes to cell growth.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05868.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05868.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>vacuole</kwd><kwd>cell size</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001821</institution-id><institution>Vienna Science and Technology Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vienna Research Group</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kleine-Vehn</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>postdoctoral fellowships</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Löfke</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name><name><surname>Scheuring</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P26568-B16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kleine-Vehn</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P26591-B16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kleine-Vehn</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Vacuolar morphologenesis correlates with cell size and is required for auxin-dependent inhibition of growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Symplastic growth, characterised by cells that do not alter their relative position to each other, is typical in plant tissue expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Priestley, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erickson, 1986</xref>). Such development implies supra-cellular (above the level of single cells) regulation, which has an enormous impact on cellular growth control for plant patterning. Despite their importance, molecular mechanisms that restrict cellular and tissue growth are poorly understood in plants.</p><p>The phytohormone auxin is a crucial growth regulator and central in differential growth processes. TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESISTANT1 (TIR1) and its homologs AUXIN F-BOX PROTEINS (AFBs) have been unequivocally demonstrated to be auxin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dharmasiri et al., 2005a</xref>). Genomic auxin responses are initiated by auxin binding to TIR1/AFBs, promoting its interaction with proteins of the AUXIN/INDOLE ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) family. Auxin-dependent formation of such a co-receptor pair triggers the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Aux/IAA proteins. In the absence of auxin, Aux/IAAs form inhibitory heterodimers with AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) family transcription factors. Thus, auxin-dependent Aux/IAA degradation leads to the release of ARF transcription factors and subsequent transcriptional responses (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Quint and Gray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sauer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, auxin-signalling events promote and inhibit cellular growth in a cell-type- and auxin concentration-dependent manner. Physiological auxin levels induce growth in light grown aerial tissues, while most root tissues show growth repression in response to the very same auxin concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sauer et al., 2013</xref>). The ‘acid growth’ theory proposes that auxin causes extracellular acidifications and subsequent cell wall remodelling, ultimately driving turgor-dependent cellular expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sauer and Kleine-Vehn, 2011</xref>). This theory is based on tissues showing auxin-dependent growth induction. In contrast, relatively little is known of how auxin inhibits cellular growth in other tissues.</p><p>The higher plant vacuole is, due to its size, the most prominent plant organelle, and shares its lytic function with its counterparts in yeast and animal lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Marty, 1999</xref>). It may likewise be hypothesised that multifunctional plant vacuoles also contribute to cellular size regulation, as the volume of vacuoles correlates with individual cell size in plant cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Owens and Poole, 1979</xref>). The root epidermis is a suitable model to study such processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Löfke et al., 2013</xref>), because it is regularly spaced into shorter tricho- and longer atrichoblast cell files in the late meristematic zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 1998</xref>), which intriguingly, show smaller and larger vacuolar structures, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Löfke et al., 2013</xref>).

To allow cellular development under high auxin conditions, we exogenously applied synthetic auxin, 1-naphtylacetic acid (NAA), in nanomolar ranges for 20 hr and screened for subcellular effects that showed differential regulation in neighbouring cells. Remarkably, exogenous application of auxin (NAA [250 nM]) or endogenous elevation of YUCCA-dependent auxin biosynthesis led to a dramatic change in vacuolar appearance in root epidermal cells, which consequently displayed smaller luminal vacuolar structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,E,F</xref>).</p><p>We established a vacuolar morphology index in epidermal cells based on the biggest luminal structure to further evaluate the apparent auxin effect on vacuolar shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis revealed that high auxin conditions affect vacuolar structures, particularly in atrichoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,G</xref>). Adversely, pharmacological depletion of auxin caused visibly larger vacuolar structures in both cell types, but was more pronounced in trichoblasts (relative to the untreated control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C,D</xref>).</p><p>This data shows that auxin differentially affects vacuolar shape in neighbouring epidermal cells.</p><p>Notably, the differential effect of auxin on vacuoles correlated exactly with a differential effect on cellular size. High auxin levels reduced the cell length of atrichoblast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,E,F,H,I</xref>), whereas cell lengths of the smaller trichoblasts were not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,E,F,H,I</xref>). Conversely, pharmacological reduction in auxin biosynthesis mainly increased the cell length in trichoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C,H</xref>).</p><p>Our data shows that the auxin effect on vacuolar morphology correlates with its negative effect on late meristematic epidermal cell size. Auxin treatments manifestly did not reverse vacuolar morphology of fully elongated epidermal root cells in the differentiation zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This finding suggests that auxin mainly shapes vacuoles in growth competent cells.</p><p>Next we investigated the auxin effect on vacuoles in the course of time. As the auxin effect on vacuoles was most pronounced in atrichoblasts, we focused our analysis (from here onwards) mainly on this cell-type. Notably, auxin imposed in time steadily increasing effects on vacuolar appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Auxin induced detectable changes in vacuolar morphology already after 15–30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Proximity of adjacent membrane allows the interaction of v (vesicle)- and t (target)-SNAREs to form a complex, allowing the fusion of vesicles to specific target membranes. SNAREs are essential for eukaryotic vesicle trafficking and according to structural features SNAREs are divided in R (arginine)- and Q (glutamine)-SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Martens and McMahon, 2008</xref>). In yeast, the SNARE complex is furthermore central in homotypic vacuolar membrane remodelling and proteomic approaches have identified conserved SNARE complexes at the plant tonoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carter et al., 2004</xref>). Ergo, we tested whether auxin affects vacuolar SNAREs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Remarkably, increased auxin biosynthesis or exogenous application of auxin increased the fluorescence intensity of tonoplast localised SNAREs, such as VAMP711-YFP, SYP21-YFP and SYP22-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–L,N,O</xref>). Auxin severely impacts on vacuolar appearance and, hence, it could be that membrane crowding induces higher fluorescence. To address this question we performed co-localisation of VAMP711-RFP/YFP and membrane dyes, such as FM4-64 and MDY-64. Notably, VAMP711-RFP/YFP, but not the membrane dyes showed auxin-induced signal intensities, suggesting that the auxin effect on vacuolar SNAREs does not rely on membrane crowding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05868.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Auxin posttranslationally stabilises tonoplast localised SNAREs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>L</bold>) Tonoplast localised SNAREs and marker protein NET4A under high auxin conditions. <italic>pUBQ10::VAMP711-YFP</italic> (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>), <italic>35S::SYP21-YFP</italic> (<bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>), <italic>SYP22::SYP22-GFP</italic> (in <italic>syp22</italic>) (<bold>E</bold> and <bold>F</bold>) and <italic>NET4A::NET4A-GFP</italic> (<bold>G</bold> and <bold>H</bold>) expressing seedlings treated with DMSO (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>C</bold>, <bold>E</bold>, <bold>G</bold>) or NAA (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>D</bold>, <bold>F</bold>, <bold>H</bold>) (500 nM; 20 hr).

Surprisingly, little is actually known about mechanisms controlling vacuolar morphology and whether the vacuoles are indeed involved in growth regulation. Plant vacuoles, inter alia, are claimed to be important cellular osmoregulators, and accordingly, have been hypothesised as contributing to turgor-dependent cellular growth induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Marty, 1999</xref>). This may explain the correlation between vacuolarisation with cellular size. Though appealing, also this hypothesis awaits experimental validation. Hence, the potential role of auxin in turgor regulation should also be carefully assessed. Just such a role has been insinuated in recent papers related to lateral root emergence. Auxin responses have been reported to reduce cellular pressure in cell files facing lateral root primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peret et al., 2012</xref>) and vacuolar morphology alterations have been recently described in endodermal tissues during lateral root emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peret et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vermeer et al., 2014</xref>). However, these proposed auxin responses are not related to cellular growth regulation and it remains to be seen whether the auxin impact on vacuolar morphology described here is related to interference with turgor pressure.</p><p>Here we show that auxin controls the overall vacuolar morphology. Several pieces of independent evidence suggest that the modulation of the vacuolar SNAREs allows the phytohormone auxin to limit cellular growth. Future studies will further assess the precise molecular role of vacuolar SNAREs in shaping the plant vacuole. Auxin impacts on vacuolar SNAREs in a posttranslational manner and it is tempting to speculate that auxin could impose a conformational change on the SNARE complex, possibly affecting its stability and activity. Accordingly, the auxin effect on vacuolar SNAREs could impact on homotypic vacuolar fusion events, leading to smaller luminal structures. Alternatively, also a structural role of SNAREs has been envisioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Sansebastiano, 2013</xref>), which could be yet another mechanism to impact on vacuolar organisation. Notably, a recent study suggested that most vacuolar structures are interconnected within an untreated cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Viotti et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, it needs to be seen how precisely auxin impacts on vacuolar morphology and whether these structures are still interconnected in high auxin conditions.</p><p>We assume that auxin utilises the plant vacuole as a cellular effector to restrict cellular expansion. Hence, we conclude that previous correlative observations on cell size and vacuolar morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Owens and Poole, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Löfke et al., 2013</xref>) may not reflect that vacuoles drive growth, but rather rely on a vacuole-dependent cellular mechanism that limits growth.</p><p>Our data extends the current view of auxin biology, suggesting that auxin coordinates extracellular and intracellular components, such as cell wall acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sauer and Kleine-Vehn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spartz et al., 2014</xref>) and vacuolar morphogenesis, for driving and restricting cellular growth. In this light, the luminal increase of plant vacuoles alone may not be sufficient to induce larger cell sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) due to cell wall limitations. In contrast, limiting cellular vacuolarisation appears sufficient to restrict cellular growth. Such a dual growth mechanism would allow plants to dynamically de- and accelerate cellular expansion, integrating multiple distinct, possibly conflictive internal and external triggers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material, growth conditions and DNA constructs</title><p>We used <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> of ecotype <italic>Columbia 0</italic> (<italic>Col-0</italic>). <italic>vamp711</italic> (N673991), obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis stock centre and the decrease of <italic>VAMP711</italic> transcript was shown by RT-PCR.

Images were taken in the late meristematic zone (position shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The largest luminal structure in five tricho- and/or atrichoblast cells were quantified by measuring the longest to widest distance and processed by multiplying the values. Means and standard error were calculated and statistical significance was evaluated by the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test using graphpad (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/">http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/</ext-link>). Figures display a representative experiment (out of three independent repetitions) utilising eight individual roots. The cell length change in the late meristematic zone (position shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) was quantified in the median epidermal confocal section decorated with propidium iodide to visualise the cell wall. Cell length measurements in the late meristematic zone were performed in imageJ by quantifying the length of four tricho- and/or atrichoblast cells which were averaged. Means and standard error were calculated and statistical significance was evaluated by the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test using graphpad (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/">http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/</ext-link>). Figures show a representative experiment (out of three independent repetitions) utilising 10 individual roots. To estimate the position for the cell length measurements in the elongation zone, seedlings were stained in propidium iodide for 5 min and subsequently imaged choosing the position were no propidium iodide (0.02 mg/ml) entered the vasculature, showing fully developed endodermal diffusion barriers. Length measurements of epidermal root hair cells were performed in imageJ by quantifying the length of individual cells which were averaged.

Figures show a representative experiment (out of three independent repetitions) utilising 10 individual roots. In each root approximately three cells were quantified. For analysis of the root length, seedlings grown in vertically orientated plates were scanned on a flat-bed scanner and measurements were performed in imageJ. Per condition, 20–25 seedlings were analysed (for each experiment) 8 days after germination. Means and standard error were calculated and statistical significance was evaluated by the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test using graphpad (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/">http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/</ext-link>).

After centrifugation, 15 µl of the extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and blotted onto a 0.2 µm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (BioRad). After blocking with a solution of 5% skim milk powder in TBS-T (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM TRIS/HCl pH = 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20) the membrane was probed with an anti-GFP antibody (JL-8; Clontech; Takara Bio Europe, Japan) diluted 1:2000 in skim milk TBS-T solution or anti-alpha-tubulin (B-5-1-1; Sigma) diluted 1:50000 in skim milk TBS-T solution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Dianova, Germany) was employed as secondary antibody (1:20000). For detection, the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent detection reagent (Thermo scientific, MA, USA) was used. Three independent root samples were quantified with imageJ and normalized to alpha-tubulin, means and standard error were calculated and statistical significance was evaluated by the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test using graphpad (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/">http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/</ext-link>).

MDY-64 and FM4-64 staining was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheuring et al., 2015</xref>). For 3D imaging, epidermal cells were recorded with a step size of 1 µm with approximately 17–20 single images.

Your article has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, as well as a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you can see from their comments, the reviewers have substantive concerns regarding your work, and we would like to ask you to address them comprehensively. Especially:</p><p>1) Please pay particular attention to the issues raised by reviewer 1, regarding the quantification of your markers. This issue is at the very heart of your manuscript, and we consider that it must be resolved to render your work publishable. Western blots for the other fusion proteins might be one way to provide more evidence, along with the reviewer's suggestions.</p><p>2) Please also clarify the involvement of TIR1-type auxin signaling, which suggests that there must be a transcriptional effect in this regulation somewhere. If it is not directly targeting the SNARE expression, but something regulating it, then do the time scales allow the conclusion that the auxin regulation is nevertheless direct and not a secondary effect?</p><p>3) The mutants that you present appear to have largely been published, nevertheless we would like to see evidence that the effects you report are due to those mutations, i.e. that you do not observe them in transgenically complemented plants.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The authors describe an interesting series of experiments suggesting that auxin increases the abundance of the vacuolar SNARE protein VTI11 and leads to a contraction of the vacuole resulting in a complex multi-lobed structure. These two observations are linked by the fact that a non-functional mutant allele <italic>vti11</italic> does not support the formation of the compact multi-lobed structures. Overall, this paper could make an interesting contribution to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Critical points to be fixed:</p><p>The increase in VTI11 abundance in the analyzed cell types is not convincing. The authors show a strong increase in the signal of a YFP fusion protein upon NAA treatment and conclude that this means increased protein levels. This conclusion is challenged by the fact that artificial overexpression of VAMP711 did not influence vacuolar morphology and, more importantly, that the lipid marker MDY64 shows exactly the same NAA-induced increase in fluorescence as the VAMP11-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures. 1E, F</xref>). This draws the validity of the microscopic assessment of SNARE abundance into question, particularly because the authors showed similar NAA-dependent increases in the abundance for a number of other vacuolar SNAREs, and even for <italic>syp21</italic>, which is actually on a pre-vacuolar compartment. My concern is that the contraction of the vacuoles into compact structures might lead to erroneous measures of the fusion proteins, due to the fact that the authors evaluated only a single confocal section, probably through the center plane of these cells, rather than a stack of images covering the entire depth. A consequence could be that in cells with voluminous vacuoles much of the vacuolar membranes lies outside the confocal section and will not be measured. In the contracted state, a greater share of this membrane should be closer to the center of the cell, leading to an increase in the fluorescence in the single confocal section.</p><p>The authors could rule out that their results are artefacts by addressing several points:</p><p>1) Integrate the fluorescence signals of the various SNARE proteins through a stack of sections covering the entire cell.</p><p>2) Do the same analysis for the lipid marker MDY64 and discuss the strong effect observed.</p><p>3) Present negative controls that do not show an NAA-induced increase of fluorescence. YFP-fusions of other vacuolar membrane proteins should be analyzed.</p><p>4) Re-decorate the blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref> for several other vacuolar marker proteins in order to demonstrate specificity of the effect of VAMP11-YFP</p><p><italic>Minor comments</italic>:</p><p>Many experiments use a YFP-fusion of VAMP11 and the fluorescence emission of YFP is very sensitive to pH changes. The authors should at least provide good arguments indicating that NAA does not change the intracellular pH to which the YFP tag is exposed.</p><p>Are the fluorescent protein tags on the cytosolic or on the lumenal side of the membrane?</p><p>It is not self-evident how an increase in vacuolar SNAREs could lead to a collapse to the vacuoles into a very compact morphology. The Discussion would be more stimulating if it presented at least some speculations on this issue.</p><p>The vacuolar morphology index appears too simplified in order to represent the complex morphological changes in a meaningful way. It arbitrarily selects only the largest vacuole in the picture as a measure, leaving aside the many small and medium-sized structures. Given this, the statistical analysis of such results appears as formally correct but of questionable relevance. I would have preferred to see an analysis of the total vacuolar volume in these cells, which may be the parameter that is most relevant for cell expansion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>Löfke et al. use <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root epidermis to show how auxin controls growth of growth-competent cells via stabilising protein components of the SNARE complex, which in turn regulate vacuole morphology. A range of genetic and chemical approaches has been taken and the results generally support the conclusions made by the authors. The manuscript is well written and the unravelling of this auxin-dependent control of vacuole morphology and cell growth will be interesting to a wide audience of cell and developmental biologists not restricted to the plant field. Below are some points for the authors to address, not in any particular order.</p><p>In the subsection headed “Vacuolar SNARE function is required for the auxin-dependent modulation of vacuolar morphology”, paragraphs 1 and 2 could be made clearer. In the reference to the redundant action of SNARE components, the <italic>vti11</italic> mutant is mentioned as displaying roundish vacuoles. Does this mean that <italic>vti11</italic> is the only mutant in a SNARE-encoding gene that has a phenotype? Also it would be useful to explain earlier what it means that VTI11 is a Qb-SNARE (see point on SNARE background below). Finally, since the vacuole morphology is clearly different in the <italic>vti11</italic> mutant from that in wild type, it is puzzling why the authors indicate that the defects in SNARE-dependent vacuolar morphology regulation in <italic>vti11</italic> are relatively mild. Perhaps they mean that the altered vacuolar morphology in <italic>vti11</italic> has little effect on cell growth in A and T cells?</p><p>The authors explain in the discussion that lack of increased growth by WM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>) and in the atrichoblasts of the <italic>vti11</italic> mutant (Figure 5–figure supplement 2) could be due to cell wall limitations. I think they can expand their reasoning to include that the increased growth observed upon Kynurenin treatment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> suggests that auxin acts not only on SNAREs/vacuolar morphology, but may also restrict growth by inhibiting availability of cell wall components.</p><p>Along the same line, it seems to me a discussion could be included on coordination between tricholast and atrichoblast cell files as well as cell divisions within a cell file. For example, do any of the genetic and pharmological treatments lead to a difference in the ratio of trichoblasts:atrichoblasts in the meristematic zone or total number of cells?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figure 6 and 7</xref> could be amalgamated into one figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-D</xref> panels are identical to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-D</xref> panels except for the higher amount of NAA. Same goes for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F-I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G-J</xref>. I suggest adding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and 7J</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and turn <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-D, F-I</xref> into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>In the subsection headed “Auxin effect on vacuolar morphogenesis interrelates with auxin-dependent cellular growth inhibition” a paragraph describes the effect of VTI11 and PI4K activity on root epidermal cell length (elongation zone) and overall root growth. Two points: 1) It is mentioned in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> that trichoblasts were measured. Why not atrichoblasts? 2) It is surprising that WM treatment alone has a negative effect on growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). If anything, it would be expected to be positive. Can the authors explain this?</p><p><italic>Minor comments</italic>:</p><p>Some of the headings could be made more specific. For example, “Interference with the auxin effect on vacuolar SNAREs impedes auxin-dependent cell size control”, this heading should refer to the connection made with PI-dependent processes.</p><p>I appreciate that space is limiting, but the minimal background information on the SNARE complex makes it difficult to relate to their role in this process. A few additional sentences to introduce SNARE would be useful. For example: 1) one gets the impression that SNAREs only exist in yeast and plants, although they indeed are common to all multicellular eukaryotic organisms, 2) mention their function in controlling membrane fusion, and 3) it would be useful to let the reader know what they are composed of such that the reader is prepared for what the Qb-SNARE VTI11 is.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>This paper reports on the dramatic effect auxin can have on the shape of root tip cell vacuoles. The data indicate that via auxin receptors, auxin can regulate the abundance of vacuolar SNARES in particular the QbSNARE VTI11. The authors have quantified the effect by designing a vacuolar morphology index, so that they can compare vacuolar morphology in the various mutants and treated root tips. The method of quantification is relatively simple and crude but does effectively reflect the changes in vacuolar morphology which in some cases are visually very striking. I'm sure with time the group will develop better methods of assaying the changed in vacuolar morphology.</p><p>In general the study is well presented and the paper well written and is a substantial contribution to the field. I feel that the authors have been a little cautious in their Discussion and have made little attempt to hypothesis as to why a vacuolar SNARE may have such a dramatic effect on vacuolar morphology. It is difficult to tell if in some of the micrographs we are looking at many individual vacuoles which have not fused together due to lack of SNARE complexes or whether they are all interconnected but just change in morphology. A bit of speculation would be good.</p><p><italic>Minor comments</italic>:</p><p>In the beginning of the subsection headed “Vacuolar SNARE function is required for the auxin-dependent modulation of vacuolar morphology”, perhaps you need to introduce VTI11 here or at least put it in the section heading.</p><p>In the Discussion section, I really wonder whether turgor exerted by the vacuole in the root tip is important.

This issue is at the very heart of your manuscript, and we consider that it must be resolved to render your work publishable. Western blots for the other fusion proteins might be one way to provide more evidence, along with the reviewer's suggestions</italic>.</p><p>We thank particularly reviewer 1 for raising these concerns. We accordingly paid particular attention to the quantification of vacuolar SNAREs and performed several experiments. 1) We experimentally excluded that membrane crowding accounts for the observed increase in fluorescent intensity. 2) Moreover, we performed detailed z-stack imaging, confirming our previous single section results on auxin induced increase in cellular abundance of vacuolar SNAREs. 3) In agreement, we also performed additional western blots, confirming that auxin increases the abundance of several vacuolar SNARE proteins. 4) Finally, we included an additional vacuolar marker NET4a-GFP in all our experiments, which fluorescent intensity or protein abundance is not affected by auxin. This set of experiments illustrates that auxin affects SNARE abundance at the tonoplast.

We focused on the time scale of the auxin effect on vacuolar morphology as suggested. Accordingly, we emphasized on detailed time course experiments. First of all we reveal that the auxin effect on vacuolar morphology increases in time. Moreover, we could detect the first auxin induced morphological change of the vacuole within 15-30 minutes. This time frame is within in the time scale of fast genomic responses. Moreover, this finding also allowed us to illustrate that the auxin effect on vacuolar morphology preceded the auxin impact on cell size, which required ∼ 45 minutes. We included the data in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The mutants that you present appear to have largely been published, nevertheless we would like to see evidence that the effects you report are due to those mutations, i.e. that you do not observe them in transgenically complemented plants</italic>.</p><p>The interpretation of the <italic>vti11</italic> mutant phenotype is indeed central in our manuscript and, hence, we followed the suggestion, utilizing a functional pVTI11::VTI11-GFP construct to complement the <italic>vti11</italic> mutant phenotypes. Notably, VTI11-GFP expression in <italic>vti11</italic> mutant epidermal cells did not only rescue vacuolar morphology in untreated conditions, but also reversed auxin sensitivity in regards to vacuolar morphology and organ root growth.

To further guide the reader on the exact optical sectioning in our figures (position for quantifications of 2D images), we also included a 3D overview screen of the root and VAMP711-YFP distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Do the same analysis for the lipid marker MDY64 and discuss the strong effect observed</italic>.</p><p>We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and performed simultaneously image acquisition of VAMP711-Y/RFP and lipid markers MDY-64 and FM4-64.

The authors should at least provide good arguments indicating that NAA does not change the intracellular pH to which the YFP tag is exposed</italic>.</p><p>We are grateful for this comment and assume many readers will have similar concerns. Therefore, we included a discussion on this aspect in the revised version of the manuscript. In our experiments we used VAMP711 fusion proteins to RFP and YFP. RFP and YFP proteins have very distinct sensitivities to pH changes, but both fusion proteins showed comparable auxin induced increase in fluorescent intensity. Moreover, previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gjetting et al., 2012</xref>) suggested that exogenous application of auxin does not detectably affect cytosolic pH. Hence, we conclude that the observed effects are not likely related to changes in cytosolic pH.</p><p><italic>Are the fluorescent protein tags on the cytosolic or on the lumenal side of the membrane</italic>?</p><p>The fluorescent tags are facing the cytosol. This information is now included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>It is not self-evident how an increase in vacuolar SNAREs could lead to a collapse to the vacuoles into a very compact morphology. The Discussion would be more stimulating if it presented at least some speculations on this issue</italic>.</p><p>This is indeed a very interesting question. We assume that auxin could trigger a conformational change of SNAREs, which may affect its activity. Alternatively, vacuolar SNAREs could also provide a structural component required for vacuolar organisation. We currently investigate these options. At the current stage we can only speculate and we followed the reviewer’s suggestion and elaborated on our Discussion.</p><p><italic>The vacuolar morphology index appears too simplified in order to represent the complex morphological changes in a meaningful way. It arbitrarily selects only the largest vacuole in the picture as a measure, leaving aside the many small and medium-sized structures. Given this, the statistical analysis of such results appears as formally correct but of questionable relevance. I would have preferred to see an analysis of the total vacuolar volume in these cells, which may be the parameter that is most relevant for cell expansion</italic>.</p><p>The vacuole is a highly complex structure, which is visually distinct in every cell. Long term auxin treatments and its effect on vacuolar shapes are very easily detectable by eye. However, shorter time points require a solid quantification method to capture morphological changes. We implemented the vacuolar morphology index to detect such major changes in vacuolar morphology. Notably, the measurement of the biggest vacuolar structure turned out to be a very reproducible approximation for vacuolar morphology. Importantly the measured values are quite stable in between independent experiments (both untreated and treated). Moreover, the index is quite sensitive to auxin induced morphological changes, which guided us to depict earliest morphological changes following short-term auxin treatments. Notably, the vacuolar morphology index robustly correlates with the auxin effect on cell sizes. Therefore, we feel that this simple quantification method is straightforward and very suitable for the here conducted work. In this respect, we kindly agree also with reviewer 3 (“The method of quantification is relatively simple and crude but does effectively reflect the changes in vacuolar morphology which in some cases are visually very striking.”). Said that we also would like to mention that we would indeed further develop tools to depict and quantify the plant vacuoles. In our on-going research, we are also investigating the potential effect of auxin on vacuolar volume and whether it is a parameter that is most relevant. We will develop in the future more sophisticated 3D imaging approaches, which will allow us to address additional questions, such as raised by reviewer 1.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>In the subsection headed “Vacuolar SNARE function is required for the auxin-dependent modulation of vacuolar morphology”,paragraphs 1 and 2 could be made clearer. In the reference to the redundant action of SNARE components, the</italic> vti11 <italic>mutant is mentioned as displaying roundish vacuoles. Does this mean that</italic> vti11 <italic>is the only mutant in a SNARE-encoding gene that has a phenotype? Also it would be useful to explain earlier what it means that VTI11 is a Qb-SNARE (see point on SNARE background below).</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the lack of discussion and improved the Introduction and Discussion on SNARE proteins. It has been previously shown that several SNARE complex components indeed function redundantly. Some mutants display defects in storage vacuoles and mild growth phenotypes (e.g. Shirakawa et al., 2010). However, based on our analysis most mutants did not show any defects in vacuolar morphology.</p><p><italic>Finally, since the vacuole morphology is clearly different in the</italic> vti11 <italic>mutant from that in wild type, it is puzzling why the authors indicate that the defects in SNARE-dependent vacuolar morphology regulation in</italic> vti11 <italic>are relatively mild. Perhaps they mean that the altered vacuolar morphology in</italic> vti11 <italic>has little effect on cell growth in A and T cells?</italic></p><p>This formulation was indeed confusing. We intended to point out that in the <italic>vti11</italic> mutant vacuolar morphology is still differentially regulated in tricho- and atrichoblast. In the revised version of the manuscript, we reformulated the sentence: “Despite these apparent defects, vacuoles remained differentially controlled in <italic>vti11</italic> mutant tricho- and atrichoblast cells, indicating that the cell type-dependent regulation of vacuolar morphology is at least partially operational in <italic>vti11</italic> mutants.”</p><p><italic>The authors explain in the discussion that lack of increased growth by WM treatment (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1"><italic>Figure 6–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>) and in the atrichoblasts of the</italic> vti11 <italic>mutant (Figure 5–figure supplement 2) could be due to cell wall limitations. I think they can expand their reasoning to include that the increased growth observed upon Kynurenin treatment in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>suggests that auxin acts not only on SNAREs/vacuolar morphology, but may also restrict growth by inhibiting availability of cell wall components.</italic></p><p>Yes, we agree with the reviewer, this data is in agreement with a dual role of auxin. Upcoming research in our group will further decipher this interplay.</p><p><italic>Along the same line, it seems to me a discussion could be included on coordination between tricholast and atrichoblast cell files as well as cell divisions within a cell file. For example, do any of the genetic and pharmological treatments lead to a difference in the ratio of trichoblasts:atrichoblasts in the meristematic zone or total number of cells</italic>?</p><p>Indeed pharmacological treatments (high and low auxin conditions) lead to a change in the ratio of tricho- and atrichoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>). We currently assume that plant tissues do not show cellular sliding due to the cell wall. Hence, cell division could contribute to the observed differences (especially after prolonged auxin treatments). This was also the reasoning to include analysis that assesses auxin-dependent growth repression in the elongation zone. We improved the underlying discussion in the revised version of the manuscript. In fact, we are currently testing whether we could use light sheet-based microscopy to follow prolonged auxin treatments in time. This approach would allow us to perform the required life cell imaging and to reveal or exclude the vacuolar requirements for cellular division.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05868.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05868.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05868.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05868-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7"><italic>Figure 6 and 7</italic></xref> <italic>could be amalgamated into one figure.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A-D</italic></xref> <italic>panels are identical to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6A-D</italic></xref> <italic>panels except for the higher amount of NAA.

In these sections, a cell “without” hairs could be still a trichoblast cell whose root hair was simply not in focus. Therefore, we considered for our measurments only cells showing a root hair, which ensured that we measured only one cell type. We assume that relative tissue expansion is constant between tricho- and atrichoblasts. Therefore, the relative outcome would be the same if we had used atrichoblasts.</p><p><italic>And 2) It is surprising that WM treatment alone has a negative effect on growth (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8I</italic></xref><italic>).

It indeed has been previously shown that high levels of WM (33µM) have a negative impact on growth (Jaillais et al., 2006). We used very low WM concentrations and observed only a mild effect on growth. Besides its mild effect on growth, this concentration range did not only reveal auxin resistant vacuoles, but also reduced the auxin effect on cell size and root organ growth.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p><italic>Some of the headings could be made more specific.
