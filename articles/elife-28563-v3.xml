sterol regulatory element-binding protein transcription factor Sre1. Here, we identify an extra-ribosomal function for uS12/Rps23 central to this regulatory system. Nro1 binds Rps23, and Ofd1 dihydroxylates Rps23 P62 in complex with Nro1. Concurrently, Nro1 imports Rps23 into the nucleus for assembly into 40S ribosomes. Low oxygen inhibits Ofd1 hydroxylase activity and stabilizes the Ofd1-Rps23-Nro1 complex, thereby sequestering Ofd1 from binding Sre1, which is then free to activate hypoxic gene expression. In vitro studies demonstrate that Ofd1 directly binds Rps23, Nro1, and Sre1 through a consensus binding sequence. Interestingly, Rps23 expression modulates Sre1 activity by changing the Rps23 substrate pool available to Ofd1. To date, oxygen is the only known signal to Sre1, but additional nutrient signals may tune the hypoxic response through control of unassembled Rps23 or Ofd1 activity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28563.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals, plants, and fungi need oxygen to release energy within their cells and for other chemical reactions. Enzymes that use oxygen typically become less active when less oxygen is available, and this makes them well suited to help cells sense oxygen. These enzymes include oxygenases, some of which modify proteins by adding oxygen to specific sites in a reaction called hydroxylation. Oxygenases control how mammals adapt to low levels of oxygen – a condition referred to as hypoxia. These enzymes achieve this by hydroxylating a protein – specifically a transcription factor – that turns on genes for survival in low oxygen. Cells quickly destroy the hydroxylated transcription factor but when oxygen is limiting, it remains unmodified. This means that, rather than being destroyed, the transcription factor binds DNA, and activates genes that keep the cells alive and growing in low oxygen.</p><p>In fission yeast, an oxygenase called Ofd1 controls the activity of a transcription factor called Sre1. Yeast requires Sre1 to grow when oxygen is limiting. Exactly how Ofd1 regulates Sre1 is unknown, but the mechanism is different from that in mammals because regulation of gene expression does not need Sre1 to be hydroxylated.</p><p>Now, Clasen et al. report that Ofd1 actually hydroxylates another protein called Rps23. This protein is one of about 80 that form the cell’s protein-building machinery, the ribosome. It turns out that, before Rps23 becomes part of the ribosome, it binds Ofd1 in a complex with other proteins. The multi-protein complex then acts to hydroxylate and transport Rps23 into the nucleus, where ribosomes are built and where the cell stores its DNA. When little oxygen is around, Ofd1 cannot hydroxylate Rps23. This stops the complex from falling apart and traps Ofd1 away from the transcription factor Sre1. When not bound by Ofd1, Sre1 is free to turn on genes that allow growth at low levels of oxygen. Finally, Clasen et al. show that more unassembled Rps23 means less Ofd1 is available to inhibit Sre1, which controls the yeast cell’s response to hypoxia.</p><p>Humans have proteins similar to Ofd1 and Rps23. As such, this pathway for sensing oxygen in yeast may occur in humans too. Further work is now needed to explore if other enzymes that hydroxylate ribosomal proteins work in a similar way.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SREBP</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>uS12</kwd><kwd>nuclear import</kwd><kwd>prolyl hydroxylation</kwd><kwd>extra-ribosomal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL077588</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Espenshade</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship 13PRE15820017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clasen</surname><given-names>Sara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant in Aid 13GRNT16400001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Espenshade</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clasen</surname><given-names>Sara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The protein uS12/Rps23 functions extra-ribosomally to control oxygen homeostasis in fission yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells require oxygen and must adapt to changes in its supply to maintain homeostasis. Research on mechanisms underlying oxygen homeostasis has focused mainly on hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Semenza, 2012</xref>). HIFs are heterodimeric transcription factors whose activity is regulated by molecular oxygen through the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes. These enzymes hydroxylate HIF proline residues to promote HIF degradation using 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and oxygen as co-substrates and Fe(II) as a co-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008</xref>). The PHDs belong to a large family of non-heme, 2OG/Fe(II)-dependent oxygenases whose members catalyze a broad set of reactions in eukaryotes and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hausinger, 2015</xref>). Despite this diversity, the active site of most 2OG oxygenases is located in a highly-conserved double-stranded beta-helix fold with the Fe(II) coordinated by a catalytic triad (HxD/E…H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McDonough et al., 2010</xref>). Since oxygen is a co-substrate for this enzyme family, they can act as sensors of cellular oxygen supply, making them ideal regulators for pathways requiring oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ratcliffe, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Lipid synthesis is highly oxygen-consumptive with yeast ergosterol synthesis requiring 12 molecules of dioxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Espenshade and Hughes, 2007</xref>). As a result, oxygen supply and sterol synthesis are coupled through the transcription factor Sre1 in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. Sre1 is a sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) homolog required for adaptation to low oxygen environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hughes et al., 2005</xref>). Notably, Sre1 is conserved across fungi, and homologs in pathogenic fungi are required for virulence since the mammalian host environment is hypoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Willger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bien and Espenshade, 2010</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Sre1 is synthesized as an ER membrane-bound precursor that is cleaved in the Golgi to release its N-terminal transcription factor domain (Sre1N) in response to sterol depletion during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hughes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Porter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>). Sre1N upregulates genes required for hypoxic growth and its own transcription. Upon reoxygenation, Sre1N signaling is rapidly down-regulated by the 2OG oxygenase Ofd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hughes and Espenshade, 2008</xref>). Ofd1 interacts with Sre1N in the presence of oxygen to inhibit DNA-binding and accelerate degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Porter et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to HIF regulation by PHDs, oxygen regulation of Sre1N does not require its hydroxylation by Ofd1. Rather, under hypoxia Ofd1 preferentially binds the nuclear import adaptor Nro1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Binding to Nro1 prevents Ofd1 binding to Sre1N, allowing Sre1N to activate hypoxic gene expression. This oxygen-regulated switch in Ofd1 binding requires oxygenase activity. However, the mechanism by which oxygen elicits this change in binding remains unclear as does the precise role for Ofd1 enzyme activity in regulating Sre1N.</p><p>Previous work in budding yeast identified a role for the Ofd1 and Nro1 homologs Tpa1 and Ett1, respectively, in translation termination. These studies found that ribosomes from cells lacking Tpa1 read through stop codons with increased frequency relative to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keeling et al., 2006</xref>). While Ofd1 and Nro1 function in opposition in the context of Sre1N regulation, <italic>ett1Δ</italic> cells share the same ribosomal read-through defect as <italic>tpa1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Henri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rispal et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, Tpa1 oxygenase activity is required to rescue this phenotype, suggesting that the ribosome read-through defect is mediated by a Tpa1 enzyme substrate. More recently, several studies identified the small ribosomal protein uS12 as an enzyme substrate for Ofd1, Tpa1, and the homologs in <italic>human</italic> (OGFOD1) and fly (Sudestrada1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loenarz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singleton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katz et al., 2014</xref>). uS12 is an essential and universal ribosomal protein that functions in translation fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sharma et al., 2007</xref>). While the human and fly enzymes catalyze prolyl-3-hydroxylation of uS12 P62, the fungal homologs catalyze 3,4-dihydroxylation of P62. Prolyl-3-hydroxylation was implicated in translation fidelity, but the function of uS12 dihydroxylation in fungi is unknown. The finding that uS12 is an Ofd1 substrate categorizes Ofd1 as a ribosomal oxygenase (ROX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ge et al., 2012</xref>). This small but growing enzyme family modifies ribosomal proteins from the large and small subunit in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. For many ROXs, the function of the hydroxylated product remains unknown, similar to dihydroxylated uS12 P62 in fungi.</p><p>Here, we independently identified uS12, known as Rps23 in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, as a binding partner and substrate of Ofd1 and investigated the role that P62 dihydroxylation plays in fission yeast. We confirmed that Ofd1 dihydroxylates Rps23 and further report that Ofd1 and Rps23 form a complex with Nro1. This complex functions to transport newly synthesized Rps23 to the nucleus while simultaneously facilitating the dihydroxylation of P62. In addition, Ofd1 activity regulates formation of the Ofd1-Rps23-Nro1 complex such that decreased enzyme activity under low oxygen stabilizes the complex. As a result, unassembled Rps23 regulates Sre1N signaling by sequestering Ofd1 in an oxygen-dependent manner, thereby coupling hypoxic gene expression to rates of ribosomal synthesis. Finally, we identified a conserved Ofd1 binding sequence shared by all known Ofd1 binding partners. This study outlines a new paradigm for control of hypoxic adaptation, assigns a second function to uS12 hydroxylation, and defines a distinct mechanism by which an oxygenase functions as a cellular oxygen sensor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ofd1 binds and dihydroxylates Rps23 P62</title><p>To identify conserved enzyme substrates of Ofd1/OGFOD1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen for human OGFOD1 binding partners using a human fetal brain cDNA library as prey.

In contrast to free GST, full-length GST-Rps23 bound Ofd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 2–3), indicating direct binding between Ofd1 and Rps23. Next, we mapped the region of Rps23 required for binding to Ofd1. Rps23 contains an evolutionarily divergent N-terminal extension domain (aa 1–46) followed by a conserved C-terminal globular domain (aa 47–143) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). We fused GST to Rps23 truncations and found that Ofd1 binds to the N-terminal extension domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 4–5). Furthermore, Rps23 aa 1–23 were necessary and sufficient to capture Ofd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 6–7). This region of Rps23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, colored magenta) is buried in assembled 40S subunits and thus inaccessible to Ofd1 based on crystal structures of budding yeast ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Shem et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, Ofd1 binds to Rps23 prior to its assembly into the 40S subunit in the nucleus. Since unassembled Rps23 represents only 2% of total Rps23 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–1B</xref>, lanes 1 and 4), we used ribosome-depleted lysates to test if Ofd1 binds Rps23 in vivo. Immunopurified wild-type Ofd1 bound unassembled Rps23 in the presence of the crosslinker DSP, but failed to bind Rps5, a ribosomal protein of similar size and charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lanes 7–8). In addition, the Fe(II)-binding mutant Ofd1 H142A D144A was unable to pull down Rps23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lanes 11–12), indicating that an intact Ofd1 active site is required to bind Rps23.</p><p>Since oxygenase function is required for Ofd1-Rps23 binding, we hypothesized that Rps23 is a substrate of Ofd1. We identified Rps23 P62 as a promising target for hydroxylation based on earlier work that reported a +16 Dalton (Da) mass shift for mammalian RPS23 aa 61–68: QPNSAIRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Louie et al., 1996</xref>). P62 is essential and part of a highly conserved loop that projects into the decoding center of the ribosome upon anticodon binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sharma et al., 2007</xref>). We confirmed that the +16 Da mass shift occurred on this proline residue by incubating Ofd1 with purified 6xHis-RPS23 and performing MS/MS that targeted the QPNSAIR peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–1C</xref>). In light of subsequent studies showing that Ofd1 and its fungal homologs dihydroxylate P62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loenarz et al., 2014</xref>), we developed a stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) assay to quantify Rps23 P62 hydroxylation.

Following digestion by LysC, H/L peptide ratios were measured by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We detected only dihydroxylated P62 in wild-type cells, consistent with published findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loenarz et al., 2014</xref>).

These data indicate that Sre1N binds Ofd1 directly through a conserved motif shared with Rps23 and Nro1.

Furthermore, overexpression of GST-Rps23 in <italic>sre1N</italic> cells led to the accumulation of Sre1N under normoxia compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). GST-Rps23 serves as a proxy for unassembled Rps23 given its ability to bind both Ofd1 and Nro1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>) while being unable to assemble into functional 40S subunits: cells that express GST-Rps23 from the <italic>rps2302</italic> locus are not viable in an <italic>rps23Δ</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data support the sequestration model by demonstrating that changes in Rps23 levels affect Sre1 signaling.</p><p>Next, we tested if the Ofd1-binding sites in Nro1 and Rps23 mediate the sequestration of Ofd1. We mutated the Ofd1-binding site at several conserved residues in Nro1 and Rps23 and expressed these mutants in <italic>nro1Δ sre1N</italic> and <italic>rps2302Δ sre1N</italic> cells, respectively. These cells carrying empty vector failed to grow in the presence of cobalt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), consistent with the fact that both <italic>nro1Δ sre1N</italic> and <italic>rps2302Δ sre1N</italic> cells were unable to activate Sre1N under hypoxia due to Ofd1-dependent inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lanes 5–6, 11–12).

Consistent with these cobalt growth defects, cells expressing Nro1 P6D, G8D, and A11D failed to activate Sre1N under low oxygen despite equal Nro1 expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 7–1B</xref>, lanes 3–10). Expression of Nro1 L15D, a mutant predicted to retain Ofd1-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), partially rescued both growth on cobalt and Sre1N accumulation under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>, lanes 4,12). <italic>rps2302Δ sre1N</italic> cells expressing wild-type <italic>rps2302<sup>+</sup></italic> grew on cobalt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Unexpectedly, although Rps23 P4D, G6D, and A9D are defective for Ofd1-binding in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), <italic>rps2302Δ sre1N</italic> cells expressing these mutants showed partial to full recovery on cobalt relative to cells expressing wild-type Rps23 or Rps23 L13D, a mutant that binds Ofd1 in vitro. Furthermore, the Rps23 mutants except for G6D restored Sre1N activity under low oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Reduced expression of Rps23 G6D may explain its inability to fully rescue Sre1N levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These findings indicate that although the Ofd1-binding sites in Nro1 and Rps23 behave similarly in vitro, these sequences do not contribute equally to Ofd1 sequestration in vivo, with sequestration more dependent on Nro1 residues.</p><p>Our model also predicts that Ofd1 oxygenase activity is crucial for the oxygen-dependent sequestration of Ofd1 by Rps23-Nro1 and hypoxia stabilizes the Ofd1-Rps23-Nro1 complex due to the inability of Ofd1 to modify Rps23 P62. Ofd1 requires both 2OG and molecular oxygen as co-substrates for hydroxylation so we treated wild-type cells with dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), a cell permeable competitive inhibitor of Ofd1 that is metabolized to a 2OG analog, to test if enzyme activity affects Ofd1 binding to Rps23 and Nro1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaakkola et al., 2001</xref>). Ofd1 immunopurified from cells treated with DMOG bound more Nro1 and Rps23 compared to vehicle-treated cells, in both the absence and presence of crosslinker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, lanes 5–8). Next, we examined whether Ofd1-Rps23-Nro1 complex stability is oxygen-dependent. Ofd1 immunopurified from wild-type cells bound more Rps23 and Nro1 in the absence of oxygen compared to cells grown in normoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, lanes 3–4). Together, these experiments show that the Ofd1-Rps23-Nro1 complex is stabilized under conditions that prevent P62 hydroxylation and support the sequestration model for Ofd1-dependent regulation of Sre1N.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we report three major findings: (1) Nro1 functions in a new nuclear import pathway for the small ribosomal protein uS12/Rps23; (2) Nro1 is the first protein adaptor for prolyl dihydroxylation; and (3) Rps23 has an extra-ribosomal function essential for the fission yeast hypoxic response.</p><p>Unassembled Rps23 sits at the center of these findings, and our data support the following model for how Rps23 is incorporated into ribosomes: Nro1 binds newly synthesized Rps23 in the cytosol; Ofd1 then binds Rps23-Nro1 and dihydroxylates P62 during nuclear import; Nro1 releases dihydroxylated Rps23 in the nucleus where it is incorporated into assembling 40S ribosomal subunits. Multiple lines of evidence support this model. Rps23 binds Nro1 in vitro, the interaction does not require Ofd1, and binding is stable in the absence of chemical crosslinker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that Rps23 and Nro1 bind first. The order of complex assembly is further supported by the fact that Nro1 is required for Ofd1 binding to Rps23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and conversely Rps23 promotes Ofd1 binding to Nro1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with this, efficient dihydroxylation of Rps23 requires Nro1 in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, Rps23 nuclear localization requires Nro1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and Ofd1 nuclear import decreases in the absence of the Rps23-Nro1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that import and dihydroxylation are coordinated and coincident. It remains to be determined how the complex dissociates in the nucleus and whether Ofd1-dependent hydroxylation plays a role.</p><p>Ofd1 binding to Rps23 and Nro1 is mediated through a shared binding sequence in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Given previous work showing that the budding yeast enzyme crystallizes as a dimer and exists in solution as a reversible monomer-dimer mix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Henri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horita et al., 2015</xref>), we modeled Ofd1 as a dimer in the complex and initially assumed that the Ofd1-binding sites in Rps23 and Nro1 contribute equally and independently to binding Ofd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, cellular studies indicate that these binding sequences are not functionally equivalent, and that sequestration of Ofd1 is more dependent on the conserved residues in Nro1 compared to Rps23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These findings highlight the need for future high resolution structural studies on the Ofd1-Rps23-Nro1 complex to determine both complex stoichiometry and how the Ofd1-binding sequences contribute to complex formation.</p><p>In a second key finding, Nro1 functions as an adaptor for Ofd1-dependent dihydroxylation in addition to its role as a nuclear importer. The mechanism by which Nro1 facilitates dihydroxylation of Rps23 is unclear. Previous work found that Nro1 is structurally similar to the α subunit of human collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase that functions in substrate recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rispal et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the study’s authors predicted that Nro1 may serve a similar role for Ofd1. We report a small but significant reduction in unmodified Rps23 P62 in reactions incubated with Nro1 which supports Nro1 functioning in substrate recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, our finding that addition of Nro1 increased production of dihydroxylated P62 at the expense of monohydroxylated P62 suggests that Nro1 facilitates the second hydroxylation event and may act by preventing release of monohydroxylated Rps23 from Ofd1. The stereochemistry of the monohydroxylated species that accumulates in <italic>nro1Δ</italic> cells is unknown. Previous studies showed that prolyl-3-hydroxylation is sufficient to restore the defects in translation termination caused by loss of the Ofd1 homolog Tpa1, suggesting that loss of this post-translational modification underlies the translation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loenarz et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that prolyl-3-hydroxylation of P62 is dramatically reduced in <italic>nro1Δ</italic> cells given the translation termination defect reported for budding yeast <italic>ett1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Henri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rispal et al., 2011</xref>). Since Ett1 and Nro1 are homologs, we predict that <italic>ett1Δ</italic> cells will show a similar loss of dihydroxylated Rps23 P62 as seen in <italic>nro1Δ</italic> cells. The requirement of Nro1 for Rps23 P62 hydroxylation explains why <italic>ett1Δ</italic> and <italic>tpa1Δ</italic> cells share the same read-through phenotype, while <italic>ofd1Δ</italic> and <italic>nro1Δ</italic> cells display opposing Sre1N phenotypes.</p><p>The third finding in this study is that unassembled Rps23 plays a central role in control of the hypoxic response in fission yeast. While Rps23 P62 hydroxylation in fungi is required for translation fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loenarz et al., 2014</xref>), we demonstrate that Rps23 has an extra-ribosomal function in the regulation of Sre1N and hypoxic gene expression. The Ofd1 hydroxylation reaction is oxygen-dependent, and this property confers oxygen regulation to the stability of the Ofd1-Rps23-Nro1 complex. The Rps23-Nro1 complex functions as a positive regulator of Sre1N by sequestering the negative regulator Ofd1 under low oxygen or DMOG-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>). We show that manipulation of unassembled Rps23 expression activates or represses Sre1N signaling in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Unlike the HIF system, this sequestration mechanism allows Sre1N activity to be regulated indirectly by oxygenase activity without requiring Sre1N to be an Ofd1 substrate. While the Ofd1-Rps23 enzyme-substrate relationship is conserved in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loenarz et al., 2014</xref>), we do not have evidence that OGFOD1 and RPS23 function in the hypoxic response in mammals, perhaps because metazoans lack an obvious Nro1 homolog.</p><p>To date, oxygen is the only known nutrient that signals to Sre1N. However, Sre1N activates anabolic pathways such as sterol synthesis that require carbon and other nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Todd et al., 2006</xref>). Given that maintenance of cellular homeostasis requires coordination of nutrient availability and metabolism, other regulatory inputs likely exist. The unassembled ribosomal protein pool is highly dynamic and subject to multiple nutrient inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schawalder et al., 2004</xref>), making Rps23 an ideal regulatory molecule. We speculate that in response to nutrient availability, rates of Rps23 synthesis couple nutrient supply to Sre1N activity. Under nutrient-deprivation, reduced Rps23 synthesis dampens Sre1N activity by failing to sequester Ofd1, thereby efficiently matching lipid synthesis to nutrient supply. Conversely, high rates of Rps23 synthesis support maximal Sre1N activity by sequestering Ofd1. Cells with different levels of Rps23 synthesis still respond to hypoxia through the oxygen-dependent sequestering of Ofd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), but the dynamic range of this response will be tuned by nutrient supply through Rps23. In addition, Nro1 may similarly bind other Ofd1 substrates, allowing for integration of multiple signals. Current studies are focused on testing this model.</p><p>Ofd1 is a member of a large family of 2OG oxygenases that catalyze a diverse set of reactions ranging from histone demethylation for regulation of transcription to halogenation for antibiotic synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hausinger, 2015</xref>). Here, we describe a mechanism by which the requirement for oxygen as a substrate confers the ability to sequester the oxygenase from other binding partners under low oxygen conditions. These enzymes also require 2OG as a co-substrate, raising the possibility that 2OG can signal to Sre1N and control the hypoxic response. Finally, our studies define a new mechanism for oxygen-sensing and suggest that other 2OG-oxygenase family members may function through a similar mechanism to regulate as yet unidentified, non-substrate targets. Indeed, several 2OG oxygenases are also ribosomal oxygenases that could similarly leverage their substrates for oxygen-dependent regulation of cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ge et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resource table</label><table

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes the role of prolyl dihydroxylation of the small ribosomal subunit protein Rps23 in regulation of sterol synthesis pathways in fission yeast. It builds on a substantial body of work by the senior author on the elucidation of this pathway, in particular the identification of Ofd1 as a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase that generates an oxygen-dependent signal leading indirectly to the degradation of the key transcription factor Sre1N.</p><p>In outline, it is now proposed that hydroxylation of Rps23 is promoted by the assembly of a protein complex involving (at least) Ofd1, Rps23 and a previously identified Ofd1-interacting protein Nro1. Binding of Ofd1 to the Nro1/Rsp23 complex is proposed to be competitive with Sre1N and modulated by the Ofd1-dependent hydroxylation of Rps23. Since binding of Ofd1 to Nro1 prevents the interaction with (and degradation of) Ser1N, production of Rsp23 and the catalytic rate for hydroxylation confer regulation on the sterol response (including by oxygen availability). This action that is proposed to be important in the co-ordination of biosynthetic processes.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the work is of high quality and in general supports the conclusions. The manuscript should also be of interest to the wider biomedical community since Ofd1 is conserved in man as OGFOD1 and RPS23 has been identified as a prolyl hydroxylated substrate of human OGFOD1, raising questions as to the nature of signaling in human cells.</p><p>Based on this there was a consensus that the work is in principle appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> but the author will need to address the following points prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) To strengthen Rps23 specificity in hypoxia, additional controls are suggested. In IPs with cross-linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>) an additional negative control, similar to the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> should be provided. Rps5 was used to show the specificity of Nro1-Rps23 binding. Is there a reason that the authors do not present this control in other IPs with cross-linker?</p><p>2) Could the authors comment on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> with regards to no Nro1-Ofd1 binding in WT cells in Nro1 IP experiment without cross-linker and only a weak binding in the same experiment with the cross-linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>)? How would an Ofd1 IP without cross-linker look? Does Nro1 co-enrich?</p><p>3) The authors demonstrate the crucial residues involved in interaction between Ofd1 and Rps23/Nro1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). However, it is important to assess the phenotypes of these mutant strains (growth) in vivo for e.g. their ability to grow on media with cobalt chloride (similarly to ofd1Δ cells). Additionally, over-expression of these Rps23 mutants in Ofd1 binding sequence should not activate expression of the reporter gene from 2XSRE-ura4+ construct. Is this the case?</p><p>4) The authors implicate a tight coupling between dihydroxylation of Rps23 and nuclear import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). What happens under hypoxia? Is Rps23 still transported to the nucleus without the dihydroxylation?</p><p>5) Does Nro1 directly import Rps23 into the nucleus? Or does it serve as an adaptor for other import receptors? Given that Nro1 is not essential for yeast cell viability, but Rps23 is, it is important to better dissect the import pathway(s) of Rps23.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28563.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) To strengthen Rps23 specificity in hypoxia, additional controls are suggested.

How would an Ofd1 IP without cross-linker look?

Relative to the Ofd1 IP with crosslinker, the Ofd1-Nro1 binding is weaker in the absence of crosslinker. This result is consistent with an enzyme-substrate interaction (Ofd1-Nro1/Rps23). Under both conditions, we consistently observe reduced Ofd1-Nro1 binding in <italic>rps23Δ</italic> and <italic>rps2302Δ</italic> cells. The Ofd1-Rps23 interaction is difficult to detect in the absence of crosslinker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as also observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors demonstrate the crucial residues involved in interaction between Ofd1 and Rps23/Nro1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). However, it is important to assess the phenotypes of these mutant strains (growth) in vivo for e.g. their ability to grow on media with cobalt chloride (similarly to ofd1Δ cells). Additionally, over-expression of these Rps23 mutants in Ofd1 binding sequence should not activate expression of the reporter gene from 2XSRE-ura4+ construct. Is this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we tested if the Ofd1-binding sequences in Nro1 and Rps23 are required to sequester Ofd1 in vivo(new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We mutated four identical residues in the Ofd1-binding sequence to aspartate, one residue from each of the pairs of conserved residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then tested if mutant Nro1 or Rps23 rescued the cobalt growth defects of <italic>rps2302Δ sre1N</italic> and <italic>nro1Δ sre1N</italic> cells when expressed from a plasmid. If the Ofd1-binding sites in Nro1 and Rps23 contribute equally to the sequestration of Ofd1, our model predicts that the Ofd1-binding mutants will not restore growth on cobalt.</p><p>In the case of Nro1, the residues that blocked Ofd1 binding in vitro also failed to rescue growth on cobalt, consistent with the model. We verified that expression of the Nro1 mutants was similar to wild-type and directly tested Sre1N activation under +/- oxygen conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, transformed cells that failed to grow on cobalt also showed impaired Sre1N signaling. Surprisingly, the analogous mutations in Rps23 had minimal impact on Sre1N levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and showed partial to full rescue of growth on cobalt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The only Rps23 mutant that showed reduced Sre1N activation (G6D) also showed low levels of pre-ribosomal Rps23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data indicate that the two Ofd1-binding sites do not contribute equally to Ofd1 sequestration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors implicate a tight coupling between dihydroxylation of Rps23 and nuclear import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). What happens under hypoxia? Is Rps23 still transported to the nucleus without the dihydroxylation?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we expanded <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> to show the Rps23-GFP localization in <italic>ofd1Δ</italic> and <italic>ofd1 H142A D144A</italic> backgrounds. Furthermore, we imaged <italic>rps2302 P62A-GFP</italic> cells. In these strains, Rps23 is not hydroxylated and localizes to the nucleus. Thus, import of Rps23 does not require P62 hydroxylation which is expected given the viability of <italic>ofd1Δ</italic> and <italic>ofd1 H142A D144A</italic> cells. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> shows that unmodified Rps23 assembles into functional ribosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Does Nro1 directly import Rps23 into the nucleus? Or does it serve as an adaptor for other import receptors? Given that Nro1 is not essential for yeast cell viability, but Rps23 is, it is important to better dissect the import pathway(s) of Rps23.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, and we agree that this is an interesting area for future study. Given the viability of <italic>nro1Δ</italic> cells, the Nro1-dependent pathway cannot be the only route for nuclear import of Rps23. Further, it remains to be tested whether Nro1 is sufficient to import Rps23. As the reviewers note, Nro1 may act as an adaptor that links Rps23 to an importin. Previous studies published by our lab identified the importin-β Kap123 as an Nro1-binding partner, and both Nro1 and Ofd1 are mislocalized in <italic>kap123Δ</italic> cells (Yeh et al., 2011). These data suggest that Kap123 may be an additional member of the complex. However, <italic>rps23Δ kap123Δ</italic> double mutants, but not <italic>rps23Δ nro1Δ</italic> cells, show severe growth defects, suggesting that Kap123 may separately function in Rps23 import.</p></body></sub-article></article>
