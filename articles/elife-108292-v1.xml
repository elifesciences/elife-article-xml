organization remain poorly understood. Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic salivary gland (SG) as a model, we identify Papss, an enzyme that synthesizes the universal sulfate donor PAPS, as a critical regulator of tube lumen expansion. <italic>Papss</italic> mutants show a disorganized apical membrane, condensed aECM, and disruptions in Golgi structures and intracellular trafficking. SG-specific expression of wild-type Papss, but not the catalytically inactive form, rescues the defects in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, suggesting that defects in sulfation are the underlying cause of the phenotypes. Additionally, we identify two zona pellucida (ZP) domain proteins, Piopio (Pio), and Dumpy (Dpy), as key components of the SG aECM. In the absence of <italic>Papss</italic>, Pio is gradually lost in the aECM, while the Dpy-positive aECM structure is condensed and dissociates from the apical membrane, leading to a thin lumen. Mutations in <italic>dpy</italic> or <italic>pio</italic>, or in <italic>Notopleural</italic>, which encodes a matriptase that cleaves Pio to form the luminal Pio pool, result in a SG lumen with alternating bulges and constrictions, with the loss of <italic>pio</italic> leading to the loss of Dpy in the lumen. Our findings underscore the essential role of sulfation in organizing the aECM during tubular organ formation and highlight the mechanical support provided by ZP domain proteins in maintaining luminal diameter.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Papss</kwd><kwd>ZP domain proteins</kwd><kwd>sulfation</kwd><kwd>Piopio</kwd><kwd>Dumpy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 2141387</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>SeYeon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03DE034704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>SeYeon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sulfation is required for organizing the apical extracellular matrix during tubular organ formation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelial tubes are critical components of many key biological organs, including the kidney, heart, and lungs. Aberrant tube size leads to common diseases and congenital disorders, such as polycystic kidney disease, asthma, and lung hypoplasia. Tube morphogenesis is regulated by multiple factors, including intracellular mechanisms, intercellular interactions, and interactions between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Specifically, events at the apical (luminal) surface of a tube play an important role in regulating tube diameter and growth, thereby influencing overall tube shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Myat and Andrew, 2002</xref>). During tubular organ formation, the surrounding epithelium secretes aECM components into the lumen. These aECM components form the luminal meshwork and interact with the apical membrane, playing a critical role in epithelial morphogenesis and regulation of tube dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaźwińska et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Devine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luschnig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Syed et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drees et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2020b</xref>).</p><p>The aECM has a distinct composition compared to the basal ECM, with a diverse array of components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). ZP domain proteins, which are highly conserved across species, are of particular interest and are characterized by a conserved 260 amino acid ZP domain that mediates homo- or heteromeric polymerization into filaments. Initially identified in the extracellular coat of mammalian oocytes, ZP domain proteins have been shown to play a critical role in the organization of specialized apical structures in various tissues in species ranging from worms to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Porter and Tamm, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Legan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beeck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Renner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McAllister et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Plaza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jovine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Litscher and Wassarman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilkin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghosh and Treisman, 2024</xref>). Chitin, a biopolymer of N-acetylglucosamine, is another major aECM component that is abundant in invertebrates and some vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mei et al., 2024</xref>). In many <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissues, chitin forms a network of fibers that provides mechanical supports and maintains the integrity of the epithelial layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araújo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Devine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moussian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tonning et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Several studies have shown the role of ZP proteins in maintaining the chitin matrix in the aECM. During <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal development, two ZP proteins, Dpy and Pio, build an elastic structure in the lumen that modulates mechanical stress and maintains the chitin matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaźwińska et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drees et al., 2023</xref>). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> corneal lens, another ZP domain protein, Dusky-like, establishes an external scaffold for chitin retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghosh and Treisman, 2024</xref>). However, many organs in both vertebrates and invertebrates have a non-chitinous aECM, and the role of ZP proteins in the non-chitinous aECM is less well understood.</p><p>Post-translational modifications of the aECM are essential for proper tube dimensions during organ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luschnig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herman and Horvitz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hwang et al., 2003</xref>). Sulfation is an abundant post-translational modification that takes place in the Golgi apparatus, where a sulfate group is covalently attached to amino acid residues of proteins or side chains of proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Günal et al., 2019</xref>). Several studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have shown key roles of sulfation in neuronal organization, development of reproductive tissues, and phenotypic plasticity, linking this post-translational modification to multiple cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Turnbull et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bülow and Hobert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kinnunen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tecle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Díaz-Balzac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dierker et al., 2016</xref>). A study in a mouse model of cystic fibrosis also suggests a link between the disease state and proper sulfation levels in organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xia et al., 2005</xref>), but the role of sulfation in tubular organ development and aECM organization remains elusive.</p><p>Sulfation reactions require a high-energy form of sulfate, 3’-phosphoadenosine-5’-phosphosulfate (PAPS), which is produced by the enzyme PAPS synthetase (Papss) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van den Boom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Günal et al., 2019</xref>). Mammals have two Papss isoforms, Papss1, and Papss2. <italic>Papss1</italic> shows ubiquitous expression, with higher levels in glandular cells and salivary duct cells, suggesting that high degrees of sulfation are required in these cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Uhlén et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karlsson et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Papss2</italic> shows a more restricted expression in certain tissues, such as cartilage, and mutations in <italic>Papss2</italic> have been associated with skeletal dysplasia in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haque et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kurima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ford-Hutchinson et al., 2005</xref>). Mouse models with exon deletions in <italic>Papss1</italic> or <italic>Papss2</italic> show extensive defects, including lethality (<italic>Papss1</italic>) and abnormal craniofacial and limb morphology (<italic>Papss2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Groza et al., 2023</xref>), demonstrating that Papss is vital for developmental processes in mammals. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has a single <italic>Papss</italic> gene, allowing for a straightforward investigation of its function in developmental processes without redundancy. By studying the role of <italic>Papss</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, we can gain valuable insights into the role of this conserved enzyme in normal development and disease in humans.</p><p>To understand the role of post-translational modification in aECM organization and to determine the key composition of the non-chitinous aECM in tubular organs, we use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic SG as a model. This single-layered epithelial tube is formed through highly stereotyped morphogenetic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2014</xref>), making it an excellent system for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying aECM composition and modification. SG cells are specified on the ventral surface of the embryo at stage 10. Once specified, SG cells do not undergo cell division or cell death because SG-upregulated transcription factors downregulate the expression of key cell cycle genes and proapoptotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Myat and Andrew, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandrasekaran and Beckendorf, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matthew et al., 2024</xref>), and thus the entire morphogenetic process is driven by cell shape change, cell rearrangement, and collective cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Myat and Andrew, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradley and Andrew, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung and Andrew, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2017</xref>). At stage 11, SG cells invaginate to form a three-dimensional tubular structure, which then elongates and migrates toward its final position during stages 12–13. The SG continues to migrate, and the lumen expands significantly by apical secretion during stages 14–16, forming the fully developed organ. Despite limited knowledge of the composition of the aECM in the SG, previous work has demonstrated the critical role of ADAMTS-A, a secreted metalloprotease, in releasing cells from the aECM to facilitate SG migration and normal lumen shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ismat et al., 2013</xref>). Our previous work has also shown that cell-aECM adhesion via the apical surface protein Cad99C influences cell rearrangement during SG elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung and Andrew, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we identify Papss as being essential for aECM organization and lumen expansion of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic SG. Loss of <italic>Papss</italic> results in a disorganized apical membrane and a condensed aECM, which is associated with disrupted Golgi structures and intracellular trafficking. <italic>Papss</italic> mutants also show defects in the basal ECM and occasional SG cell death, leading to invasion of hemocytes into SG epithelia that engulf dying cells. Expressing the wild-type (WT) Papss in the SG rescues all phenotypes, but not the enzyme-dead form. We identify two ZP proteins, Pio and Dpy, as key components of the SG aECM. In the SG lumen, these ZP domain proteins form a filamentous scaffold that is significantly affected by the loss of <italic>Papss</italic>, with Pio eventually being lost from the aECM, and the Dpy-positive aECM structure condensing and dissociating from the apical membrane. Mutations in <italic>pio</italic> or <italic>dpy</italic>, or in <italic>Notopleural</italic> (<italic>Np</italic>), which encodes a matriptase that cleaves Pio to form the luminal pool of Pio, exhibit bulging and constriction of the SG lumen. Notably, mutations in <italic>pio</italic> result in the loss of luminal Dpy signals in the SG. These data indicate that the Dpy-containing filamentous structure of the aECM is crucial for maintaining luminal diameter and that the luminal pool of Pio is essential for organizing this structure during SG morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Papss is required for SG lumen expansion</title><p>To identify key enzymes that affect SG morphology by modifying aECM components, we examined the effects of the loss of ~20 enzymes that are highly expressed in the SG and are likely to function in the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al., 2013</xref>). Deficiency lines deleting each enzyme were immunostained with the apical membrane marker Crumbs (Crb) or Stranded at Second (SAS) to assess SG lumen shape.

The Papss protein contains two critical protein domains, the ATP sulfurylase domain, which adds sulfate to an AMP group of ATP to form adenosine 5’-phosphosulfate (APS), and the APS kinase domain, which phosphorylates APS to form PAPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Venkatachalam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mueller and Shafqat, 2013</xref>). Sanger sequencing of this mutant identified a point mutation (G-&gt;A) that introduces a premature stop codon (Trp271-&gt;stop; amino acid number is for the Papss-PA isoform) located near the N-terminus of the ATP sulfurylase domain, resulting in a truncated protein in which most of the domain is not translated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1S1A-B</xref>). Since both protein domains are essential for the enzyme function of Papss, we conclude that this mutant line is potentially null or a strong hypomorphic allele. <italic>Papss</italic> homozygous mutants and transheterozygotes for <italic>Papss</italic> mutant over a deficiency were embryonic lethal. To test the role of Papss in sulfation in the SG, we checked for the presence of sulfated tyrosine using a sulfotyrosine antibody in WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutant embryos. In WT, we observed strong sulfotyrosine signals both in the apical membrane and as puncta in the cytoplasm of SG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1S2A</xref>). The cytoplasmic puncta colocalized with ManII-GFP signals, a medial Golgi marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that proteins undergoing tyrosine sulfation in the Golgi are detected by the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1S2C</xref>). In <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, the cytoplasmic punctate signals were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that sulfation in the Golgi is decreased. The signals at the apical membrane appeared similar or slightly reduced compared to WT, suggesting that sulfated molecules, possibly by maternally provided Papss, were still targeted apically, although it is not clear whether they were properly targeted to their original destination or mislocalized. Together with a previous study using Alcian Blue staining showing the loss of sulfated biomolecules in the <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>), these data suggest sulfation in the SG is dependent on Papss.</p><p><italic>Papss</italic> homozygous mutant embryos often showed overall defective embryonic morphology, such as defects in germ band retraction and head involution (39%; N=80/204; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–F</xref>). The heterozygous <italic>Papss</italic> mutant embryos produced by crossing <italic>Papss</italic> mutants with WT flies appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–F</xref>). A smaller percentage of transheterozygous embryos showed similar defects (10%; N=13/136), with many late-stage embryos appearing normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C, E and F</xref>). We conclude that transheterozygous embryos with more severe defects did not survive to late stages, but we cannot rule out the possibility that a secondary mutation at another gene locus contributes to the overall embryonic defects. Embryos with these morphological defects often showed defects in SG invagination, forming a SG close to the surface of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D, G and H</xref>). We used the embryos that formed the SG in the normal position for quantification and further analysis.</p><p>Using the adherens junction (AJ) marker E-cadherin (Ecad) signals, we analyzed SG lumen phenotypes in <italic>Papss</italic> homozygous mutant embryos and transheterozygotes. During stages 14–16, the WT SG lumen expanded consistently throughout its length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Papss</italic> mutant embryos exhibited irregularities in SG lumen expansion. At stage 14, when the WT SG lumen expansion began, more than 40% of <italic>Papss</italic> mutant embryos had either a thinner lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and I</xref>; 18%; N=7/38) or a slightly irregular lumen with bulges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and I</xref>; 24%; N=9/38). At stage 16, about half of <italic>Papss</italic> homozygous or mutant embryos or transheterozygotes over a deficiency showed an overall thin lumen with an irregular apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and I’</xref>), and the other half had an irregularly expanded lumen with thin and expanded regions along its length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and I’</xref>). Quantification of the SG lumen length and diameter at stage 16 showed that whereas the lumen length was comparable between WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), the diameter was significantly decreased or irregular, with a high degree of variation in <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and K’</xref>). Quantification of the SG lumen area at stage 16 revealed that <italic>Papss</italic> mutants’ SGs exhibiting the thin lumen phenotype had a smaller lumen size compared to WT. Together, these data suggest a role for Papss in SG lumen expansion primarily by expanding the lumen diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the SG lumen expansion defects are due to the loss of <italic>Papss</italic>, we performed a rescue experiment by overexpressing Papss in the SG using the SG-specific driver <italic>sage-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2009</xref>) in the <italic>Papss</italic> mutant background. <italic>Papss</italic> produces multiple isoforms, including Papss-PA/B/C/G (629 aa), Papss-PD (657 aa), and Papss-PE/F/H (630 aa), which differ only slightly in the N-terminus (Flybase; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flybase.org/">https://flybase.org/</ext-link>). Using three additional probes that detect different subsets of splice forms, we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization and found that all probes detected signals in the SG at varying levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). We generated UAS lines for Papss-PD and Papss-PE and found that overexpression of either isoform in the SG of WT embryos resulted in a normally expanded SG lumen (data for Papss-PE overexpression are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and I’</xref>). Given the high levels of <italic>Papss</italic> mRNA in the WT SG, the Papss protein is likely abundant in the SG, which may explain why further overexpression of Papss does not lead to any additional effects. Since our initial analysis showed identical rescue features in the SG for the generated UAS lines, we used the UAS-Papss-PD and UAS-Papss-PE lines interchangeably for further experiments (hereafter, when overexpressed, Papss-PD and Papss-PE will be referred to as Papss). When Papss was overexpressed in the SG of <italic>Papss</italic> mutant embryos, only a small fraction (4%; N=1/26) showed a thin lumen phenotype along the entire length of the SG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and I’</xref>). The majority of embryos (73%) showed either a normal, fully expanded lumen along the entire length of the SG, with occasional slight irregularities at the apical membrane (42%; N=11/26), or an irregularly expanded lumen, where some parts of the SG lumen were expanded and others were thin (31%; N=8/26) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and I’</xref>). SGs with normally expanded lumens had luminal geometry comparable to that of WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>). Interestingly, some of the embryos had an over-expanded SG lumen, often with a non-uniform diameter (24%; N=6/24; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and I’</xref>). To test whether the enzyme activity of Papss is required for its role in SG lumen expansion, we also generated UAS lines with mutations in the critical residues of the ATP sulfurylase (F593P) and APS kinase (K193A) domains using the Papss-PD isoform (See Materials and Methods for details; amino acid number is for Papss-PD). Overexpressing a mutant version of Papss containing both of these mutations in the SG did not rescue the SG phenotypes as WT Papss did, but it showed the same range of defects as <italic>Papss</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I’ and J-L</xref>). These data suggest that the sulfation activity of Papss is required for SG lumen expansion. Overall, although a range of phenotypes was present, the thin SG lumen phenotype was almost completely rescued by SG-specific expression of WT Papss, but not the enzyme-dead form.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of <italic>Papss</italic> disrupts the apical domain and aECM organization</title><p>To investigate the cellular basis of the thin SG lumen phenotype in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, we examined the localization of key apical membrane proteins and junctional markers. In WT SGs, the apical polarity protein Crb localized to the subapical region (SAR) between the apical surface (free apical area) and the AJs, and we observed clear Crb signals along the apical cell boundary of each SG cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In contrast, the Crb signals in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants appeared less prominently localized to the SAR in SG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We measured the Crb signal intensity in the SAR and the apical-medial region of SG cells. The ratio of the Crb signal intensity at SAR to apical-medial intensity was significantly lower in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating disorganization of the apical domain. The AJ marker Ecad and the septate junction (SJ) marker Discs large (Dlg) showed no apparent disruption in localization compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>).

Similarly, we observed relatively weak WGA signals in the apical membrane and the lumen of WT SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; n=25 SGs). Notably, the luminal signals showed multiple thin filamentous organizations traversing the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting heterogeneity of the luminal structure. In <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, WGA signals were increased in both the lumen and apical membrane, with the apical membrane signals appearing more diffuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; n=28 SGs). Interestingly, the luminal WGA signals in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants accumulated strongly on one side along the entire length of the lumen, whereas the thin filamentous WGA signals in WT SGs appeared to show no bias and were mostly centered in the lumen. In regions with a thin SG lumen, WGA was present in a highly condensed rod-like structure; in expanded regions, WGA signals showed either a similar condensed rod-like structure, favoring one side of the SG lumen, or a slightly condensed filamentous structure often broadly associated with the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

To examine the Golgi structures in more detail, we performed TEM analysis in WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SG cells. In contrast to the mammalian Golgi, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Golgi lacks the characteristic ribbon-like structure and is composed of a series of individual cisternae arranged in a random, disordered fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kondylis and Rabouille, 2009</xref>). While the Golgi in WT SG cells showed randomly arranged cisternae, the Golgi in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants showed abnormal arrangement, either stacked or compressed, with small electron-dense puncta along these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M and N</xref>), suggesting a functional defect and possible protein aggregation. Other organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), appeared relatively normal. SG-specific expression of GFP-KDEL, GFP fused to the ER retention motif KDEL, or immunostaining for prolyl-4-hydroxylase-alpha SG1, an ER-resident enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2006</xref>), showed no significant differences between WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). TEM analysis also revealed similar ER structures in WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). These data suggest that loss of <italic>Papss</italic> disrupts the Golgi, but not the ER.</p><p>To determine whether the phenotypes observed in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants are due to defects in Golgi structure and function, we examined the morphology of the SG in null mutants of two key Golgi components, GM130 and Grasp65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Both mutants were homozygous-viable. Although the GM130 null allele (<italic>GM130△<sup>23</sup></italic>) was extremely weak and difficult to grow, the embryos we managed to collect appeared normal, and the SG exhibited only mild irregularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>; n=5/5). It is possible that only relatively normal embryos survived until late stages of embryogenesis. However, <italic>Grasp65</italic> null mutants (<italic>Grasp65<sup>102</sup></italic>) exhibited a highly irregular SG lumen with condensed luminal WGA signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C</xref> and C; n=10/10). These data suggest that disrupted Golgi structures in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants may contribute to the SG defects.</p><p>The aberrant Golgi structures observed in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants prompted us to investigate the impact on intracellular trafficking components. We examined the localization of Rab11, a marker for recycling endosomes, Rab7, a marker for late endosomes, and Sec15, an exocyst marker. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung and Andrew, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Le and Chung, 2021</xref>), Rab11 and Sec15 were enriched along the apical domain of WT SG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O and Q</xref>). In <italic>Papss</italic> mutants SGs, we observed an increase in apical Rab11 signal intensity, with some signals mislocalized to the basolateral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P and S</xref>). In contrast, Sec15 signals were significantly reduced at the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R and T</xref>). Unlike Rab11 or Sec15, Rab7 localized in large punctate structures in the cytoplasm of WT SG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, the number of Rab7 puncta was significantly reduced, although the intensity of Rab7 puncta was not significantly different from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). TEM analysis revealed a number of electron-dense vesicles in the apical domain of SG cells in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3U</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SGs showed fewer electron-dense vesicles, but instead, we observed several larger, empty vesicle-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3V and W</xref>).

To test whether these acellular regions were caused by cell death, we stained embryos with an antibody against <italic>Drosophila</italic> cleaved death caspase-1 (DCP-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sarkissian et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, DCP-1 signals were often found within the acellular spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), suggesting that loss of <italic>Papss</italic> leads to abnormal cell death in the SG. TEM analysis also captured a dying cell in the <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SG, supporting the occurrence of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We found that <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SGs have a significantly higher number of these acellular spaces compared to WT SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Quantifying the number of SG cells at stage 16 revealed that <italic>Papss</italic> homozygous embryos and transheterozygotes have significantly fewer cells than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Overexpression of WT Papss, but not the mutant form of Papss, in the <italic>Papss</italic> mutant background decreased the number of acellular regions within the SG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and restored the number of SG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This suggests that loss of sulfation leads to conditions that hinder SG cell survival. Blocking apoptosis in the <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SG by overexpressing the baculoviral protein p35, a caspase inhibitor of apoptosis, also restored the SG cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that apoptosis is a key mechanism underlying SG cell loss in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants. Importantly, the SGs in these embryos still showed thin (25%; N=2/8) or irregularly expanded (75%; N=6/8) lumens, suggesting that SG lumen expansion defects in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants are independent of abnormal cell death.</p><p>Using srpHemo3x-mCh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gyoergy et al., 2018</xref>), we labeled hemocytes, which are analogous in function to macrophages in vertebrates. Hemocyte signals were often present in the acellular regions of the SG in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, suggesting that hemocytes may aid in apoptotic cell clearance from the SG epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). In normal epithelia, the basal ECM acts as a physical barrier, preventing hemocytes from migrating into the epithelial layer. To examine the integrity of the basal ECM in <italic>Papss,</italic> we used an antibody against Nidogen (Ndg), a glycoprotein with important linker functions in the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wolfstetter and Holz, 2012</xref>).

However, in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, Ndg signals were irregular and often disconnected, and hemocytes invaded SG cells through the gaps in the Ndg-positive basal ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

Pio antibody signals showed distinct localization, predominantly in the SG lumen and at the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). At stages 11 and 12, the Pio antibody revealed low levels of cytoplasmic punctate signals along with strong luminal signals, but from stage 13, Pio signals were predominantly localized to the SG lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, compared to the diffuse luminal mCh-Pio signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), Pio antibody signals in the SG lumen were heterogeneous with filamentous structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>), resembling luminal WGA signals. Pio antibody signals were absent at all stages in the <italic>pio</italic> null mutant, in which the entire ZP domain is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drees et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), confirming antibody specificity. The Pio protein is known to be cleaved, at one cleavage site after the ZP domain, possibly by a furin protease, and at another cleavage site within the ZP domain by the matriptase Notopleural (Np) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drees et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drees et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The latter cleavage site falls within the peptide sequence used to generate the Pio antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). A possible explanation for the different signals between mCh-Pio and Pio antibody signals is that the Pio antibody preferentially recognizes the C-terminal ZP domain fragment after furin and Np cleavage, whereas diffuse, luminal mCh-Pio signals are either the secreted Pio protein cleaved only by furin or the N-terminal fragment after Np cleavage.</p><p>Dpy-YFP signals from the Dpy-YFP knock-in line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lye et al., 2014</xref>; YFP insertion into the <italic>dpy</italic> locus near the middle of the protein) showed heterogeneous, filamentous structures in the SG lumen throughout SG morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) that colocalized with Pio antibody and WGA signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F”</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). It should be noted that because homozygous Dpy-YFP embryos showed a bulging and constricted SG lumen phenotype with highly condensed Dpy-YFP signals throughout the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), we used embryos with one copy of the transgene to analyze Dpy localization. Qsm localization was analyzed using the mCh-Qsm knock-in line, in which mCh is inserted into the <italic>qsm</italic> locus a few amino acids downstream of the N-terminal end of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu and Hayashi, 2021</xref>). Unlike Pio and Dpy, mCh-Qsm signals were not detected in the SG lumen. Instead, they showed a dynamic intracellular localization ranging from cytoplasmic signals with apical membrane enrichment (stages 11–14) and apical vesicular signals (stages 14–15) to prominent signals at the apical membrane and SJs (stage 16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). These data suggest that Qsm is not a component of the SG aECM. However, it is possible that the mCh-Qsm signals only detect the cleaved N-terminal fragment of Qsm, while the C-terminal fragment may localize to a different subcellular location. Taken together, our data suggest that Pio and Dpy form filamentous aECM structures in the SG.</p><p>We next examined Pio, mCh-Pio, Dpy-YFP, and mCh-Qsm signals in <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SGs at stages 14 and 16. At stage 14, Pio antibody and Dpy-YFP signals appeared condensed and enriched within the SG lumen, with reduced association with the apical membrane compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and G’</xref>). Interestingly, Pio antibody signals were barely detectable in the SG lumen at stage 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–H’’’</xref>), likely due to either protein degradation or epitope masking caused by aECM condensation and protein misfolding. In contrast, Dpy-YFP signals remained in the lumen at all stages and were condensed and localized to one side of the lumen at stage 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–H’’’</xref>), similar to WGA signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). mCh-Pio signals were depleted from the expanded region of the lumen, but weak signals colocalized with condensed Dpy-YFP signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We did not observe any significant differences in the localization or intensity of mCh-Qsm signals in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). These data suggest that the luminal pool of Pio and Dpy, which form filamentous structures, is significantly affected by the loss of <italic>Papss</italic>, resulting in the loss of Pio and the condensation and dissociation of the Dpy-containing aECM structure from the apical membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ZP domain matrix is required for uniform SG lumen diameter</title><p>We next investigated the role of Pio and Dpy in SG morphogenesis by analyzing SG lumen morphology in <italic>pio</italic> and <italic>dpy</italic> mutants. Immunostaining with Ecad revealed that <italic>pio</italic> null mutants formed relatively normal SGs up to stage 15, but stage 16 SGs showed dramatically abnormal luminal morphology characterized by multiple constrictions, with a slight expansion of the lumen between constrictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The constricted regions were severely narrowed to the point of almost no luminal space, and some luminal regions also showed a flat protrusion on one side of the SG lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Notably, these abnormal luminal shapes were associated with a progressive loss of luminal WGA and Dpy-YFP signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>). In <italic>pio</italic> mutants, WGA signals were comparable to WT at stages 13 and 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), but appeared slightly reduced and diffuse in the SG lumen at late stage 14, and this reduction became more pronounced at stage 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Dpy-YFP signals were more severely affected in <italic>pio</italic> mutants. Unlike the strong, filamentous luminal signals in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), Dpy-YFP signals were reduced and diffuse in the SG lumen and were detected in the cytoplasm of <italic>pio</italic> mutant SG cells from stage 12 to stage 14, with a conspicuous absence in the lumen at stage 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). By stage 16, both WGA and Dpy-YFP signals were completely absent from the lumen in <italic>pio</italic> mutants, whereas the signals were still present at the apical membrane and in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>). We conclude that WGA primarily detects Dpy in the SG lumen and that Pio is required for Dpy secretion to the SG lumen.</p><p>To test a role for Pio cleavage and localization in shaping the SG lumen, we analyzed embryos mutant for the matriptase Np, which cleaves Pio. In <italic>Np</italic> mutants, Pio and WGA signals were observed in both the apical membrane and lumen up to stage 14, similar to WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, at stage 16, Pio signals were observed closely associated with the apical membrane, with no luminal Pio signals present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that Np is required for this luminal pool of Pio. Importantly, <italic>Np</italic> mutants exhibited the same bulging and constricting SG luminal phenotype at stage 16 as <italic>pio</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>), indicating that the filamentous luminal Pio structure plays a crucial role in maintaining a uniform SG diameter. <italic>Dpy</italic> mutants (<italic>dpy<sup>ov1</sup></italic>; a spontaneous mutant with a transposable element insertion into intron 11) exhibited a more severe bulging and constriction phenotype in the SG lumen compared to <italic>pio</italic> mutants. Until stage 14, SGs in <italic>dpy</italic> mutants often showed a curved shape, but otherwise had a relatively normal morphology and uniform diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). At stages 15 and 16, SG lumen lost regularity and uniformity, often exhibiting multiple bulges and constrictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and G’</xref>). In constricting regions, we observed condensed Pio and WGA signals in the lumen, whereas in bulging regions, weak Pio and WGA signals were detected along the apical boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and G’</xref>). These data suggest a disrupted luminal scaffold that correlates with the bulging and constricting luminal morphology.</p><p>To further investigate the role of Np in cleaving Pio to organize the aECM during SG morphogenesis, we overexpressed WT (Np<sup>WT</sup>) and mutant (Np<sup>mut</sup>) forms of Np using the UAS-Np-Strep and UAS-Np.S990A-GFP lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drees et al., 2019</xref>). It should be noted that the endogenous Np remains when either form of Np is overexpressed in the SG. Overexpression of Np<sup>WT</sup> increased the intensity of luminal mCh-Pio signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), whereas overexpression of Np<sup>mut</sup> resulted in the absence of the mCh-Pio signals in the lumen but strong mCh-Pio signals close to the apical membrane and in the cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), supporting the role of Np in cleaving Pio to generate the luminal pool of Pio. In Np<sup>WT</sup>-overexpressing SGs, the overall intensity of Pio and Dpy-YFP signals also appeared increased at both the apical membrane and in the lumen compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). These embryos did not show obvious changes in the SG morphology. In Np<sup>mut</sup>-overexpressing SGs, Pio signals appeared to be increased at the apical membrane, and various levels of filamentous luminal signals were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–I’’</xref>). Importantly, the regions of the lumen lacking luminal Pio signals was always slightly expanded compared to the region with filamentous luminal Pio signals, supporting the idea that the luminal Pio pool is important for a uniform lumen diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and I’’</xref>; n=11/13). Dpy-YFP signals could not be analyzed properly with Np<sup>mut</sup> overexpression because of the GFP tag in the Np<sup>mut</sup> transgene. However, we detected two distinct pools of fluorescent signals in the GFP channel. The first pool was cytoplasmic punctate signals that colocalized with mCh-Pio, which we confirmed are Np<sup>mut</sup>-GFP signals in a separate staining, and the second pool was thin filamentous luminal signals that overlapped with Pio antibody signals, which we suspect are Dpy-YFP signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). These data suggest that overexpressed Np<sup>mut</sup> failed to cleave mCh-Pio and Pio, leading to their accumulation at and near the apical membrane, but the endogenous Np still cleaved some pool, resulting in low levels of filamentous luminal Pio structures. Taken together, our data suggest that Dpy and Pio form a luminal scaffold necessary for a uniform SG tube diameter and that Pio cleavage by Np is essential for forming this scaffold.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study highlights the critical role of Papss, a key enzyme that produces the universal sulfate donor PAPS, in aECM organization and lumen expansion in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic SG. <italic>Papss</italic> mutants show defective SG lumen expansion, accompanied by disruption of the apical domain of SG cells and the aECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Mutants of the key Golgi component Grasp65 show a mildly irregular SG lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), supporting the important role of the Golgi in establishing proper lumen dimensions during organ formation. Consistent with the idea that the secretory pathway plays a key role in trafficking aECM components to the lumen, several mutants in intracellular trafficking genes, such as <italic>CrebA</italic>, <italic>Sec61β</italic>, and <italic>Sar1</italic>, which encode a major transcription factor that boosts secretory capacity, a Sec61 translocon component, and a COPII vesicle formation component, respectively, have been shown to have a slightly thinner SG lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fox and Andrew, 2015</xref>).

For example, in the non-chitinous aECM of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> vulva and excretory duct, distinct aECM components, including zona pellucida (ZP) domain proteins, chondroitin proteoglycans, and glycoproteins, work together to form the lumens of these tubular organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2020b</xref>). Our work reveals that two ZP proteins, Dpy and Pio, play essential roles in organizing the aECM in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SG, highlighting the important role of ZP proteins in forming the non-chitinous luminal matrix during tubular organ formation. Dpy, a gigantic protein (&gt;2 MDa) with hundreds of epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats interspersed with a Dpy module, forms long filamentous structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilkin et al., 2000</xref>). With these filamentous structures, Dpy plays an essential role in the organization and attachment of apical structures in several tissues, including the thoracic cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilkin et al., 2000</xref>), embryonic trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaźwińska et al., 2003</xref>), pupal wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bökel et al., 2005</xref>), genitalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2020</xref>), and muscle tendon cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu and Hayashi, 2021</xref>). In the SG, aberrantly formed or lost luminal Dpy structures correlate with abnormal luminal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We propose that the Dpy filamentous structure provides mechanical support in the SG aECM and that proper organization of these structures is critical for the formation of a uniform tube diameter. WGA signals always colocalize with Dpy-YFP signals in WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, and both signals are absent from the lumen in <italic>pio</italic> mutants. WGA may primarily detect Dpy in the SG lumen by binding sugar residues that are attached to numerous EGF modules of the Dpy protein. A caveat to the analysis of Dpy using the Dpy-YFP line is that it is a non-functional fusion protein. An antibody against Dpy or a new functional fusion protein will be required to confirm Dpy localization. Even with this caveat, our data with the Pio antibody suggest that Dpy forms the filamentous luminal structure with Pio. Pio is required to secrete and maintain Dpy in the lumen of the SG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is consistent with a role for Pio in Dpy secretion in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drees et al., 2023</xref>) and suggests a conserved role for Pio in multiple tissues. Since the ZP domains of Pio and Dpy have been shown to bind directly to each other in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drees et al., 2023</xref>), it is likely that the binding of Pio and Dpy is required for the formation of filamentous luminal structures. This binding may require cleavage of Pio by the matriptase Np, which generates the filamentous luminal pool of Pio (C-terminal ZP fragment of Pio). <italic>Pio</italic> and <italic>Np</italic> mutants show similar bulging and constricting SG lumen morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that the generation of the C-terminal ZP fragment of Pio by Np is critical for the formation of the filamentous luminal structure with Dpy.</p><p>Papss plays an essential role in the formation of the filamentous Dpy/Pio structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It will be important to learn if the defects of the Pio-Dpy matrix in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants are a direct consequence of the loss of sulfation on these proteins or if it’s an indirect outcome. The ZP domain can mediate homomeric or heteromeric polymerization into filaments, and its structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds formed between conserved Cys residues responsible for the polymerization of ZP modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jovine et al., 2002</xref>). Defective disulfide bond formation due to defective sulfation may destabilize Pio-Dpy interactions. Additionally, hundreds of EGF modules in the Dpy protein are highly susceptible to O-glycosylation. Sulfation of the glycan groups attached to Dpy may be critical for its ability to form a filamentous structure. In the absence of sulfation, the glycan groups on Dpy may not properly interact with the surrounding materials in the lumen, resulting in an aggregated and condensed structure. However, additional key substrate(s) of Papss, such as mucins, may exist in the SG aECM that play a key role in lumen expansion and shape. The striking enrichment of <italic>Papss</italic> expression in the SG compared to other tubular organs, such as the trachea, implies that the key substrate(s) of Papss are likely unique to or more highly enriched in the SG aECM than in the tracheal aECM.</p><p>It will be interesting to determine the role of other ZP proteins highly expressed in the SG. Qsm, for example, has been found in the same intracellular vesicles as Dpy in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tendon cells and has been shown to physically interact with Dpy through their ZP domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu and Hayashi, 2021</xref>). Qsm has been shown to remodel Dpy filaments that link tendon cells to the pupal cuticle, increasing their tensile strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu and Hayashi, 2021</xref>). In the SG, we find that Qsm is mainly localized to cytoplasmic vesicles and AJ/SJ regions rather than being present in the SG lumen like Pio and Dpy. It should be noted that, like Pio, Qsm has a furin cleavage site near the transmembrane domain and another putative protease cleavage site in the ZP domain. Since the mCh-Qsm line contains the mCh insertion near the N-terminal end of the protein, the mCh-Qsm signals are likely those of the cleaved N-terminal fragment after cleavage by these proteases and will need to be confirmed using a western blot. Further investigation will be needed to determine the role of Qsm in junctional regions of SG cells. Also, the roles of other SG-upregulated ZP domain proteins remain to be elucidated.</p><p>In conclusion, our analysis of the <italic>Drosophila Papss</italic> gene, a single ortholog of human Papss1 and Papss2, reveals its multiple roles during SG development. We expect that these findings will provide important insights into the function of these enzymes in normal development and disease in humans. Our findings on the key role of two ZP proteins, Pio and Dpy, as major components of the SG aECM also provide valuable information on the organization of the non-chitinous aECM during organ formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and genetics</title><p>The fly stocks used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

Regions were manually drawn along the inner or outer boundary of the Ecad signals of each cell to mark the SAR and apical-medial regions. The mean gray value of the apical-medial Crb signals in each cell (the region delineated by the inner boundary of the Ecad signals) was quantified using Fiji. The mean gray value of the SAR Crb signals was calculated using the integrated densities and areas calculated with Fiji for regions between the inner and outer boundaries. To subtract the background, the average mean gray value of Crb signals for five regions outside the embryo was subtracted from the mean gray values of the SAR and apical-medial Crb signals in each SG cell. The ratio of the SAR to the apical-medial Crb level was compared. Seven and six embryos were used for the WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, respectively, and four to eight cells per SG.

This result clearly indicates that the sulfation activity of Papss is required for SG development.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>-The main concern is the lack of clear connection between sulfation and the phenotypes observed at the cellular level, and, importantly, the lack of connection between sulfation and the Pio-Dpy matrix. Indeed, the mechanism/s by which sulfation affects lumen expansion are not elucidated and no targets of this modification are identified or investigated. A direct (or instructive) role for sulfation in aECM organization is not clearly supported by the results, and the connection between sulfation and Pio/Dpy roles seems correlative rather than causative. As it is presented, the mechanisms by which sulfation regulates SG lumen expansion remains elusive in this study.</p><p>-In my opinion the authors overestimate their findings with several conclusions, as exemplified in the abstract:</p><p>&quot;In the absence of Papss, Pio is gradually lost in the aECM, while the Dpy-positive aECM structure is condensed and dissociates from the apical membrane, leading to a thin lumen. Mutations in dpy or pio, or in Notopleural, which encodes a matriptase that cleaves Pio to form the luminal Pio pool, result in a SG lumen with alternating bulges and constrictions, with the loss of pio leading to the loss of Dpy in the lumen. Our findings underscore the essential role of sulfation in organizing the aECM during tubular organ formation and highlight the mechanical support provided by ZP domain proteins in maintaining luminal diameter.&quot;</p><p>The findings leading to conclude that sulfation organizes the aECM and that the absence of Papss leads to a thin lumen due to defects in Dpy/Pio are not strong. The authors certainly show that Papss is required for proper Pio and Dpy accumulation. They also show that Pio is required for Dpy accumulation, and that Pio and Dpy form an aECM required for lumen expansion. However, the absence of Pio and Dpy do not fully recapitulate Papss mutant defects (thin lumen). I wonder whether other hypothesis and models could account for the observed results. For instance, a role for Papss affecting secretion, in which case sulfation would have an indirect role in aECM organization. This study does not address the mechanical properties of Dpy in normal and mutant salivary glands.</p><p>-Minor issues relate to the genotype/phenotype analysis. It is surprising that the authors detect only mild effects on sulfation in Papss mutants using an anti-sulfoTyr antibody, as Papss is the only Papss synthathase. Generating germ line clones (which is a feasible experiment) would have helped to prove that this minor effect is due to the contribution of maternal product. The loss of function allele used in this study seems problematic, as it produces effects in heterozygous conditions difficult to interpret. Cleaning the chromosome or using an alternative loss of function condition (another allele, RNAi, etc...) would have helped to present a more reliable explanation.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, I am pleased with the authors' revisions in response to my original comments and those of the other reviewers. The addition of the sulfation(-) mutant to Fig. 1 is particularly nice. I have just a few additional suggestions for text changes to improve clarity/precision.</p><p>(1) The current title of this manuscript is quite broad, making it sound like a review article. I recommend adding sulfation and salivary gland to the title to convey the main points more clearly. e.g. Sulfation affects apical extracellular matrix organization during development of the Drosophila salivary gland tube.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We agree and have changed the title of the paper as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1B shows very striking enrichment of papss expression in the salivary gland compared to other tubes like the trachea that also contain Pio and Dpy. To me, this implies that the key substrate(s) of Papss are likely to be unique, or at least more highly enriched, in the salivary gland aECM compared to the tracheal aECM (e.g. probably not Pio or Dpy themselves). I suggest that the authors address the implications of this apparent SG specificity in the discussion (paragraph beginning on p. 21, line 559).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree that there may be other key substrates of Papss in the SG, such as mucins, which play an important role in organizing the aECM and expanding the lumen. We have included a discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) p. 15, lines 374-376 &quot;The Pio protein is known to be cleaved, at one cleavage site after the ZP domain by the furin protease and at another cleavage site within the ZP domain by the matriptase Notopleural (Np) (Drees et al., 2019; Drees et al., 2023; Figure 5B).&quot; As far as I can see, the Drees papers show that Pio is cleaved somewhere in the vicinity of a consensus furin cleavage site, but do not actually establish that the cleavage happens at this exact site or is done by a furin protease (this is just an assumption). Please word more carefully, e.g. &quot;at one cleavage site after the ZP domain, possibly by a furin protease&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have edited the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Throughout the paper, I find a bit confusing the description of the lumen phenotype and their interpretations.</p><p>Papss mutants produce SG that are either &quot;thin&quot; or show &quot;irregular lumen with bulges&quot;. Do the authors think that these are two different manifestations of the same effect? or do they think that there are different causes behind?</p></disp-quote><p>The thin lumen phenotype appears to occur when the Pio-Dpy matrix is significantly condensed. When this matrix is less condensed in one region of the lumen than in other regions, the lumen appears irregular with bulges.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the defects in Grasp65 mutants categorized as &quot;irregular lumen with bulges&quot; similar to those in Papss mutants?

Multiple mutations in several Golgi components that more significantly disrupt Golgi structures and function may cause more severe defects in lumen expansion and shape.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How the defects described for Pio (&quot;multiple constrictions with a slight expansion between constrictions&quot;) and Dpy mutants (&quot;lumen with multiple bulges and constrictions&quot;) relate to the &quot;irregular lumen with bulges&quot; in Papss mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>pio and dpy mutants show more stereotypical phenotypes, while Papss mutants exhibit more irregular and random phenotypes. The irregular lumen phenotypes in Papss mutants are associated with a condensed Pio-Dpy matrix.</p></body></sub-article></article>
