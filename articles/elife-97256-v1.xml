As diurnal animals mature, feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, circadian sleep patterns are initiated with formation of a circuit connecting the central clock to arousal output neurons; emergence of circadian sleep also enables long-term memory (LTM). However, the cues that trigger the development of this clock-arousal circuit are unknown. Here, we identify a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. We find that in the 2nd instar larval period (L2), sleep and feeding are spread across the day; these behaviors become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar larval stage (L3). Forcing mature (L3) animals to adopt immature (L2) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit LTM. In addition, the development of the clock (DN1a)-arousal (Dh44) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. Finally, we demonstrate that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. Together, our data suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Like most young animals, babies must obtain enough nutrients and energy to grow, yet they also need to rest for their brains to mature properly. As many exhausted new parents know first-hand, balancing these conflicting needs results in frequent, rapid switches between eating and sleeping. Eventually, new-borns’ internal biological clock system, which is aligned with the 24-hour light cycle, becomes fully operational. Exactly how this then translates into allowing them to stay alert during the day and be sleepy at night is still unclear.</p><p>Like humans, the larvae of fruit flies first sleep haphazardly before developing a circadian pattern whereby they sleep at night and eat during the day. This shift occurs when a group of nerve cells called DN1a, whose job is to ‘keep time’, connects with Dh44, a subset of neurons which, when active, promote wakefulness. The trigger for these changes, however, has remained elusive.</p><p>In response, Poe et al. hypothesized that feeding behaviour and nutrient availability coordinated the emergence of sleep rhythms in fruit flies. Forcing fruit fly larvae to keep feeding in an ‘immature’ pattern – by either genetic manipulations or reducing the sugar content of their food – not only prevented them from developing ‘mature’ sleeping rhythms but also resulted in memory problems.</p><p>These experiments also showed that the DN1a-Dh44 connection depends on nutrient availability, as it did not form in larvae raised on the low-sugar food. Further genetic experiments showed that the Dh44 cells themselves act like nutrient sensors during the emergence of sleeping patterns.</p><p>These results shed new light on the factors triggering sleep rhythm development. Poe et al. hope that the understanding gained can be extended to humans and eventually help manage nervous system disorders and health problems associated with disrupted sleep during early life.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH DP2NS111996</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kayser</surname><given-names>Matthew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01NS120979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kayser</surname><given-names>Matthew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Award for Medical Scientists</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kayser</surname><given-names>Matthew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006792</institution-id><institution>Hartwell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poe</surname><given-names>Amy R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioral and circuit analyses show that changes to energetic demand are a key driver of consolidation of daily sleep and feeding patterns as animals mature.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of behavioral rhythms such as sleep-wake patterns is critical for brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vallone et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, early life circadian disruptions in rodents negatively impacts adult behaviors, neuronal morphology, and circadian physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Varcoe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mendez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ameen et al., 2022</xref>). Likewise, in humans, disruptions in sleep and rhythms during development are a common co-morbidity in neurodevelopmental disorders including ADHD and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoffmire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krakowiak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kotagal, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ednick et al., 2009</xref>). Although mechanisms encoding the molecular clock are well understood, little is known about how rhythmic behaviors first emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vallone et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmona-Alcocer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sehgal et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Poe et al., 2022</xref>). In particular, cues that trigger the consolidation of sleep and waking behaviors as development proceeds are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blumberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blumberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frank, 2020</xref>).</p><p>A key potential factor in the maturation of sleep patterns is the coincident change in feeding and metabolism during development. Early in development, most young animals must obtain enough nutrients to ensure proper growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh et al., 2023</xref>). Yet, developing organisms must also sleep to support nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vallone et al., 2007</xref>). These conflicting needs (feeding vs. quiescence) result in rapid transitions between sleeping and feeding states early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adair and Bauchner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levin and Stern, 1975</xref>). As development proceeds, nutritional intake and storage capacity increase, allowing for the consolidation of feeding and sleep to specific times of day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2018</xref>). These changes in nutritional storage capacity are likely conserved as mammalian body composition and nutritional capacity change over infant development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Toro-Ramos et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> show rapid increases in overall larval body size including the size of the fat body (used for nutrient storage) across development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butterworth et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacobs et al., 2020</xref>). However, the role that developmental change in metabolic drive plays in regulating the consolidation of behavioral rhythms is not known.</p><p>In adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, sleep and feeding behaviors are consolidated to specific times of day with flies eating more in the day than the night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, early in development, sleep in 2nd instar <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (L2) lacks a circadian pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poe et al., 2023</xref>). We previously determined that sleep-wake rhythms are initiated in early 3rd instar <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (L3) (72 hr AEL). DN1a clock neurons anatomically and functionally connect to Dh44 arousal output neurons to drive the consolidation of sleep in L3. Development of this circuit promotes deeper sleep in L3 resulting in the emergence of long-term memory (LTM) capabilities at the L3 stage but not before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poe et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Here, we identify the cues that trigger the emergence of the DN1a-Dh44 circuit and the consolidation of sleep-wake rhythms in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. We demonstrate that developmental changes to energetic demands drive consolidation of periods of sleep and feeding across the day as animals mature. While endogenous deeper sleep in L3 facilitates LTM, we find that experimentally inducing deep sleep prematurely in L2 is detrimental to development and does not improve LTM performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that DN1a-Dh44 circuit formation is developmentally plastic, as rearing on an insufficient nutritional environment prevents establishment of this neural connection. Finally, we find that Dh44 neurons require glucose metabolic genes to promote sleep-wake rhythm development, suggesting that these neurons sense the nutritional environment to promote circadian-sleep crosstalk.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Energetic demands limit developmental onset of rhythmic behaviors</title><p>The emergence of circadian sleep-wake rhythms in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae is advantageous as it enables long-term memory capabilities at the L3 stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poe et al., 2023</xref>). Less mature larvae (L2) do not exhibit consolidated sleep-wake patterns, prompting us to ask why rhythmic behaviors do not emerge earlier in life. To determine if the absence of rhythmic sleep-wake patterns in L2 might be related to feeding patterns, we examined larval feeding rate (# mouth hook contractions in a 5-min period) under constant conditions at 4 times across the day (Circadian Time [CT] 1, CT7, CT13, and CT19) in developmentally age-matched 2nd (L2) and early 3rd instar (L3; 72 hr AEL) larvae. While we observed no differences in feeding rate across the day in L2, we found that L3 show diurnal differences in feeding with higher feeding rate during the subjective day compared to the subjective night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Analysis of total food intake indicated that L2 consume the same amount at CT1 and CT13; however, L3 consume more at CT1 than at CT13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To assess whether the daily pattern of feeding in early L3 is dependent on the canonical circadian biological clock, we examined feeding rate in null mutants for the clock gene <italic>tim</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Konopka and Benzer, 1971</xref>). We observed no differences in feeding rate across the day in L3 <italic>tim</italic> mutants indicating that the daily feeding pattern requires a functioning molecular clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These findings underscore the tight relationship between sleep and feeding across development as diurnal differences in sleep emerge concurrently at the L3 stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poe et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Energetic drive limits sleep rhythm development.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Feeding rate (# of mouth hook contractions per 5 min) of L2 controls (<bold>A</bold>) L3 raised on regular (ctrl) food (<bold>B</bold>) L3 clock mutants (<bold>C</bold>) and L3 raised on low sugar (L.S.) food (<bold>D</bold>) across the day.

First, we devised a nutritional paradigm with reduced sugar content but otherwise normal food (low sugar, 1.2% glucose, L.S.). Critically, this paradigm did not affect any measures of larval growth or development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>) in contrast to numerous other diets that were assessed. We found that the feeding pattern in L3 raised on L.S. food closely resembled that of L2 on normal food (8% glucose), with feeding spread out across the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Compared to L3 raised on control food, this paradigm was also associated with loss of diurnal differences in sleep duration, sleep bout number, and arousal threshold (indicating less deep sleep) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Next, to avoid chronic effects of this dietary manipulation, we acutely stimulated feeding in L3 reared on normal food using thermogenetic activation of NPF +neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2017</xref>). Like L.S. conditions, enforcing a constant feeding pattern through NPF +neuron activation led to loss of sleep rhythms and loss of deep sleep (higher arousal threshold) in L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Immature feeding strategies limit LTM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Feeding rate of L3 expressing <italic>npf-</italic>Gal4 &gt;<italic>UAS-TrpA1</italic> and genetic controls at 30 °C at CT13.

Our CCHa1 peptide data suggest that Dh44 neurons may undergo changes in CCHa1-R expression or subcellular localization between the L2 and L3 stages: we only observed an increase in Dh44 neural activity in response to the bath application of CCHa1 peptide at the L3 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Interestingly, this increase in activity is absent in low nutrient conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) suggesting that the larval nutritional environment may also modulate CCHa1-R localization or expression. Indeed, we observed a disruption of sleep rhythms in L3 when glucose metabolic genes are knocked down in Dh44 neurons, demonstrating that post-synaptic processes likely initiate onset of circadian sleep. These findings raise intriguing questions for how changes in an organism’s energetic and nutritional state influence sleep-circadian circuit development. Perhaps larval Dh44 neurons respond to an increase in glucose levels in the environment by promoting CCHa1-R localization to the membrane. In this model, changes in CCHa1-R subcellular localization allow Dh44 neurons to become competent to receive clock-driven cues, while this or other Dh44-derived signals promote circuit connectivity with DN1as to drive consolidation of sleep at the L3 stage. There are no available antibodies or endogenous fluorescent reporters of CCHa1-R, limiting our ability to examine receptor subcellular localization. Additionally, while our study focuses on presumed CCHa1 synaptic signaling between DN1a and Dh44 neurons, we cannot rule out the possibility of CCHa1 volume transmission from DN1as or other sources as contributors to sleep-wake regulation. Regardless, our data open avenues for future work on the molecular and subcellular mechanisms regulating DN1a-Dh44 circuit development.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that larvae exhibit both sleep-wake and feeding daily rhythms at the L3 stage, but not earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poe et al., 2023</xref>). This raises the obvious question of whether sleep and feeding are opposite sides of the same coin. While larvae cannot eat when they are sleeping, we have observed distinct effects of certain manipulations on sleep behaviors but not feeding. For example, knockdown of <italic>Hex-C</italic> in Dh44 neurons disrupts sleep rhythms with no obvious effect on feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). It is, of course, possible to affect both sleep and feeding behaviors with the same manipulation (e.g. activation of NPF +neurons) underscoring that they are highly inter-connected behaviors. Future work will leverage the larval system to examine how sleep-wake and feeding circuitry communicate to balance these rhythmic behaviors across developmental periods.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>The following lines have been maintained as lab stocks or were obtained from Dr. Amita Sehgal: iso31, tim0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Konopka and Benzer, 1971</xref>), Dh44<sup>VT</sup>-Gal4 (VT039046) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>), cry-Gal4 pdf-Gal80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>), UAS-TrpA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>), UAS-mCherry RNAi, LexAOP-GCaMP6 UAS-P2X2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yao et al., 2012</xref>), and UAS-GCaMP7f.

Temporally adjacent images were subtracted to generate maps of pixel value intensity change. A binary threshold was set such that individual pixel intensity changes that fell below 40 gray-scale units within each well were set equal to zero (‘no change’) to eliminate noise. For 3rd instars, the threshold was set to 45 to account for larger body size. Pixel changes greater than or equal to threshold value were set equal to one (‘change’). Activity was then calculated by taking the sum of all pixels changed between images. Sleep was defined as an activity value of zero between frames. For 2nd instar sleep experiments done across the day, total sleep was summed over 6 hr beginning 2 hr after the molt to second instar. For sleep experiments performed at certain circadian times, total sleep in the second hour after the molt to second (or third) instar was summed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Feeding behavior analysis</title><p>For feeding rate analysis, newly molted 2nd instar or 3rd instar larvae were placed in individual wells of the LarvaLodge containing 120 µl of 3% agar and 2% sucrose media covered with a thin layer of yeast paste. Larvae were then imaged continuously with a Sony HDR-CX405 HD Handycam camera (B&amp;H Photo, Cat. No: SOHDRCX405) for 5 minutes. The number of mouth hook contractions (feeding rate) was counted manually over the imaging period and raw numbers were recorded. For food intake analysis, newly molted 2nd instar or 3rd instar larvae were starved for 1 hr in petri dishes with water placed on a Kimwipe. To compare groups of larvae of similar body weights, 13 L3 larvae and 26 L2 larvae were grouped together. Larvae were placed in a petri dish containing blue-dyed 3% agar, 2% sucrose, and 2.5% apple juice with blue-dyed yeast paste on top for 4 hr at 25 °C in constant darkness. We found that 4 hr on blue-dyed agar was sufficient to reflect total food consumption in each condition with a shorter period of time (1 hr) causing more variability. After 4 hr, groups of larvae were washed in water, put in microtubes, and frozen at –80 °C for 1 hr. Frozen larvae were then homogenized in 300 µl of distilled water and spun down for 5 min at 13,0000 rpm. The amount of blue dye in the supernatant was then measured using a spectrophotometer (OD<sub>629</sub>).

Experiments were conducted on assay plates (100X15 mm, Genesee Scientific, Cat. No: 32–107) filled with a thin layer of 2.5% agarose containing either pure agarose (EMSCO/Fisher, Cat. No: 16500–500) or agarose plus reinforcer. As olfactory stimuli, we used 10 µl amyl acetate (AM, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No: STBF2370V, diluted 1:50 in paraffin oil-Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No: SZBF140V) and octanol (OCT, Fisher Scientific, Cat. No: SALP564726, undiluted). Odorants were loaded into the caps of 0.6 mL tubes (EMSCO/Fisher, Cat. No: 05-408-123) and covered with parafilm (EMSCO/Fisher, Cat. No: 1337412). For naïve preferences of odorants, a single odorant was placed on one side of an agarose plate with no odorant on the other side. A group of 30 larvae were placed in the middle. After 5 min, individuals were counted on the odorant side, the non-odorant side, or in the middle. The naïve preference was calculated by subtracting the number of larvae on the non-odorant side from the number of larvae on the odorant side and then dividing by the total number of larvae. For naïve preference of quinine, a group of 30 larvae were placed in the middle of a half agarose-half quinine plate. After 5 min, individuals were counted on the quinine side, the agarose side, or in the middle. The naïve preference for quinine was calculated by subtracting the number of larvae on the quinine side from the number of larvae on the agarose side and then dividing by the total number of larvae. Larvae were trained by exposing a group of 30 larvae to AM while crawling on agarose medium plus quinine reinforcer. After 5 min, larvae were transferred to a fresh Petri dish containing agarose alone with OCT as an odorant (AM+/OCT). A second group of 30 larvae received the reciprocal training (AM/OCT+). Three training cycles were used for all experiments. For long-term memory, larvae were transferred after training onto agarose plates with a small piece of Kimwipe moistened with tap water and covered in dry active yeast (LabScientific, Cat. No: FLY804020F). Larvae were then kept in the dark for 1.5 hr before testing memory performance. Training and retention for thermogenetic experiments were conducted at 30 °C. For short-term memory, larvae were immediately transferred after training onto test plates (agarose plus reinforcer) on which AM and OCT were presented on opposite sides of the plate. After 5 min, individuals were counted on the AM side, the OCT side, or in the middle. We then calculated a preference index (PREF) for each training group by subtracting the number of larvae on the conditioned stimulus side from the number of larvae on the unconditioned stimulus side. For one set of experiments, we calculated two PREF values: (1 a) PREF<sub>AM+/OCT</sub> = (#AM - #OCT)/ # TOTAL; (1b) PREF<sub>AM/OCT+</sub> = (#OCT-#AM)/ # TOTAL. We then took the average of each PREF value to calculate an associative performance index (PI) as a measure of associative learning.

Thus, they cannot show that sleep during L2 stage would be sufficient to form LTM.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the experiments with Gaboxadol feeding in L2 did not perfectly mimic L3 sleep behaviors. However, genetic induction of sleep in L2 was effective in increasing sleep duration and depth similar to that observed in normal L3. As noted below in response to specific reviewer comments, because gaboxadol feeding is standard in the field for adult sleep induction, we prefer to still include this data in the manuscript for transparency. Moreover, the gaboxadol manipulation did cause a significant decrease in arousal threshold compared to control larvae. Together these approaches support the hypothesis that sleeping more/more deeply is not sufficient to promote LTM in L2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest that larval Dh44 neurons may integrate &quot;information about the nutritional environment through the direct sensing of glucose levels to modulate sleep-wake rhythm development&quot;. They identify glucose metabolism genes (e.g., Glut1) in the downstream DH44 neurons as being required for the organization of the sleep-wake-feeding rhythm, and that CCHa signaling in DN1a signaling to the DH44 cells via the receptor. However, how this is connected is not well explained. Do the authors think that the nutrient sensing is only occurring in the DH44 neurons and not in DN1a or other neurons? Would not knocking down glucose metabolism in any neuron lead to a functional defect? What is the evidence that Dh44 neurons are specific sensors of nutritional state? For example, do the authors think that e.g. the overexpression of Glut1 in Dh44 neurons, a manipulation that can increase transport of glucose into cells, would rescue the effects of low-sugar food?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions and have added the experiment proposed. We found that knockdown of Hex-C in DN1a neurons did not disrupt sleep-wake rhythms (Fig. S4G-I) suggesting that Dh44 neurons are specialized in requiring glucose metabolism to drive sleep-wake rhythms. We have also added further clarification in the text regarding the existing evidence that Dh44 neurons act has nutrient sensors.</p><p>Some of the genetic controls seem to be inconsistent suggesting some genetic background effects. In Figure 2B, npf-gal4 flies without the UAS show no significant circadian change in sleep duration, whereas UAS-TrpA flies do. The genetic control data in Figure 2D are also inconsistent. Npf-Gal4 seems to have some effect by itself without the UAS. The same is not seen with R76G11-Gal4. Suppl Fig 2: Naïve OCT and AM preference in L3 expressing various combinations of the transgenes show significant differences. npf-Gal4 alone seems to influence preference.</p><p>The sleep duration and bout number/length data are highly variable.</p><p>All experiments are performed in isogenized background so variability seen in genetic controls likely reflects stochastic nature of behavioral experiments. Indeed, adult sleep data also shows a great deal of variability within the same genetic background (PMID: 29228366). We agree it is an important point, and we attempt to minimize variability as much as possible with backcrossing of flies and tight control of environmental conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Low sugar exposure and activation of NPF neurons might not induce the same behavioral changes. LS exposure does not enhance mouth hook movements, but overall food intake. NPF activation seems to enhance mouth hook movements, but the data for food intake is not shown. This information would be necessary to compare the two different manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. However, we elected not to perform food intake experiments with the NPF activation experiments. Since we are not directly comparing the low sugar and NPF manipulations to each other, we think that both experiments together support the conclusion that immature food acquisition strategies (whether food intake or feeding rate) limit LTM performance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors write that the larval feeding assays run for 4 hours, can they explain why that long? Larvae should already have processed food within 4 hours, so that the measurement would not include all eaten food.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the rationale for doing 4 hour feeding assays in the results section. We did 4 hours on blue dyed food because initial experiments of 1 hour with control L3 at CT1-4 were difficult to interpret. The measurement does not include all of the eaten food in the 4 hours but does reflect more long-term changes in food intake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sleep induction with Gaboxadol seems to not really work - sleep duration, bout number and length are not enhanced, and arousal threshold is only slightly lower. Thus, the authors should not use this data as an example for inducing sleep behaviour.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this approach did not have a large effect in larvae. However, because gaboxadol feeding is standard in the field for adult sleep induction, we prefer to still include this data in the manuscript for transparency. Moreover, the Gaboxadol manipulation did cause a mild (but significant) decrease in arousal threshold compared to control larvae. Gaboxadol feeding also caused a significant decrease in total body weight compared to control larvae indicating that even slightly deeper sleep could be detrimental to younger animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Activation of R76G11 with TrpA1 seems to work better for inducing sleep like behaviour. However, the authors describe that they permanently activated neurons. To induce a &quot;normal&quot; sleep pattern, the authors might try to only activate these neurons during the normal enhanced sleep time in L3 (CT13?) and not during the whole day. This might also allow larvae to eat during day time and gain more weight.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that this point was not clearer, but we did do acute activation of R76G11(+) neurons, as proposed by the reviewer. We have clarified the text to make this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be interesting to see how larvae fed with high sucrose and low protein diet would behave in this assay. Do the authors suggest that sugar is most important for the development of sleep behaviour or that it is a combination of sugar and protein that might be required?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that feeding larvae a high sucrose and low protein diet would be interesting. However, we initially tried a low protein diet and observed significant developmental delays. Therefore, we are concerned that developmental defects on a high sucrose and low protein diet would confound behavioral results. Additionally, the Dh44 manipulations (glucose &amp; GCN2 signaling) suggest that sugar is the most important for the development of sleep behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors could discuss if the interaction between DN1a clock neurons and Dh44 neurons is mediated synaptic or by volume transmission following the extracellular release of the CCHa1 neuropeptide.
