knowledge of how its development proceeds across life in health. Achieving consensus on the precise cortical asymmetries in humans is necessary to uncover the developmental timing of asymmetry and the extent to which it arises through genetic and later influences in childhood. Here, we delineate population-level asymmetry in cortical thickness and surface area vertex-wise in seven datasets and chart asymmetry trajectories longitudinally across life (4–89 years; observations = 3937; 70% longitudinal). We find replicable asymmetry interrelationships, heritability maps, and test asymmetry associations in large–scale data. Cortical asymmetry was robust across datasets. Whereas areal asymmetry is predominantly stable across life, thickness asymmetry grows in childhood and peaks in early adulthood. Areal asymmetry is low-moderately heritable (max h<sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub> ~19%) and correlates phenotypically and genetically in specific regions, indicating coordinated development of asymmetries partly through genes. In contrast, thickness asymmetry is globally interrelated across the cortex in a pattern suggesting highly left-lateralized individuals tend towards left-lateralization also in population-level right-asymmetric regions (and vice versa), and exhibits low or absent heritability. We find less areal asymmetry in the most consistently lateralized region in humans associates with subtly lower cognitive ability, and confirm small handedness and sex effects. Results suggest areal asymmetry is developmentally stable and arises early in life through genetic but mainly subject-specific stochastic effects, whereas childhood developmental growth shapes thickness asymmetry and may lead to directional variability of global thickness lateralization in the population.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain development</kwd><kwd>lateralization</kwd><kwd>population neuroscience</kwd><kwd>lifespan</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>283634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fjell</surname><given-names>Anders M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>725025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fjell</surname><given-names>Anders M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>313440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walhovd</surname><given-names>Kristine B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norwegian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>249931</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fjell</surname><given-names>Anders M</given-names></name><name><surname>Walhovd</surname><given-names>Kristine B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norwegian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>302854</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yunpeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Brain asymmetry in cortical surface area shows lifespan stability from early childhood to old age and is more underpinned by genetic differences, whereas asymmetry in cortical thickness grows through childhood and adolescence and is minimally explained by genetics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain’s hemispheres exhibit high contralateral symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">van Kesteren and Kievit, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stark et al., 2008</xref>), homotopic regions are under similar genetic influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schmitt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eyler et al., 2014</xref>) and show highly correlated developmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schmitt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Raznahan et al., 2011</xref>).

Cortical thickness and surface area are known to exhibit distinct asymmetry patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>), albeit reported inconsistently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiarello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Luders et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lyttelton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sha et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maingault et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shaw et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hamilton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Koelkebeck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plessen et al., 2014</xref>). Yet achieving consensus on cortical asymmetries in humans is a prerequisite to uncover the genetic-developmental and lifespan influences that shape and alter them. Although an extensive literature in search of structural asymmetry deviations in various conditions and disorders is in several cases being challenged by newer data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kong et al., 2022</xref>), at least some aspects of cortical asymmetry are confirmed to be subtly reduced in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Postema et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sha et al., 2022</xref>), but also through later life influences such as aging, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Thompson et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, altered cortical asymmetry at various lifespan stages may be associated with reduced brain health. However, it is currently unknown how cortical asymmetry development proceeds across life in health, because no previous study has charted cortical asymmetry trajectories from childhood to old age using longitudinal data.</p><p>Compounding the lack of longitudinal investigation, previous large-scale studies do not delineate the precise brain regions exhibiting robust cortical asymmetry, relying on brain atlases with predefined anatomical boundaries that may not conform well to the underlying asymmetry of cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sha et al., 2021b</xref>). Taking an atlas-free approach to delineate asymmetries that reliably reproduce across international samples as starting point (i.e. population-level asymmetries) would better enable mapping of the developmental principles underlying structural cortical asymmetries, as well as the genetic and individual-specific factors associated with cortical lateralization. Furthermore, such an approach would help resolve the many reported inconsistencies for cortical asymmetry maps – for example reports of both right- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maingault et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hamilton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Williams et al., 2022</xref>) and left- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Luders et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plessen et al., 2014</xref>) thickness lateralization in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiarello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maingault et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shaw et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Koelkebeck et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Luders et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sha et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plessen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Williams et al., 2023</xref>), and of right- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maingault et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2014</xref>) and left areal lateralization of superior temporal sulcus (STS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Remer et al., 2017</xref>) – while serving as a high-fidelity phenotype for future brain asymmetry studies to complement existing low-resolution atlases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Determining the developmental and lifespan trajectories of cortical asymmetry may shed light on how cortical asymmetries are shaped through childhood or set from early life, and provide evidence of the timing of expected brain change in normal development. Although important in and of itself, this would also provide a useful normative reference, as subtly altered cortical asymmetry – in terms of both area and thickness – has been linked at the group-level to neurodevelopmental disorders along the autism spectrum, suggesting altered lateralized neurodevelopment may be a relevant outcome in at least some cases of developmental perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Postema et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sha et al., 2022</xref>). For areal asymmetry, surprisingly few studies have charted developmental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Remer et al., 2017</xref>) or aging-related effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Williams et al., 2022</xref>), although indirect evidence in neonates suggests adult-like patterns of areal asymmetry are evident at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Williams et al., 2023</xref>) and may exhibit little change from birth to 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2014</xref>) despite rapid and concurrent developmental cortical expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2013</xref>). For thickness asymmetry, longitudinal increases in asymmetry have been shown during the first two years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2015</xref>), with suggestions of rapid asymmetry growth from birth to 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2015</xref>), and potentially continued growth until adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nie et al., 2013</xref>). However, previous lifespan studies mapped thickness asymmetry linearly across cross-sectional developmental and adult age-ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plessen et al., 2014</xref>), mostly concluding thickness asymmetry is minimal in infancy and maximal age ~60. In contrast, recent work established thickness asymmetry shows a non-linear decline from 20 to 90 years that is reproducible across longitudinal aging cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, although offering viable developmental insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plessen et al., 2014</xref>), previous lifespan studies of thickness asymmetry do not accurately capture the aging process, and likely conflate non-linear developmental and aging trajectories with linear models. A longitudinal exploration of the lifespan trajectories of thickness asymmetry accounting for dynamic change is needed to further knowledge of normal human brain development.</p><p>Correlations between cortical asymmetries may provide a window on asymmetries formed under common genetic or developmental influences. Contemporary research suggests brain asymmetries are complex, multifactorial and independent (i.e. uncorrelated) traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rentería, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Francks, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Neubauer et al., 2020</xref>), contrasting earlier theories emphasizing a single (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Annett, 1964</xref>) or predominating factor controlling various cerebral lateralizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McManus and Bryden, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Geschwind and Galaburda, 1985</xref>).

Where reported, evidence suggests cortical asymmetries are mostly independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sha et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guadalupe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiarello et al., 2013</xref>) – in line with a multifactorial view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rentería, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Francks, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Currently, it is unknown whether or which cortical asymmetries are reliably correlated within individuals, though this may signify coordinated development of left-right brain asymmetries through genetic or lifespan influences – a genetic or later developmental account depending on trait heritability and whether phenotypic correlations are underpinned by genetic correlations.</p><p>Finally, altered development of cerebral lateralization has been widely hypothesized to relate to average poorer cognitive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plessen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crow et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hirnstein et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically in the context of cortical asymmetry, however, although one previous study reported larger thickness asymmetry may relate to better verbal and visuospatial cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plessen et al., 2014</xref>), phenotypic asymmetry-cognition associations have been rarely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plessen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Moodie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Yeo et al., 2016</xref>), conflicting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Moodie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Yeo et al., 2016</xref>), not comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plessen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Moodie et al., 2020</xref>), and to date remain untested in large-scale data. Still, recent work points to small but significant overlap between genes underlying multivariate brain asymmetries and those influencing educational attainment and specific developmental disorders impacting cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sha et al., 2021b</xref>), indicating either pleiotropy between non-related traits or capturing shared genetic susceptibility to altered brain lateralization and cognitive outcomes. However, most large-scale studies examining factors widely assumed important for asymmetry have used brain atlases with limited spatial precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sha et al., 2021b</xref>).

Therefore, as a final step, we reasoned that combining an optimal delineation of population-level cortical asymmetries with big data would optimize detection and quantification of the effects of factors purportedly related to asymmetry, namely cognitive ability, handedness, and sex.</p><p>Here, we first aimed to delineate population-level cortical areal and thickness asymmetries using vertex-wise analyses and their overlap in seven international datasets. With a view to gaining insight into cortical asymmetry development, we then aimed to trace a series of lifespan and genetic analyses. Specifically, we chart the developmental and lifespan trajectories of cortical asymmetry for the first time longitudinally across the lifespan. Next, we examine phenotypic interregional asymmetry correlations, under the assumption correlations indicate coordinated development of left-right asymmetries through genes or lifespan influences. To shed light on the extent to which differences in asymmetry are genetic, we test heritability of asymmetry using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and extended twin data, and examine whether or not phenotypic correlations are underpinned by genetic correlations suggestive of coordinated development through genes. Finally, we screen our set of robust, population-level asymmetries for association with general cognitive ability and factors purportedly related to asymmetry in UK Biobank (UKB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Miller et al., 2016</xref>). Based on findings of aging-related dedifferentiation in thickness asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>), we hypothesized trajectories of cortical thickness would show developmental growth in thickness asymmetry (i.e. differentiation), but remained agnostic regarding lifespan areal asymmetry development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Population-level asymmetry of the cerebral cortex</title><p>First, to delineate cortical regions exhibiting population-level areal and thickness asymmetry, we assessed asymmetry vertex-wise in 7 independent adult samples and quantified overlapping effects (Methods).

Specifically, a large left-asymmetric region in and around SMG/perisylvian (#1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) showed strong asymmetry by age ~4 that was largely maintained throughout life through steady aging-associated decline of both hemispheres, whereas leftward asymmetry of temporal cortex (#2,6) and anterior insular (#4) was maintained through developmental expansion and aging-associated decline of both hemispheres.

Of note, while several areal asymmetry cluster-pairs exhibiting post-corrected significance in the SNP-based analysis were estimated to show high twin-based genetic correlation, these did not survive correction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The high overlap in effects between seven datasets from four countries here suggests these results likely apply universally. This evident consensus suggests genetic-developmental programs regulate mean brain lateralization with respect to both area and apparent thickness in humans. However, the genetic findings presented herein suggest these may have reached population fixation, as heritability of even our optimally delineated asymmetry measures was generally low. This indicates either subject-specific stochastic mechanisms in early neurodevelopment or later developmental influences primarily determine cortical asymmetry. Tracing their lifespan development, we show the trajectories of areal asymmetry primarily suggest this form of asymmetry is developmentally stable at least from age ~4, maintained throughout life, and formed early on – possibly in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sha et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Williams et al., 2023</xref>) (while we cannot extrapolate to ages before our sample begins, we note this agrees with findings in neonates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Williams et al., 2023</xref>). One interpretation of lifespan stability combined with low heritability may be stochastic early-life developmental influences determine individual differences in areal asymmetry more than later developmental change, but work linking prenatal and childhood trajectories is needed to affirm this. Still, we also found relatively stronger heritability for areal asymmetry (notably, anterior insula exhibited ~19% SNP-heritability). This also illustrates region-dependent genetic effects upon areal asymmetry, and high genetic correlations suggest specific areal asymmetries are formed under common genetic influence. In contrast, childhood development of thickness asymmetry until a peak around age ~24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>), higher directional variability in adult samples, and lower heritability all converge to suggest thickness asymmetry may be more shaped through subject-specific effects in later childhood, possibly through interaction with the environment. This interpretation applied to asymmetry also agrees with work suggesting cortical area in general may trace more to early-life factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grasby et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rakic, 1995</xref>) whereas thickness may be more impacted by lifespan influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grasby et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fjell et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Lifespan trajectories</title><p>Our longitudinal description of cortical asymmetry lifespan trajectories gleaned novel insight into normal brain maturation. For areal asymmetry, adult-like patterns of lateralization were strongly established before age ~4, indicating areal asymmetry traces back further and does not primarily emerge through later cortical expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wierenga et al., 2014</xref>). Rather, the lifespan trajectories predominantly show stability from childhood to old age, as asymmetry was maintained through periods of developmental expansion and aging-related change that were region-specific and bilateral. This may align with evidence indicating areal asymmetry may be primarily determined in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Williams et al., 2023</xref>), including evidence suggesting little change in areal asymmetry from birth to 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wierenga et al., 2014</xref>), and little difference between maps derived from neonates and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Williams et al., 2023</xref>). It may also fit with the principle that the primary microstructural basis of cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rakic, 1995</xref>) – the number of and spacing between cortical minicolumns – is determined in prenatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rakic, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fjell et al., 2019</xref>), and agree with work suggesting asymmetry at this microstructural level may underly hemispheric differences in surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chance et al., 2006</xref>). The developmental trajectories agree with studies indicating areal asymmetry is established and strongly directional early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Remer et al., 2017</xref>). That change in surface area later in development follows embryonic gene expression gradients may also agree with a prenatal account for areal asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fjell et al., 2019</xref>). Our results may therefore constrain the extent to which areal asymmetry can be viewed as a plastic feature of brain organization, and may even suggest areal asymmetry may sometimes be a marker for innate hemispheric specializations shared by most humans. Although future research is needed to assess structure-function relationships, the degree of precision with which leftward areal asymmetry follows the contours of auditory regions in the Sylvian fissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that show left functional lateralization may be one example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chance et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ocklenburg et al., 2018</xref>); we found ~94% of individuals exhibited leftward areal asymmetry here – the most consistently lateralized cortical region in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, although weak thickness asymmetry was evident by age ~4, we observed childhood developmental growth in many thickness asymmetries. Developmental trajectories showed non-linear asymmetry growth by virtue of accelerated thinning of the non-dominant hemisphere (10/20 clusters showed this relative hemispheric difference in the rate of developmental thinning; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This led to maximally established asymmetry around ~24 years of age. These trajectories clearly suggest differentiation of the cortex occurs with respect to thickness asymmetry in development, possibly (though not necessarily) suggesting it may be more amenable to experience-dependent change. Indeed, as cortical thinning in childhood is thought to partly reflect learning-dependent processes such as intracortical myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Natu et al., 2019</xref>), pruning of initially overproduced synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Petanjek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Faust et al., 2021</xref>) and neuropil reduction, thickness asymmetry growth may suggest hemispheric differences in the developmental optimization of cortical networks at least partly shaped by childhood experience. This raises the possibility thickness asymmetry may be a marker of ontogenetic hemispheric specialization within neurocognitive networks, possibly in line with animal models suggesting lateralized training can alter the balance in homotopic thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Díaz et al., 1994</xref>). However, this is speculative, and intervention approaches are needed to experimentally test plasticity of thickness asymmetry in humans. Our lifespan results are difficult to reconcile with earlier lifespan reports finding different mean thickness asymmetry patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shaw et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>) and modelling asymmetry linearly across cross-sectional childhood and adult samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plessen et al., 2014</xref>). However, our findings agree with work finding a similar left-right thickness asymmetry pattern shows rapid longitudinal increase in the first years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2015</xref>), particularly in mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2015</xref>). As we observed rapid asymmetry differentiation spanninng childhood and adolescence in most prefrontal regions and others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>), we extend these earlier findings in neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Likely, longitudinal data and nonlinear modelling was critical to capture early developmental growth in thickness asymmetry within a lifespan perspective, because large variation in hemispheric thickness estimates at any age may hinder detection of subtle change effects even in large cross-sectional samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fjell et al., 2020</xref>), rendering follow-up data likely critical in the context of cortical asymmetry change. As prefrontal thickness asymmetry seems particularly vulnerable in some neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Postema et al., 2019</xref>), aging, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>), these trajectories provide a useful normative reference regarding the timing of expected brain change in development. With regards to aging, most clusters delineated here did not exhibit the relative hemispheric difference in rates of cortical thinning we have previously shown is a feature of aging in heteromodal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>), except in clusters overlapping with our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). This fits with our previous work showing aging-related loss in thickness asymmetry is specific to heteromodal regions vulnerable in aging. In these, we also found strong evidence of early developmental growth in thickness asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Developmental differentiation and aging-related dedifferentiation of thickness asymmetry underscores its proposed role in supporting optimal brain organization and function, though it seems not all thickness asymmetries that grow in childhood development decline in aging.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Interregional asymmetry correlations</title><p>For areal asymmetry, we uncovered a covariance structure that almost perfectly replicated across datasets. In general, this fit with a multifaceted view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rentería, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Francks, 2015</xref>), in which most asymmetries were either not or only weakly correlated – but reliably so – contrasting views emphasizing a single biological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Annett, 1964</xref>) or overall anatomical factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crow, 2010</xref>) controlling cerebral lateralization. However, we also identified several regions wherein areal asymmetry reliably correlated within individuals, showing the variance in cortical asymmetries is not always dissociable, as often thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rentería, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Francks, 2015</xref>). The strongest relationships all pertained to asymmetries that were proximal in cortex but opposite in direction. Several of these were underpinned by high asymmetry-asymmetry SNP-based genetic correlations, illustrating some lateralizations in surface area exhibit coordinated genetic development.</p><p>For thickness asymmetry, we also uncovered a common covariance structure – particularly clear in UKB – that nevertheless replicated with moderate precision across datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, a single component explained 21.9% variance in thickness asymmetry in UKB, and a high correlation across 38,171 individuals further suggested thickness asymmetry may be globally interrelated across the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These data for thickness indicate individuals may tend towards either leftward asymmetry, rightward asymmetry, or symmetry, both globally across the cortex and irrespective of the region-specific average direction of asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>). Though it is unclear why the relationships were weaker in the other datasets, we nevertheless found similarly significant relationships in each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This result may be in broad agreement with the notion that some lateralized genetic-developmental programs may trigger lateralization in either direction or lose their directional bias through environmental interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Francks, 2015</xref>). As thickness asymmetry seems established at but minimal from birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2015</xref>), genetic effects may determine the average region-specific hemispheric bias in the population, but later developmental change may subsequently confer major increases upon its directional variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Francks, 2015</xref>). Overall, our data suggests developmental change in thickness asymmetry may lead to directional variability of its lateralization across individuals. Thus, far from being independent phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rentería, 2012</xref>), thickness asymmetries may be globally interrelated across cortex and their direction coordinated through childhood.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Genetic influences</title><p>For areal asymmetry, we found replicable patterns of low-moderate heritability across datasets and methods. We also found areal asymmetry in anterior insula is, to our knowledge, the most heritable asymmetry yet reported with genomic methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sha et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sha et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrion-Castillo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cuellar-Partida et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elliott et al., 2018</xref>), with common SNPs explaining ~19% variance. This is notably higher than in our recent report (&lt;5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sha et al., 2021a</xref>), illustrating a benefit of our approach. As we reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sha et al., 2021a</xref>), we confirm asymmetry here associates with handedness. Furthermore, highest SNP and twin-based heritability for areal asymmetry was found in regions constituting the earliest emerging cortical asymmetries in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dubois et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Habas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kasprian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hill et al., 2010</xref>): anterior insula, STS, PT, medial occipital cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, heritability was not restricted to these regions, as most areal asymmetries exhibited significant – albeit often lower – SNP-based heritability, as did most parcels when estimated cortex-wide. SNP-based heritability was also evident in regions not found in the present analyses to show strong areal asymmetry, such as Broca’s area (but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).

However, while heritability of either hemisphere was high, areal asymmetry heritability was still only moderate at best, suggesting genetic but primarily subject-specific stochastic effects underly its formation. By contrast, thickness asymmetry was generally not heritable, or showed low and localized heritability effects with no clear global pattern, as well as more divergent results using twin and genomic methods, possibly due to low-power for twin-models.</p><p>Together, lifespan stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2014</xref>), higher heritability, and phenotypic and genetic correlations suggest higher genetic influence upon individual differences in areal asymmetry. By contrast, childhood developmental growth, directional variability and low heritability suggest thickness asymmetry may be more shaped through individual lifespan exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fjell et al., 2019</xref>). Whether region-specific thickness asymmetry change relates to the maturation of lateralized brain functions is thus an interesting question for future research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop and Bates, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Somers et al., 2015</xref>). Regardless, these results support a differentiation between early-life (i.e. before age ~4) and later developmental factors in shaping areal and thickness asymmetry, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Individual differences</title><p>Other factors commonly espoused to be important for asymmetry were associated with only small average effects in adults. For example, we found one region – SMG/perisylvian – wherein higher leftward areal asymmetry related to subtly higher cognitive ability. Since interhemispheric anatomy here is likely related to brain torque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Toga and Thompson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">LeMay, 1976</xref>), this may agree with work suggesting torque relates to cognitive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kong, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, that ~94% of humans exhibit leftward asymmetry in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) suggests tightly regulated genetic-developmental programs control its lateralized direction in humans (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This result may therefore suggest disruptions in areal lateralization early in life are associated with cognitive deficits detectable in later life as small effects in big data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deary et al., 2004</xref>). While speculative, this may also agree with evidence that differences in general cognitive ability that show high lifespan stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deary et al., 2004</xref>) relate primarily to areal phenotypes formed early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rakic, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fjell et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with our recent analysis in UKB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sha et al., 2021a</xref>), we confirmed leftward areal asymmetry of anterior insula, and leftward somatosensory thickness asymmetry is subtly reduced in left-handers. Sha et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sha et al., 2021a</xref>) reported shared genetic influences upon handedness and asymmetry in anterior insula and other more focal regions. Anterior insula lies within a left-lateralized functional language network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Labache et al., 2019</xref>), and its structural asymmetry may relate to language lateralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiarello et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biduła and Króliczak, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Keller et al., 2011</xref>) in which left-handers show increased atypicality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wiberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mazoyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Westerhausen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carey and Johnstone, 2014</xref>). Since asymmetry here emerges early in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dubois et al., 2010</xref>) and is by far the most heritable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we agree with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiarello et al., 2013</xref>) that this ontogenetically foundational region of cortex may be fruitful for understanding genetic-developmental mechanisms influencing laterality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afif et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kalani et al., 2009</xref>). Less leftward somatosensory thickness asymmetry in left-handers also echoes our recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sha et al., 2021a</xref>) and fits a scenario whereby thickness asymmetries may be partly shaped through use-dependent plasticity and detectable through group-level hemispheric specializations of function. Still, the small effects show cortical asymmetry cannot predict individual handedness. Associations with other factors typically assumed important were similarly small, and mostly compatible with the ENIGMA report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>) and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Williams et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guadalupe et al., 2015</xref>). Concerning sex effects – which were small, differing in direction, and more predictive than ICV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guadalupe et al., 2015</xref>) – inconsistencies between ours and ENIGMA include findings of increased (here) and decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>) LPC areal asymmetry in males, and increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>) and decreased (here) entorhinal thickness asymmetry in males, and our approach detected other regions slightly more asymmetric in males (e.g. STS). Possibly, differences in sample median age (UKB = ~64; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref> = 26) and potential sex-differences in brain decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McCarrey et al., 2016</xref>) may underlie some inconsistencies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations</title><p>Some limitations should be noted. First, our delineation of population-level asymmetry used a single analysis software. We used FreeSurfer’s default ‘recon-all’ to delineate the cortex, which has been extensively validated against postmortem data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardinale et al., 2014</xref>) and is the software underlying most large-scale studies with brain measures. It is currently unclear to what extent differences in pipelines account for previous mixed results. Although we highlight there are clear commonalities between our results and studies using alternative pipelines, suggesting they generalize across analysis streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Luders et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lyttelton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plessen et al., 2014</xref>), we found one instance where the MRI pipeline leads to different results for thickness asymmetry (HCP pipeline; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). It is not known what underlies this difference, though it is unrelated to the cross-hemispheric registration methods employed here, as our results reproduce using standard methods and thus are likely evident in most FreeSurfer-derived datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). One possibility could be that thickness asymmetry may not reflect cortical thickness differences per se, but rather reflect biologically meaningful hemispheric differences in intracortical myelination that are consistently picked up on via FreeSurfer’s delineation procedure. Future research is required to resolve this. However, that the thickness asymmetry pattern we observe shows a clear developmental trajectory suggests it is a true biological effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>), as do the replicable aging-related changes therein we have shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>). Other sources of inconsistently reported results for cortical asymmetries likely include varying age-distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>), and multiple asymmetries within atlas-based parcels (e.g. we observed discrepant results to ENIGMA for insula thickness asymmetry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>). Still, this does not explain other discrepancies, such as rightward areal STS asymmetry here but not elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Remer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thickness asymmetries seem also more variable compared with area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>), though it should be noted thickness in general may be slightly less reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hedges et al., 2022</xref>), the asymmetry effect is smaller, and thus possibly contains more error. Relatedly, while areal and thickness asymmetry patterns and magnitudes using cross-hemispheric methods agree with standard analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), the magnitude of some asymmetries near the subcortical boundary may be exaggerated via this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sha et al., 2021a</xref>). And while we did not find (strong) areal asymmetry in inferior frontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 2018</xref>), both the unthresholded significance maps and standard parcellation analyses were compatible with this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), highlighting a limitation of our thresholding approach. Second, while GAMMs are considered optimal for modelling lifespan data and are robust to nonuniform age distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sørensen et al., 2021</xref>), relative underrepresentation in mid-adulthood may drive trajectory inflection points around this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>), urging caution around interpreting these as reflecting real change. Relatedly, as individual-level mean estimates likely contain more error when extracted from smaller clusters, the trajectories from smaller clusters may be more prone to deflection by age density differences. And while spatially averaging across asymmetries helps smooth out some of this noise to better reveal developmental principles underlying cortical asymmetries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), it also trades off with accuracy, since trajectories from distinct regions somewhat differ. Third, although differing heritability methods enabled a replication test, methodological differences should be considered when interpreting heritability estimates, and may partly explain the common observation of higher estimates from twins, which we also observed. For example, twin methods implicitly incorporate additive genetic effects and gene-gene interactions amongst other terms, whereas SNP-based methods incorporate only additive effects. Still, twin methods may be prone to overestimating heritability due to unmet assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dalmaijer, 2020</xref>), whereas SNP-based methods may not capture all phenotype-relevant genetic variance and have their own assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hibar et al., 2017</xref>). Adding to this complexity, the samples used for twin- and SNP-based estimation consist of young adults and older adults, respectively. Hence, low SNP-based estimates for thickness asymmetry in UKB may be partly due to reduced thickness asymmetry in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Williams et al., 2022</xref>). However, as cortex-wide twin-based estimates were also significantly lower for thickness asymmetry in the young HCP sample, age is likely not the main driver behind this difference. Again, we also cannot rule out that reliability differences between measures may partially explain some magnitude differences in heritability. Further, genetic correlations can be high even where heritability of either trait is low, and are typically higher than phenotypic correlations – known phenomena also observed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheverud, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sodini et al., 2018</xref>). It may therefore be prudent to not overinterpret their magnitudes, though the veracity of the reported SNP-based genetic correlations seems well-supported, as one expects true genetic correlations between developmentally-related traits (here, sampled from nearby in the same organ), and to track the phenotypic correlations (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Fourth, we imposed a cluster size limit for overlapping asymmetry effects, and thus more focal asymmetries may also be informative for the factors tested here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sha et al., 2021a</xref>). Fifth, only dichotomous handedness self-reports are available with UKB, and future studies might benefit from more nuanced handedness assessments. Relatedly, because UKB cognitive data is not exhaustive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fawns-Ritchie and Deary, 2020</xref>), we extracted the common variance across tests to index general cognitive ability. This approach does not permit testing associations with well-operationalized or specific cognitive domains, and it remains to be seen whether cortical asymmetry may be more informative for lateralized cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ocklenburg et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Overall, we track the development of population-level cerebral cortical asymmetries longitudinally across life and perform analyses to trace developmental principles underlying their formation. Developmental and lifespan trajectories, interregional correlations and heritability analyses converge upon a differentiation between early-life and later-developmental factors underlying the formation of areal and thickness asymmetries, respectively. By revealing hitherto unknown principles of developmental stability and change underlying diverse aspects of cortical asymmetry, we here advance knowledge of normal human brain development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Samples</title><p>We used anatomical T1 -weighted (T1w) scans from 7 independent international MRI datasets originating from 4 countries (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref> for an overview of samples used for each analysis).

We did not consider sex differences in lifespan asymmetry change because our elected method was not well-suited to testing three-way interactions between nonlinear smooth terms.

Then, we regressed out age, sex and scanner (where applicable) from each AI, using linear mixed models after collating the data from each sample (adding random intercepts for LCBC subjects), to ensure the correction was unaffected by differences in sample age-distribution.

For general cognition, we used the first principal component across the following 11 core UK Biobank cognitive variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fawns-Ritchie and Deary, 2020</xref>): Mean reaction time (log transformed) [field 20023], Numeric memory [4282], Fluid reasoning [20016], Matrix completion [6373], Tower rearranging [21004], Symbol digit substitution [23324], Paired associate learning [20197], Prospective memory [20018] (recoded as 1 or 0, depending on whether the instruction was remembered on the first attempt or not), Pairs matching (log) [399], Trail making A (log) [6348], Trail making B (log) [6350]. Prior to the PCA, for participants with cognitive data, data was imputed for missing cognitive variables via the ‘imputePCA’ function (number of estimated components tentatively optimized using general cross validation; ‘missMDA’ R package v1.18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Josse and Husson, 2016</xref>). PC1 (explaining 39.2%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1L</xref>) was inversed to correlate negatively with age (<italic>r</italic>=–0.39), ensuring higher values reflected higher cognition. As fewer participants had cognitive data relative to the other variables, for each cluster we ran one set of linear models to assess the marginal effect of cognition (PC1 as predictor; age, sex, ICV controlled; N=35,198), and one set of linear models to assess the marginal effects of Handedness, Sex, and ICV in a model including all three predictors (age controlled, N=37,569 with available handedness data). For the cognitive analysis, effects identified in the imputed dataset were checked against the confidence intervals for the effect in the subset of the data with no missing cognitive variables (N=4696).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Population-level asymmetry of the cerebral cortex: reproducibility, lifespan changes, heritability, and individual differences&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dorothy V M Bishop (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work in its current form will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However, note that in the light of the very constructive comment and in tune with our general belief that these data can potentially provide an important reference for future studies, we as editors would be willing to consider a future, thoroughly revised revision of this paper. We would treat it as a new submission (with potentially new reviewers being invited, depending on the availability of reviewers.) – All of this of course depending on the nature and extent of your revisions to the manuscript and your documentation of these. *</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers and editors agreed that the paper provides a useful descriptive catalogue of phenomena related to hemispheric anatomical asymmetries and that it does so in a largely sound manner (but see specific methodological concerns below). However, there was no consensus to be reached that this study has a specific impact on our learning about the mechanisms of hemispheric lateralisation. After reviews and an elaborate discussion amongst reviewers and editors, concerns remained over the mechanistic impact of the results presented and the degree of conceptual synthesis provided, so we decided not to invite a revision of this study for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have several comments and suggestions that I hope will be of use to the authors.</p><p>1. In discussing the differences between regional asymmetries in cortical thickness and cortical area, it is prudent to mention that CT is less reliable than SA and this reliability difference may be amplified in the computation of asymmetry.</p><p>2. In claiming that &quot;disrupted cortical asymmetry is a confirmed feature of… aging…&quot; the authors cite one study and ignore others that not only lend little support to this conclusion but also warn that regional asymmetry in the aging brain is not well-replicated even across similar samples.</p><p>3. Unclear how GAMM captures nonlinearity of change over time with only two measurement occasions.</p><p>4. Discovering a capture of 21% of common variance by the first component of the PCA hardly signals the existence of a single factor. CFA would be a more appropriate way of testing single vs multiple factors hypotheses.</p><p>5. The authors consistently characterize correlations as &quot;strong&quot; – unclear why. The characterization is somewhat hyperbolic: for example, r=.56 does not seem particularly strong, with about 70% of the variance not shared by the variables. Why not just write &quot;correlated,&quot; report the magnitude and the direction and let the readers make a qualitative judgment if they feel like it.</p><p>Some stylistic editing will improve this manuscript. For example, the sentence &quot;Areal asymmetry correlates in specific regions…&quot; in the Abstract is quite unwieldy and can be split into two or three.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I found some of the graphs hard to read.</p><p>For example, in Figure 5 the color scale was hard to read. It goes from one shade of blue to another shade of blue and I could not really see much distinction.</p><p>Figure 6, it is not clear what is being plotted on the abscissa. There is no axis label.</p><p>The authors use the term &quot;longitudinal&quot; to describe their age-related analyses, but my understanding of that term is that it refers to the same individuals tested over time, which is not the case here; it's a cross-sectional approach.</p><p>The word &quot;course&quot; should be &quot;coarse&quot; (line 70).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, while I think the attempt at a comprehensive approach by the authors is commendable, the paper, which includes a great deal of supplementary material, is just too dense and unwieldy. My recommendation would be to break it up. I'm not a fan of authors who turn papers into 'minimal publishable units', but here we have the opposite – a paper so dense with information that it is hard to follow.</p><p>I don't know if <italic>eLife</italic> would consider a series of related papers like this but the work would be easier to follow, and potentially more influential if it were split up. There is a nice logical progression, with the initial analyses delineating brain areas that are consistently asymmetric, and subsequent analyses then using these, so a series of papers would work well I think – something like this:</p><p>Paper 1: qs 1 and 3 – replicability of population-level asymmetries, and inter-regional correlations.</p><p>Paper 2: consideration of causal factors, incorporating longitudinal analysis of lifespan trajectories of asymmetry (q2) and heritability (q4). The longitudinal analysis could potentially incorporate analysis of interregional correlations across age – given that connectivity changes with age, there is a rationale for looking at that (LCBC sample), but even without that, this would make a meaty paper.</p><p>Paper 3 (q5) Consideration of significance of individual differences in terms of correlations with sex, handedness, and general cognitive ability (UKB sample). Potentially more could be done with this; it could look at associations with absolute as well as raw asymmetry indices. But I think it would be most valuable if preceded by a balanced review of prior work in this area, culminating in a list of claims of associations that could be tested in this sample. That would make it more evident which claims are NOT supported, which would be very useful for the field.</p><p>Note: I am not recommending jettisoning the null results – on the contrary, I would like to see them given more serious treatment, as they could be helpful in moving the field forward.</p><p>Since breaking up the paper this way would be a fairly radical move, I'll assume that the authors and/or editors will decide against this, and so my remaining comments will be written as if we are dealing with a paper that does incorporate all the current material.</p><p>I would suggest rewriting the Abstract to give a more balanced account of the findings, including an indication of the null as well as positive results.</p><p>I don't know whether <italic>eLife</italic> insists on the particular structuring of the paper used here, with Methods at the end. I would hope this could be modified, as for a multi-question paper like this, it is particularly frustrating for the reader. The introduction ends with five specific questions clearly laid out, but we then jump into Results, which are hard to understand without seeing the Methods. So the reader goes forward to Methods, where the dataset for each of the five questions is first described, then the data analysis methods for each of the five questions. This involves a great deal of jumping about. I found myself wanting to literally cut and paste the material so I could read it in a sensible sequence.</p><p>Interregional correlations</p><p>The material on interregional correlations was fascinating but hard to follow. The numbers (Figure 4 Figure supplement 1) are hard to read, but I was very surprised at just how low these correlations were for SA, given that people have tended to interpret asymmetries in terms of a general 'torque' effect.</p><p>The CT asymmetries were hard to interpret, given the relatively low Mantel scores – and the way the Biobank data stand out even just on the heatmap. This made me wonder if the more restricted age range of the Biobank sample might affect the covariances. I wasn't sure how the age residualisation worked, and whether it was within-sample or across samples, so hard to know if and how the fact that Biobank has a much higher age minimum than others might have an effect?</p><p>One thing that makes the results confusing is the flipping of the hemisphere so that the emphasis is on strength of laterality in the population direction. It would be worth taking some time in the introduction to discuss predictions from the 'multifactorial' account versus a 'single factor' account – relating this to discussions of cerebral torque.</p><p>An alternative approach would be to just present the unflipped data, explaining that a positive correlation then indicates agreement in left-wardness (regardless of whether the population bias is left or right), and a negative correlation indicates agreement between the strength of lateralisation in the population direction.</p><p>The subsequent discussion of these results was pretty clear – it's just the account in Results that was hard to follow.</p><p>Heritability</p><p>The account of results in the Abstract again focused on the positive findings and ignored the null results as if they were of no interest.</p><p>So the Abstract states: &quot;Areal asymmetry is moderately heritable (max h2SNP ~19%), and phenotypic correlations are reflected by high genetic correlations, whereas heritability of thickness asymmetry is low. &quot;</p><p>My reading of the results is that none of the twin-based heritability estimates – either global or regional – was statistically significant. Consistent with previous reports by Eyler et al. and others, the strongest influence on asymmetry indices is the E-term (nonshared environment), which may be interpreted in this context as chance (stochastic) influences.</p><p>The SNP-based estimates from UK Biobank give a handful of significant heritability estimates for the SA asymmetry, but none for CT. I agree it is of interest to document these, but the genetic effects that are found are not high (19% is the highest estimate, with the remaining 80% of variance accounted for by the e2 term).</p><p>I guess it is a case of one's perspective, but my take on this is not &quot;isn't it interesting that if we have a huge sample we can pick up some small genetic effects on a handful of asymmetry measures&quot;, but rather, &quot;isn't it interesting that brains end up with similar patterns of structural asymmetry, even though genes explain so little individual variation &quot;. This does suggest that there are genetic influences that create these general biases to one direction or the other, but which have reached fixation in the population and so show little individual variation.</p><p>Associations with cognition</p><p>As noted above, I felt this treatment was too brief. There is a rich literature on associations with asymmetry for the variables considered here, much of it focusing on the degree rather than the direction of asymmetry.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have several comments and suggestions that I hope will be of use to the authors.</p><p>1. In discussing the differences between regional asymmetries in cortical thickness and cortical area, it is prudent to mention that CT is less reliable than SA and this reliability difference may be amplified in the computation of asymmetry.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added text to reflect this in the Discussion (see below). Furthermore, we now also acknowledge that this potential reliability difference may be a contributor to some of the differences in results for areal and thickness asymmetry (e.g. heritability), stating this in the limitations:</p><p>615 – “Conceivable sources of inconsistently reported results for cortical asymmetries likely include varying age distributions (particularly for thickness) (Roe et al. 2021), and multiple asymmetries within atlas-based parcels (e.g. we observed notably discrepant results to ENIGMA for insula thickness asymmetry (Kong et al. 2018)) … Thickness asymmetries seem also more variable compared with area (Kong et al. 2018), though it should be noted thickness in general may be slightly less reliable (Hedges et al. 2022), the asymmetry effect is smaller, and thus possibly contains more error”</p><p>646 – “Again, we also cannot rule out that potential reliability differences between thickness and areal asymmetry may partially explain some magnitude differences in heritability estimates.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In claiming that &quot;disrupted cortical asymmetry is a confirmed feature of… aging…&quot; the authors cite one study and ignore others that not only lend little support to this conclusion but also warn that regional asymmetry in the aging brain is not well-replicated even across similar samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. In the context of aging, this statement is specific to cortical thickness asymmetry. While we agree previous cross-sectional studies provided mixed support for this (e.g. (Zhou et al. 2013; Plessen et al. 2014)), our previous study which we cite here showed that both leftward and rightward thickness asymmetry exhibit widespread reduction in aging that is replicable in multiple longitudinal samples (Roe et al. 2021). This previous study was the first to address the question longitudinally, which is likely the key reason why earlier cross-sectional studies lent little support to this conclusion. We agree the few studies assessing cross-sectional age effects on areal asymmetries do not lend support for the claim in aging, and indeed, a key motivation for the current study is that we know little about lifespan changes in areal asymmetry. As this is an introductory sentence, it is perhaps too early to specify that in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, the evidence suggests alterations in both area and thickness, whereas in the context of aging, current evidence supports changes in thickness only. Therefore, we opted for the following change that highlights only some aspects of cortical asymmetry have been shown to be subtly altered in aging, without going into the specifics at this point – which we do later in paragraphs dealing with these issues in depth. We agree reported patterns of average regional asymmetry in the aging brain in general have been inconsistent, especially for thickness asymmetry (e.g. Zhou et al. 2013; Plessen et al. 2014; Roe et al. 2021). We believe this point only highlights the need for our study and approach.</p><p>55 – ”Although an extensive literature in search of structural asymmetry deviations in various conditions and disorders is in several cases being challenged by newer data (Kong et al. 2020), at least some aspects of cortical asymmetry are confirmed to be subtly reduced in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (Postema et al. 2019), but also through later life influences such as aging (Roe et al. 2021), and Alzheimer’s disease (Thompson et al. 2007; Roe et al. 2021)”</p><p>74 – “Determining the developmental and lifespan trajectories of cortical asymmetry may shed light on how cortical asymmetries are shaped through childhood or set from early life, and provide evidence of the timing of expected brain change in normal development. Although important in and of itself, this would also provide a useful normative reference, as subtly altered cortical asymmetry – in terms of both area and thickness – has been linked at the group-level to neurodevelopmental disorders along the autism spectrum (Postema et al. 2019; Sha et al. 2022), suggesting altered lateralized neurodevelopment may be a neurobiologically relevant outcome in at least some cases of developmental perturbation (Postema et al. 2019; Sha et al. 2022). For areal asymmetry, surprisingly few studies have charted developmental (Li et al. 2014; Remer et al. 2017) or aging-related effects (Kong et al. 2018; Williams et al. 2022), although indirect evidence in neonates suggests adult-like patterns of areal asymmetry are evident at birth and may exhibit little change from birth to 2 years (Li et al. 2014) despite rapid and concurrent developmental cortical expansion (Li et al. 2013). For thickness asymmetry, longitudinal increases in asymmetry have been shown during the first two years of life (Li et al. 2015), with suggestions of rapid asymmetry growth from birth to 1 year (Li et al. 2015), and potentially continued growth until adolescence (Nie et al. 2013). However, previous lifespan studies mapped thickness asymmetry linearly across cross-sectional developmental and adult age-ranges (Zhou et al. 2013; Plessen et al. 2014), mostly concluding thickness asymmetry is minimal in infancy and maximal age ~60. In contrast, recent work established thickness asymmetry shows a non-linear decline from 20 to 90 years that is reproducible across longitudinal aging cohorts (Roe et al. 2021). Thus, although offering viable developmental insights (Zhou et al. 2013; Plessen et al. 2014), previous lifespan studies of thickness asymmetry do not accurately capture the aging process, and likely conflate non-linear developmental and aging trajectories with linear models. A longitudinal exploration of the lifespan trajectories of thickness asymmetry accounting for dynamic change is needed to further knowledge of normal human brain development.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Unclear how GAMM captures nonlinearity of change over time with only two measurement occasions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is useful to clarify. GAMMs capture the non-linearity of the mean-level trajectories across persons, incorporating data from both cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements. They do not model non-linearity within persons. Hence, the non-linearity in GAMM is achieved in the same way as in a Generalized Additive Model that does not incorporate repeat measures (essentially a weighted sum of basis functions and their coefficients). Since both single and repeat measures over time are taken into account, the estimated population trajectories will be an intermediate estimate of cross-sectional and longitudinal trajectories. We have added this clarification in the Methods:</p><p>743 – “GAMMs incorporate both cross-sectional and longitudinal data to capture non-linearity of the mean level trajectories across persons (Sørensen et al. 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Discovering a capture of 21% of common variance by the first component of the PCA hardly signals the existence of a single factor. CFA would be a more appropriate way of testing single vs multiple factors hypotheses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed all statements pertaining to a “single global factor” to a “single principle component” or similar, as we agree this better represents our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors consistently characterize correlations as &quot;strong&quot; – unclear why. The characterization is somewhat hyperbolic: for example, r=.56 does not seem particularly strong, with about 70% of the variance not shared by the variables. Why not just write &quot;correlated,&quot; report the magnitude and the direction and let the readers make a qualitative judgment if they feel like it.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed such examples where this refers to a correlation. We now only use the word “strong” when describing asymmetries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some stylistic editing will improve this manuscript. For example, the sentence &quot;Areal asymmetry correlates in specific regions…&quot; in the Abstract is quite unwieldy and can be split into two or three.</p></disp-quote><p>In line with this suggestion and others, we have made extensive amendments to the abstract. However, since we must be mindful of word count and taking the care to highlight our main findings, we cannot split this sentence into multiple sentences. The abstract now reads:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>31 – “Cortical asymmetry is a ubiquitous feature of brain organization that is subtly altered in some neurodevelopmental disorders, yet we lack knowledge of how its development proceeds across life in health. Achieving consensus on the precise cortical asymmetries in humans is necessary to uncover the genetic and later influences that shape them, such as age. Here, we delineate population-level asymmetry in cortical thickness and surface area vertex-wise in 7 datasets and chart asymmetry trajectories longitudinally across life (4-89 years; observations = 3937; 70% longitudinal). We find replicable asymmetry interrelationships, heritability maps, and test asymmetry associations in large-scale data. Cortical asymmetry was robust across datasets. Whereas areal asymmetry is predominantly stable across life, thickness asymmetry grows in childhood and peaks in early adulthood. Areal asymmetry correlates phenotypically and genetically in specific regions, and is low-moderately heritable (max h<sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub> ~19%). In contrast, thickness asymmetry is globally interrelated across the cortex in a pattern suggesting highly left-lateralized individuals tend towards left-lateralization also in population-level right-asymmetric regions (and vice versa), and exhibits low or absent heritability. We find less areal asymmetry in the most consistently lateralized region in humans associates with subtly lower cognitive ability, and confirm small handedness and sex effects. Results suggest areal asymmetry is developmentally stable and arises in early life through genetic but mainly subject-specific stochastic effects, whereas childhood developmental growth shapes thickness asymmetry and may lead to directional variability of global thickness lateralization in the population.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I found some of the graphs hard to read.</p><p>For example, in Figure 5 the color scale was hard to read. It goes from one shade of blue to another shade of blue and I could not really see much distinction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the scale in Figure 5 to a warm colour scale, and changed the gradient to better distinguish between numerical estimates.

In fact, all of the analyses ran with the LCBC sample incorporated all longitudinal data within the given age-range. Therefore, our use of this term, as well as other longitudinal terms – such as “aging” and “change” – is justified and correct. We have extensively amended the revised manuscript to highlight the longitudinal lifespan aspect to these data, which we propose was key to uncovering the developmental trajectories we show here. Some example amendments/statements:</p><p>35 – “… and chart asymmetry trajectories longitudinally across life (4-89 years; observations = 3937; 70% longitudinal)”.</p><p>61 – “no previous study has charted cortical asymmetry trajectories from childhood to old age using longitudinal data”.</p><p>63 – “Compounding the lack of longitudinal investigation, previous large-scale studies do not …”.</p><p>90 – “A longitudinal exploration of the lifespan trajectories of thickness asymmetry accounting for dynamic change is needed to further knowledge of normal human brain development.”</p><p>121 – “To gain insight into their development, we then trace a series of lifespan and genetic analyses.

My recommendation would be to break it up. I'm not a fan of authors who turn papers into 'minimal publishable units', but here we have the opposite – a paper so dense with information that it is hard to follow.</p><p>1. I don't know if eLife would consider a series of related papers like this but the work would be easier to follow, and potentially more influential if it were split up. There is a nice logical progression, with the initial analyses delineating brain areas that are consistently asymmetric, and subsequent analyses then using these, so a series of papers would work well I think – something like this:</p><p>Paper 1: qs 1 and 3 – replicability of population-level asymmetries, and inter-regional correlations.</p><p>Paper 2: consideration of causal factors, incorporating longitudinal analysis of lifespan trajectories of asymmetry (q2) and heritability (q4). The longitudinal analysis could potentially incorporate analysis of interregional correlations across age – given that connectivity changes with age, there is a rationale for looking at that (LCBC sample), but even without that, this would make a meaty paper.</p><p>Paper 3 (q5) Consideration of significance of individual differences in terms of correlations with sex, handedness, and general cognitive ability (UKB sample). Potentially more could be done with this; it could look at associations with absolute as well as raw asymmetry indices. But I think it would be most valuable if preceded by a balanced review of prior work in this area, culminating in a list of claims of associations that could be tested in this sample. That would make it more evident which claims are NOT supported, which would be very useful for the field.</p><p>Note: I am not recommending jettisoning the null results – on the contrary, I would like to see them given more serious treatment, as they could be helpful in moving the field forward.</p><p>2. Since breaking up the paper this way would be a fairly radical move, I'll assume that the authors and/or editors will decide against this, and so my remaining comments will be written as if we are dealing with a paper that does incorporate all the current material.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comments. We do not feel the work will be as impactful if split up over several papers in the current publishing landscape, and so respectfully maintain our decision not to. However, we have taken on board the Reviewer’s many comments for how to improve the paper as it is.</p><p>(Regarding the specific point about association analysis being a paper on its own, please see below):</p><p>We agree the literature review regarding asymmetry-cognition associations lacked some necessary detail. However, although a rich literature has attempted to associate diverse aspects of brain asymmetry with cognitive ability, almost none of these studies focuses specifically on cortical asymmetry. Indeed, we are only aware of three other studies testing cognitive links with cortical asymmetry or derivations of it (beyond our previous one which included cognitive change analysis in aging; (Roe et al. 2021)). Two of these focused on fluctuating asymmetry (Yeo et al. 2016; Moodie et al. 2020), operationalizing this as the average across absolute asymmetry deviance scores from the mean per-ROI, and are therefore not directly comparable to the present study. The remaining one found that greater thickness asymmetry in the expected direction may relate to better cognitive outcomes (Plessen et al. 2014). We now explicitly mention this study in the Introduction and Discussion, as well as summarize all previous work attempting to relate cortical asymmetry specifically to variations in cognitive ability:</p><p>106 – “Finally, altered development of cerebral lateralization in general has been widely hypothesized to relate to average poorer cognitive outcomes (Crow et al. 1998; Hirnstein et al. 2010; Plessen et al. 2014). Specifically in the context of cortical asymmetry, however, although one previous study reported larger thickness asymmetry may relate to better verbal and visuospatial cognition (Plessen et al. 2014), phenotypic asymmetry-cognition associations have been rarely reported (Plessen et al. 2014; Yeo et al. 2016; Moodie et al. 2020), conflicting (Yeo et al. 2016; Moodie et al. 2020), not directly comparable (Plessen et al. 2014; Moodie et al. 2020), and to date remain untested in large-scale data. Still, recent work points to small but significant overlap between genes underlying multivariate brain asymmetries and those influencing educational attainment and specific developmental disorders impacting cognition (Sha, Schijven, et al. 2021), indicating either pleiotropy between non-related traits or capturing shared genetic susceptibility to altered brain lateralization and cognitive outcomes.”</p><p>574 – “Also of note, no other asymmetry showed evidence of cognitive association (Figure 7—figure supplement 1), suggesting previously reported associations in small samples will likely not replicate (Plessen et al. 2014)”</p><p>Since we are careful not to generalize our findings to asymmetry measures not studied here, we do not agree we should separate this into another paper. Methodologically, we maintain our decision to reduce the 11 UK Biobank cognitive variables to their shared variation (Lyall et al. 2016), because the brief nature of UKB cognitive tests does not permit an overly thorough investigation into how different aspects of cognition relate to cortical asymmetry. That is, although it seemed like a brief treatment, it is a defensible and possibly close to optimal approach to take with this data. Note that we now consistently refer to our PC1 measure in terms of “general cognitive ability”. Regarding the distinction with absolute asymmetry, the statements we opt for are always specific to cortical asymmetry, and we are not aware of a large literature looking at absolute strength of cortical asymmetries when testing associations with cognition. However, we have added text to acknowledge this remains to be tested:</p><p>657 – “Relatedly, because UKB cognitive data is not exhaustive (Fawns-Ritchie and Deary 2020) (e.g. fluid IQ ranges from 1-13), we extracted the common variance across core tests to index general cognitive ability. This approach does not permit testing associations with well-operationalized or specific cognitive domains (for which UKB cognitive data may not be sufficient), and it remains to be seen whether cortical asymmetry may be informative in the context of specific forms of lateralized cognition (Ocklenburg et al. 2014), or using absolute non-directional measures. However, the subtlety of the only effect on cognition we find here may suggest we might expect similarly weak effects, though not necessarily if brain and phenotypic measurement accuracy is jointly optimized (Aki Nikolaidis et al. 2022).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I would suggest rewriting the Abstract to give a more balanced account of the findings, including an indication of the null as well as positive results.</p></disp-quote><p>As per a previous comment by the Reviewer, we now highlight that all effects we find are small in the Abstract and Discussion, including heritability findings.</p><p>Though we acknowledge we must be careful not to interpret the null, we agree that in data of this size, we can tentatively suggest that the null relationships we find suggest any effect of a given cortical asymmetry on e.g. general cognitive ability is arguably negligible if we are not able to detect it here. We also regret including the last sentence the reviewer mentions, as we completely agree it is very unlikely measures of specific cognitive abilities will be highly informative in terms of association with cortical asymmetry. We have added this argumentation and amended the closing statement accordingly:</p><p>658 – “This approach does not permit testing associations with well-operationalized or specific cognitive domains (for which UKB cognitive data may not be sufficient), and it remains to be seen whether cortical asymmetry may be informative in the context of specific forms of lateralized cognition (Ocklenburg et al. 2014), or using absolute nondirectional measures. However, the subtlety of the only effect on cognition we find here may suggest we might expect similarly weak effects, though not necessarily if brain and phenotypic measurement accuracy is jointly optimized (Aki Nikolaidis et al. 2022)”</p><p>Though we agree with the reviewer’s points, the Abstract is arguably not the right place to present the argument for null associations, also given word limits, which also influence bias towards positive results. However, we have made changes to the Abstract to highlight the found effects were small, including heritability effects (note that in line with other Reviewer suggestions, we have reduced emphasis on the individual differences analysis and thus no longer highlight these findings to the same degree in the Abstract). In accordance with the Reviewer’s later comments, we also highlight the interpretation of stochastic influences, further highlighting that (heritability) effects were predominantly small.</p><p>38 – “Areal asymmetry correlates phenotypically and genetically in specific regions, and is low-moderately heritable (max h<sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub> ~19%). In contrast, thickness asymmetry is globally interrelated …, and exhibits low or absent heritability. We find less areal asymmetry in the most consistently lateralized region in humans associates with subtly lower cognitive ability, and confirm small handedness and sex effects. Results suggest areal asymmetry is developmentally stable and arises in early life through genetic but mainly subject-specific stochastic effects, whereas childhood developmental growth shapes thickness asymmetry and may lead to directional variability of global thickness lateralization in the population.”</p><p>We also added Discussion around null/small effects in the context of the small cognitive association we find:</p><p>572 – “However, as seems typical for brain associations in big data (Marek et al. 2022) and may be expected for any single structural measure explaining a complex phenomenon, the association was notably small. Also of note, no other asymmetry showed evidence of cognitive association (Figure 7—figure supplement 1), suggesting previously reported associations in small samples will likely not replicate (Plessen et al. 2014).”</p><p>And amended the Results and Discussion to highlight that the found associations are indeed small:</p><p>381 – “Notably, all effect sizes were small … Although small, we note this association was far from only just surviving correction at our predefined α level (⍺ = .01; Methods).”</p><p>422 – “… and uncover novel and confirm previously-reported associations with factors purportedly important in the context of asymmetry – all with small effects.”</p><p>576 – That the association we find was specific to the most lateralized areal asymmetry in humans may suggest disruptions in early life cerebral lateralization leads to cognitive deficits – detectable in later life as small effects in big data.</p><p>590 – “the small effects highlight cortical asymmetry cannot predict individual hand preference.”</p><p>591 – “Similarly, asymmetry-relationships with other factors typically assumed important were all small, despite our optimization of asymmetry phenotypes”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I don't know whether eLife insists on the particular structuring of the paper used here, with Methods at the end. I would hope this could be modified, as for a multi-question paper like this, it is particularly frustrating for the reader. The introduction ends with five specific questions clearly laid out, but we then jump into Results, which are hard to understand without seeing the Methods. So the reader goes forward to Methods, where the dataset for each of the five questions is first described, then the data analysis methods for each of the five questions. This involves a great deal of jumping about. I found myself wanting to literally cut and paste the material so I could read it in a sensible sequence.</p></disp-quote><p>We enquired, but <italic>eLife</italic> mostly prefer to stick to a methods last format. They did say they sometimes allow a change in structure “where it makes sense to do so”, but the general impression was that it would not be deemed justifiable. Therefore, to avoid futile work, we chose to refine the new submission to hopefully be easier to follow, in the format they predominantly accept. While we sympathize with the Reviewer that it is not always preferable, we hope for understanding in this matter, as the decision does not lie with us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interregional correlations</p><p>5. The material on interregional correlations was fascinating but hard to follow. The numbers (Figure 4 Figure supplement 1) are hard to read, but I was very surprised at just how low these correlations were for SA, given that people have tended to interpret asymmetries in terms of a general 'torque' effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We reduced the number of technical analyses in this section (i.e. geodesic distance) and streamlined the results to be more readable. We have also increased the resolution of the figure (now Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We agree many of the correlations are indeed surprisingly low for areal asymmetry, and highlight multifactorial explanations in the Discussion.</p><p>510 – “For areal asymmetry, we uncovered a covariance structure that almost perfectly replicated across datasets. In general, this fit with a multifaceted view (Rentería 2012; Francks 2015; Bain et al. 2019), in which most asymmetries were either not or only weakly correlated – but reliably so – contrasting views emphasizing a single (Annett 1964, 1998) or overall anatomical factor (Crow 2010) controlling cerebral lateralization. However, we also identified several regions wherein areal asymmetry reliably correlated within individuals, showing the variance in cortical asymmetries is not always dissociable, as often thought (Rentería 2012; Francks 2015; Bain et al. 2019). The strongest relationships all pertained to asymmetries that were proximal in cortex but opposite in direction. Several of these were underpinned by high asymmetry-asymmetry genetic correlations, illustrating cerebral lateralizations in surface area that are formed under common genetic influence, and in agreement with likely prenatal origins for areal asymmetry (Rakic 1995; Li et al. 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The CT asymmetries were hard to interpret, given the relatively low Mantel scores – and the way the Biobank data stand out even just on the heatmap. This made me wonder if the more restricted age range of the Biobank sample might affect the covariances. I wasn't sure how the age residualisation worked, and whether it was within-sample or across samples, so hard to know if and how the fact that Biobank has a much higher age minimum than others might have an effect?</p></disp-quote><p>The age residualisation was previously performed separately within each sample, so it was plausible differences in age-ranges could have affected the results. Since we agree a better approach is to perform the age/sex/site/residualisation across collated samples, we followed the suggestion. The overall pattern of results did not change, with the UKB data still standing out. However, this approach improved results of the Mantel tests, increasing the whole-matrix correlation from r = .43 to.49 for the LCBC-UKB comparison, and from r = .45 to.62 for the LCBC-HCP comparison. This revised approach supports a stronger replication, with the effects clearly similar across samples, albeit still weaker in LCBC and HCP.</p><p>We have also added the following in the Discussion to mention the differences between datasets for thickness asymmetries:</p><p>526 – “Though it is unclear why the relationships were weaker in the other datasets tested, we nevertheless found similarly significant relationships in each (Figure 5—figure supplement 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

It would be worth taking some time in the introduction to discuss predictions from the 'multifactorial' account versus a 'single factor' account – relating this to discussions of cerebral torque.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following in the introduction to briefly mention these contrasting views:</p><p>93 – “Correlations between cortical asymmetries may provide a window on asymmetries formed under common genetic or developmental influences. Contemporary research suggests brain asymmetries are complex, multifactorial and largely independent (i.e. uncorrelated) traits (Rentería 2012; Francks 2015; Neubauer et al. 2020), contrasting earlier theories emphasizing a single (Annett 1964, 1998) or predominating factor (Geschwind and Galaburda 1985; McManus and Bryden 1991) controlling various cerebral lateralizations”</p><p>In addition, we also briefly mention the overall cerebral torque factor in the Discussion:</p><p>510 – “For areal asymmetry, we uncovered a covariance structure that almost perfectly replicated across datasets.

An alternative approach would be to just present the unflipped data, explaining that a positive correlation then indicates agreement in left-wardness (regardless of whether the population bias is left or right), and a negative correlation indicates agreement between the strength of lateralisation in the population direction.</p><p>10. The subsequent discussion of these results was pretty clear – it's just the account in Results that was hard to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we of course agree this is a viable alternative approach, we argue it is a less obvious interpretation for the average reader that a positive correlation between cluster AI’s with a negative mean (i.e. rightward) and one with a positive mean (i.e. leftward) indicates agreement in leftward asymmetry. At least, this will likely be less obvious to those outside of the laterality community, such as developmental scholars, and readers who skim the explanation in the figure caption that the “opposite hemisphere” relationships are evidence of an arguably different phenomenon may easily miss this point (see below heat maps). Instead, we chose to highlight the qualitatively different nature of the relationships we see between opposite-direction asymmetries. We argue that the most unambiguous and clear way to present these relationships is that a positive correlation should indicate an asymmetry-asymmetry relationship, regardless of population-direction in the cluster (i.e. higher asymmetry in the population-direction, as the Reviewer points out). As is made clear in the below heat maps, the flipping of course only affects the opposite-direction asymmetry relationships. The negative correlations immediately stand out as a different phenomenon, and indicate that more leftward asymmetry relates to less rightward asymmetry, without having to consider the AI formula. We chose to consistently do this also to aid interpretation of genetic correlations (again to asymmetry-asymmetry genetic relationships), and for the analysis of cognitive ability, handedness, sex etc. For the latter, it greatly facilitates the communication of results to the average reader to not have to consider that e.g. the interpretation of the relationship between handedness and asymmetry changes depending on whether the brain cluster visualized in Figure 7 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> is yellow or blue. For these reasons, we respectfully opt to maintain this decision. Where relevant, we have added the following text or similar:</p><p>“AI’s in rightward clusters are inversed, such that positive correlations denote positive asymmetry-asymmetry (genetic) relationships, regardless of direction of mean asymmetry in the cluster (i.e. higher asymmetry in the population-direction)”</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Example of results in UKB using proposed alternative approach.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84685-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Heritability</p><p>11.

This makes the replication much clearer, at least for areal asymmetry. We agree that not enough attention was previously paid to the fact the E term soaks up most variance, and the potential theoretical interpretations of this. Please see our full response in the below comment (point 12). As mentioned above, the abstract now highlights that areal asymmetry was also low-moderately heritable, and invokes an interpretation of stochastic influences around these still relatively low estimates. However, we maintain our decision to highlight the 19% estimate, because to our knowledge this represents the most heritable brain or behavioural asymmetry yet reported with genomic methods, and this estimate is as high as many other structural brain imaging phenotypes that are not asymmetry-focused (Elliott et al. 2018). The fact that this same cluster associates with handedness will thus be of great interest to asymmetry researchers.</p><p>38 – “… Areal asymmetry correlates phenotypically and genetically in specific regions, and is low-moderately heritable (max h<sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub> ~19%).

This does suggest that there are genetic influences that create these general biases to one direction or the other, but which have reached fixation in the population and so show little individual variation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We fully agree this is a likely interpretation, and now also emphasize this in the Discussion (in addition to the Abstract):</p><p>435 – “This evident consensus suggests genetic-developmental programs regulate mean brain lateralization with respect to both area and thickness in humans. However, the genetic findings presented herein suggest these may have reached population fixation, as heritability of even our optimally delineated asymmetry measures was generally low. This indicates either subject-specific stochastic mechanisms in early neurodevelopment or later developmental influences primarily determine cortical asymmetry. Tracing their lifespan development, we show the lifespan trajectories of areal asymmetry primarily suggest this form of cerebral asymmetry is developmentally stable at least from age ~4, maintained throughout life, and formed early on – possibly in utero (Li et al. 2014; Sha, Schijven, et al. 2021). One interpretation of lifespan stability combined with low heritability may be stochastic early life developmental influences determine interindividual differences in areal asymmetry more than later developmental change. However, future work linking prenatal and childhood trajectories is needed to affirm this. Still, we also found relatively stronger heritability and reproducible heritability maps for areal asymmetry (notably, anterior insula exhibited ~19% SNP-based heritability). This also illustrates region-dependent interindividual genetic effects upon areal asymmetry, and the fact that phenotypic correlations were underpinned by high genetic correlations suggests specific areal asymmetries are formed under common genetic influence. In stark contrast, our findings of childhood development of thickness asymmetry until a peak around age ~24, higher directional variability in adult samples, and lower heritability, converge to suggest thickness asymmetry may be more shaped through subject-specific effects in later childhood development, possibly as the brain grows in interaction with the environment. This interpretation applied to asymmetry agrees with work suggesting cortical area in general may trace more to early life factors (Walhovd et al. 2016; Grasby et al. 2020) whereas thickness may be more related to and impacted by lifespan influences (Rakic 1995; Walhovd et al. 2016; Grasby et al. 2020)”</p><p>549 – “However, as noted above, although heritability of either hemisphere was high, areal asymmetry heritability was still only moderate at best, suggesting both genetics but primarily subject-specific stochastic effects likely underly its formation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Associations with cognition</p><p>13. As noted above, I felt this treatment was too brief. There is a rich literature on associations with asymmetry for the variables considered here, much of it focusing on the degree rather than the direction of asymmetry. So I would like to see a separate paper dealing with associations with AIs from this analysis, relating the findings more systematically to prior studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the literature review regarding asymmetry-cognition associations lacked some necessary detail. However, although a rich literature has attempted to associate diverse aspects of brain asymmetry with cognitive ability, almost none of these studies focuses specifically on cortical asymmetry. Indeed, we are only aware of three other studies testing cognitive links with cortical asymmetry or derivations of it (beyond our previous one which included cognitive change analysis in aging; (Roe et al. 2021)). Two of these focused on fluctuating asymmetry (Yeo et al. 2016; Moodie et al. 2020), operationalizing this as the average across absolute asymmetry deviance scores from the mean per-ROI, and are therefore not directly comparable to the present study. The remaining one found that greater thickness asymmetry in the expected direction may relate to better cognitive outcomes (Plessen et al. 2014). We now explicitly mention this study in the Introduction and Discussion, as well as summarize all previous work attempting to relate cortical asymmetry specifically to variations in cognitive ability:</p><p>106 – “Finally, altered development of cerebral lateralization in general has been widely hypothesized to relate to average poorer cognitive outcomes (Crow et al. 1998; Hirnstein et al. 2010; Plessen et al. 2014). Specifically in the context of cortical asymmetry, however, although one previous study reported larger thickness asymmetry may relate to better verbal and visuospatial cognition (Plessen et al. 2014), phenotypic asymmetry-cognition associations have been rarely reported (Plessen et al. 2014; Yeo et al. 2016; Moodie et al. 2020), conflicting (Yeo et al. 2016; Moodie et al. 2020), not directly comparable (Plessen et al. 2014; Moodie et al. 2020), and to date remain untested in large-scale data. Still, recent work points to small but significant overlap between genes underlying multivariate brain asymmetries and those influencing educational attainment and specific developmental disorders impacting cognition (Sha, Schijven, et al. 2021), indicating either pleiotropy between non-related traits or capturing shared genetic susceptibility to altered brain lateralization and cognitive outcomes.”</p><p>574 – “Also of note, no other asymmetry showed evidence of cognitive association (Figure 7—figure supplement 1), suggesting previously reported associations in small samples will likely not replicate (Plessen et al. 2014)”</p><p>Since we are careful not to generalize our findings to asymmetry measures not studied here, we do not agree we should separate this into another paper. Methodologically, we maintain our decision to reduce the 11 UK Biobank cognitive variables to their shared variation (Lyall et al. 2016), because the brief nature of UKB cognitive tests does not permit an overly thorough investigation into how different aspects of cognition relate to cortical asymmetry. That is, although it seemed like a brief treatment, it is a defensible and possibly close to optimal approach to take with this data. Note that we now consistently refer to our PC1 measure in terms of “general cognitive ability”. Regarding the distinction with absolute asymmetry, the statements we opt for are always specific to cortical asymmetry, and we are not aware of a large literature looking at absolute strength of cortical asymmetries when testing associations with cognition. However, we have added text to acknowledge this remains to be tested:</p><p>657 – “Relatedly, because UKB cognitive data is not exhaustive (Fawns-Ritchie and Deary 2020) (e.g. fluid IQ ranges from 1-13), we extracted the common variance across core tests to index general cognitive ability. This approach does not permit testing associations with well-operationalized or specific cognitive domains (for which UKB cognitive data may not be sufficient), and it remains to be seen whether cortical asymmetry may be informative in the context of specific forms of lateralized cognition (Ocklenburg et al. 2014), or using absolute non-directional measures. However, the subtlety of the only effect on cognition we find here may suggest we might expect similarly weak effects, though not necessarily if brain and phenotypic measurement accuracy is jointly optimized (Aki Nikolaidis et al. 2022).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14.
