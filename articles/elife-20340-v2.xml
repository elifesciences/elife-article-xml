of cellular aging. However, little is known about aging and longevity in symmetrically dividing eukaryotic cells because most prior studies have used budding yeast for RLS studies. Here, we describe a multiplexed fission yeast lifespan micro-dissector (multFYLM) and an associated image processing pipeline for performing high-throughput and automated single-cell micro-dissection. Using the multFYLM, we observe continuous replication of hundreds of individual fission yeast cells for over seventy-five generations. Surprisingly, cells die without the classic hallmarks of cellular aging, such as progressive changes in size, doubling time, or sibling health. Genetic perturbations and drugs can extend the RLS via an aging-independent mechanism. Using a quantitative model to analyze these results, we conclude that fission yeast does not age and that cellular aging and replicative lifespan can be uncoupled in a eukaryotic cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20340.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20340.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20340.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As the cells in our bodies age, their ability to carry out their normal processes also degrades. Ultimately, this causes tissues to deteriorate. How rapidly a cell ages depends on the genes encoded in its DNA, and can also be affected by certain drug treatments.</p><p>Cells reproduce by dividing to form two new cells. One common approach used to study cellular aging is to follow how genetic modifications and drug treatments alter how many offspring a cell produces before it dies. So far, most of these studies have been performed using budding yeast cells, which reproduce by dividing asymmetrically to form two differently sized cells. Little is known about aging in cells that divide symmetrically.</p><p>Another type of yeast, called fission yeast, divides symmetrically. Furthermore, many of the processes used by fission yeast cells to repair and replicate DNA are the same as those used in human cells. To study aging in fission yeast, Spivey, Jones et al. developed a “microfluidic” device and software tools that can image and track a large number of cells across their entire lifespans (which last for up to a week).</p><p>Unexpectedly, it appears that fission yeast do not age. Although cells died, their deaths were random and their chance of dying did not increase as the cells got older. Treating the cells with a drug called rapamycin lengthened their average lifespan, as did stabilizing their DNA. Treatments that impaired the ability of the cells to repair their DNA reduced the yeast's lifespan. However, in all cases, a cell’s chance of death stayed constant as the cells got older.</p><p>One conclusion that could be drawn from the work of Spivey, Jones et al. is that cellular aging may be intrinsic to cells that divide asymmetrically – so budding yeast ages whilst fission yeast does not. Future studies will investigate this in more detail; for example, by looking at how “pro-aging factors” are segregated between dividing cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20340.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20340.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>replicative lifespan</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>fission yeast</kwd><kwd>microfluidics</kwd><kwd>single cell</kwd><kwd>microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000965</institution-id><institution>American Federation for Aging Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AFAR-020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spivey</surname><given-names>Eric C</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Stephen K</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Rybarski</surname><given-names>James R</given-names></name><name><surname>Saifuddin</surname><given-names>Fatema A</given-names></name><name><surname>Finkelstein</surname><given-names>Ilya J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 AG053051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Stephen K</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R1214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rybarski</surname><given-names>James R</given-names></name><name><surname>Saifuddin</surname><given-names>Fatema A</given-names></name><name><surname>Finkelstein</surname><given-names>Ilya J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F-l808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spivey</surname><given-names>Eric C</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Stephen K</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Rybarski</surname><given-names>James R</given-names></name><name><surname>Saifuddin</surname><given-names>Fatema A</given-names></name><name><surname>Finkelstein</surname><given-names>Ilya J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A high throughput, full lifespan microscopic analysis reveals that fission yeast does not age but has a finite replicative lifespan.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is the progressive decrease of an organism’s fitness over time. The asymmetric segregation of pro-aging factors (e.g., damaged proteins and organelles) has been proposed to promote aging in mitotically active yeast and higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bufalino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erjavec et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Katajisto et al., 2015</xref>). In budding yeast, asymmetric division into mother and daughter cells ensures that a mother cell produces a limited number of daughters over its replicative lifespan (RLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</xref>). Aging mother cells increase in size, divide progressively more slowly, and produce shorter-lived daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartholomew and Mittwer, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kennedy et al., 1994</xref>). Mother cell decline is associated with asymmetric phenotypes such as preferential retention of protein aggregates, dysregulation of vacuole acidity, and genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saka et al., 2013</xref>). By sequestering pro-aging factors in the mothers, newly born daughters reset their RLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kwan et al., 2013</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that alternate mechanisms may be active in symmetrically dividing eukaryotic cells.</p><p>The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is an excellent model system for investigating RLS and aging phenotypes in symmetrically dividing eukaryotic cells. Fission yeast cells are cylindrical, grow by linear extension, and divide via medial fission. After cell division, the two sibling cells each inherit one pre-existing cell tip (old-pole). The new tip is formed at the site of septation (new-pole). Immediately after division, new growth is localized at the old-pole end of the cell. Activation of growth at the new-pole cell tip occurs ~30% through the cell cycle (generally halfway through G<sub>2</sub>). This transition from monopolar to bipolar growth is known as new end take-off (NETO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mitchison and Nurse, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sveiczer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin and Chang, 2005</xref>). Prior studies of fission yeast have yielded conflicting results regarding cellular aging. Several papers reported aging phenotypes akin to those observed in budding yeast (e.g., mother cells become larger, divide more slowly, and have less healthy offspring as they age) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erjavec et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker and Walmsley, 1999</xref>). However, a recent report used colony lineage analysis to conclude that protein aggregates are not asymmetrically distributed, and that inheriting the old cell pole or the old spindle pole body during cell division does not lead to a decline in cell health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coelho et al., 2013</xref>). However, this report tracked the first 7–8 cell divisions of microcolonies on agar plates and thus could not observe the RLS of single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coelho et al., 2013</xref>). The controversy between these studies may partially stem from the difficulty in tracking visually identical cells for dozens of generations.</p><p>Replicative lifespan assays require the separation of cells after every division. This is traditionally done via manual micro-dissection of sibling cells on agar plates, a laborious process that is especially difficult and error-prone for symmetrically dividing fission yeast. Extrinsic effects related to using a solid agar surface may confound observations made under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mei and Brenner, 2015</xref>). Finally, recent work using high-throughput microfluidic devices to study individual budding yeast and bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nobs and Maerkl, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huberts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Minc and Chang, 2010</xref>) has shown that large sample sizes are needed to truly capture cellular lifespan accurately – populations less than ~100 cells do not reliably estimate the RLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huberts et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the first high-throughput characterization of both RLS and aging in fission yeast. To enable these studies, we describe a microfluidic device—the multiplexed fission yeast lifespan microdissector (multFYLM)—and a software analysis suite that capture and track individual <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells throughout their lifespan. Using this platform, we present the first quantitative replicative lifespan study in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, settling a long-standing controversy regarding whether this organism undergoes replicative aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erjavec et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker and Walmsley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coelho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Minois et al., 2006</xref>). The RLS of fission yeast is substantially longer than previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erjavec et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker and Walmsley, 1999</xref>). Remarkably, cell death is stochastic and does not exhibit the classic hallmarks of cellular aging. Despite the lack of aging phenotypes, rapamycin and Sir2p overexpression both extend RLS, whereas increased genome instability decreases RLS. These results demonstrate that RLS can be extended without any aging phenotypes, a fact that has implications for the proposed mechanism of lifespan extension by these interventions. Using these results, we also describe a quantitative framework for analyzing how stochastic and age-dependent effects contribute to the experimentally measured replicative lifespan. This framework will be broadly applicable to future replicative lifespan studies of model organisms. We conclude that fission yeast dies primarily via a stochastic, age-independent mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A high-throughput microfluidic assay for measuring the replicative lifespan of fission yeast</title><p>Replicative lifespan assays require the separation of cells after every division. This is traditionally done via manual micro-dissection of sibling cells, a laborious process that is especially difficult for symmetrically dividing fission yeast. We recently developed a microfluidic platform for capturing and immobilizing individual fission yeast cells via their old cell tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spivey et al., 2014</xref>). However, our first-generation device could only observe a single strain per experiment, required an unconventional fabrication strategy, and suffered from frequent cell loss that ultimately shortened the observation time. To address these limitations, we developed a multiplexed fission yeast lifespan microdissector (multFYLM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), along with a dedicated software package designed to streamline the analysis and quantification of raw microscopy data. Single cells are geometrically constrained within catch channels, preserving the orientation of the cell poles over multiple generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The cells divide by medial fission, thereby ensuring that the oldest cell pole is retained deep within the catch channel. If new-pole tips are loaded initially, then these outward-facing tips become the old-pole tips after the first division.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20340.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A multiplexed fission yeast lifespan microdissector (multFYLM).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of multFYLM (gray) loaded with fission yeast (orange).

Cells are drawn into the catch channels by flow from the central trench to the side trenches via a small (2 µm W x 5 µm L x ~12 µm H) drain channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We did not monitor all 2352 catch channels during our experiments, but we routinely filled &gt;80% of the 224 monitored catch channels in each of the six microfluidic sub-systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). A constant flow of fresh media supplies nutrients, removes waste, and ensures that cells are stably retained for the duration of the experiment. Once loaded, up to 98% of the cells could be retained in their respective catch channels for over 100 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). As a cell grows and divides, the old-pole cell is maintained by flow at the end of the catch channel, while the new-pole cells grow towards the central trench. Eventually, the new-pole cells are pushed into the central trench, where they are washed out by constant media flow (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). This allows for continuous, whole-lifetime observation of the old-pole cell as well as its newest siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-20340-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20340.007</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Operation of the multFYLM.</title><p>Time-lapse imaging of fission yeast in a single field of view of the multFYLM for approximately 140 hr.

The hazard rate (also called the death rate) can be calculated for any generational age using this function. Surprisingly, the fission yeast survival curve did not fit the traditional aging-dependent Gompertz model, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gompertz, 1825</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greenwood, 1928</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilson, 1993</xref>), which describes survival and hazard in terms of a generation-dependent (<italic>i.e.,</italic> aging) and a generation-independent term (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation (2)</xref> in Materials and methods). The RLS data were best described by a single exponential decay, corresponding to a generation-independent hazard rate. Strikingly, the hazard rate does not increase as the replicative age increases; instead, it remains steady at an average ~2% chance of death per cell per generation. For comparison, we also analyzed the survival data and hazard function for budding yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) grown in a microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jo et al., 2015</xref>).

To explore the effect of different genetic backgrounds on replicative lifespan, we determined survival curves, hazard functions, and replicative half-lives for three additional strains, including two wild fission yeast isolates with distinct morphologies and population doubling times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeffares et al., 2015</xref>). Most laboratory fission yeast strains have three chromosomes, but the recently identified strain CBS2777 has a fourth chromosome that originated via a series of complex genomic rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>). CBS2777 had the shortest RLS of 22.7 generations (95% CI 21.9–23.6 generations), consistent with its aberrant genome and altered genome maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, strains NCYC132 and JB760 showed greater longevity with estimated RLS of &gt;50 and &gt;70 generations, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). These RLS correspond to a hazard rate that is ~5 fold lower than strain h- 972 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The longevity of strain NCYC132 is consistent with an earlier manual microdissection study performed on solid media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coelho et al., 2013</xref>). Each strain’s survival curve was best described by an exponential decay function, resulting in a generation-independent hazard function. Thus, an aging-independent replicative lifespan is a feature of diverse fission yeasts isolates, and likely the entire species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Aging-associated phenotypes do not correlate with death in fission yeast</title><p>Prior RLS studies have identified three common phenotypes associated with cellular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Piper, 2006</xref>). In budding yeast, aging mother cells increase in cell size, progressively slow their doubling times, and produce daughters with decreased fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartholomew and Mittwer, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kennedy et al., 1994</xref>). Whether older fission yeast cells also undergo similar aging-associated phenotypes remains unresolved. To answer these outstanding questions, we examined time-dependent changes in morphology, doubling times, and sibling health in individual fission yeast cells as they approached death. Quantitative observation of cell length revealed two classes of dying cells: the majority (72%; n = 234) died prior to reaching the normal division length (&lt;16.2 µm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). The remaining cells (28%; n = 92) showed an elongated phenotype and exceeded the average division time by more than three-fold. In <italic>S. pombe,</italic> cell length is strongly correlated with division time and cell length, indicating that cell cycle checkpoints were likely dysregulated in these dying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mitchison and Nurse, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sveiczer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wood and Nurse, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hachet et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these differences in length at death, most cells had normal doubling times throughout their lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). Next, we investigated whether there were any morphological changes in the generations preceding death. The majority of cells retained wild type cell lengths and doubling rates until the penultimate cell division. In the two generations immediately preceding death, there was a mild, but statistically significant change in the distributions of cell lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and doubling times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, we did not observe any predictable trends for individual cells, arguing against a consistent pattern of age-related decline.

This is possible because the last siblings of dying cells also remain captured in the catch channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These are siblings that are produced by the final division of the old-pole cells. We categorized these siblings into three classes: (i) those that died without dividing, (ii) those that divided once and died, and (iii) those that divided two or more times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>). The fate of the new-pole siblings was independent of the replicative age of the old-pole cells at death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Most new-pole siblings of a dying cell (66%, n = 135) never divided and typically did not grow, suggesting that the underlying cause of death was distributed symmetrically between the two sibling cells. Similarly, new-pole siblings that divided once and died (14%, n = 29) also typically did not grow. old-pole cells that died while hyper-elongated were more likely to have these unhealthy offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). As elongated cells generally indicate the activation of a DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furnari et al., 1997</xref>), our findings suggest that genome instability in these cells may be the underlying cause of death in both the old cell and its most recent sibling. In new-pole siblings that divided two or more times (20%, n = 40), doubling times were indistinguishable from rapidly growing, healthy cells (2.1 ± 0.7 hr, n = 208). These healthy new-pole cells were typically born from old-pole cells that did not elongate during their terminal division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). These observations suggest that the cause of death was contained within the old-pole cell, thereby reducing the likelihood of death in the sibling. Taken together, our observations suggest that in 76% of cases, cell death impacts both sibling cells. However, in 24% of cells, death is localized to just one of the two siblings. Importantly, there was no correlation between the replicative age of the old-pole cell and survival probability of the last sibling cell. These observations are in stark contrast to <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> where aging factors are generally sequestered to younger mother cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). However, older <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mothers produce larger and slower-dividing daughter cells.

Gar2 localizes to rDNA during transcription and has been used to monitor rDNA dynamics in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Win et al., 2005</xref>). The strain expressing Gar2-mCherry at the native locus divided at approximately the same length and rate as wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Dividing cells mostly had equal Gar2 fluorescence in both sibling cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). However, 7% of cells (n = 88/1182) showed rDNA segregation defects that appear as multiple rDNA loci, asymmetric fluorescence distributions, or rDNA bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The rDNA mis-segregation was similar to mis-segregation of a fluorescent marker on chromosome I (7% of cells; n = 20/278) and chromosome II (5% of cells; n = 19/370) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Multi-punctate rDNA loci were nearly always lethal, whereas asymmetric rDNA segregation and rDNA bridges were lethal in 40% of cells (n = 31/78; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, 40% of cells (n = 56/141) showed rDNA defects immediately preceding death. In dying cells, rDNA instability was elevated relative to mis-segregation of chromosome I (16% of cells; n = 15/95) and chromosome II (13% of cells; n = 18/137) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Loss of Rqh1p caused higher frequencies of spontaneous rDNA defects, a shorter RLS (5.3 generations, 95% CI 5.0–5.7), and a &gt;7 fold higher hazard rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). rDNA defects were even more prevalent in dying <italic>rqh1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The multFYLM provides a temperature-controlled growth environment for hundreds of individual cells for up to a week (&gt;75 generations), facilitating tens of thousands of micro-dissections. We also developed an image-processing pipeline for quantitative phenotypic analysis of individual cell lineages. The blueprints for multFYLM, as well as the image analysis pipeline are both available via GitHub (see Materials and methods). We note that microfluidics-based lifespan measurements are free from potential extrinsic effects (e.g., secretion of small molecules onto the solid agar surface) which have been proposed to confound observations of RLS assays using manual microdissection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mei and Brenner, 2015</xref>). Using the multFYLM, we set out to determine whether fission yeast undergoes replicative aging.</p><p>Taken together, our data provide three sets of experimental evidence that fission yeast does not age. First, the RLS survival curves and corresponding hazard rates are qualitatively different between budding and fission yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The budding yeast RLS is best described by a Gompertz model that includes both an age-dependent as well as an age-independent survival probability. In contrast, the fission yeast RLS is best described by a single exponential decay. This corresponds to a hazard function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> that is constant with each generation, as would be expected for an organism that does not age. Second, we observed that cell volumes and division rates did not change until the penultimate cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Third, after the death of a cell, the health of the surviving sibling was also independent of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These conclusions are also broadly consistent with a recent report that observed robust, aging-independent growth of the symmetrically dividing <italic>E. coli</italic> in a microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our results highlight a critical consideration when interpreting replicative lifespan curves. The experimentally determined RLS does not necessarily report on whether a population of cells is aging. This is because the RLS is affected by a combination of both age-independent and age-dependent biological processes—cell may die randomly without aging. A mathematical model is required to further parse the relative contributions of aging-independent and aging-dependent mechanisms. The Gompertz function is an excellent model for understanding the replicative lifespan survival curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bansal et al., 2015</xref>). In this model, the replicative lifespan is dependent on just two parameters: (i) an age-independent hazard rate, and (ii) an age-dependent hazard rate, which determine how rapidly mortality increases as a function of the cell’s age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkwood, 2015</xref>). Together, these two parameters describe a population’s likelihood of death at any age. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> illustrates that the experimentally observed RLS is dependent on both of these terms. An increased RLS is not sufficient to conclude that cells age more slowly. Indeed, our data indicate that a decreased RLS can also be achieved by increasing the age-independent hazard rate. To further illustrate this point, we include a Gompertz model analysis of the RLS of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> grown in a microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jo et al., 2015</xref>) and our own data from <italic>S. pombe</italic>. For all of our data, changes in RLS can be completely accounted for by changes in the age-independent hazard rate. In contrast, budding yeast have age-dependent hazard rates an order of magnitude higher than their age-independent rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We anticipate that the development of the multFYLM, as well as a quantitative analysis framework, will continue to inform comparative RLS studies in model organisms.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20340.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The replicative lifespan is an incomplete reporter of cellular aging.</title><p>RLS contours were generated from experimentally determined ranges of Gompertz coefficients using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation (7)</xref>.

Strikingly, the RLS of <italic>S. pombe</italic> can be extended by up to 41% via rapamycin treatment and Sir2p over-expression without influencing aging-related phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that rapamycin and Sir2p both reduce the onset of sudden death. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence these interventions can extend the RLS in an organism that does not age. This suggests that both Sir2p and rapamycin may partially affect the RLS of aging organisms like <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> via an aging-independent mechanism. Additional studies will be required to parse out the aging-dependent and aging-independent mechanisms of RLS extension.</p><p>For a subset of cells, genomic instability due to aberrant segregation of the rDNA locus may be one cause of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ganley and Kobayashi, 2014</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, rDNA segregation defects were highly elevated relative to general chromosome mis-segregation in wild type cells immediately prior to death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Ablating Rqh1p, a helicase that promotes rDNA stability and replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stewart et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murray et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doe et al., 2000</xref>), further increased rDNA defects while drastically reducing the RLS, independent of age. Recent studies also indicate that protein aggregation may be a second major cause of sudden death in rapidly dividing fission yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coelho et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2014</xref>). These two mechanisms of death need not be mutually exclusive.

A tape barrier was applied to the edge of a silicon wafer bearing the multFYLM master structures, and 13 g of PDMS was poured onto the wafer, covering the surface. The wafer with PDMS was degassed for ~10 min (at 60–70 cmHg vacuum in a vacuum chamber) to remove additional bubbles, then placed in a 70°C oven for 15–17 min. The wafer was intentionally removed while the PDMS was still tacky to improve adhesion of the microfluidic connectors (nanoports). To create a source and drain interface for the device, nanoports (N-333–01, IDEX Health and Science, Oak Harbor, WA) were applied to the surface of the PDMS over the ends of the master structure of the multFYLM, then an additional 14 g of PDMS was poured over the surface, with care taken to avoid getting liquid PDMS inside the nanoports. The wafer with PDMS and nanoports was then degassed &gt;10 min to remove additional bubbles, and then returned to the 70°C oven for 3 hr to cure completely. The cured PDMS was then removed whole from the wafer after cooling to room temperature. A multFYLM with nanoports was trimmed from the cured PDMS disk to approximately 15 × 25 mm. A 1 mm diameter biopsy punch (Acu-punch, Accuderm) was used to make holes connecting the bottom of each nanoport to the conduits on the bottom surface of the PDMS. The multFYLM was then placed in isopropanol and sonicated for 30 min, removed, and placed to dry on a 70°C hotplate for 2 hr. Borosilicate glass coverslips (48 × 65 mm #1, Gold Seal) were concurrently prepared by cleaning for &gt;1 hr in a 2% detergent solution (Hellmannex II, Hellma Analytics), then rinsing thoroughly in deionized water and isopropanol before drying for &gt;2 hr on a 70°C hotplate. Cleaned multFYLM and coverslips were stored in a covered container until needed. To bond, the multFYLM and a coverslip were placed in a plasma cleaner (PDC-32G, Harrick Scientific) and cleaned for 20 s on the ‘high’ setting with oxygen plasma from ambient air (~21% oxygen). The multFYLM and glass coverslip were then gently pressed together to form a permanent bond. To make the microfluidic interface, PFA tubing (1512L, IDEX), with a 1/16” outer diameter was used to connect a 100 mL luer lock syringe (60271, Veterinary Concepts, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.veterinaryconcepts.com">www.veterinaryconcepts.com</ext-link>) to the multFYLM, and to construct a drain line leading from the multFYLM to a waste container. The tubing was connected to the multFYLM nanoports using 10–32 coned nuts (F-332–01, IDEX) with ferrules (F-142N, IDEX). A two-way valve (P-512, IDEX) was placed on the drain line to allow for better flow control. For longer experiments, two syringes could be loaded in tandem, connected with a Y-connector (P-512, IDEX). The valve and Y-connector were connected to the tubing using ¼−28 connectors (P-235, IDEX) with flangeless ferrules (P-200, IDEX). The source line tubing was connected to the syringe with a Luer adapter (P-658, IDEX). The syringe(s) was/were then placed in a syringe pump (Legato 210, KD Scientific) for operation.

Deletion of <italic>sir2</italic> in the wild-type h- 972 strain was completed by first generating a PCR product containing KANMX4 flanked by <italic>SIR2</italic> 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions. Competent IF30 cells were then transformed with the PCR product and selected on YES +G418 agar plates. Deletion was confirmed by PCR. A <italic>SIR2</italic> over-expression plasmid was generated via Gateway cloning (Life Technologies). First, <italic>SIR2</italic> was integrated into the pDONR221 plasmid to yield pIF133. <italic>SIR2</italic> was then swapped from pIF133 to pDUAL-GFH1 (Riken), yielding plasmid pIF200. pIF200 expresses <italic>SIR2</italic> under the <italic>NMT1</italic> promoter, and also labels the protein C-terminally with a eGFP-FLAG-His6 tags.

Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, and then blocked with PBS Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor, Inc.) for one hour with shaking at 22°C. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4°C while shaking in phosphate buffered saline +0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) containing 1:1000 dilution of anti-β actin antibody (mouse, ab8224, Abcam) and 1:500 dilution of an <italic>S. pombe</italic>-specific anti-Sir2p antibody (rabbit, generously provided by Dr. Allshire) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buscaino et al., 2013</xref>).

The FYLM Critic pipeline consists of two discrete stages: (i) pre-processing the raw microscope images to correct for stage drift, and (ii) quantification of cell phenotypes (e.g., length, doubling time, fluorescence intensity and spatial distribution).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Stage 1: Pre-processing the microscope images</title><p>Several image pre-processing steps were taken to permit efficient quantification. First, the angles of the four solid sections of PDMS on either side of the catch channels were measured relative to the vertical axis of the image, and a corrective rotation in the opposite direction was applied to all images in that field of view. This resulted in the long axis of each cell being completely horizontal in all subsequent analyses. The multFYLM was too large to be imaged in its entirety within a single field of view, so the microscope stage was programmed to move to eight different subsections of the device in a continuous cycle. Due to the imperfect motion of the microscope stage, subsequent images of the same field of view randomly translated by a few micrometers relative to the previous image at the same nominal location. Images were aligned to the first image of the sequence using a cross-correlation algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guizar-Sicairos et al., 2008</xref>). The exact location of each catch channel was manually specified, but only if a cell had already entered the channel at the beginning of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Stage 2: Annotating individual cells within the multFYLM</title><p>In order to analyze cell lengths and phenotypes, kymographs were produced for each catch channel and then annotated semi-manually. To produce the kymographs, a line of pixels was taken along the center of each catch channel, starting from the center of the ‘notch’ and extending into the central trench. This kymograph captured information along the long axis of the cells. The time-dependent one-dimensional (1D) kymographs for each catch channel were stacked together vertically, producing a two-dimensional (2D) kymograph of each cell’s growth and division. The out-of-focus image was used for this process as the septa and cell walls were much more distinct, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nobs and Maerkl, 2014</xref>). The position of the old-pole and the leftmost septum were then manually annotated using a simple point-and-click interface to identify each cell division. Once all single-cell kymographs were annotated, this annotation was used to calculate a cell length for each time point. The final status of the cell (whether it died, survived to the end of the experiment, or was ejected) was determined by the user. Further analysis of the cell length, growth rates, and fluorescence intensities was performed in MATLAB (Mathworks). The local minima of the growth curves were used to determine division times and the replicative age of each cell.</p><p>Ejections and replacement of individual cells within the catch channels may confound our whole-lifespan tracking. Therefore, we optimizing cell loading, retention and imaging conditions to minimize the loss of individual cells throughout the course of each experiment. First, ejection of individual cells was minimized over the course of ~100 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Second, each cell was imaged once every two minutes, minimizing the amount of time during which a cell could conceivably be ejected and replaced by another from the central trench. If a cell were indeed replaced within our two-minute frame rate, we would expect an abrupt change in the captured cell length (indicated a re-loading event). All kymographs were carefully monitored for such events, and in the rare cases where this occurred, were discarded from the final analysis. In summary, our analysis ensures that cell ejection or re-capture is mitigated by both efficient cell capture and by analysis of the single-cell datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Survival curves</title><p>Kaplan-Meier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaplan and Meier, 1958</xref>) survival function estimates were calculated in MATLAB.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Each reviewer thought the study was technically well done and the results showing that <italic>S. pombe</italic> does not age were convincing. However, the major issue comes down to novelty. Two of the reviewers correctly pointed out that the microfluidic assay has already been published from your lab, and another group previously showed that <italic>S. pombe</italic> does not age, but using a microcolony-based assay. Your new high-throughput system is much better, but the conclusion that <italic>S. pombe</italic> does not age was already published, making the current findings less novel. After extensive debate, we decided the story does not reach the bar for novelty to be acceptable for publication <italic>eLife</italic>. I'm sorry for the disappointing news. The individual reviewer comments are included below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript by Spivey et al. describes a novel high-throughput microfluidic system for tracking the replicative lifespan (RLS) of the symmetrically dividing yeast, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. There have been conflicting reports of whether <italic>S. pombe</italic> actually ages or not, probably because of the difficulty in reliably following individual cells that have divided through fission. The multiplexed fission yeast lifespan microdissector (FYLM) solves this problem by forming a trap that traps and retains one cell pole and then allows new cell poles from the fission to flow away. The authors also developed a robust image analysis software package with the clever name &quot;FYLM Critic&quot;. An earlier, single-channel version of this microfluidic system was previously described by the authors as a proof of principal, but this one appears to be much improved. FYLM is used in this study to demonstrate that <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells do not display age-associated changes in growth or morphology, and their rate of death does change with replicative age. Rather than fitting a Gompertz model for survival that takes into account age-dependent and age-independent contributions, the <italic>S. pombe</italic> data instead fits a model of single exponential decay. These cells apparently die stochastically, without any increased risk per generation.</p><p>Sir2 overexpression and rapamycin treatment, two conditions that extend <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RLS and lifespan of other model eukaryotes, actually extended <italic>S. pombe</italic> RLS as well.

Furthermore, the likelihood of death does not increase with increasing numbers of cell divisions. Also, the siblings of dead cells do not show an increased chance of death.

This effect is significantly smaller than reported in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> but mirrors an earlier observation that the <italic>S. pombe sir2Δ</italic> strain retains nearly the same fitness as wild type cells (Erjavec et al., 2008, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0804550105). The 40-50% reduction of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RLS in a <italic>sir2Δ</italic> background may stem from the key role that Sir2p plays in maintaining genetic stability at the rDNA locus (Saka et al., 2013, DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2013.07.048). In contrast, <italic>S. pombe</italic> appears to have a redundant, Sir2p-independent mechanism for maintaining rDNA stability (Shankaranarayana et al., 2003, DOI: 10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00489-5).</p><p>A revised supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) now includes additional characterization of Sir2p protein levels (Western blot) and localization.

The antibody detected both native Sir2p and Sir2p-eGFP (seen as a slower-migrating species in panel B). Importantly, the antibody did not show any signal in the <italic>sir2Δ</italic> background. Panel (C) of the revised figure also demonstrates that Sir2p-eGFP localizes to the nucleus. Taken together, these results confirm ~2-3 fold over-expression of Sir2p in this construct. This data is also mentioned in the aforementioned subsection of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>mCherry-tagged Gar2 was used to monitor rDNA locus dynamics/segregation in the live cells.

Chromosome loci were marked with a TetO cassette that was integrated into Chromosome I or Chromosome II, as described previously (Petrova et al., 2013, DOI: 10.1128/MCB.01400-12). These strains also expressed a nuclear TetR-tdTomato fusion for live-cell fluorescence imaging. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> summarizes chromosome mis-segregation at Chromosomes I and II and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> describes chromosome mis-segregation at the rDNA locus (Chromosome III). In short, we find that normally dividing cells have similarly low rates of chromosome mis-segregation (7%, 5%, and 7% of cells showed defects for chromosomes I, II, and III, respectively). However, rDNA defects were elevated relative to chromosome I and II mis-segregation in cells immediately preceding death (16%, 13%, and 40% for chromosomes I, II, and III, respectively).</p><p>Chromosome I and II mis-segregation was elevated 2.3 and 2.6-fold in dying cells, whereas rDNA instability was elevated 5.7-fold.

Three manuscripts invoked aging and only one (Coelho et al) came to the opposite conclusion. These conflicting studies likely stem from the technical difficulties of monitoring individual cells that divide by binary fission.</p><p>Coelho <italic>et al.</italic> drew their conclusions from the analysis of six to eight cell divisions in a micro- colony. However, analyzing just eight cell divisions (~24 hrs in the lab) means that the vast majority of cells are still living. This is insufficient to draw broad conclusions about the replicative lifespan of any organism that can divide 70+ times before death (over a week of continuous division). Without a better understanding of the full replicative lifespan of <italic>S. pombe</italic>, which turns out to be ~40 generations long, it is also difficult to put the cell deaths observed during 8 generations in its proper context. In contrast, our study observed the full replicative lifespan of hundreds of individual cells from multiple biological replicates and a number of different genotypes. This rich dataset allowed us to develop statistical tests for aging and to fit the lifespan data to a model that separating aging dependent and aging independent factors. This significantly expands the datasets presented by Coelho et al. and definitively settles the long- standing controversy of whether fission yeast ages.</p><p>This manuscript also presents <italic>the first high-throughput microfluidic device</italic> for replicative lifespan studies in rod-shaped eukaryotic cells.

Prior to our study, it was unclear whether overexpression of Sir2p or addition of rapamycin can extend lifespan without fundamentally affecting aging. Our study is the first to suggest that lifespan can be increased without any aging phenotypes, a fact that has implications for the proposed mechanism of lifespan extension by these interventions.

Why invent a new name when the basic design of the device is essentially identical to what has been already published and widely adopted?</italic> </p><p>Our method is different from the device published by Wang et al. (2010, DOI: DOI:10.1016/j.cub.2010.04.045) in both function and scale. First, we used standard microlithography, a technique available to nearly all biophysical and single-cell biology labs. Due to the relatively small size of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, Wang et al. used an unconventional and highly specialized fabrication strategy. A second major difference is that our device has continuous media flow through the cell capture chambers (Wang et al. did not). This ensures that each cell is maintained in an environment that provides nutrients and prevents any accumulation of waste products. This was necessary because of the significantly longer timescales of our experiments and the robust growth of bacteria relative to yeast in spent media. Third, our devices can multiplex up to six distinct genotypes into a single experiment and monitor multi-color fluorescent signals throughput the replicative lifespan. Fourth, we provide both an image processing toolkit and a statistical framework for analyzing the datasets obtained via our device. Although we drew inspiration from the cartoon illustration in Wang et al., both the images and the actual platform are significantly different and highlight the novelty of our approach.</p><p>The reviewer shows concern about our nomenclature (multiplexed fission yeast lifespan microdissector; multFYLM) and suggests keeping the naming convention established in Wang et al.(“mother machine”).
