distribution. Although this pattern was discovered more than sixty years ago, it remains an open question to explain its ubiquity. Here, we propose an explanation based on evolutionary dynamics on graphs. For simple models of a mutant or pathogen invading a network-structured population of healthy cells, we show that skewed distributions of incubation periods emerge for a wide range of assumptions about invader fitness, competition dynamics, and network structure. The skewness stems from stochastic mechanisms associated with two classic problems in probability theory: the coupon collector and the random walk. Unlike previous explanations that rely crucially on heterogeneity, our results hold even for homogeneous populations. Thus, we predict that two equally healthy individuals subjected to equal doses of equally pathogenic agents may, by chance alone, show remarkably different time courses of disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30212.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When one child goes to school with a throat infection, many of his or her classmates will often start to come down with a sore throat after two or three days. A few of the children will get sick sooner, the very next day, while others may take about a week. As such, there is a distribution of incubation periods – the time from exposure to illness – across the children in the class.</p><p>When plotted on a graph, the distribution of incubation periods is not the normal bell curve. Rather the curve looks lopsided, with a long tail on the right. Plotting the logarithms of the incubation periods, however, rather than the incubation periods themselves, does give a normal distribution. As such, statisticians refer to this kind of curve as a “lognormal distribution&quot;. Remarkably, many other, completely unrelated, diseases – like typhoid fever or bladder cancer – also have approximately lognormal distributions of incubation periods. This raised the question: why do such different diseases show such a similar curve?</p><p>Working with a simple mathematical model in which chance plays a key role, Ottino-Löffler et al. calculate how long it takes for a bacterial infection or cancer cell to take over a network of healthy cells. The model explains why a lognormal-like distribution of incubation periods, modeled as takeover times, is so ubiquitous. It emerges from the random dynamics of the incubation process itself, as the disease-causing microbe or mutant cancer cell competes with the cells of the host.</p><p>Intuitively, this new analysis builds on insights from the “coupon collector’s problem”: a classical problem in mathematics that describes the situation where a person collects items like baseball cards, stamps, or cartoon monsters in a videogame. If a random item arrives every day, and the collector’s luck is bad, they may have to wait a long time to collect those last few items. Similarly, in the model of Ottino-Löffler et al., the takeover time is dominated by dramatic slowdowns near the start or end of the infection process. These effects lead to an approximately lognormal distribution, with long waits, as seen in so many diseases.</p><p>Ottino-Löffler et al. do not anticipate that their findings will have direct benefits for medicine or public health. Instead, they believe their results could help to advance basic research in the fields of epidemiology, evolutionary biology and cancer research. The findings might also make an impact outside biology. The term “contagion” has now become a familiar metaphor for the spread of everything from computer viruses to bank failures. This model sheds light on how long it takes for a contagion to take over a network, for a variety of idealized networks and spreading processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mathematical model</kwd><kwd>infectious disease</kwd><kwd>incubation period</kwd><kwd>evolutionary graph theory</kwd><kwd>complex networks</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMS-1513179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strogatz</surname><given-names>Steven H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Loan Repayment Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Jacob G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship DGE-1650441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ottino-Loffler</surname><given-names>Bertrand</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CCF-1522054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strogatz</surname><given-names>Steven H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evolutionary graph theory solves the longstanding puzzle of why diverse infectious diseases and cancers show similar (approximately lognormal) distributions of their incubation periods.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The discovery that incubation periods tend to follow right-skewed distributions originally came from epidemiological investigations of incidents in which many people were simultaneously and inadvertently exposed to a pathogen. For example, at a church dinner in Hanford, California on March 17, 1914, ninety-three individuals became infected with typhoid fever after eating contaminated spaghetti prepared by an asymptomatic carrier known to posterity as Mrs. X. Using the known time of exposure and onset of symptoms for the 93 cases, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sawyer, 1914</xref> found that the incubation periods ranged from 3 to 29 days, with a mode of only 6 days and a distribution that was strongly skewed to the right. Similar results were later found for other infectious diseases. Surveying the literature in 1950, Sartwell noted a striking pattern: the incubation periods of diseases as diverse as streptococcal sore throat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sartwell, 1950</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), measles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stillerman and Thalhimer, 1944</xref>), polio, malaria, chicken pox, and the common cold were all, to a good approximation, lognormally distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sartwell, 1950</xref>). On a time scale of years instead of days, the incubation periods for bladder cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldblatt, 1949</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), skin cancer, radiation-induced leukemia, and other cancers were also found to be approximately lognormally distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armenian and Lilienfeld, 1974</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30212.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Frequency distributions of incubation periods for two diseases.</title><p>Data redrawn from historic examples.

Previous explanations rest on the presumed heterogeneity of the host, the pathogen, or the dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sartwell, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nishiura, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Horner and Samsa, 1992</xref>). To see how this works, return to the typhoid outbreak at the Hanford church dinner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sawyer, 1914</xref>). Every person who ate that spaghetti presumably had a different level of overall health and immune function, and every plate of spaghetti was likely contaminated with a different dose and possibly even strain of typhoid.</p><p>Suppose the typhoid bacteria proliferated exponentially fast within the hosts and triggered symptoms when they reached a fixed threshold. Then, if the bacterial dose, growth rate, or triggering threshold were normally distributed across the hosts, one can show that the resulting distribution of incubation periods would have been either exactly or approximately lognormal (see Results, ‘Influence of heterogeneity’). On the other hand, there is counter-evidence that lognormal distributions can occur even if some of these sources of heterogeneity are lacking. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sartwell, 1950</xref> reanalyzed data from a study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodian et al., 1949</xref>) in which identical doses and strains of polio virus were injected into the brains of hundreds of rhesus monkeys. The incubation period, defined as the time from inoculation to the onset of paralysis, was still found to be approximately lognormally distributed, even though the route of infection and the viral dose and strain were held constant. Moreover, the lognormal distributions commonly observed for human diseases have a particular shape, with a dispersion factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sartwell, 1950</xref>) around <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1.1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which previous models cannot explain without special parameter tuning. (See <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref> for the definition of dispersion factors.)</p><p>Here, we propose a new explanation for the skewed distribution of incubation periods. Instead of heterogeneity, it relies on the stochastic dynamics of the incubation process, as the pathogen invades, multiplies, and competes with itself and the cells of the host in a structured network topology. The theory predicts that under a broad range of circumstances, incubation periods should follow a right-skewed distribution that resembles a lognormal, but is actually a Gumbel, one of the universal extreme value distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kotz and Nadarajah, 2000</xref>). Heterogeneity is not required, but it is allowed; it does not qualitatively alter our results when included.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mathematical Model</title><p>We model the incubation process using the formalism of evolutionary graph theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lieberman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nowak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ohtsuki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashcroft et al., 2015</xref>).

The network could represent several plausible biological scenarios, for example the intestinal microbiome, where harmful typhoid bacteria are competing against a benign resident population of gut flora in a mixing system (modeled as a complete graph); or it could represent mutated leukemic stem-cells vying for space against healthy hematopoietic stem cells within the well-organized three-dimensional bone marrow space (modeled as a 3D lattice); or a flat epithelial sheet with an early squamous cancer compromising and invading nearby healthy cells (modeled as a 2D lattice). For the sake of generality, we will refer to the two types of agents as healthy residents and harmful invaders.</p><p>While Sartwell’s law has been applied to many different types of diseases with diverse etiologies, the model we propose makes the most sense for asexually reproducing invaders, like cancer cells or bacteria. Viruses, on the other hand, often reproduce with a ‘one-to-many’ dynamic, which is not faithfully captured in this model. So, while the general phenomenon of network invasion seems to apply to viruses as well, the model in its present form is not well suited to describe their dynamics.</p><boxed-text id="box1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30212.004</object-id><label>Box 1.</label><caption><p>Dispersion factors.</p></caption><p>The <bold>Dispersion Factor</bold> of a distribution or dataset is defined to be its geometric standard deviation.

The fitness of residents is normalized to 1. We consider two versions of the Moran process. In the Birth-death (Bd) version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), a random node is chosen, with probability proportional to its fitness. It gives birth to a single offspring. Then, one of its neighbors is chosen uniformly at random to die and is replaced by the offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We also consider Death-birth (Db) updates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). In this version of the model, a node is randomly selected for death, with probability proportional to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; then a copy of a uniformly random neighbor replaces it. To test the robustness of our results, we study both versions of the Moran model on various networks: complete graphs, star graphs, Erdős-Rényi random graphs, one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattices, and small-world, scale-free, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-regular networks. We also vary the invader fitness <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and the model criterion for the onset of symptoms. These extensions are presented in the Materials and methods, Figures 5, 6. <xref ref-type="box" rid="box2">Box 2</xref> discusses other variants of the Moran model.

The update rule is applied at discrete time steps. In the long run, either the invaders replace all the residents, or vice versa. If symptoms are triggered when the entire network has been taken over by invaders, then the incubation period is the number of time steps between the introduction of the invader and its fixation. On the other hand, if the invaders die out and the healthy cells take over, then the process is stopped and no observable symptoms manifest. Later, in the paper, we consider a generalization from complete to partial takeovers, but for now the incubation period will refer to a complete takeover.</p><p>Our notion of time in this model is linked directly to the biology of invasion of a reproducing asexual pathogen that divides and replaces other cells sequentially. Instead of considering divisions as a rate, and therefore linking the dynamics to real time, we consider time steps to be individual division events. This is more akin to the standard methods of modeling chemical interactions, as in the Gillespie algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gillespie, 1977</xref>). This focus on the biology of the individual pathogen (or cancer cell) also provides a simple explanation for how diseases with very different natural histories can have the same analytic distribution of incubation time. As each different disease would have a different characteristic mean doubling time, while the shape of the distributions might be the same, the physical time taken would scale with the characteristic proliferation time. Future iterations of this model could consider deriving an exact scaling between physical time and this biological event-based updating of time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Infinitely fit invaders</title><p>First, consider what happens if the invaders have infinite fitness (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) in the Birth-death model. While an exaggeration, this case is instructive and is a reasonable approximation for aggressive cancers and infections. In this limit, the dynamics simplify enormously: only the invaders reproduce. But because they give birth and replace their neighbors blindly, they waste time whenever they compete between themselves and one invader replaces another. These random self-replacements slow down the incubation process, and make it highly variable. In fact, the level of in-fighting is what determines the incubation period in this case. Beyond fitness, the topology of the network matters too. For low-dimensional networks, exemplified by a two-dimensional lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> , red circles), the growth rate of the invader population remains roughly constant as takeover occurs. This leads to a normal distribution of incubation periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, red circles; and see Methods and Materials, ‘Birth-death, other solvable networks’). However, on very high-dimensional networks like the complete graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, blue circles), the distribution becomes right skewed. Intuitively, this happens because every invader now has a chance of replacing any healthy node or any other invader. It is as if at every time step a candidate node for replacement gets blindly drawn from a bag, relabeled as an invader, and returned to the bag. At the start of the incubation process, almost every draw adds another invader to the population and the infection progresses rapidly. But near the end, it will take many, many draws to blindly fish out the last remaining healthy node, as needed to terminate the incubation period. This slowing-down phenomenon near the end should feel familiar to anyone who has tried to complete a collection of baseball cards, stamps, or coupons, since they are all manifestations of the coupon collector's problem, a well-studied concept in probability theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pósfai, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Feller, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Erdős and Rényi, 1961</xref>). Because of those frustratingly long waits to collect the final healthy node, the incubation period distribution gets skewed to the right. In the infinite-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> limit (see Methods and Materials, ‘Birth-death, complete graph’), the coupon collector’s process returns a Gumbel distribution, which resembles a lognormal and can be mistaken for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Read, 1998</xref>). Indeed, when a Gumbel and a lognormal are fit to the same real data, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it is hard to tell them apart. All this analysis can easily be repeated for the Death-birth model with minimal changes.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30212.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Network topology and invader fitness shape the distribution of incubation periods.</title><p>Plots show simulated distributions of incubation periods, defined here as invader fixation times.

Then a different stochastic mechanism skews the distribution of incubation periods to the right (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and Methods and Materials, ‘Random Walk Skewness’).

However, we only care about random walks that successfully hit <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, as these represent disease processes that manifest symptoms, so we must always condition on its success. This demands that the invader experience early success and growth, pushing it away from probable extinction. This conditioning introduces a bias that makes short incubation times probable, but long walks may still occasionally occur, driving the mean time above the median. In short, a conditioned random walk will introduce a right skew in the distribution of incubation periods. This effect holds for both high- and low-dimensional networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), and for Birth-death and Death-birth dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Testing robustness to update rule and truncation</title><p>Right-skewed distributions typically persist in the face of various perturbations to the model, but some perturbations can turn them into normal distributions.

While it is likely that tumor cells late in the disease process have much higher fitness than healthy cells secondary to continued selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Scott and Marusyk, 2017</xref>), there is ample evidence that most cancers have long latency periods, for example in genetic data from pancreatic cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yachida et al., 2010</xref>). One could speculate that during this early period, which accounts for the majority of the cancer’s time in the patient, the fitness is nearly neutral. For the cancer data reviewed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armenian and Lilienfeld, 1974</xref>), the observed distributions typically had dispersion factors around <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf108"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1.4</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.9</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. In our model, these high dispersion factors tend to arise when the invader is only slightly more fit than residents. This is also consistent with the suggestion of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Williams and Bjerknes, 1972</xref>); the shape of tumors in the model most closely resembled that of real tumors when the fitness of the invaders was only slightly above neutral.</p><p>In 1546, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fracastorii, 1930</xref> described the incubation of rabies after a bite from an rabid dog as ‘stealthy, slow, and gradual.’ Today, nearly five centuries later, the dynamics of incubation processes remain stealthy and slow to yield their secrets. We have tried to shed light on their patterns of variability with the help of a new conceptual tool, evolutionary graph theory. This approach provides a possible solution to the longstanding question of why so many disparate diseases show such similarly-shaped distributions of incubation periods. What remains is to quantify the dynamics of incubation processes experimentally with high-resolution measurements in time and space.</p><p>Aside from their possible application to incubation processes, our results also shed light on a broader theoretical question in evolutionary dynamics: when a mutant invades a structured population of residents, how does the distribution of mutant fixation times depend on the network structure of the population? Early work in evolutionary graph theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lieberman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nowak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ohtsuki et al., 2006</xref>) concentrated on the network’s impact on the probability of mutant fixation and the mean time to fixation. More recent studies have gone beyond the mean time to consider the full distribution of fixation times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashcroft et al., 2015</xref>), as we have also done here. We hope that our exact results for disparate topologies and dynamics will stimulate further investigations of these important questions in evolutionary biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Here we describe the model and our analytical and numerical results in further detail.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. One of the reviewers, Martin A Nowak, has agreed to share his name.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the reviewers found the calculations extremely interesting and considered the results to be novel and important. However, there was a shared concern that the connection of these results with the biological phenomenon of the incubation period was not on firm ground. In particular, the assumption that 100% – or close to 100% – of the host cells are infected when symptomatic infection starts was not well-motivated, and the biological plausibility of this assumption was unclear.</p><p>2) We would like to encourage the authors to reconsider the interpretation of their findings. Ideally they should provide a broader a list of biological phenomena (not only incubation periods) that could be described by their model.</p><p>3) If they want to strengthen their interpretation of incubation periods, a mechanistic description how the model describes specific diseases is needed along with a discussion of possible caveats.</p><p>4) It would also be of interest to discuss the question of time-varying N (either growing N, or declining N as a result of the pathogen killing host cells). However, following consultation, it was felt that anything more than discussion of this question is beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Strogatz et al. present a model for why the length of disease incubation periods tend to have a right-skewed probability distribution. The core idea is marvelously simple: even in the absence of complications such as host or pathogen heterogeneity, a simple stochastic model for within-host disease spread predicts a right-skewed distribution for the time between inoculation and the pathogen reaching a threshold value (corresponding to the threshold of immune activation that marks the end of the incubation period).

However, there was a shared concern that the connection of these results with the biological phenomenon of the incubation period was not on firm ground. In particular, the assumption that 100% – or close to 100% – of the host cells are infected when symptomatic infection starts was not well-motivated, and the biological plausibility of this assumption was unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have addressed this point in a new paragraph added to Results, called “Testing robustness to update rule and truncation.” The relevant sentences are: “For example, suppose we allow symptoms to occur when invaders take over only a fraction <italic>f</italic> of the whole network. This is a reasonable consideration as leukemic cells need not take over all the bone marrow before leukemia becomes evident, nor does typhoid need to overwhelm all the cells in the microbiome before causing fever; indeed it is likely far fewer in both cases.” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 (D, E, F</xref>) show that the right-skewed distribution persists for Death-birth dynamics, even if only 10% takeover triggers the appearance of symptoms. (Actually, the right-skewed distribution can be proven to persist for any fixed, nonzero fraction <italic>f</italic>. We cite the relevant math literature in the text.)</p><p>On the other hand, Birth-death dynamics are sensitive to the choice of <italic>f</italic>. They produce a distribution that switches from a Gumbel when <italic>f</italic> = 100% to a normal distribution for any <italic>f</italic> less than 100%.</p><p>We explain why the two cases differ in the caption to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. “The difference in sensitivity between the two types of dynamics can be explained intuitively by when coupon collection occurs. […] In contrast, coupon collection occurs near the <italic>end</italic> of the invasion for Birth-death dynamics (when residents are scarce), and hence gets truncated when <italic>f</italic> &lt; 1, giving rise to a normal instead of a right-skewed distribution.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) We would like to encourage the authors to reconsider the interpretation of their findings. Ideally they should provide a broader a list of biological phenomena (not only incubation periods) that could be described by their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this helpful suggestion. In response, we have added the following paragraph at the end of the Discussion: “Aside from their possible application to incubation processes, our results also shed light on a broader theoretical question in evolutionary dynamics: when a mutant invades a structured population of residents, how does the distribution of mutant fixation times depend on the network structure of the population? […] We hope that our exact results for disparate topologies and dynamics will stimulate further investigations of these important questions in evolutionary biology.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If they want to strengthen their interpretation of incubation periods, a mechanistic description how the model describes specific diseases is needed along with a discussion of possible caveats.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to connect the model more closely to specific diseases. In the section of the Results called “Mathematical model,” the relevant passage reads: “A network of <italic>N</italic> ≫ 1 nodes is used to represent an environment within a host where a pathogenic agent, such as a bacterium or cancer cell, is invading and reproducing. The network could represent several plausible biological scenarios, for example the intestinal microbiome, where harmful typhoid bacteria are competing against a benign resident population of gut flora in a mixing system (modeled as a complete graph); or it could represent mutated leukemic stem-cells vying for space against healthy hematopoietic stem cells within the well-organized three-dimensional bone marrow space (modeled as a 3D lattice); or a flat epithelial sheet with an early squamous cancer compromising and invading nearby healthy cells (modeled as a 2D lattice).”</p><p>Regarding possible caveats, we have clarified (in Results, “Mathematical model”) that the model probably does not apply to viruses:</p><p>“While Sartwell’s law has been applied to diseases as varied as measles and leukemia, the model we propose makes the most sense for asexually reproducing invaders, like cancer cells or bacteria. […] So, while the general phenomenon of network invasion seems to apply to viruses as well, this model is not well suited to describe their dynamics.”</p><p>We also draw a closer connection to cancer dynamics in the Discussion: “On the other hand, it is tempting to speculate that this regime of nearly neutral fitness may be more relevant to cancer development. […] This is also consistent with the suggestion of (Williams and Bjerknes, 1972); the shape of tumors in the model most closely resembled that of real tumors when the fitness of the invaders was only slightly above to neutral.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would also be of interest to discuss the question of time-varying N (either growing N, or declining N as a result of the pathogen killing host cells). However, following consultation, it was felt that anything more than discussion of this question is beyond the scope of the current work.</p></disp-quote><p>We are also interested in the effect of time-varying N, but also agree that a full investigation is outside of the scope of this paper. To give a preliminary sense of what might occur, we have added a new section in the Materials and methods, “Influence of non-static population,” as well as an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These show the results of an initial exploration of the effects of a non-static population on the complete graph. We specifically examine cases where the resident population has a chance at growing at every time step, shrinking at every time step, and randomly growing or shrinking at each time step.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] My primary concerns surround the relatively limited connection back to the biology.
