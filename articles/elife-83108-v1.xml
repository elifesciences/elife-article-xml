Recent studies in zebrafish larvae and lampreys have shown that CSF-cNs control postures and movements via spinal connections. However, the structures, connectivity, and functions in mammals remain largely unknown. Here we developed a method to genetically target mouse CSF-cNs that highlighted structural connections and functions. We first found that intracerebroventricular injection of adeno-associated virus with a neuron-specific promoter and <italic>Pkd2l1-Cre</italic> mice specifically labeled CSF-cNs. Single-cell labeling of 71 CSF-cNs revealed rostral axon extensions of over 1800 Î¼m in unmyelinated bundles in the ventral funiculus and terminated on CSF-cNs to form a recurrent circuitry, which was further determined by serial electron microscopy and electrophysiology. CSF-cNs were also found to connect with axial motor neurons and premotor interneurons around the central canal and within the axon bundles. Chemogenetic CSF-cNs inactivation reduced speed and step frequency during treadmill locomotion. Our data revealed the basic structures and connections of mouse CSF-cNs to control spinal motor circuits for proper locomotion. The versatile methods developed in this study will contribute to further understanding of CSF-cN functions in mammals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neuron</kwd><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AMED-CREST</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP21gm1210005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueno</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Moonshot research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J21zf0127004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueno</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H04985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueno</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H05556</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueno</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K19443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueno</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K21460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueno</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21H02590</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueno</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21H05683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueno</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueno</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JSPS KAKENHI, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas -

They have bulbous dendritic structures containing motile cilium and microvilli that extend apically into the CSF. The broad conservation of CSF-cNs in over 200 vertebrate species implicates their fundamental physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agduhr, 1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agduhr, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kolmer, 1921</xref>). Although the unique structure of CSF-cNs suggests that they are sensory or neurosecretory cells that interact with CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">VÃ­gh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vigh and Vigh-Teichmann, 1998</xref>), their specific functions have long remained undetermined.</p><p>CSF-cNs have been shown to comprise chemo- and mechanosensory properties that enable the detection of physiological changes in the CSF. The polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1 channel (PKD2L1), a member of the polycystin subgroup of transient receptor potential channels, was originally found to be expressed in the CSF-cNs of mice, and thereafter in other species including zebrafish, rabbits, and macaque monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Djenoune et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tonelli GombalovÃ¡ et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2006</xref>). PKD2L1 is a chemo- or mechanosensitive nonselective cation channel that can sense extracellular pH, osmolarity, and mechanical flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delmas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orts-Delâimmagine et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, CSF-cNs physiologically respond to alkalinization and acidification in rodents and lampreys, in which acid-sensing ion channel ASICs also contribute to lowered pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jalalvand et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marichal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orts-DelâImmagine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orts-Delâimmagine et al., 2012</xref>). CSF-cNs also respond to osmolarity and ATP in rodents and fluid movements in lampreys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jalalvand et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marichal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orts-Delâimmagine et al., 2012</xref>). These reports indicate that CSF-cNs are chemo- and mechanosensory cells that detect components in the CSF. CSF-cNs have also been reported to be GABAergic interneurons that express glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Djenoune et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stoeckel et al., 2003</xref>). These suggest that componential information of CSF is transferred as inhibitory GABAergic signals onto local circuits.</p><p>A series of recent elegant studies in zebrafish larvae have further revealed the connectivity and functions of CSF-cNs. They showed that CSF-cNs are mechanosensory neurons that detect intraspinal mechanical signals to control body posture and locomotion in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">BÃ¶hm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubbard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wyart et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, CSF-cNs detect spinal bending through PKD2L1 and control tail beating locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">BÃ¶hm et al., 2016</xref>). They send GABAergic inhibitory signals onto glutamatergic V0-v (premotor descending), commissural primary ascending (CoPA) interneurons, and caudal primary (CaP) axial motor neurons (MNs) in local motor circuits to modulate locomotion and control balance during slow and fast swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fidelin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubbard et al., 2016</xref>). CSF-cNs further contribute to the maintenance of spine curvature by sensing contacts with the Reissner fiber in the central canal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cantaut-Belarif et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orts-DelâImmagine et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sternberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Troutwine et al., 2020</xref>). These reports indicate that CSF-cNs are intraspinal mechanosensory neurons that control body axis and locomotion. These properties are partially observed in lampreys, in which CSF-cNs respond to spinal bending and pH alteration, leading to a decrease in locomotor burst in an isolated spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jalalvand et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jalalvand et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the physiological functions and underlying circuitry of CSF-cNs in mammals have been largely undetermined. Although mice are suitable to study connectivity and functions of specific neurons, methods for targeting CSF-cNs are still immature, presumably because their longitudinal and intraspinal location along the central canal make it challenging to access CSF-cNs. The discovery of PKD2L1 expressions in CSF-cNs has allowed to exploit the use of <italic>Pkd2l1-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Djenoune et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">JurÄiÄ et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orts-DelâImmagine et al., 2014</xref>). Fluorescent labeling combined with reporter mice has proved to be a practical method to analyze their morphology and electrophysiological properties, showing that labeled PKD2L1<sup>+</sup> cells have ventral and rostrocaudal axon extensions, respond to pH and osmotic changes, and receive GABA/glycine and glutamatergic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jurcic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">JurÄiÄ et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orts-DelâImmagine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orts-Delâimmagine et al., 2012</xref>). However, a relatively lower specificity due to ectopic Cre expression in the medullar and spinal parenchyma, as well as extra-brain regions (e.g. the taste buds), makes them insufficient for specific targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orts-Delâimmagine et al., 2012</xref>). The limited specificity, flexibility, and accessibility of current methods in mice are a barrier to investigate their structure, network, and function. Although a very recent study used <italic>Pkd2l1<sup>IRES</sup></italic><sup>-<italic>Cre</italic></sup> and reporter mice to show local connections of CSF-cNs with spinal neurons and their contribution to skilled locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerstmann et al., 2022</xref>), alternative specific and flexible methods for manipulating CSF-cNs are required to determine precise features of structure, connectivity, and functions.</p><p>In this study, we serendipitously discovered a method to target mouse CSF-cNs via intracerebroventricular injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) with a neuron-specific promoter, which enabled us to introduce any genes into the CSF-cNs. We developed versatile methods to label and manipulate CSF-cNs, and these facilitated to elucidate the precise and detailed structure, connectivity, and function of mouse CSF-cNs in the spinal motor circuitry that are involved in locomotor control. The methodological tools and approach described herein will provide further insight to understand the enigmatic functions of CSF-cNs in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intracerebroventricular AAV injection specifically labels CSF-CNs</title><p>In the course of our previous studies to label projections of the corticospinal tract that extend from the cerebral cortex to spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ueno et al., 2018</xref>), we serendipitously found that injection of a fluorescent protein-expressing AAV into the sensorimotor cortex occasionally labeled cells around the central canal of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We presumed that AAV particles may have leaked into the lateral ventricle, which is located just beneath the cortex and passed through the CSF to label the cells in the spinal cord. To examine this possibility, we directly injected AAV that expressed mCherry under the human synapsin I promoter (AAV-syn-mCherry, serotype 1/2) into the lateral ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that a direct intracerebroventricular injection efficiently labeled the cells surrounding the central canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The cells were mostly located at the ventral position of the central canal underlying the ependymal cells and had dendrite-like structures extending directly into the central canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Their location and structure likely corresponded to those of CSF-cNs, which are present in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Djenoune et al., 2014</xref>).

Most of the cells had a single elongated axon that first projects ventrally and then rostrally in the ventral funiculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2EâG</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). All of them projected to specific side of the ventral funiculus without bilateral projections (left side, 46.5%; right side, 53.5%), although it was unclear if they extended to ipsi- or contralateral side because their soma were located at the ventral midline along the central canal (67/71 cells). The remaining four dorsolateral cells projected axons ipsilaterally. A small proportion of the cells at the cervical and sacral levels also exhibited caudal projections in the ventral funiculus (4.2% in total) or bidirectional projections at the cervical level (1.2%; two cells at C2 and C4/5, respectively, with three and one cells located ventral and lateral to the central canal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>).

They often formed parallel collaterals that extended rostrally in the ventral funiculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), wherein none of them crossed the midline.

In accordance, EGFP<sup>+</sup> MN somas of axial muscles (neck and back) were mostly located ventromedially (24/29 cells for the neck and 26/26 cells for the back muscle), and dendritic fibers elongated to the area around the central canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D, E</xref>). In contrast, MNs of distal muscles (biceps and foot) were in lateral positions (29/33 cells for the biceps and 25/25 cells for the foot muscle) with dendrites extending dorsoventrally, which were located far from the central canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Some of the axial MN dendrites extended to mCherry<sup>+</sup> CSF-cNs and their presumptive ascending axons at the midline and were closely contacted with presynaptic GAD65<sup>+</sup> or postsynaptic gephyrin<sup>+</sup> puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M and N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1F, G</xref>). We further found that GFP<sup>+</sup> dendrites occasionally extended and contacted in close to or within mCherry<sup>+</sup> ventral fiber bundles of CSF-cNs, with GAD65<sup>+</sup> or gephyrin<sup>+</sup> puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1H, I</xref>). These GFP<sup>+</sup> MN neurites had scarce presynaptic signals of VAChT and Vglut2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishimaru et al., 2005</xref>), although a weak VAChT staining was occasionally observed in large terminals near the central canal (data not shown). Furthermore, an axon initial segment marker ankyrin-G was only detected in laterally directed GFP<sup>+</sup> fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1J</xref>). These suggest that the MN neurites extending medially to the central canal are dendrites and receive inhibitory CSF-cN inputs.</p><p>We further examined anatomical connections with Chx10<sup>+</sup> V2a premotor interneurons, which engage in locomotion and skilled motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ueno et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Chx10<sup>Cre</sup></italic>;CAG-lcl-EGFP mice, we observed that <italic>Chx10</italic>-EGFP<sup>+</sup> neurites also ran along or across the mCherry<sup>+</sup> fiber bundles in the ventral funiculus and were occasionally contacted with GAD65<sup>+</sup> puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P-S</xref>).</p><p>We reanalyzed the SBF-SEM data of the ventral bundle, and found that some of the presynaptic CSF-cN terminals containing COX4-dAPEX2<sup>+</sup> mitochondria contacted COX4-dAPEX2<sup>â</sup> neurites emerging from the outside of the bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6T</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1K</xref>). TEM analyses further identified synaptic structures in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6U</xref>). We also frequently found rosette-like structures in which a COX4-dAPEX2<sup>â</sup> neurite was surrounded by multiple bouton-like presynaptic terminals containing COX4-dAPEX2<sup>+</sup> mitochondria along the rostrocaudal axis; this observation was also confirmed in TEM analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6V</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1M</xref>). These boutons contained abundant synaptic vesicles, as well as larger vesicles approximately ~100 nm in size. These types of connection were also found in the subependymal bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6W</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1L</xref>). COX4-dAPEX2<sup>+</sup> pre-synapses also contacted COX4-dAPEX2<sup>â</sup> neurites in the area outside the bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1N</xref>). Although their cell identity could not be determined, the observed COX4-dAPEX2<sup>â</sup> postsynaptic neurites may correspond to the dendrites of Chat<sup>+</sup> or Chx10<sup>+</sup> neurons. Although axo-axonic connections were identified in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2021</xref>), we could not find axonal morphology in COX4-dAPEX2<sup>â</sup> neurite, at least in our small serial samples. The recent study suggesting anatomical connections with medial motor column (MMC) MNs and spinal interneurons further supports our observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerstmann et al., 2022</xref>). Taken together, the data show that CSF-cNs have anatomical connections with motor-related neurons in the spinal cord.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Inactivation of CSF-cNs induced deficits in treadmill locomotion</title><p>Finally, we explored the role of CSF-cNs in motor control.

We intracerebroventricularly injected AAV-Syn-DIO-hM4Di into <italic>Pkd2l1-Cre</italic> mice, and the mice were then subjected to run on a treadmill before and after treatment with the ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The treadmill speed was programmed to increase from 5.0 to 35 m/min (8.33â58.33 cm/s), and it was found that the maximum speed to run was significantly decreased in CNO-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). We next performed kinematic analyses at a speed of 14 m/min (23.3 cm/s). Overall, the locomotion was not abolished in the CNO-treated mice, in which left-right coordination was not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, we found that step frequencies (Hz) were significantly decreased by CNO treatment, and concomitantly, stride lengths were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7DâF</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). These changes were not observed in control wild-type (WT) mice treated with AAV and CNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7GâK</xref>).

Although the wide distribution of CSF-cNs in the spinal cord has implied that they have important physiological roles in mammals, their connections and functions have remained poorly understood. Our developed methods proved to be effective to analyze CSF-cN structure and function, and we uncovered typical caudo-rostral projections and functional connections in the spinal circuitry that are involved in locomotor control.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Specific methods to label and manipulate CSF-cNs</title><p>Although intracerebroventricular AAV injections have been widely used, especially for gene delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dirren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galvan et al., 2021</xref>), no studies have investigated their applicability for CSF-cN labeling. Some previous studies have reported the intracerebroventricular or spinal injection of traditional neural tracers for the purpose of labeling ventricular cells, including CSF-cNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jalalvand et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Song et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Song and Zhang, 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, the AAV-mediated method can express any genes of interest primarily into CSF-cNs; this increases specificity, depth, and diversity of the analyses. Since we noticed that AAV8 was not efficient in labeling CSF-cNs (data not shown) and some other serotypes spread throughout the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galvan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mathiesen et al., 2020</xref>), an appropriate serotype as well as a specific promoter would be essential to successfully target CSF-cNs. Although a few unrelated spinal neurons and fibers were occasionally labeled, possibly due to a leak or transsynaptic transfer of AAV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>), the combination of <italic>Pkd2l1-Cre</italic> was able to further restrict labeling in PKD2L1<sup>+</sup> neurons that contacted the CSF. This approach excluded other ventricular cells, as well as ectopic PKD2L1<sup>+</sup> cells located in the ventromedial spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tonelli GombalovÃ¡ et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">JurÄiÄ et al., 2021</xref>) and <italic>Pkd2l1</italic><sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes in the gray matter.

Thus, the present viral tracing method can provide higher specificity, resolution, and flexibility to introduce (or reduce) specific genes or genetic tools, which will further contribute to studies of CSF-cNs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Structures of CSF-cNs revealed by viral tracing</title><p>Our methodological approach was able to demonstrate, for the first time, the origin and unique structure of mouse CSF-cNs fibers, which projected ventro-rostrally and back to the central canal. Although each CSF-cN projection showed some variance, the following common features were observed: (1) a thin fiber derived from the soma extends ventrally, where bouton structures are scarce; (2) multiple short neurites also extend locally; (3) ventral axons extend rostrally in the ventral funiculus with multiple boutons; (4) ventral axons form several collaterals dorsally, which project back to the central canal; and (5) the branches extended rostrocaudally after reaching the central canal, which also has multiple boutons.</p><p>It has been reported that CSF-cNs have ipsilateral ascending tracts in two to six segments in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Djenoune et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fidelin et al., 2015</xref>) and in frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dale et al., 1987</xref>), suggesting conserved projection features among species. The rostral extensions of over 1800â4800 Î¼m observed in our study would correspond to at least over one to four spinal segments in mice. The axons did not show clear commissural innervation until they extended to the ventral funiculus; however, dorsal collaterals often exhibited bilateral innervation around the central canal. The possibly conserved ipsilateral projections should be further examined regarding functional connections on either side, along with those of dorsolateral CSF-cNs, which were not effectively analyzed in the present study. In mammals, the origins of ventral axon bundles were suggested by the expression of P2X2 and PSA-NCAM, particularly in the caudal to lower thoracic cord in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stoeckel et al., 2003</xref>). Recent analyses of <italic>Pkd2l1-Cre</italic> and reporter mice have also suggested the presence of rostrocaudally or caudorostrally running bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">JurÄiÄ et al., 2021</xref>). Our present data revealed the origin and predominant rostral direction of ventral axons at a single-cell and ultrastructural levels. Although P2X2<sup>+</sup> fibers have been reported along the central canal of the thoracic cord in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stoeckel et al., 2003</xref>), we demonstrated for the first time that the subependymal bundles also originate from CSF-cNs and exist at the cervical level.</p><p>Our method also enabled to visualize the apical side, in which dendritic bulbs extended to the CSF and occasionally contained cilia-like protrusions. Previous slice experiments have suggested that the bulb and cilia can detect mechano- or chemosensory information (e.g. pH) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orts-DelâImmagine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orts-Delâimmagine et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the cilia of CSF-cNs are required to detect spinal bending and maintenance of spinal curvature in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orts-DelâImmagine et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sternberg et al., 2018</xref>) and for proper skilled movements in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerstmann et al., 2022</xref>), thus supporting the critical role of these neurons in the mechanosensory system. Electron microscopic analyses have further revealed that close vicinity of the bulb to the Reissner fiber enables the detection of spinal curvature and maintenance of a straight body axis in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cantaut-Belarif et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orts-DelâImmagine et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Troutwine et al., 2020</xref>).

In this study, we found that CSF-cNs send collaterals around the central canal and are connected to other rostral CSF-cNs. While previous electrophysiological studies reported that CSF-cNs received GABAergic synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jurcic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marichal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orts-DelâImmagine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orts-Delâimmagine et al., 2012</xref>), the presynaptic partners remained undetermined. We showed direct evidences of rostrocaudal recurrent circuitry by using a single-cell tracing, serial electron microscopic analyses, and electrophysiological recording. These indicate that caudal CSF-cNs are the primary sources of GABAergic inputs. This is supported by previous electron microscopic observations of P2X2 <italic><sup>+</sup></italic> presynaptic terminals, which were present around the central canal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stoeckel et al., 2003</xref>). Recent rabies virus-based monosynaptic retrograde tracing further supports our observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerstmann et al., 2022</xref>). Mutual connections have been also suggested to be present in carps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vigh et al., 1974</xref>), implicating a conserved connectivity among species. Other undetermined sources of glutamatergic, cholinergic, and monoaminergic inputs were also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jurcic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orts-DelâImmagine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orts-DelâImmagine et al., 2016</xref>), and these may also control CSF-cN functions.</p><p>Connectivity of CSF-cNs has recently been determined in zebrafish larvae. CSF-cNs are connected with CaP primary MNs that innervate axial musculature and are required for fast locomotion and postural control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubbard et al., 2016</xref>). This is likely partially conserved in mice, based on our anatomical data showing the connections with axial muscle MNs. Zebrafish CSF-cNs are additionally connected to V0-v premotor interneurons, which are involved in slow locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fidelin et al., 2015</xref>), and CoPA interneurons involved in sensory-motor gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubbard et al., 2016</xref>). Although we did not assess relevant subtypes, Chat<sup>+</sup> and V2a interneurons were found to be anatomically connected with CSF-cN axons. These neurons are known to be recruited in locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tillakaratne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>). Recent electrophysiological analyses have shown a functional connection with presumptive V0c neurons, and anatomical analyses further demonstrated presynaptic contacts onto the soma of Lhx1<sup>+</sup> (V0/dI4) and Chx10<sup>+</sup> V2a interneurons as well as MMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerstmann et al., 2022</xref>). Although they showed some different subcellular patterns of contacts from our observations in which the contacts were mainly seen on cell bodies rather than neurites, this discrepancy may be attributed to the use of different labeling methods. Our methods provide high specificity and resolution to additionally determine the anatomical patterns of connectivity with spinal interneurons, which especially showed a unique distribution of contacts with distal dendrites around the central canal as well as within the unmyelinated axon bundles, forming multiple synaptic clusters in a rosette-like structure.</p><p>Our anatomical data suggest that CSF-cNs may be involved in a motor module that controls axial muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). V2 neurons have presynaptic inputs onto dendrites of axial muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goetz et al., 2015</xref>), and the medial population of V2a neurons is presumed to be premotor neurons for axial muscle MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>). As for cholinergic neurons, lamina X contains several types of cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barber et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>). V0c neurons connect to MNs including axial muscles with C boutons and modulate locomotor activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barber et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goetz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>). Chat<sup>+</sup> central canal cluster cells also respond to locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barber et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tillakaratne et al., 2014</xref>). These neurons may form a motor module in the ventromedial gray matter and be controlled by inhibitory inputs from CSF-cNs. Since electrophysiological recording could not be applied in the present study, functional connections between CSF-cNs and axial MNs, Chat<sup>+</sup> and V2a interneurons are still hypothetical. Further studies are required to determine the patterns of connections.</p><p>We also found strong expressions of inhibitory synaptic proteins in the axon bundles, consistent with synaptic marker expressions in ventral fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stoeckel et al., 2003</xref>). Our serial electron microscopic analyses additionally revealed that synaptic structures are actually present in the bundle. In particular, the unmyelinated axons often exhibited a typical multiple bouton structures that surrounded and contacted other running dendrites. Although the functions of unmyelinated fiber bundles and their internal synaptic structures are not yet understood, strong inhibitory transmission in this region may have an essential role in spinal function. Axo-axonic connections, which could not be clearly identified in the present study, should also be explored in future studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Since this region occasionally contains larger vesicles (~100 nm) that are positioned far from the synaptic cleft, volume transmission may also occur here. In addition, structural differences were found among the bundles at cervical to sacral levels. For example, caudal CSF-cNs had more rostrally branched and longer axons in the ventral bundle that were closely aligned to the median fissure, whereas rostral CSF-cNs comprised relatively shorter rostral projections in multiple distributed bundles and more dorsally branched collaterals. These features may have functional implications that should be explored more. It is also unclear whether CSF-cN outputs are biased on specific spinal levels, such as those of central pattern generators (CPGs) for locomotion located at C5âT1 and T12âL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gordon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kjaerulff and Kiehn, 1996</xref>), or evenly distributed throughout the spinal cord. Dorsal collateral density was higher at the cervical level but lower in the lumbar cord, suggesting that dorsal innervations might not correlate with the CPG locations. Additionally, CSF-cNs had other connections within the ventral bundles possibly throughout the spinal cord, suggesting their influence on the circuitry such as for axial muscles at various spinal levels. Notably, ablation of rostral and caudal CSF-cNs in zebrafish larvae exhibited different deficits in movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Further research is required to understand the difference or similarity between functions at different spinal levels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sensorimotor functions of CSF-cNs in locomotion</title><p>Our results indicate that CSF-cNs are required for smooth locomotion on the treadmill. Notably, CSF-cNs inactivation decreased maximum speed and step frequency, accompanied by an increase of stride lengths. This effect may be related to observations reported in zebrafish larvae, in which silencing of CSF-cNs induced a decrease in tail-beating frequency, as well as postural defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">BÃ¶hm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubbard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Some previous studies predicted a lower contribution of mouse CSF-cNs to general movements, since a decrease in the number of CSF-cNs in adult or in C57Bl/6 N mice did not apparently change motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tonelli GombalovÃ¡ et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Orts-DelâImmagine et al., 2017</xref>). A recent study that deleted <italic>Pkd2l1</italic>-Cre<sup>+</sup> cells with diphtheria toxin, however, reported deficits in skilled movements on a narrow beam and horizontal ladder with wide rungs that were partially replicated in our experiments, although no impairments were observed in walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerstmann et al., 2022</xref>). Our detailed kinematic analyses combined with specific targeting of CSF-cNs additionally revealed that acute inactivation of CSF-cNs disturbed smooth locomotion on the treadmill to maintain step frequency at a high speed. Nevertheless, the functional effect seemed to be relatively weaker compared to the phenotypes reported in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">BÃ¶hm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fidelin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubbard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2021</xref>), as we could not see clear defects in rostrocaudal coordination or postural control. It is possible that alternate circuits for limb control or other mechanosensory systems (e.g. muscle spindles and Golgi tendons that are especially developed in mammals) predominantly work or compensate to maintain locomotion in quadrupedal species. Thus, although it is phylogenetically conceivable that CSF-cNs are involved in a motor module for posture control, it remains unclear if they are fully functional or rudimentary in mice.</p><p>A model illustrating CSF-cN circuits for locomotion is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>. CSF-cNs may interoceptively detect spinal bending to control axial movements. CSF-cNs may subsequently convey inhibitory signals onto a rostral motor module comprising axial MN, Chat<sup>+</sup>, and V2a premotor neurons and also inhibit rostral CSF-cNs that sequentially release inhibitions onto a more rostral motor module. Longitudinal transmissions of inhibitory signals are shown to be essential to evoke appropriate locomotor coordination or frequency in several contexts. For example, V1 inhibitory neurons that contain both ascending and descending projections are important to control locomotion speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gosgnach et al., 2006</xref>). V2b inhibitory neurons that predominantly comprise descending projections are required for rostrocaudal flexor-extensor coordination, which is cooperated with V1 inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). CSF-cNs may share some properties with V2b inhibitory neurons, since they both originate from the p2 domain, as well as p3 and pMN for other types of CSF-cNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Petracca et al., 2016</xref>). The inhibitory signals may further influence the activities of excitatory V2a interneurons, which have a role in rhythm generation, primarily at faster locomotor speeds in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crone et al., 2009</xref>). Zebrafish also have similar ascending and descending inhibitory V1 and V2b circuitry that inhibit MNs and V2a neurons to control swimming speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callahan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kimura and Higashijima, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sengupta et al., 2021</xref>). These rostrocaudal inhibitory transmissions may control sequential axial MNs and muscle activities, which are coupled to limb movements and are essential for mobilization and stabilization during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hinckley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schilling and Carrier, 2010</xref>). Further electrophysiological and electromyographic analyses are required to test the involvement of CSF-cNs in the motor circuitry of axial muscles in mice.</p><p>Although CSF-cNs respond to spinal bending in zebrafish, the present study did not examine what CSF-cNs specifically detect to control locomotion. Although mechanosensory signals would be generated during treadmill locomotion or ladder walking, these should be further investigated in future studies. Other chemosensory signals, such as pH changes or compounds proposed to be generated in respiratory changes, excess neural activities, fatigue, autonomic, or immune responses, may also be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jalalvand et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prendergast et al., 2019</xref>).

At least two CSF-cN subpopulations, referred to as CSF-cNâ² (dorsolateral) and CSF-cNâ²â² (ventral), have been reported in zebrafish and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Bella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Petracca et al., 2016</xref>). These two subpopulations exhibit a different connectivity and functions in zebrafish. Ventral CSF-cNs respond to longitudinal contractions, connect to CaP MNs, and are involved in fast swimming, while dorsal CSF-cNs respond to ipsilateral lateral bending, connect to putative V0-v, and are involved in slow swimming circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">BÃ¶hm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Djenoune et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubbard et al., 2016</xref>). Studies in lampreys have also shown that lateral and ventral CSF-cNs have different mechano- and chemosensory properties, as well as the presence of motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jalalvand et al., 2022</xref>).

In this context, the features of the minor bidirectionally or caudally projecting CSF-cNs also remain unknown.</p><p>In conclusion, we found a specific method to label and manipulate mouse CSF-cNs and revealed their structures, connectivity, and involvement in locomotion function, which have long been remained poorly understood in mammals. The method developed here will pave the way for a more detailed exploration of the features of mouse CSF-cNs, ranging from connectivity to physiological and molecular functions and will provide further insight into the architecture of spinal circuits that control sensorimotor or other homeostatic functions in mammals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The following mice were used in this study: male C57BL/6 J mice (Jackson laboratory), <italic>Pkd2l1-Cre</italic> (a bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse line; a gift from C.

The stimuli (duration, 10 ms; frequency, 0.3 Hz; repetition, 10 times; light intensity, ~5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) were controlled with an STO mk II stimulator (BRC). GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-evoked IPSCs were isolated by bath perfusion of 20 ÂµM Bicuculline (Sigma).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Treadmill locomotor test and DREADD experiments</title><p><italic>Pkd2l1-Cre</italic> or WT mice were randomly selected and injected with AAV-Syn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry intracerebroventricularly at P28 and were then trained to run on the treadmill (Melquest) twice at week 3 after AAV injection. After 4 wk, mice were subjected to run on the treadmill at the speeds programmed to increase from 5.0 to 35 m/min (8.33â58.33 cm/s) in 1 min. The maximum speed at which the mice could keep running on the treadmill was recorded blindly (n=7 for <italic>Pkd2l1-Cre</italic>; n=7 for WT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ueno and Yamashita, 2011</xref>). The following criteria were used for the endpoints of running: (1) the hip touched on the back curtain for more than 3 s; (2) a caudal half of the body was kept under the curtain for more than 3 s; or (3) more than half of the body was under the curtain. The tests were performed three times pre- and 30 min post-injection of CNO (5.0 mg/kg body weight, i.p.; Sigma), and the average speed was calculated. Runs at 14 m/min (23.3 cm/s) were further recorded with high-speed video cameras (198 f/s) set on the left and back of the treadmill and MotionRecorder software of the Kinematracer system (Kissei comtec; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ueno et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ueno and Yamashita, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) (n=7 for <italic>Pkd2l1-Cre</italic>; n=7 for WT). The movies were then transported to DeepLabCut, a markerless pose estimation system based on transfer learning with a deep neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>), to track the movement of the fore- and hind-paws. The positions of fore- and hind-paws in 280 training frames of the representative mouse locomotion movie were manually labeled, and then the deep neural network was trained with the datasets for 1,030,000 iterations with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER Graphics Card. The fore- and hind-paws in the movies were then tracked, and the obtained x-y coordinates were transported to 3DCalculator software of Kinematracer system, which was modified to integrate CSV files generated in DeepLabCut. Stride and step lengths of the left fore- and hindlimbs (total 28â65 steps in two 11 s movies per mouse), step frequency (Hz), and phase values (Ï) were then assessed in the KineAnalyzer software. Step frequency (Hz) was determined by the duration of step cycle, which corresponds to the phase between two successive foot contacts of the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leblond et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lemieux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ueno and Yamashita, 2011</xref>). A phase value (Ï) corresponded to the time point of left fore- or hind-paw contacts relative to the right fore- or hindlimb step cycle. A phase value of 0 or 1 indicates an in-phase coupling (synchrony), while 0.5 reflects an anti-phase coupling (alternation).

This study revealed CSF-cNs structures, connectivity and involvement in locomotor function. By combining viral tracing, anatomical reconstruction, electronic microscopy, otpogenetic stimulation and in vivo analysis of locomotion the authors describe CSF-cNs rostral axon extension over a large distance (2000-4000Âµm), demonstrate their recurrent interconnection and their connection with different neuronal elements of the spinal locomotor circuits. The present study is an excellent complement to a previous study published recently (Gerstmann et al., 2022). Experiments are well performed, figures and findings are of very high quality and the data are strongly supporting the conclusions.

Did the authors observe any specificity in the CSF-cN anatomy in cervical or lumbar spinal cord?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for critical and important comments on the anatomical analyses. It remains unclear whether CSF-cNs outputs are biased to specific spinal levels containing locomotor CPG. The density of dorsally innervating collaterals was higher at the cervical levels and gradually decreased to the caudal spinal cord (Figure 1âsupplement 1IâL, Figure 2I, Figure 2âsupplement 1). This suggests that the dorsal innervations might not correlate with the spinal levels of CPGs located at C5âT1 and T12âL5 (Kjaerulff et al., 1996; Gordon et al., 2008 etc.). We also note that CSF-cNs had connections within the ventral bundles that existed throughout the spinal levels. This further suggests that CSF-cNs may not function specifically in CPG regions. As CSF-cNs were present throughout the spinal cord, we assume that they influence the circuitry such as for axial muscles at various spinal levels. However, more sophisticated investigations are required to understand the differences or similarity of the functions among spinal levels. We added these points in Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. A minor proportion of labeled CSF-cNs project bidirectionally (rostrally and caudally). Please specify where the somata of these cells reside. How does this observation fit with the general scheme proposed in Figure 7?</p></disp-quote><p>The bidirectionally-projecting CSF-cNs were located only at the cervical level C2 (two cells) and C4/5 (two cells), in which at the ventral (three cells) and lateral (one cell) side of the central canal, in our preparation. We do not know if they are classified as minor subtype or mis-projection CSF-cNs. They were rarely observed only at the cervical level (four cells in total 332), and thus it was difficult to fit and integrate them in the model of Figure 7-supplement 1, at present. It requires further studies to examine their features. We added these points in Results, Discussion, and Figure legends of Figure 7-supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. A poor terminal arborization is described for CSF-cNs with a cell body located at the lumbar level. Is this real or is it due to the difficulty of reconstructing a neuron over such a long distance? If this is real, could this morphology be linked to any different role played by these cells located in the lumbar spinal cord?</p></disp-quote><p>We showed the data of traced CSF-cNs; some axons clearly ended in the ventral funiculus and did not have many dorsal collaterals especially at the lumbar and sacral levels.Â This is also suggested by the observation of cleared spinal cord, exhibiting less amount of GFP<sup>+</sup> fiber bundles at the ventral midline especially at the lumbar and sacral level (Figure 1âsupplement 1IâL), although we could not clearly discriminate dorsal collaterals from ventrally-projecting axons there.</p><p>Despite the less dorsal collaterals, we observed synaptic structures within the ventral funiculus, in which neurites received multiple inputs from CSF-cNs with a typical rosette-like structure. Thus, CSF-cNs outputs would also function in the caudal spinal cord. The structural difference may suggest functional difference among the spinal levels, but unfortunately we do not have clear answers to explain it at present. We state this issue in Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Is there any evidence for commissural connections between CSF-cNs in mice ?</p></disp-quote><p>We additionally analyzed the projection side of single-cell traced CSF-cNs in three structural parts; (1) ventral projections to the ventral funiculus, (2) rostral projections in the ventral funiculus, and (3) dorsal projections to the central canal.</p><p>As for the (1) ventral projections, since most of the labeled CSF-cNs soma were located at the ventral midline along the central canal (67/71 cells), it was difficult to strictly determine if they projected to ipsi- or contralateral side. However, all the axons projected to specific side without bilateral projections (left side, 46.5%; right side, 53.5%). The remaining four dorsolateral cells projected axons ipsilaterally. In the (2) rostral projections in the ventral funiculus, we did not see any fibers crossing the midline. Lastly, at the (3) dorsal projections back to the central canal, in many cases, the fibers extended not only to the ipsilateral but also to the contralateral side (ipsilateral, 7.0%; bidirectional, 62.8%; contralateral, 9.3%; midline beneath the central canal, 20.9%). It requires further examinations if they had functional connections on either side. Moreover, the possibly conserved ipsilateral projections should be examined in the dorsolateral CSF-cNs of the central canal, which could not be effectively analyzed in the present study. We added these points in Results, Discussion, and Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Anatomical projections and optogenetic stimulation of CSF-cN neurons to infer synaptic connectivity:</p><p>a. The authors should provide more details on the procedure they followed. Where was the blue light applied? How many fibers are labelled/stimulated?</p></disp-quote><p>We described more detail procedures in Materials and methods: âTo elicit evoked IPSCs, photostimulation with a 470-nm blue light was used with an LED driver (LEDD1B â T-Cube LED driver, Mounted LED for microscope, Thorlabs), which was passed through a filter (LED-DA/FI/TX-A-000, Optline) and an immersion objective (40x/0.8 W, Nikon) directly above the spinal cord slice (distance, less than 3 mm). The stimuli (duration, 10 ms; frequency, 0.3 Hz; repetition, 10 times; light intensity, ~5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) were controlled with an STO mk II stimulator (BRC). GABAA receptor-evoked IPSCs were isolated by bath perfusion of 20 ÂµM Bicuculline (Sigma).â. We also counted the number of ChR2-mCherry-labeled fibers; 355.3 Â± 52.5 fibers (n = 3) were observed at T4âT6 levels, indicating the efficiency of the labeling. We added these points in Results and Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors perform control experiments (no channelrhodopsin)? Specify other parameters of stimulation (intensity, location, duration). Did the authors test the GABAergic nature of the neurotransmitter involved (meaning repeating the stimulation in the presence of a specific blocker)?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed control experiments in spinal slices of <italic>Pkd2l1</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic>;<italic>lCl<sup>-</sup>GFP</italic> mice injected with AAV-Syn-DIO-mCherry. No responses were detected by a blue light stimulation (0/14 cells). We added the new data in Figure 5D and Results. We further performed recordings under treatment with bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist. It blocked the IPSC responses of CSF-cNs (8/8 cells), indicating that the IPSCs were mediated by GABAA receptors. We added these new data in Figure 5C and Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The connectivity between CSF-cNs with axial motor neurons, V0c and V2a interneurons only relies on the anatomical study. Could the authors provide a more solid and full demonstration could be provided using again optogenetics tools and electrophysiological recordings in complement to the anatomical data? Is there some experimental limitation that prevents the authors to achieve such an investigation? In the absence of such data, the authors should acknowledge in the Discussion and in Figure 7 â supplement 1 that the connections between CSF-cNs, axial motor neurons, v0c and v2a interneurons are still hypothetical.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewerâs comment that electrophysiological recordings are required to determine their connectivity. However, recordings from V2a or V0c neurons were rather challenging for us at present. Triple transgenic mice such as <italic>Chx10</italic> (<italic>or Chat</italic>)-<italic>Cre</italic>;<italic>Pkd2l1</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic>;<italic>lox</italic>-<italic>CAT</italic>-<italic>lox</italic>-<italic>GFP</italic> mice may be available to identify the cells; however, it will be difficult to avoid leaking ChR2 expression in V2a and V0c neurons by AAV-Syn-DIO-ChR2 injections. A simple method to fluorescently label those neurons such as by developing <italic>Chx10</italic> (<italic>or Chat</italic>)-<italic>GFP</italic> mice and crossing with <italic>Pkd2l1</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic> mice will be required for further analyses.</p><p>The recordings from motor neurons in the medial column were also difficult in our technique. In particular, it was difficult to stably record motor neurons at whole cell configuration even in some rare cases of success in patch clamp around P28. The recent paper by Gerstmann et al. (<italic>Curr Biol</italic> 2022) also described that they could not detect evoked IPSCs in the motor neurons, in which they discussed that the discrepancy with the anatomical findings could be attributed to sparse connectivity and technical limitation to find intact connections in transverse slices. Therefore, an alternative methodology would be needed to determine their connections. As functional connections with spinal interneurons and motor neurons were difficult to assess in our study, we revised the Discussion and Figure legends of Figure 7âsupplement 1 to state that the connections and the proposed model are still hypothetical.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c.

Considering the comment and the definition of Sherringtonâs and others on motor neurons, we replaced the word to âmoduleâ throughout the manuscript (e.g. Kiehn, <italic>Nat Rev Neurosci</italic> 2016; Caggiano et al., <italic>Sci Rep</italic> 2016; Grillner et al., <italic>Physiol Rev</italic> 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Effects on locomotor function:</p><p>The size of the sample used to investigate locomotor parameters is rather low (at the limit to do trustable statistics).

The absence of phenotype in our beam walk test might be attributed to differences in methodology or sensitivity (chemogenetics, ventral CSF-cNs targeting in our study vs. diphtheria toxin, whole CSF-cNs; different apparatus etc.) from that in the study by Gerstmann et al. 2022.</p></body></sub-article></article>
