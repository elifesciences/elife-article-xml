progression. Cyclin D1 has been recognized as an oncogene since it was upregulated in several different types of cancers. It is known that the post-translational regulation of cyclin D1 is controlled by ubiquitination/proteasome degradation system in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Several cullin-associated F-box E3 ligases have been shown to regulate cyclin D1 degradation; however, it is not known if additional cullin-associated E3 ligases participate in the regulation of cyclin D1 protein stability. In this study, we have screened an siRNA library containing siRNAs specific for 154 ligase subunits, including F-box, SOCS, BTB-containing proteins, and DDB proteins. We found that multiple cullin-associated E3 ligases regulate cyclin D1 activity, including Keap1, DDB2, and WSB2. We found that these E3 ligases interact with cyclin D1, regulate cyclin D1 ubiquitination and proteasome degradation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. These E3 ligases also control cell cycle progression and cell proliferation through regulation of cyclin D1 protein stability. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of cyclin D1 protein stability and function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cyclin D1</kwd><kwd>cullin-associated E3 ligase</kwd><kwd>Keap1</kwd><kwd>DDB2</kwd><kwd>WSB2</kwd><kwd>Rbx1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFB3800800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Liping</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82030067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82161160342</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82250710174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82172397</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Liping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cyclin D1 protein stability is regulated by ubiquitin-proteasome mechanism mediated by multiple E3 ligases, including newly identified Keap1, DDB2, and WSB2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cyclin D1 is a key factor controlling cell cycle progression. It forms a complex with CDK4/6 and functions as a regulatory subunit in G1/S phase transition during cell cycle progression. Proteasome degradation is one of the critical post-translational regulatory mechanisms modulating steady-state protein levels of cyclin D1 during normal cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Qie and Diehl, 2020</xref>). Cullin-Ring complexes comprise the largest known family of ubiquitin ligases. Human cells express seven different cullins, CUL1, -2, -3, -4A, -4B, -5, and -7, and each of them nucleates a different ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>). Recent studies demonstrate that F-box proteins Fbxw8, Fbx4, Fbxo31, and AMBRA1 interact with CUL1/7 and mediate cyclin D1 degradation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chaikovsky et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Maiani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Okabe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Santra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Simoneschi et al., 2021</xref>). However, it is not known if other E3 ligase(s) is also involved in maintaining steady-state protein levels of cyclin D1. In this study, we have screened an E3 ligase siRNA library and identified three additional cullin-associated E3 ligases, which mediate cyclin D1 ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Our findings indicate multiple cullin-associated E3 ligases participate in the regulation of cyclin D1 stability in the cells.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To determine if cullins are required for cyclin D1 degradation, CUL1–7 (CUL1, -2, -3, -4A, -4B, -5, and -7) expression plasmids were co-transfected with cyclin D1 into HEK293 cells. Forced expression of CUL1–7 significantly suppressed cyclin D1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, the levels of cyclin B1 (G2/M regulator) and cyclin A (S phase regulator) were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that the CUL1–7 specifically regulate cyclin D1 protein levels. Consistent with these findings, RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>cullins</italic> significantly enhanced levels of endogenous cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The knockdown efficiency of these siRNAs to each <italic>cullin</italic> mRNA was about 60–90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, the silencing specificity of each <italic>cullin</italic> siRNA has been verified through both western blotting and real-time PCR assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). Results of luciferase assay also showed that cullins inhibited cyclin D1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In contrast, silencing of the cullins led to increased cyclin D1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>We then determined whether cullin-induced cyclin D1 degradation is ubiquitin-dependent and performed ubiquitination assay. We found that forced expression of CUL1–7 resulted in polyubiquitination of wild-type (WT) cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). It was noted that CUL4B and CUL7 exhibited the most significant effect on cyclin D1 ubiquitination compared with other cullins. In contrast, CUL1–7 had no effects on the ubiquitination of mutant cyclin D1 with phosphorylation defect (T286A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). It has been reported that Thr286 phosphorylation is required for cyclin D1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Diehl et al., 1997</xref>). Our results suggest that cullin-induced cyclin D1 ubiquitination is phosphorylation-dependent. A proteasome degradation inhibitor, MG132, was used to further determine if the cullins-mediated cyclin D1 degradation is through a proteasome-dependent mechanism. MG132 significantly reversed cyclin D1 degradation induced by CUL1–7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). Compared with their effects on cyclin D1 protein degradation, CUL1–7 had no significant effects on cyclin D1 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). These results demonstrated that these seven human cullins may play critical and redundant roles in cyclin D1 degradation through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism.</p><p>Each cullin protein interacts with different multi-subunit ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>). Hundreds of substrate receptor subunits associated with different cullin-Ring ligases have been characterized in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>). To identify additional E3 ligases which are associated with cullin proteins and are involved in cyclin D1 degradation, we generated an siRNA library targeting known cullin-associated proteins. This library contains triplicated siRNAs targeting to specific genes encoding for 154 ligase subunits, including F-box, SOCS, BTB-containing proteins, and DDB proteins. We transfected these siRNAs with 3xE2F-Luc reporter construct into NIH3T3 cells. 3xE2F-Luc reporter specifically responds to cyclin D1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ohtani et al., 1995</xref>). After screening the siRNA library, we found that 3xE2F luciferase activity was enhanced by 24 E3 ligases (&gt;1.5-fold increase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref>). These results suggest that multiple E3 ligases associated with different cullin proteins are involved in cyclin D1 degradation. We selected five E3 ligases, which showed highest stimulation activities on the 3xE2F-Luc reporter and found that all of them have the ability to reduce cyclin D1 protein levels in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11</xref>). Among these E3 ligase subunits, Fbxw8 (specific for CUL1 and -7) has been reported to induce cyclin D1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Okabe et al., 2006</xref>). The roles of other E3 ligase subunits, such as Keap1 (associated with CUL3), DDB2 (associated with CUL4A and -4B), and WSB2 (associated with CUL2 and -5) in cyclin D1 degradation have not been reported.</p><p>To further test the hypothesis that cyclin D1 degradation is mediated by multiple E3 ligases, we determined if different E3 ligases, Keap1, DDB2, and WSB2, are involved in cyclin D1 proteolysis. We first examined the interaction of these E3 ligases with cyclin D1 through co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged Keap1 and treated with MG132 to prevent cyclin D1 degradation. Endogenous cyclin D1 was detected in the Keap1 immunoprecipitate, and this interaction was enhanced by the CUL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, the interaction of DDB2 with endogenous cyclin D1 was enhanced by the CUL4A and -4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with these results, we also observed that CUL2 and -5 enhanced the interaction between WSB2 and endogenous cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Rbx1 is associated with CUL1–7 and was used as a control in this study. The results of co-IP assay showed that Rbx1 interacted with endogenous cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cullin-associated E3 ligases mediate cyclin D1 ubiquitination and proteasome degradation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of Keap1, CUL3 with endogenous cyclin D1.

For Keap1, we used BTB domain deletion form which abolishes its binding with CUL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Furukawa and Xiong, 2005</xref>). For DDB2, we used the WD motif deletion form which blocks its binding to its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Nag et al., 2001</xref>). For WSB2, we used the C-terminal deleted mutant which loses its binding to CUL2 and -5. And for Rbx1, we used the mutant form Rbx1<sup>C53A/C56A</sup> which dramatically reduced the ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ohta et al., 1999</xref>). We found that WT but not mutant Keap1 (F-box mutation) induced cyclin D1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, Keap1 had no effect on the ubiquitination of phosphorylation mutant cyclin D1 (T286A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

In addition, Keap1, DDB2, WSB2, or Rbx1 had no effects on the ubiquitination of phosphorylation mutant cyclin D1 (T286A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). These results indicate that Keap1, DDB2, and WSB2 interact with cyclin D1 and mediate cyclin D1 ubiquitination in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. We then determined the effects of these E3 ligases on cyclin D1 degradation by western blot analysis. Keap1, DDB2, WSB2, and Rbx1 induced WT but not T286A mutant cyclin D1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–L</xref>).

Over-expression of Keap1, DDB2, WSB2, or Rbx1 markedly inhibited the growth of HCT-116 cells. In contrast, these E3 ligases had no effect on cell proliferation in the cells stably transfected with T286A mutant cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, E, H, and K</xref>). Then, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and treated cells with nocodazole to synchronize the cell division cycle. We found that in HCT-116 cells stably transfected with the WT cyclin D1, forced expression of Keap1, DDB2, WSB2, or Rbx1 prevented the nocodazole-mediated G2/M block and subsequently resulted in accumulation of cells in G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, Keap1, DDB2, WSB2, or Rbx1 failed to induce efficient cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase in the mutant cyclin D1 (T286A) transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, E, H, and K</xref>). The results indicate that these cullin-associated ubiquitin ligases promoted cyclin D1 degradation and subsequently decreased cell cycle progression rate in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Moreover, forced expression of Keap1, DDB2, WSB2, or Rbx1 also blocked DNA synthesis in WT cyclin D1 transfected cells but not mutant cyclin D1 (T286A) transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, F, I, and L</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we also observed that decreased phospho-Rb protein levels in the cells in which Keap1, DDB2, WSB2, or Rbx1 were co-transfected with WT cyclin D1 but not the mutant cyclin D1 (T286) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). It was reported that Lysine 269 is essential for cyclin D1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbash et al., 2009</xref>). To determine if mutation of Lysine 269 will affect cyclin D1 degradation induced by newly identified E3 ligases in the current study, WT or mutant cyclin D1 (K269R) expression plasmids were co-transfected with Keap1 or DDB2 expression plasmid into HEK293 cells. AMBRA1 expression plasmid, a well known E3 ligase targeting cyclin D1, was used as a control in this experiment. 48 hr after transfection, changes in cyclin D1 protein levels were detected by the western blot analysis. We found that expression of Keap1 or DDB2 in 293 cells reduced WT but not K269R mutant cyclin D1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). To determine if these newly identified E3 ligases directly interact cyclin D1, we performed in vitro ubiquitination assay and used AMBRA1 as a positive control. We found that cyclin D1 ubiquitination ladders were observed when Keap1 or DDB2 were added, suggesting that Keap1 and DDB2 could directly interact with cyclin D1. In contrast, WSB2 only has weak effect to directly interact with cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Our findings indicate that cyclin D1 degradation is mediated by multiple E3 ligases, which are associated with different cullin proteins, including CUL2, -3, -4A, -4B, and -5. Several F-box proteins, Fbxw8, Fbxo4, Fbxo31, and AMBRA1, have previously been reported to mediate cyclin D1 degradation, and these three E3 ligases interact with cullin 1, 4, or 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chaikovsky et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Maiani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Okabe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Santra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Simoneschi et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, we found that Keap1 (works together with CUL3), DDB2 (works together with CUL4A and -4B), and WSB2 (works together with CUL2 and -5), which functions as the Ring subunit binding protein interacting with the C-terminal domains of the cullins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>), participated in the regulation of cyclin D1 proteolysis and affected the cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). The cullins interact with substrate receptor subunits to form ubiquitin ligase complex and mediate cyclin D1 degradation through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. This redundant cyclin D1 regulatory mechanism may function to ensure the normal G1-S phase transition and cell cycle progression in the cell.</p><p>Compared with transcriptional regulatory mechanism, post-translational regulation controls protein stability and plays a major role in the response to exogenous signals. It has been demonstrated that chemical reagents or γ-irradiation, which induce DNA damage, result in decreased cyclin D1 protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Choo et al., 2009</xref>). DDB2 functions as a decisive factor for cell fate after DNA damage. DDB2-deficient cells are resistant to apoptosis in response to a variety of DNA damaging agents and also undergo cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Stoyanova et al., 2009</xref>). Our results raise the possibility that DDB2 may regulate cell cycle pace after DNA damage through regulation of cyclin D1 protein stability.</p><p>In addition, cyclin D1 is abnormally up-regulated in many different types of human cancers as a proto-oncogene, including breast, lung, oesophagus, bladder, and lymphoid cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gautschi et al., 2007</xref>). Genetic lesions, such as gene amplification or mutations, can only account for a portion of the cases for the abnormal up-regulation of cyclin D1 in these cancers. Growing evidences have shown that defective regulation at the post-translational level may be an important reason resulting in the increased cyclin D1 stability. The half-life of cyclin D1 in normal cells is relatively short (~20 min) due to ubiquitin-proteasome degradation regulated by a number of E3 ligases. In the current study we found that silencing of these ubiquitin ligases resulted in increased stability and accumulation of cyclin D1 in human cancer cells leading to the stimulation of cell cycle progression. In fact, a number of these cullins-associated E3 ligases, such as Fbxo31, Keap1, DDB2, and the cullins, have been demonstrated to function as tumor suppressors or components of tumor suppressor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fay et al., 2003</xref>). These tumor suppressors may exert their functions through controlling the steady-state protein levels of cyclin D1. Loss-of-function mutations of these E3 ligases lead to spontaneous tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ohta et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and ubiquitination assay</title><p>Western blotting and immunoprecipitation (IP) were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>).

The cell lines were tested for mycoplasma-free status before they were used. HCT-116 cells expressing WT HA-cyclin D1 or MT HA-cyclin D1 (T286A) were generated by transient transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Then transfected colonies were selected in the presence of G418 (1000 μg/ml for HCT-116 cells). DNA plasmids were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells in 6 cm culture dishes using Lipofectamine 2000. Empty vector was used to keep the total amount of transfected DNA plasmid constant in each group in all experiments. Flag-EGFP plasmid was co-transfected as an internal control to evaluate transfection efficiency. Western blotting and IP assays were performed 24 hr after transfection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Myc-CUL3 and FBXW8 were generously provided by Dr. Yue Xiong and Dr. Osamu Tetsu, respectively.

These studies provide convincing evidence that CUL4 and AMBRA1, but not other cullins or substrate adaptors regulate endogenous cyclin D levels in several cell lines including RPE-1, U2OS, and HCT-116 cells, and show functional relevance during human development and cancer. Some of the results presented In these studies contradict the results presented in this short report (e.g. Simoneschi et al. show in Figure 1 that knockdown of only CUL4A/B and AMBRA1, but no other cullin or substrate adaptor, including DDB2, increase cyclin D1 levels in HCT-116 cells). Thus, the authors need to mention these previous findings in their introduction. This would obviously change the scope of their study and require them to address the discrepancies between these previous and their findings and also provide experimental evidence for when and how CRLs other than CRL4-AMBRA1 is important. This would ultimately result in a completely new study.</p><p>2) Overstatements:</p><p>– The authors claim that no other CRLs than CRL1/7 with substrate adaptors FBXW8, FBXO4, and FBXO31 has been implicated in Cyclin D degradation, which is not the case (see above).</p><p>– In the abstract they also claim that KEAP1, DDB2, and WSB2 directly interact with cyclin D1, something they did not test. They only provide evidence that these proteins, when ectopically expressed, can be in a complex with cyclin D1 in cells. These co-IP experiments also lack important controls (see below point 4). Direct interaction can only be claimed by in vitro reconstitution with recombinantly purified proteins.</p><p>– Throughout the manuscript effects with RBX1 are presented as novel findings; however, RBX1 is an integral part of all CRLs and thus should be presented as a positive control</p><p>3) Another important issue that arises from this study is how different CRLs would recognize cyclin D structurally. The authors draw a model (Figure 2M), in which all four different types of CRLs recognize cyclin D by the same mechanism using different substrate adaptors. This would be rather surprising, given that different substrate adaptors are generally thought to use unique manners to bind specific sets of substrates. Given that the authors do no provide evidence for direct interaction and ubiquitylation, It is equally conceivable that the effects they are observing are occurring through indirect mechanisms and unknown substrates (e.g. AMBRA1).</p><p>4) In addition to these major conceptual weaknesses, there are also missing controls for several experiments. To name a few: the anti-substrate adaptor co-IP experiments (Figure 1A-C) are lacking loading controls that show that the same amount of substrate adaptor was enriched in the IP. The ubiquitylation assays (Figure 1E-H) are missing controls that show that the same amount of ubiquitin was immunoprecipitated in each condition. The CHX assays (Figure 1M) need to be quantified and half-lives should be determined.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80327.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This interesting set of data provides new understanding of the role of cullin-associated E3 ligases in regulating cyclin D1 protein stability.
