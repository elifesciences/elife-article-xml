system is a hallmark of aging. The cellular mechanisms behind this overactivity remain poorly understood, with most attention paid to likely central nervous system components. In this work, we hypothesized that aging also affects the function of motor neurons in the peripheral sympathetic ganglia. To test this hypothesis, we compared the electrophysiological responses and ion-channel activity of neurons isolated from the superior cervical ganglia of young (12 weeks), middle-aged (64 weeks), and old (115 weeks) mice. These approaches showed that aging does impact the intrinsic properties of sympathetic motor neurons, increasing spontaneous and evoked firing responses. A reduction of M current emerged as a major contributor to age-related hyperexcitability. Thus, it is essential to consider the effect of aging on motor components of the sympathetic reflex as a crucial part of the mechanism involved in sympathetic overactivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sympathetic nervous system</kwd><kwd>KCNQ current</kwd><kwd>neuronal hyper-excitability</kwd><kwd>cellular aging</kwd><kwd>intercellular communication</kwd><kwd>organ dysfunction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM142690</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vivas</surname><given-names>Oscar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG056595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno</surname><given-names>Claudia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000965</institution-id><institution>American Federation for Aging Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sagol Network GerOmics Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vivas</surname><given-names>Oscar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000965</institution-id><institution>American Federation for Aging Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Glenn Foundation for Junior Faculty</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno</surname><given-names>Claudia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Weill Neurohub</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de La Cruz</surname><given-names>Lizbeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aging reduces the potassium M current in sympathetic motor neurons, resulting in a hyperactive phenotype that can be reversed by pharmacological activation of these channels.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>This study focuses on the mechanisms underlying the deterioration of the sympathetic nervous system as we age. With advancing age, the sympathetic nervous system tends to become overactive, evidenced by increased electrical activity in sympathetic nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wallin et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Narkiewicz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart et al., 2009</xref>). This overactivity, observed in humans and animal models, leads to heightened release of norepinephrine over organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ziegler et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldstein et al., 1983a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 1983b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Veith et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Esler et al., 1995</xref>), triggering compensatory processes and cellular deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hogikyan and Supiano, 1994</xref>). Understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of this age-associated overactivity is crucial as many common age-driven diseases are linked to sympathetic overactivity. For instance, dysregulation of norepinephrine release is associated with age-related hypertension and arrhythmias. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system remain to be elucidated.</p><p>During execution of sympathetic reflexes, three essential cellular components of the nervous system come into play: sensory neurons for detecting and transmitting signals of internal conditions, neurons of the sympathetic nuclei in the brain for integrating information and responding to internal changes, and the sympathetic motor neurons in the ganglia for receiving and delivering information to target organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Age-associated overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system has been predominantly ascribed to changes in the central system, specifically focusing on the hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei. In the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the activation of glutamatergic neurons through leptin pathways has emerged as a significant contributor to sympathetic overactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). At the same time, glial senescence and subsequent inflammatory mechanisms in brainstem nuclei also have been linked to sympathetic nervous system overactivity during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balasubramanian et al., 2021</xref>). However, one key question remains: Is age-related sympathetic overactivity limited solely to changes in the central system?</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Components of the sympathetic reflex.</title><p>Schematic of the components of the sympathetic autonomic reflex: Sensory neurons send information to the central component (pre-ganglionic neurons), where information is processed. Then, sympathetic motor neurons receive information from pre-ganglionic neurons to transmit it to the target organ. This research was focused on evaluating the age-related changes in the function of sympathetic motor neurons.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91663-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Aging impacts the morphology and calcium responses of sympathetic motor neurons, the peripheral component of the sympathetic reflex. Notably, sympathetic innervation to the spleen and lymph nodes reduces, while thymus innervation increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madden et al., 1997</xref>). Similarly, innervation to vascular smooth muscle changes with age, and the extent and implications of these changes depend on the specific target and neuropeptide content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnstock, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews and Cowen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrews et al., 1996</xref>). Additionally, aging affects the function of sympathetic motor neurons, as evidenced by altered calcium responses. Old sympathetic motor neurons display reduced expression of SERCA pumps, an essential component for calcium transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pottorf et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchholz et al., 2007</xref>). The results of these experiments suggest that aging has a distinct influence on the intrinsic function of sympathetic motor neurons, irrespective of any changes in the central system. As a result, the main objective of our study was to examine directly the impact of aging on the intrinsic membrane electrical properties of sympathetic motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Our work was structured around three main objectives: (1) to standardize the isolation of sympathetic motor neurons from adult to old age in mice, (2) to compare the spontaneous and evoked electrical activity of sympathetic motor neurons at three life stages, and (3) to identify potential molecular candidates underlying the observed altered electric properties and neuronal activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sympathetic motor neurons from old mice are healthy in culture</title><p>Our first goal was to assess the viability of neurons isolated from young adult and old mice. We isolated sympathetic motor neurons enzymatically from the left and right superior cervical ganglia (SCG) of young adults (12 weeks old) and old animals (115 weeks old, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The same enzymatic digestion was used for both ages. Single neurons exhibited no visible neurite growth before 18 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left); however, after 72 hr in culture, both young and old sympathetic motor neurons showed evident neurite growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right). The mean diameter of the cell soma was found to be similar in young (19.7 Â± 0.6 Î¼m) and old (19.6 Â± 0.6 Î¼m) neurons after 24 and 72 hr in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The dendritic arborization after 24 hr in culture was comparable between young (37 Â± 2 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>) and old (42 Â± 3 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>) neurons. However, after 72 hr in culture, the dendritic arborization in old neurons (105 Â± 7 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>) was more extensive compared to that of young neurons (74 Â± 5 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We continued the culture for 7 days and noted that the neurites grew until they contacted other neurons in the same dish. Furthermore, glial cells became apparent at this stage in cultures of young and old cells. The ability of neurons to regenerate neurites and contact each other was considered an indicator of viability and health. We ruled out the possibility that any functional differences between neurons from animals of different ages were due to potential damage to old neurons during the isolation and culture process. From now on, we report electrical measurements on neurons that had been incubated for approximately just 12â18 hr after isolation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sympathetic motor neurons from old mice are healthy in culture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the experimental approach: Sympathetic motor neurons were isolated from the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) of 12- and 115-week-old mice.

For reference, we also provide comparable human ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Spontaneous activity was recorded using the current clamp modality without applying any holding or current stimulus. Electrical access to the cell was obtained using the perforated patch technique (see âMaterials and methodsâ for details). Young neurons had a resting membrane potential (RMP) of â64 Â± 1 mV and very little spontaneous activity, which aligns with the expected behavior of motor neurons that respond to presynaptic commands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Only 3% exhibited spontaneous firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, middle-aged neurons showed an RMP of â58 Â± 1 mV, and 37% of these neurons displayed spontaneous firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâD</xref>). The depolarized RMP and the increased number of neurons spontaneously firing persisted in old neurons, where the RMP was â54 Â± 1 mV and 58% of neurons exhibited spontaneous firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâD</xref>). Despite the higher percentage of old neurons firing spontaneously compared to middle-aged neurons, the mean firing frequency in old neurons (60 Â± 20 action potentials [APs]/min) was significantly lower than that observed in middle-aged neurons (177 Â± 41 APs/min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Sympathetic motor neurons from old mice fire action potentials spontaneously.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ages in mice, and equivalent in humans, that were used to compare the functional responses of sympathetic motor neurons.

Cells requiring larger holding currents were excluded. From the response to additional negative current pulses (â40 to 0 pA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), we calculated the input resistance (ÎV/injected current). At these membrane potentials, without activation of voltage-activated ion channels, the change in voltage is proportional to the injected current. Input resistance was not affected by age. Young adult neurons (0.8 Â± 0.09 GÎ©), middle-aged neurons (1.1 Â± 0.06 GÎ©), and old neurons (1.1 Â± 0.11 GÎ©) exhibited similar input resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In conclusion, our findings suggest that aging leads to a gradual depolarization of the RMP without significant alteration of the input resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sympathetic motor neurons from old mice are more responsive to electrical stimulation</title><p>During sympathetic reflexes, the peripheral motor neurons increase their firing frequency in response to commands from the central sympathetic nuclei. These commands can be mimicked as direct electrical stimulation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. To test whether aging increases the sensitivity of sympathetic motor neurons to electrical stimulation, neurons were injected with 1 s current steps of amplitude ranging from 10 pA to 100 pA starting from a potential of â65 mV (â0 pA currentâ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Accordingly, the percentage of tonic neurons increased in middle-aged (34%) and old (46%) compared to young (19%) neurons. These findings highlight how aging impacts the distribution of firing subtypes in sympathetic motor neurons.</p><p>While age does impact the distribution of firing subtypes, the question remains whether intrinsic properties are affected within each subpopulation across different ages. Therefore, we analyzed the intrinsic properties across subpopulations between different age groups. The RMP of adapting and phasic firing neurons was more depolarized in middle-aged and old compared to young neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The RMP of tonic neurons tended to become more depolarized with age, but the effect was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Similar to the observation when the entire population was analyzed, the input resistance was not significantly different with age within phasic and adapting neurons.

This analysis suggested that, regardless of the subpopulation type, older neurons tend to have more depolarized RMP with no changes in input resistance.</p><p>Interestingly, aging leads to an increase in the number of spontaneous APs in phasic and tonic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). In the phasic class, middle-aged neurons fired 3 Â± 2 APs per minute and old neurons fired 5 Â± 3 APs compared to zero APs in phasic young neurons. In the tonic class, middle-aged neurons fired 179 Â± 46 APs and old neurons fired 86 Â± 27 APs, in striking contrast to zero APs in tonic young neurons. Next, we compared the maximum number of APs elicited by the strongest stimulus (100 pA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). In phasic neurons, the number of APs at 100 pA increased by 53% in middle age (9.5 Â± 1.0 APs) and 133% in old (14.5 Â± 2.1 APs) compared to young neurons (6.2 Â± 1.0 APs).

In addition, aging is associated with a shift in the proportion of neurons falling in each class.

It illustrates the temporal correlation between the decrease in M current with the increase in excitability and firing of APs. This strong dependence led us to hypothesize that aging decreases M current, leading to a depolarized RMP and hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). For these experiments, we measured the RMP and evoked activity using perforated patch, followed by the amplitude of M current using a whole-cell voltage clamp in the same cell. We also measured the membrane capacitance as a proxy for cell size. Interestingly, M current density was smaller by 29% in middle-aged (7.5 Â± 0.7 pA/pF) and by 55% in old (4.8 Â± 0.7 pA/pF) compared to young (10.6 Â± 1.5 pA/pF) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

Next, we tested the effect on the abundance of the channels mediating M current. Contrary to our expectation, we observed that KCNQ2 protein levels were 1.5 Â± 0.1-fold higher in old compared to young neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>).

However, recent evidence suggests that aging also impacts the intrinsic properties of peripheral sensory neurons leading to hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanani et al., 2023</xref>). In line with this observation, our research reveals increased excitability in old sympathetic motor neurons. Collectively, these findings underscore that aging affects the intrinsic properties of peripheral neurons, challenging the notion that age-related changes are limited to the central nervous system. Hence, it is crucial to reconsider our understanding of aging-related sympathetic overactivity with a holistic perspective. Investigating how aging affects the intrinsic properties of sensory, central, and sympathetic motor neurons throughout a lifetime will be essential research to comprehend the underlying cause-and-effect mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The molecular mechanism underlying the age-related excitability changes</title><p>The expression, distribution, regulation, and function of ion channels play a pivotal role in determining the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons. The mechanism underlying changes in age-associated excitability encompass alterations in cholinergic and glutamatergic responses and the function and expression of voltage-gated ion channels, such as Ca<sub>V</sub>, K<sub>V</sub>, and HCN. In recent years, research on aging has revealed a significant impact of ion channels in the aging process. For example, repressing glutamate-gated chloride channels and L-type channels extends longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zullo et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, inhibiting A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels has shown the potential to revert the intrinsic excitability of aged CA3 pyramidal neurons to a young-like state in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simkin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our data show a decrease in M current and suggest that it is a key mechanism behind the development of a more depolarized RMP and hyperexcitability in old sympathetic motor neurons. Work done in other systems has also underscored the importance of M current in the development of age-associated neuronal dysfunction. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, aging is associated with reduced M expression in the brain, while KCNQ overexpression in mushroom body neurons reverses age-related memory impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavaliere et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, in macaques, blocking KCNQ channels partially restores memory-related firing of aged neurons to more youthful levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Recent findings by Li et al. demonstrate that aged hypocretin/orexin neurons exhibit hyperexcitability with lower KCNQ expression. Their study shows that selectively disrupting <italic>Kcnq2/3</italic> genes in young hypocretin neurons is sufficient to depolarize these neurons and cause sleep fragmentation, mimicking the sleep instability observed in aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2022</xref>). In our work, we also analyzed the effect of aging on other currents without seeing significant differences, suggesting that KCNQ channels are particularly susceptible to a process occurring during aging.</p><p>In our study, we found a reduction in M current but an increase in KCNQ2 channel abundance; why? We speculate the increase in KCNQ2 abundance is a compensatory mechanism that does not achieve to restore the function of the cell. This experiment assessed total protein abundance, which includes synthesized protein in traffic and inserted at the plasma membrane. Our experiments did not investigate the abundance of KCNQ2/3 channels only in the plasma membrane. Multiple mechanisms, independent from increased synthesis, could underlie a reduction in M current including alterations in traffic, insertion, post-translational modifications, and cofactors of KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 channels. This mechanism remains elusive and open for exploration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations and conclusion</title><p>We want to point out that linopirdine has been reported to affect other ionic currents besides M current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neacsu and Babes, 2010</xref>). Despite this limitation, the application of linopirdine to young sympathetic motor neurons led to depolarization and firing of APs.</p><p>The hypothesis of age-associated hyperexcitability of sympathetic motor neurons should be tested in the neurons of other sympathetic ganglia, including the stellate and celiac. While our study allowed us to determine the effect of aging on sympathetic neurons in isolation from other components of the sympathetic reflex, it did not provide insight into whether the hyperexcitability of motor neurons is a compensatory mechanism responding to earlier changes in the brain or target tissues. This question has posed a long-standing challenge, especially in various pathologies where sympathetic overactivity, such as arrhythmias and hypertension, plays a role. In such cases, sympathetic overactivity could result from deterioration in the target organs or sensory components, such as the heart and carotid body. Further research and exploration are needed to unravel these complex interactions and establish a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying age-related changes in the sympathetic nervous system.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that aging directly impacts the intrinsic electrical properties of sympathetic motor neurons. Furthermore, our research postulates that the decrease in KCNQ function underlies the hyperexcitability of sympathetic motor neurons. These findings shed light on the mechanisms involved in age-related changes within the sympathetic nervous system and offer a promising avenue for further investigation and potential intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, C57BL/6, males)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse, wild type, young adult</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, C57BL/6, males)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse, wild type, middle and old ages</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-KCNQ2 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ABCAM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# ab22897;

The authors found that sympathetic motor neurons from old mice exhibit increased firing rates (spontaneous and evoked), more depolarized membrane resting potential, and increased rheobase. Furthermore, the study investigates cellular mechanisms underlying age-associated hyperexcitability and shows solid evidence supporting that a decreased activity of KCNQ2/3 channels during aging is a major contributor to the increased excitability of sympathetic old neurons.

The findings indicate that neurons isolated from aged animals show increased membrane excitability manifested as increased firing rates in response to electrical stimulation and changes in related membrane properties including depolarized resting membrane potential, increased rheobase, and spontaneous firing. By contrast, neuron cultures from young mice show little to no spontaneous firing and relatively low firing rates in response to current injection. These changes in excitability correlate with reductions in the magnitude of KCNQ currents in neurons cultured from aged mice compared to neurons from cultured from young mice. The authors conclude that aging promotes hyperexcitability of sympathetic motor neurons through changes in KCNQ channels.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91663.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>de La Cruz</surname><given-names>Lizbeth</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Washington</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bui</surname><given-names>Derek</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Washington</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Moreno</surname><given-names>Claudia M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Washington</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vivas</surname><given-names>Oscar</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Washington</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors</bold>:</p><p>Please make corrections as suggested by reviewer 1 to improve the manuscript.

I also removed extraneous information in that section. It now reads:</p><p>Previous work by our group and others demonstrated that cholinergic stimulation leads to a decrease in M current and increases the excitability of sympathetic motor neurons at young ages.67-71 The molecular determinants of the M current are channels formed by KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in these neurons.70, 76, 77 Thus, Figure 6A shows a voltage response (measured in current-clamp mode) and a consecutive M current recording (measured in voltage-clamp mode) in the same neuron upon stimulation of cholinergic type 1 muscarinic receptors. It illustrates the temporal correlation between the decrease of M current with the increase in excitability and firing of APs. This strong dependence led us to hypothesize that aging decreases M current, leading to a depolarized RMP and hyperexcitability (Figure 6B). For these experiments, we measured the RMP and evoked activity using perforated patch, followed by the amplitude of M current using a whole-cell voltage clamp in the same cell. We also measured the membrane capacitance as a proxy for cell size. Interestingly, M current density was smaller by 29% in middle age (7.5 Â± 0.7 pA/pF) and by 55% in old (4.8 Â± 0.7 pA/pF) compared to young (10.6 Â± 1.5 pA/pF) neurons (Figure 6C-D). The average capacitance was similar in young (30.8 Â± 2.2 pF), middle-aged (27.4 Â± 1.2 pF), and old (28.8 Â± 2.3 pF) neurons (Figure 6E), suggesting that aging is not associated with changes in cell size of sympathetic motor neurons, and supporting the hypothesis that aging alters the levels of M current. Next, we tested the effect on the abundance of the channels mediating M current. Contrary to our expectation, we observed that KCNQ2 protein levels were 1.5 Â± 0.1 -fold higher in old compared to young neurons (Figure 6F-G). Unfortunately, we did not find an antibody to detect consistently KCNQ3 channels. We concluded that the decrease in M current is not caused by a decrease in the abundance of KCNQ2 protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B. and - the implications or lack thereof - of the correlation of KCNQ with AP firing rates.</p></disp-quote><p>I am not sure to understand the request in the section on the correlation of KCNQ with AP firing rate. I divided the long paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The apparent lack of correlation between KCNQ current and KCNQ2 protein needs to be better explained. This is a central part of the study and this result undercuts the premise of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, total KCNQ2 protein abundance increases while M current decreases. We do not claim in our work that changes in excitability are caused by a reduction in the expression or density of KCNQ2 channels. On the contrary, our current working hypothesis is that the reduction in M current is caused by changes in traffic, degradation, posttranslational modifications, or cofactors for KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 channels. I have modified the description in the results section and discussion to clarify this concept. We also note that the discussion section contains a paragraph discussing this discrepancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the poor specificity of Linordipine for KCNQ should be pointed out in the limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. I have added the following sentences to the Limitations section. It reads: âWe want to point out that linopirdine has been reported to affect other ionic currents besides M current (Neacsu and Babes, 2010; Lamas et al., 1997). Despite this limitation, the application of linopirdine to young sympathetic motor neurons led to depolarization and firing of action potentials.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the editor notes that the author response should not contain ambiguities in what was addressed in the revision.

After reviewing this comment, I realized I did not respond to the Major points in the section of the Recommendations for the authors from Reviewer 3. We missed that entire section. Our previous responses addressed the Public review of Reviewer 3. When doing so, we did not separate the sentences, omitting the request to perform the experiment in slices.</p><p>The proposed experiments will require an upward microscope coupled to an electrophysiology rig; unfortunately, we do not have the equipment to do these experiments. We agree that our findings need to be tested in intact preparations to understand how the hyperactivity of sympathetic motor neurons affects systemic responses and the function of controlling organ function. This is a crucial step to move the field forward. Our laboratory is trying to find the appropriate experimental design to address this problem. We believe we must go beyond redoing these experiments in slices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The significance values greater than p &lt; 0.05 do not add anything and distract focus from the results that are meaningful.

The important point is stimulation of muscarinic AChRs, which physiologically are stimulated by acetylcholine. The particular muscarinic agonist used is unimportant. Unless mandated by eLife, &quot;cholinergic type 1 muscarinic receptors&quot; are usually referred to as M1 mAChRs, or even better is &quot;Gq-coupled M1 mAChRs.&quot; I don't think that Kruse and Whitten, 2021 were the first to demonstrate the increase in excitability of sympathetic neurons from stimulation of M1 mAChRs. Please try and cite in a more scholarly fashion.</p></disp-quote><p>A) We have modified lines 192 and 198, removing the mention of oxotremorine.</p><p>B) We have modified the nomenclature used to refer to cholinergic type 1 muscarinic receptors.</p><p>C) We cited references on the role of M current on sympathetic motor neuron excitability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors may want to use the term &quot;M current&quot; (after defining it) as the current produced by KCNQ2&amp;3-containing channels in sympathetic neurons, and reserve &quot;KCNQ&quot; or &quot;Kv7&quot; currents as those made by cloned KCNQ/Kv7 channels in heterologous systems. A reason for this is to exclude currents KCNQ1-containing channels, which most definitely do not contribute to the &quot;KCNQ&quot; current in these cells. I am not mandating this, but rather suggesting it to conform with the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. I have modified the text to use the term M current. I maintained the use of KCNQ only when referring to KCNQ channel, such as in the section describing the abundance of KCNQ2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The section in the text on &quot;Aging reduces KCNQ current&quot; is confusing. Can the authors describe their results and their interpretation more directly?</p><p>(6) Please explain the meaning of the increase in KCNQ2 abundance with age in Fig. 6G. How is this increase in KCNQ2 expression consistent with an increase in excitability? The explanation of &quot;The decrease in KCNQ current and the increase in the abundance of KCNQ2 protein suggest a potential compensatory mechanism that occurs during aging, which we are actively investigating in an independent study.&quot; is rather odd, considering that the entire thesis of this paper is that changes in excitability and firing properties are underlied by changes in KCNQ2/3 channel expression/density. Suddenly, is this not the case?? What about KCNQ3? It would be very enlightening if the authors would just quantify the ratio of KCNQ2:KCNQ3 subunits in M-type channels in young and old mice using simple TEA dose/response curves (see Shapiro et al., JNS, 2000; Selyanko et al., J. Physiol., Hadley et al., Br. J. Pharm., 2001 and a great many more). It is also surprising that the authors did not assess or probe for differences in mAChR-induced suppression of M current between SCG neurons of young and old mice. This would seem to be a fundamental experiment in this line of inquiry.</p></disp-quote><p>We have divided this paragraph in sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A.

This data shows the complexity of the mechanism behind the M current in old neurons where changes in basal levels of PIP2, phospholipids metabolism, KCNQ2/3 changes in traffic/degradation, and M current pharmacology need to be addressed together for a proper interpretation.
