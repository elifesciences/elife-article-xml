and tunneling nanotube (TNT) structures. Here, we set up two quantitative delivery reporters to study cargo transfer between cells. We found that EVs are internalized by reporter cells but do not efficiently deliver functional Cas9 protein to the nucleus. In contrast, donor and acceptor cells co-cultured to permit cell contact resulted in a highly effective transfer. Among our tested donor and acceptor cell pairs, HEK293T and MDA-MB-231 recorded optimal intercellular transfer. Depolymerization of F-actin greatly decreased Cas9 transfer, whereas inhibitors of endocytosis or knockdown of genes implicated in this process had little effect on transfer. Imaging results suggest that intercellular transfer of cargos occurred through open-ended membrane tubular connections. In contrast, cultures consisting only of HEK293T cells form close-ended tubular connections ineffective in cargo transfer. Depletion of human endogenous fusogens, syncytins, especially syncytin-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, significantly reduced Cas9 transfer. Full-length mouse syncytin, but not truncated mutants, rescued the effect of depletion of human syncytins on Cas9 transfer. Mouse syncytin overexpression in HEK293T cells partially facilitated Cas9 transfer among HEK293T cells. These findings suggest that syncytin may serve as the fusogen responsible for the formation of an open-ended connection between cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Communication between cells is an important process for survival, especially in multicellular organisms. Cells typically exchange information by releasing small molecules in to their surrounding environment which neighboring cells then receive and respond to. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that cells also pass signals to each other via fatty bubbles called exosomes and tubes connecting their membranes.</p><p>Various reports have suggested that these mechanisms can transport larger proteins and nucleic acids which carry the information cells need to make proteins. However, how cells are able to combine their membranes to allow these types of transfer is unclear.</p><p>To investigate, Zhang and Schekman studied how human cancer cells and embryonic cells grown in a laboratory pass molecules between each other. This included a string of nucleic acids known as RNA and a protein called Cas9 which can edit the genome of cells to activate an enzyme that has bioluminescence activity. By measuring the level of luminescence, Zhang and Schekman were able to sensitively detect the transfer of Cas9 and RNA to neighboring cells.</p><p>The experiments showed that exosomes were not efficient at transporting proteins or RNA. However, cells in near or direct contact transferred both molecules effectively using tube connections, with some cell types being more adept at this mechanism than others. Zhang and Schekman found that the formation of these tubular channels required a protein called syncytin which helps membranes fuse together mainly in the early stages of embryo development.</p><p>These findings open a new avenue of investigation on how cells send signals to one another. It is also possible that the protein syncytin has a role in cancer progression, as tumors rely on cell communication to maintain their growth and organize the cells surrounding them. However, further work is needed to investigate this possibility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intercellular communication</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>membrane tubular connection</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>Syncytin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014220</institution-id><institution>Innovative Genomics Institute, UC Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sergey Brin Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A human endogenous fusogen, syncytin, which facilitates placental cell-cell fusion during early embryonic development, mediates the formation of open-ended membrane tubular connections between other cell types that efficiently promotes the intercellular transfer of cytoplasmic cargos including Cas9 protein and organelles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although most forms of intercellular communication are mediated by secreted diffusible proteins and small molecules, considerable interest has developed concerning the possibility that extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes and tubular connections may convey cytoplasmic proteins, RNA molecules, and even organelles between neighboring or distant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aykan, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Exosomes, one type of EV, are secreted from diverse cells and have been reported to elicit physiologically meaningful effects on target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mathieu et al., 2019</xref>). Exosomes contain various biological molecules, including lipids, RNA, and proteins, any or all of which may introduce normal or pathological signals to a target cell or tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mathieu et al., 2019</xref>). Our previous studies reported that two RNA-binding proteins, YBX1 and Lupus La protein, are involved in highly selective microRNA loading into exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Temoche-Diaz et al., 2019</xref>). The use of exosomes as a diagnostic biomarker and as a delivery vehicle for drugs or the CRISPR/Cas9 has generated much interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Jong et al., 2020</xref>). We know little about the means by which exosomes may efficiently deliver cargo to the cytoplasm or nucleus of cells that internalize such vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalluri and LeBleu, 2020</xref>). Functional delivery will likely require the action of a membrane fusogen to promote fusion of an exosome at the cell surface or after internalization to an endosome.</p><p>The tunneling nanotube (TNT) is a membranous structure with the potential for intercellular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rustom et al., 2004</xref>). TNTs are thin membrane bridges with open-ended extremities that appear to mediate membrane continuity between cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rustom et al., 2004</xref>). TNTs were first described in cultured rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, and although considerable evidence has developed for intercellular transfer mediated by TNTs in cell culture, the possibility of a physiological role needs to be further explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pinto et al., 2020</xref>). Diverse cargo, including small organelles of the endosomal/lysosomal system and mitochondria, calcium, MHC class I proteins, miRNAs, mRNAs, prions, viral and bacterial pathogens, have been found to traverse open-ended TNT connections among a variety of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eugenin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerdes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerdes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerdes and Carvalho, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gurke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kolba et al., 2019</xref>). TNTs are usually 50â1000 nm in width; however, thicker tubules of 1â2 Î¼m in width, called tumor microtubes, have been reported in cultures of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roehlecke and Schmidt, 2020</xref>). Tumor microtubes may play roles in the tumor microenvironment, especially glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Osswald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Venkataramani et al., 2022</xref>). This emerging form of intercellular tubular connections may enhance our understanding of cellular community in multicellular organisms and in disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamashita et al., 2018</xref>). As with exosomes, open-ended tubular connections between cells must involve a membrane fusogen to promote intercellular traffic of proteins, RNA, and organelles.</p><p>Cell-cell fusion serves vital roles in virtually all organisms from yeast to mammals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Olson, 2005</xref>), Mammals have a limited number of known catalysts of cell fusion that serve specialized cells and tissues. Two examples are myomaker and myomerger for myoblast fusion, and the syncytins for trophoblast cell fusion (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brukman et al., 2019</xref>). Syncytins are endogenous retroviral envelope glycoproteins: syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaise et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frendo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mi et al., 2000</xref>) and syncytin-A and -B in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupressoir et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peng et al., 2007</xref>). Syncytin-mediated fusion requires complementary cell surface receptors, including ASCT-2, a widely distributed neutral amino acid transporter, a receptor for syncytin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blond et al., 2000</xref>) and Major Facilitator Superfamily Domain Containing-2 (MFSD2), a sodium-dependent lysophosphatidylcholine transporter, the receptor for syncytin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Esnault et al., 2008</xref>). In the mouse, lymphocyte antigen 6E (Ly6e) has been identified as a receptor for syncytin-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bacquin et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to a role in the formation of a trophoblast syncytium during early embryonic development, syncytins are also involved in the fusion of osteoclast precursors and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bjerregaard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Uygur et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>Cytoplasmic structure-forming proteins are required to organize the plasma membrane as cells adhere in preparation for fusion. For example, invasive protrusions that promote the cell membrane juxtaposition and fusogen engagement are propelled by Arp2/3-mediated branched actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sens et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shilagardi et al., 2013</xref>). In this process, dynamin, a large GTPase best known for its role in endocytosis, bundles actin filaments to promote invasive protrusion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the use of quantitative assays to measure traffic of protein and RNA cargo between cells. A Cas9/gRNA cargo enriched in exosomes was found to be inefficiently delivered for gene editing in a reporter cells. Similar results have been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Jong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Somiya and Kuroda, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albanese et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, we found highly efficient transfer when cells were co-cultured with physical contact. Using live-cell imaging and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), we found that traffic appeared to be mediated by open-ended membrane tubular connections of several microns in diameter. Membrane fusion depended on syncytin in the acceptor cell and a complementary receptor in the donor cell. Optimum transfer was seen with HEK293T cells as a donor and MDA-MB-231 cells and several other tumor cell lines as acceptor. In contrast, HEK293T cells serving as both a donor and an acceptor were not active in intercellular traffic but instead appeared to form close-ended tubular connections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exosome-mediated Cas9 intercellular transfer is inefficient</title><p>To determine whether exosomes efficiently deliver cargo proteins and RNA to recipient cells, we developed a Cas9-based dual-luciferase cargo reporter assay. In donor cells, a modified âretention using a selective hook (RUSH)â strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>) was applied to Cas9 tethered indirectly to CD63, a tetraspanin membrane protein enriched in endosomes and exosomes. CD63 was fused with streptavidin, and Cas9, to which a nuclear localization signal was appended, was fused to streptavidin-binding protein (SBP). gRNA expression was driven separately by a U6 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These two chimeric proteins associate noncovalently and dissociate in the presence of biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). HEK293T cells were stably transfected with one or both fusion genes and secreted exosomes were purified by differential and buoyant density centrifugation. Exosomes from cells expressing both fusion proteins were enriched in Cas9 and gRNA, whereas cells expressing Cas9 untethered to CD63 had little or no Cas9 or gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

In this approach, constitutively expressed firefly luciferase (Fluc) was expressed linked to the sequence of a self-cleaving peptide, F2A, followed by a Cas9/gRNA-targeted linker region and a stop codon. The Nluc sequence was placed after the stop codon with one nucleotide out of frame such that Nluc expression would depend upon cleavage and error-prone non-homologous end joining to remove the stop codon and restore a proper reading frame. Synthesis of the gRNA was driven independently by a U6 promoter. Expression of the upstream Fluc gene served as the denominator in a measure of the efficiency of Nluc repair. As a test, we expressed Cas9 protein in HEK293T cells with the reporter plasmid and found that expression of Cas9 increased the Nluc/Fluc signal around 100-fold compared to that transfected with control empty plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Exosomes secreted from the donor cell line were purified as described earlier and incubated with the reporter cell line in the presence of exogenous biotin to dissociate Cas9 from the CD63 tether. At an excess of exosomes/cell of 10<sup>5</sup>/1, the Nluc/Fluc ratio increased by only 50%, markedly lower than the 70-fold increase in the ratio of reporter cells directly transfected with the Cas9/gRNA construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) or co-transfected with both SBP-Cas9/gRNA and streptavidin-CD63 in the presence or absence of biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Nonetheless, the signal was somewhat proportional to dose of exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), but we concluded that functional delivery of Cas9/gRNA from exosomes secreted by HEK293T cells was very inefficient. Similar experiments were performed using Cas9-enriched exosomes secreted by MDA-MB231 cells, and we found that these exosomes were also inefficient for the Cas9/gRNA delivery to MDA-MB231 cells as a reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Our findings were similar to those reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Jong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Somiya and Kuroda, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In a control experiment, we used exosomes enriched in Cas9-GFP secreted by HEK293T cells to monitor internalization into U2OS cells. Tagged GFP antibody was used to detect internalized Cas9-GFP that accumulated in intracellular puncta in ~30% of the cells during a 16 hr incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). From these experiments, we concluded that Cas9 was internalized into cells but may not have been mobilized from vesicles to gain access to the luciferase reporter genes in the nucleus.</p><p>We considered the possibilities that the secreted exosomes were fragile for storage or damaged during the purification procedure. Unfractionated conditioned medium from the donor cells was incubated with reporter cells for 3â8 days with little change in the Nluc/Fluc signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). As a further test of vesicle stability, we incubated donor and acceptor cells in a transwell chamber separated by a 0.45 Î¼m pore vesicle-permeable membrane. After a 6-day co-culture, no increase in the Nluc/Fluc was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Therefore, we suggest delivery of Cas9 is limited by inefficient fusion of exosomes with the endosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Intercellular transfer of Cas9 and other cargos through direct cell-cell contact</title><p>We next tested the possible transfer of Cas9/gRNA mediated by cell-cell contact.

We examined the distribution and function of syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 in HEK293T cells and in the tumor cell lines in our Cas9 and GFP transfer assays. First, we used immunoblotting to detect syncytins in the cell lines used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The expression of syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 was detected in all these lines but the higher mobility, presumably furin processed form of syncytin-2, was more apparent than that of syncytin-1. MDA-MB-231 cells had a lower level of syncytin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). CRISPRi was used to deplete syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 in MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1BâE</xref>). Because of the complication in using CRISPRi in a transfer assay that depended on the expression of Cas9, we titrated the expression of dCas9 and found that a low level did not itself affect the detection of functional Cas9 transfer from HEK293T to MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1BâE</xref>).

These results showed that most GFP-fusion proteins localized in a reticular pattern within transfected cells with some label detected at or near the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). We then applied cell surface biotinylation using an impermeable labeling reagent to test whether GFP-syncytins localized at cell surface. Syncytin-fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated with GFP antibody and SDS-PAGE blots were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (streptavidin-HRP) and GFP antibody. HRP blots showed two species that migrated at the positions expected for full-length and furin processed forms of the syncytin fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast, immunoprecipitated fractions blotted with GFP antibody revealed species that migrated at positions expected for the full-length fusion proteins. We interpret this to mean that the majority of molecules accumulated early in the secretory pathway prior to the point of cleavage by the furin protease in the trans-Golgi membrane and beyond.</p><p>Next, we visualized HEK293T cells containing SBP-Cas9-GFP and Myc-streptavidin-CD63-mCherry co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 cells containing syncytin 1-BFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1E</xref>) or syncytin 2-BFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Syncytin-BFP fusions were found partially localized to or near the surface and at junctions between a tubule and the adjoining cell plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1E and F</xref>). We conclude that under conditions of transient transfection at least some of all three syncytins may be detected at the cell surface and in proximity to sites of membrane fusion. The results of the GFP immunoblot of total proteins and biotinylation of those molecules trafficked to the cell surface suggest that some small fraction of the total fusion proteins experience proteolytic maturation.</p><p>We also examined the role of the syncytin-2 receptor, MFSD2A, established in studies on trophoblast cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Esnault et al., 2008</xref>). MFSD2A knockdown in HEK293T cells reduced functional Cas9 transfer by approximately five- to sixfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). MFSD2A knockdown in MDA-MB-231 acceptor cells reduced Cas9 transfer approximately three- to fourfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and D</xref>). These results suggested roles for MFSD2A in functional Cas9 transfer in both HEK293T and MDA-MB-231 cells. Given the above results reveal that cargos could be transferred among MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> suggest that syncytin and its receptor may also play roles in the intercellular transfer among MDA-MB-231 cells. Finally, we used IF and live-cell imaging and localized MFSD2A to the cell surface of normal and GFP-MFSD2A-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E and F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>MFSD2A knockdown in in both HEK293T and MDA-MB-231 cells reduced intercellular transfer of Cas9.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Donor cells: HEK293T with stable overexpression of SBP-tagged Cas9-GFP/gRNA (SBP-Cas9/gRNA) (Ctrl), or MFSD2A knockdown.

A Cas9-based dual-luciferase system and a trifluorescence split-GFP assay were used to measure Cas9-mediated genome editing and the formation of active GFP from fragments shared between cells in contact. We found that exosomes enriched in Cas9 were internalized by acceptor cells but largely failed to release Cas9 for editing purposes. The same was true for exosomes enriched in a fragment of GFP that failed to form active GFP in acceptor cells. In contrast, quite efficient transfer was seen in co-cultures of cells grown to near confluence. Transfer among cells in co-culture was dependent on actin but was not blocked under conditions that arrested endocytosis. Imaging experiments revealed occasional intercellular tubular connections of a range of diameter that in certain donor-acceptor cell pairs appeared to be open-ended to allow cytoplasmic continuity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9G</xref>). As a donor cell line, HEK293T was quite efficient in cargo transfer and formed open-ended tubular connections to MDA-MB-231 acceptor cells. In contrast, the tubular connections between HEK293T cells were not open-ended and transferred little if any cargo. The transfer process appeared to consist of at least three stages: an initial tubular protrusion, possibly driven by F-actin, emanating from a donor or acceptor cell; contact by the tubule with an opposing cell surface; and membrane fusion in favorable circumstances, particularly when the acceptor cell was MDA-MB-231 or one of several other tumor cell lines. Tubules formed and made contact with opposing cells but did not fuse unless the endogenous membrane fusogen, syncytin (particularly syncytin-2), was expressed on the acceptor cell. The syncytin-2 receptor protein, MFSD2A, appeared to be required to promote fusion for the intercellular transfer.</p><p>Many reports have described the intercellular traffic of proteins, RNA, and organelles such as mitochondria and lysosomes mediated by tubular connections; however, the physiological function and molecular mechanism of this pathway have not been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pinto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roehlecke and Schmidt, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamashita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dagar et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, exosomes are widely believed to mediate intercellular traffic of proteins and RNA, yet no reports have probed the mechanism of the membrane fusion event that must accompany the discharge of exosome content to the cytoplasm or nucleus of targeted cells.</p><p>We considered other pathways of traffic mediated by cell-cell contact that could explain our results. Trogocytosis is a means by which one cell nibbles another cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joly and Hudrisier, 2003</xref>). In this process, lymphocytes (B, T, and NK cells) extract surface molecules from antigen-presenting cells and express them on their own surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joly and Hudrisier, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">GutiÃ©rrez-VÃ¡zquez et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies reported that trogocytosis requires PI3K activation, which is blocked by such inhibitors as wortmannin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MartÃ­nez-MartÃ­n et al., 2011</xref>). We found that the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 did not block the transfer of Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Alternatively, some cells in contact form an âimmunological synapseâ that could promote the local traffic of exosomes possibly leading to selected delivery of cargo proteins and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dustin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grakoui et al., 1999</xref>). However, we found intercellular traffic relatively unaffected by inhibitors of endocytosis, which would be required for the uptake of vesicles produced and consumed at an immunologic-like synapse.</p><p>A variety of other cell-cell adhesions, some of which involve tubular connections, have been reported. Many such connections remained close-ended such as in gap junctions, synaptic junctions, and cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamashita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">RamÃ­rez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999</xref>). We found large lateral surfaces form and remain stable at the junction of tubules and the cell surface under conditions where membrane fusion does not occur. These adhesions may require molecules employed for other stable cell-cell junctions, and open-ended membrane tubes such as TNTs and tumor microtubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roehlecke and Schmidt, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamashita et al., 2018</xref>). The role of such stable junctions as a prelude to membrane fusion remains to be considered.</p><p>Fusion has been seen at other tubular junctions, particularly for the formation of open-ended contact with thin tubules called TNTs. TNTs range in diameter from 50 to 1000 nm and in length from a few to 100 Î¼m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roehlecke and Schmidt, 2020</xref>). Previous studies have reported the transfer of proteins, mRNA, and organelles such as mitochondria and lysosomes mediated by TNTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pinto et al., 2020</xref>). Tumor microtubes produced by cancer cells generate tubular connections of 1â2 Î¼m in diameter, perhaps to allow the passage of larger organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roehlecke and Schmidt, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Osswald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Latario et al., 2020</xref>). Such membrane tubes were detected in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Osswald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lou et al., 2012</xref>), possibly serving a role in tumor maintenance and progression. MDA-MB-231 cells transferred cytoplasmic cargo to other cancer cell lines, including U2OS, A549, and MCF5, as well as to other MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The tubular connections we found range from 2 to 4 Î¼m in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and were not confined to tumor cells but included our standard donor cell line, HEK293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We observed membrane tubules projecting from HEK293T cells connecting to MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Such structures from nontransformed cells could indicate a more normal role in cell and tissue physiology and at the border of a tumor as in the hijacking of mitochondria from immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saha et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>At present, it is not possible to offer distinct roles for TNTs and thick tubules in the transfer of cytoplasmic cargo between cells. Our observations are consistent with either or both such structures engaged in the transfer of Cas9 and our other reporter proteins. Aside from the example of cancer cells and their interface in tumors, the role of TNTs and larger tubular connections in normal physiological functions remains to be explored.</p><p>Among the possible catalysts of open-ended connections, we considered the role of the one known mammalian viral-like fusogen, syncytin (syncytin-1 and syncytin-2). Syncytins are mammalian endogenous fusogens that facilitate trophoblast cell fusion in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaise et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grandi and Tramontano, 2018</xref>). In this study, we used immunoblot to detect syncytins corresponding in SDS-PAGE mobility to precursor and/or furin-processed mature proteins expressed in several cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Using CRISPRi, we found that knockdown of syncytins in MDA-MB-231 cells, but not in HEK293T cells, blocked transmission of Cas9 and the formation of open-ended tubular connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Previous studies reported a number of other proteins involved in TNT formation, including M-Sec and the exocyst complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hase et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>), LST1 and RalA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schiller et al., 2013</xref>), ERp29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pergu et al., 2019</xref>), S100A4 and RAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sun et al., 2012</xref>), Myosin10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gousset et al., 2013</xref>), Rab8-Rab11-Rab35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>), MICAL2PV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), IRSp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">PrÃ©vost et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delage et al., 2016</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dagar et al., 2021</xref>). However, it is not clear in any of these cases if the protein is involved in tube formation, adhesion, or fusion. Nonetheless, it is likely that proteins, in addition to syncytin, such as the receptor proteins MFSD2A (for syncytin-2), ASCT2 (for syncytin-1), and Ly6e (for mouse syncytin-A), are involved specifically in fusion. The failure of endogenous syncytins to support fusion in HEK293T cells serving as an acceptor target could relate to unexplored aspects of intracellular traffic or regulation of fusogen activity. Although we found some increase in Cas9 traffic to HEK293T cells ectopically expressing mouse syncytin-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), full fusion activity may depend on unknown variables.</p><p>Inefficient sorting of functional syncytins or their receptors may explain the failure of exosomes isolated from HEK293T and MDA-MB-231 cells to deliver Cas9 for editing in the other target cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Indeed, the requirement for an active fusogen incorporated into exosomes may explain other examples of failed delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Jong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haimovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Somiya and Kuroda, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albanese et al., 2021</xref>). The question remains to explain the many observations that suggest functional delivery by exosomes. A closer look by quantitative measures may show that apparent success in exosome-mediated transfer is quite inefficient. A contrasting example may be in the activity of trophoblasts that may express active syncytins and their receptors at the cell surface and may likewise traffic extracellular vesicles within the developing placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tolosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Uygur et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vargas et al., 2014</xref>). Lessons learned from trophoblasts may inform the rational design of functional exosomes useful in the delivery of heterologous protein, such as Cas9 protein, between cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

cancer cell lines, including U2OS, MDS-MB-231, A549, MCF7, Hela, and A431, were from the UC Berkeley Cell Culture Facility and were confirmed by short tandem repeat profiling (STR) and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. These cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin. For exosome production, we seeded cells to ~10% confluency in 150 mm tissue culture dishes (Corning, Corning, NY) containing 20 ml of growth medium and then grown to 80% confluency (~48 hr). Cells used for exosome production were incubated in exosome-free medium produced by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 24 hr using a Ti-45 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) in a LE-80 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). For co-culture experiments with cell-cell contact, unless otherwise noted, we used a ratio of donor cells to recipient cells of 10:1. Cells were co-cultured for 3â6 days until near confluence. Co-cultures were assayed for luciferase activity or were analyzed by flow cytometry. For co-culture experiments using a transwell dish, we seeded donor cell lines in the top layer and reporter cells in the bottom layer followed by incubation for 6 days. Inhibitors with indicated concentrations were incubated in the co-cultures for 3â6 days.</p><p>For the stable cell lines, we transfected cells with lentivirus and then single clones were selected via antibiotics or sorted by flow cytometry. Plasmids, including His-Flag-Cas9-GFP, SBP-Flag-Cas9-GFP, Myc-streptavidin-CD63-mCherry, or the reporter plasmids, were transfected into HEK293T cells, together with psPAX2 and pMD2.G, for lentivirus packaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>siRNA and shRNA transfection</title><p>siRNAs were purchased from QIAGEN. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturerâs instructions. For shRNAs, the sequences were designed using online data available from the Broad Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/">https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/</ext-link>) and synthesized by IDT and inserted into the pLKO.1 plasmid. Plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells, together with psPAX2 and pMD2.G, for lentivirus packaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>CRISPR interference</title><p>MDA-MB-231 cells with reporter plasmid and HEK293T cells expressing dCas9-KRAB, as in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>), were generated using lentivirus. A modified version of the transfer plasmid, UCOE-EF1Î±-dCas9-BFP-KRAB, was kindly provided by Jonathan Weissman (Whitehead Institute, MIT). Cells were sorted using the single-cell mode for BFP signal post transduction. Sequences for gRNAs targeting the promoter of the genes of interest were extracted from the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horlbeck et al., 2016</xref>). gRNAs were cloned in plasmid pU6-sgRNA EF1Alpha-puro-T2A-BFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>) and plasmid #60955 obtained from Addgene. The three top gRNAs from the V.2 library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horlbeck et al., 2016</xref>) were chosen per gene of interest. Lentiviruses with the gRNAs targeting the genes of interest were used to transduce the parental cells. Three days post transduction, cells were sorted using a single-cell mode. Knockdown efficiencies were evaluated by immunoblot.</p><p>To avoid the effect of CRISPRi on a transfer assay that depended on the expression of Cas9, we titrated the expression of dCas9 in MDA-MB-231 reporter cells. Three representative clones were selected for high, medium, and low levels expression of dCas9. The high level of dCas9 expression was around threefold of that in medium-level clone and around tenfold of that in low-level clone. We found that a low or medium level of expression of dCas9 did not itself significantly affect the detection of functional Cas9 transfer from HEK293T to MDA-MB-231 cells. We used a medium level of expression of dCas9 in the syncytin-1 knockdown clone, and a low level of dCas9 in the syncytin-2 knockdown clone, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunoprecipitation</title><p>Cells expressing both SBP-Flag-Cas9-GFP and Myc-streptavidin-CD63-mCherry were cultured with or without biotin at indicated concentrations for 24 hr and then the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 1 mM PMSF) for 30 min at 4Â°.

After polymerizing overnight at 60Â°C, the coverslips were removed from the bottom of the live-cell dishes. Next, 70-nm-thick ultrathin sections were cut using a diamond knife and then picked up with Formvar-coated copper grids. Sections were double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. After air drying, samples were examined with a FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope. All the EM experiments were performed in the Electron Microscope Laboratory at UC Berkeley.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Cells or co-cultures were analyzed or sorted using flow cytometry. FSC-A and FSC-H were used to gate for single particles (singlets), which were used for further analysis. Gating of each fluorescent channel was determined by comparing a control sample without any fluorescence labeling and a control that was labeled in a single channel. Data were collected on a BD Bioscience LSR Fortessa (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and analyzed by FlowJo X software and Flowing software.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gal Haimovich (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One reviewer is more extensive in the comments which need to be addressed as best as is possible. Most of these are clarifications but the reviewer indicates that more convincing evidence is needed.</p><p>1) Clarify text to address questions raised by reviewer 2.</p><p>2) An experiment suggested by reviewers 2 and 3 is to use immunofluorescence to localize the presence of the fusion determinants on the membrane. Perhaps this will clarify the differences in receptivity in the cell line. There is some confusion here as to the level of the protein and the corresponding ability to form open connections.</p><p>3) A clarification of the differences between the role of these observed membrane tubules and the TNTs reported in other works in transfer of molecules (eg mRNA).</p><p>Is it just a thickness difference?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It would be more generalizable to living systems to look at primary cells rather than cell lines.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Related to public comment 1: If str-CD63 is absent from the transiently transfected cells, then an additional comparison should be to transiently transfect SBP-Cas9-GFP to cells expressing myc-str-CD63 and the Nluc reporter, in the presence or absence of biotin. This will show whether the str-SBP interaction is inhibiting Cas9 nuclear import and if biotin actually releases SBP-Cas9-GFP for nuclear import (as an additional control to the co-IP in Figure 1 â supp figure 1A).</p><p>2. Related to public comment 2:</p><p>c. Assuming Syncytin-2 is not required for TNTs transfer, a simple experiment to distinguish TNT and membrane tubules will be to track TNT formation, or transfer of known TNTs cargos (e.g. vesicles, mitochondria, mRNA) in WT vs Syncytin K/O.</p><p>d. To rule out the possibility that the observed phenotype is due to mRNA transfer through TNTs, the authors could transfect the acceptor cells with siRNA against the SBP-Cas9-GFP mRNA. The phenotype should not change if mRNA transfer does not play a role here.</p><p>e. At the very least, the authors should discuss these possibilities and why they think TNTs do not play a role in the Cas9/split-GFP transfer since both the protein and mRNA can transfer through TNTs, yielding the observed results.</p><p>3. Related to public comment #3: Split GFP assay</p><p>a. A FACS analysis of mixed (not co-cultured) cells similar to the one presented in Figure 2C, F should be shown.</p><p>b. Knocking-down Syncytin for the split-GFP assay will strengthen the claim that both assays measure the same process.</p><p>4. Related to public comment #4c: The authors should show live imaging of single-culture acceptor cells to see the background in the mCherry and GFP channel.</p><p>5. Related to public comment #5: I think a relatively simple experiment to examine the function of Syncytin in HEK293T will be to determine the syncytin localization in MDA vs HEK cells (e.g. at cell surface, contact sites, membrane tubules). I think it can greatly improve the authors' claim on the role of Syncytin and resolve the HEK problem.</p><p>6. The authors show that transferred Cas9, as detected by immunofluorescence (Figure 1H), is maintained in vesicular formations in the acceptor cells â probably endosomes or lysosomes as previously demonstrated for EV uptake (e.g. PMID: 27114500), but the authors do not provide more details on these structures. Is the IF signal for CD63 represents the endogenous CD63 in acceptor cells or myc-str-CD63 coming from the donor cells? The figure legend reads &quot;anti-CD63&quot; antibody suggesting endogenous, but no such antibody appears in the list in Materials and methods section, so maybe the authors meant anti-myc? Furthermore, co-IF with antibodies against early/late endosome/lysosome markers could clarify at which stage Cas9 gets &quot;stuck&quot;.</p><p>7. The authors perform the co-culture experiments on a time scale of days. From my experience with TNT-mediated mRNA transfer, this is most likely because the initial culture was at 10% confluence â with low chance of cell-cell contact. Have the authors tried looking at transfer in a 1:1 or 10:1 culture plated already at 60-70% confluence? This could yield more interactions that could be detected and studied.</p><p>8. Latrunculin â my experience suggests it is very toxic to cells (I used 100-200nM) and typically the cells die within several hours. Yet here the authors treated the cells for 3-6 days. Furthermore, such a treatment will likely affect cell motility and proliferation â thus limiting not only formation of tubules but also decrease the probability for cell-contacts. The authors should state if they checked for cell viability and if cell proliferation was affected â thus reducing confluence. Experiments with high-confluence at initiation and therefor reduced co-culture duration (item #2 above) could help with the toxicity by reducing time of exposure to the drug.</p><p>9. The authors spend two paragraphs in the discussion to suggest a role in cancer (transformed) cells vs non-transformed cells. However, the only example of non-transformed cells they have are the HEK293T cells â and the lack of transfer can be a unique issue of this particular cell line. I suggest to limit the discussion of this subject or provide data from at least one more non-transformed cell line (which also expresses Syncytin).</p><p>10. The section on the split GFP is very confusing and hard to follow â for example I needed to read several times until I understood what &quot;Q2-4/Q4-4+Q2-4&quot;.

It will also be helpful to label the axes with the relevant fluorescent protein measured, rather the filter name. I suggest using simpler labeling and more explanations for better clarity.</p><p>11.

Perhaps this will clarify the differences in receptivity in the cell line. There is some confusion here as to the level of the protein and the corresponding ability to form open connections.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the commercial antibodies for syncytins are not good for immunofluorescence, we relied on cells transfected with fluorescent protein-tagged syncytins. The results show that syncytins partially localized to the cell surface (Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A-C), including at the junction between a tubule and the target cell surface (Figure 8âfigure supplement 1E, F). We found that overexpressed syncytin-1 and -2 induced cell fusion in HEK293T cells, consistent with the cell surface localization of at least a fraction of these proteins. Nonetheless, the basal level of syncytins at the surface of HEK293 cells may be inadequate to promote open-ended tubular connections in cultures of this cell line. Answering this question will require more sensitive probes to detect the endogenous syncytins.</p><p>As an independent test of cell surface localization, we used surface biotinylation to show that a fraction of the syncytins can be labeled externally (Figure 8âfigure supplement 1D). This fraction shows evidence of proteolytic processing consistent with furin cleavage whereas the overwhelming majority of transfected syncytins detected in a blot of lysates suggests that most remains in the unprocessed precursor form, consistent with the punctate and reticular fluorescence images (Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A clarification of the differences between the role of these observed membrane tubules and the TNTs reported in other works in transfer of molecules (eg mRNA).</p><p>Is it just a thickness difference?</p></disp-quote><p>The results in this study cannot distinguish between roles for TNTs or thick membrane tubules. We are not yet aware of distinct requirements for the formation of these two tubular connections. It may be that TNTs contain actin only, whereas thick tubules contain both actin and microtubules (ref: PMID: 17142745), which may result in the transfer of different cargos, for example, the transfer of microtubule-mediated cargos through thick tubular connections. Such functional distinctions bear further exploration thus we have been careful avoid implying a role for one or the other, except insofar as our visual detection has focused on the more obvious role of thick tubules in intercellular transfer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Related to public comment 1: If str-CD63 is absent from the transiently transfected cells, then an additional comparison should be to transiently transfect SBP-Cas9-GFP to cells expressing myc-str-CD63 and the Nluc reporter, in the presence or absence of biotin. This will show whether the str-SBP interaction is inhibiting Cas9 nuclear import and if biotin actually releases SBP-Cas9-GFP for nuclear import (as an additional control to the co-IP in Figure 1 â supp figure 1A).</p></disp-quote><p>We added new data in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D which suggests that CD63-tethering itself does not affect Cas9 function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to public comment 2:</p><p>c. Assuming Syncytin-2 is not required for TNTs transfer, a simple experiment to distinguish TNT and membrane tubules will be to track TNT formation, or transfer of known TNTs cargos (e.g. vesicles, mitochondria, mRNA) in WT vs Syncytin K/O.</p><p>d. To rule out the possibility that the observed phenotype is due to mRNA transfer through TNTs, the authors could transfect the acceptor cells with siRNA against the SBP-Cas9-GFP mRNA. The phenotype should not change if mRNA transfer does not play a role here.</p><p>e. At the very least, the authors should discuss these possibilities and why they think TNTs do not play a role in the Cas9/split-GFP transfer since both the protein and mRNA can transfer through TNTs, yielding the observed results.</p></disp-quote><p>The results in this study do not rule out a role for TNTs in intercellular transfer nor do we suggest that syncytin-2 is not required for TNT-mediated transfer.

Related to public comment #5: I think a relatively simple experiment to examine the function of Syncytin in HEK293T will be to determine the syncytin localization in MDA vs HEK cells (e.g. at cell surface, contact sites, membrane tubules). I think it can greatly improve the authors' claim on the role of Syncytin and resolve the HEK problem.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new visualization and cell surface labeling experiments to show that syncytins appear to be partially localized at the cell surface of MDA-MB-231 cells, and even at sites of cell-cell contact (Figure 8âfigure supplement 1). We also find that overexpressed syncytin-2 localizes to the plasma membrane of HEK293T cells to induce cell fusion. As stated above, the problem remains to explain why basal levels of expression of syncytins are inadequate to promote the formation of open-ended tubular connections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors show that transferred Cas9, as detected by immunofluorescence (Figure 1H), is maintained in vesicular formations in the acceptor cells â probably endosomes or lysosomes as previously demonstrated for EV uptake (e.g. PMID: 27114500), but the authors do not provide more details on these structures. Is the IF signal for CD63 represents the endogenous CD63 in acceptor cells or myc-str-CD63 coming from the donor cells?

Thus for the high concentrations, at initiation we used a higher cell density (a little more than DMSO) and cultured for longer times until near confluence to diminish the toxic effect. The Nluc/Fluc signal detected after co-culture suggested that more than half of the cells remained viable during drug treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
