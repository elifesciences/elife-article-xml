positions. In contrast to cellular organelles surrounded by lipid membranes, the composition of distinct chromatin domains is rather ill described and highly dynamic. To gain molecular insight into these domains and explore their composition, we developed an antibody-based proximity biotinylation method targeting the RNA and proteins constituents. The method that we termed antibody-mediated proximity labelling coupled to mass spectrometry (AMPL-MS) does not require the expression of fusion proteins and therefore constitutes a versatile and very sensitive method to characterize the composition of chromatin domains based on specific signature proteins or histone modifications. To demonstrate the utility of our approach we used AMPL-MS to characterize the molecular features of the chromocenter as well as the chromosome territory containing the hyperactive X chromosome in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This analysis identified a number of known RNA-binding proteins in proximity of the hyperactive X and the centromere, supporting the accuracy of our method. In addition, it enabled us to characterize the role of RNA in the formation of these nuclear bodies. Furthermore, our method identified a new set of RNA molecules associated with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> centromere. Characterization of these novel molecules suggested the formation of R-loops in centromeres, which we validated using a novel probe for R-loops in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Taken together, AMPL-MS improves the selectivity and specificity of proximity ligation allowing for novel discoveries of weak protein–RNA interactions in biologically diverse domains.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane less organelles</kwd><kwd>nuclear bodies</kwd><kwd>dosage compensation</kwd><kwd>structural RNA</kwd><kwd>proximity proteomics</kwd><kwd>proximity RNA labelling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>419067076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choudhury</surname><given-names>Rupam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>213249687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borsò</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>325871075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choudhury</surname><given-names>Rupam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QBM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Venkateswaran Venkatasubramani</surname><given-names>Anuroop</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>97131</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franconi</surname><given-names>Celeste</given-names></name><name><surname>Kinkley</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proximity biotinylation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> centromere suggests a role of RNA helicases, centromeric transcripts, and centromeric R-loops for centromere function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic information in the eukaryotic nucleus is packaged in a complex chromatin structure. Typically, chromatin has been classified in two major categories: euchromatin, which is loosely packed and more accessible, and tightly packed and less accessible heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heitz, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elgin and Grewal, 2003</xref>). These different degrees of accessibility are thought to be mediated by a network of specific protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Bemmel et al., 2013</xref>). Systematic mapping studies of proteins on chromatin using DamID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Bemmel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Filion et al., 2010</xref>) or ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roy et al., 2010</xref>) revealed a diverse composition of chromatin resulting in up to 30 different types of chromatin. A variety of different chromatin capture methods have demonstrated that the genome can be separated in two large functional compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>) with inter-chromosomal interactions occurring mainly between loci belonging to the same compartment. While it is generally accepted that the three-dimensional organization of nuclear chromatin in distinct domains plays a major role in regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pombo and Dillon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reiff et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lanctôt et al., 2007</xref>), the mechanisms of how the different types of chromatin form and how they contribute to the dynamic regulation of gene expression are still not fully understood. Several studies have shown that individual chromosomes occupy distinct areas within the nucleus, often called territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cremer and Cremer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fritz et al., 2019</xref>) and specific domains within chromosomes likewise cluster to the interior or periphery of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ou et al., 2017</xref>). Prominent examples of such regions are the centromeric heterochromatin that frequently localizes at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taddei et al., 2004</xref>) or nuclear bodies such as the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caudron-Herger et al., 2016</xref>) or Cajal bodies that are formed on the rDNA locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caudron-Herger et al., 2016</xref>) or at sites of snRNP and snoRNP biogenesis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cioce and Lamond, 2005</xref>). Nuclear bodies and distinct chromosome territories dissolve at the onset of mitosis and re-form in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheutin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>). Such self-organized formation and maintenance of functional domains are most likely mediated by multiple interactions between the DNA, proteins, and RNA found within these domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Quinodoz et al., 2021</xref>). The individual interactions that drive this process are often weak in nature but nevertheless able to drive the formation of distinct nuclear bodies. Though microscopically detectable, many nuclear bodies are highly dynamic and difficult to purify. In fact, even for the most abundant classes of nuclear bodies such as nucleoli or Cajal bodies, the investigation of their proteomic composition required large quantities of cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lam et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2005</xref>). The purification and characterization of specific chromosomal territories are even more challenging and often involve the disruption of the nuclear 3D structure before purification of a chromosomal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iglesias et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vermeulen and Déjardin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saksouk et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, these purification methods frequently depend on the stable interaction of the protein with the DNA and hence many weak interactions are lost. A possible solution to this loss is the use of proximity biotinylation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roux et al., 2012</xref>), which have been shown to provide powerful tools to identify and characterize such weak interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Youn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Samavarchi-Tehrani et al., 2020</xref>). In fact, proximity biotinylation has been increasingly used in chromatin research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kochanova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Minderjahn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Santos-Barriopedro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Remnant et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Villaseñor et al., 2020</xref>) to characterize the chromosomal environment of DNA-bound factors that have been elusive to ChIP or ChIP-MS methods. A major disadvantage thus far of these methods is the requirement of exogenously expressed fusion proteins such as BioID or variants thereof or with Apex2 and new cell lines had to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kochanova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Minderjahn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, as the expression of transgenic fusion proteins and the delivery of biotinylation reagents are difficult to control, it results in a high background and variance of the proximity proteome. To overcome these issues, various in vitro methods using BirA derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Santos-Barriopedro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Remnant et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bar et al., 2018</xref>) or secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hashimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kotani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rees et al., 2015</xref> have been established to facilitate proximity biotinylation in cells. The disadvantages of BirA, HRP, and their derivatives are their relatively low biotinylation efficiency and slower kinetics resulting in a lower sensitivity and the requirement of large amounts of input material. In addition, Apex2 allows the efficient labelling of proteins and RNA molecules in proximity to a given bait using biotin-anilin as substrate. To improve the specificity and sensitivity of these approaches we developed a novel method called AMPL-MS (antibody-mediated proximity labelling coupled to mass spectrometry), using a protein A–Apex2 fusion protein. A related approach has recently been used to study the proteomics composition of protein domains carrying specific histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2022</xref>). However, our approach investigates not only proteins but also RNAs in proximity of nuclear factors that define distinct chromosomal domains. Here, we use AMPL-MS in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and show that specific nuclear domains are enriched for specific RNAs, which are most likely transcribed from the DNA that is part of the domain. Furthermore, we show that removal of the RNA substantially changes the proteomic composition and domain morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, deeper evaluation of centromeric RNA–protein proximity data, revealed an important role of R-loops in the formation/maintenance of these domains, which we could confirm using novel orthoganol approaches. Taken together, AMPL-MS is highly versatile and improves the specificity and selectivity of proximity biotinylation, facilitating the discovery of novel and relevant weak RNA–protein interactions within biologically distinct domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Versatile proximity biotinylation in cells</title><p>To establish a versatile and sensitive method to characterize the molecular neighbourhood of a given chromatin protein, we expressed a His-tagged fusion protein of protein A and Apex2 in <italic>E. coli</italic> (pA-Apex2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The fusion protein was used to tether Apex2 to chromatin domains marked by specific antibodies, which allows an efficient biotinylation of all proteins in the vicinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To assess the specificity of the method, we first targeted centromeric chromatin using an antibody against the centromeric histone variant of H3, Centromer Identifier (CID or dCenpA). The colocalization of the biotin signal with CID in immunofluorescence images shows that pA-Apex2 biotinylates proteins within the centromeric domain only in presence of an anti-CID antibody, biotin-phenol, and hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b, c</xref>). Hardly any biotinylation is observed when either antibody, biotin-phenol, or hydrogen peroxide is omitted. Due to the presence of endogenous peroxides, we could observe some minor background biotinylation when we did not exogenously add hydrogen peroxide and therefore compared all proximity proteomes to the controls where no primary antibody was added. Proteins within this domain were then isolated using streptavidin beads and analysed by mass spectrometry leading to the identification of 172 proteins that localized in proximity to CID containing centromeric chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). All previously characterized centromeric proteins of <italic>Drosophila</italic> were almost exclusively detected in proximity to CID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kochanova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barth et al., 2014</xref>). A gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the proteins that had not yet been reported as CID interactors revealed a strong enrichment of factors involved in RNA-related processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A comparison with a proximity proteome experiments performed in SL2 cells expressing a CID-APEX2 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kochanova et al., 2020</xref>) also showed that the AMPL-MS approach has a much higher sensitivity as we got a comparable number of identified components of centromeric chromatin from as little as 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells as opposed to 2 × 10<sup>10</sup> cells in the conventional experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kochanova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This increased sensitivity is most likely due to a much lower background of the AMPL-MS approach thanks to the isolation of nuclei and the extensive washing steps after the incubation with pA-APEX2. These steps greatly reduce interfering background and, thanks to the nuclear permeabilization, increase the penetration of biotin-phenol, which is otherwise not taken up very efficiently by these cells. The establishment of AMPL-MS as a sensitive and versatile method to analyse chromatin domains allows a quick investigation and comparison of such domains even in difficult to isolate cell populations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Antibody-mediated proximity labelling coupled to mass spectrometry (AMPL-MS) to study the proteomic composition of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> centromere in a genetically unperturbed cell line.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of AMPL-MS.

To do this, we used an antibody recognizing MSL2, a component of the dosage compensation complex that specifically and selectively associates with the male X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lucchesi and Kuroda, 2015</xref>). Like the selective biotinylation of the centromere, AMPL-MS using an anti-MSL2 antibody resulted in the specific labelling of the X chromosome territory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>) only when antibody, biotin-phenol, and hydrogen peroxide is present. As expected, the composition of the enriched sets of protein depends on the bait identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Interestingly, both chromatin neighbourhoods contained factors related to RNA-related processes albeit with slightly different functional terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e, f</xref>). Importantly, this method does not allow us to distinguish whether the association of these factors is directly caused by the recruitment of MSL2 to the hyperactive X or whether their localization is caused by the general upregulation of gene activity on the single male X chromosome. As both proteins are tightly associated with chromatin, we reasoned that the histones in proximity to CID should carry different modification patterns than the one in the neighbourhood of MSL2. Indeed, we detected a moderate increase of activating marks in the MSL2 proximity proteome and a slightly higher level of repressive marks in proximity of CID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>).

RNA transcribed from pericentromeric or centromeric chromatin bind plays a key role in setting up the structure of the centromere and the clustering of distinct centromeres in interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corless et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). To investigate the RNA-dependent proteomic neighbourhood of distinct nuclear domains like the hyperactive X chromosome or the chromocenter, we performed AMPL-MS for MSL2 and CID in the presence or absence of RNase A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9 supp10 supp12 supp11">Supplementary files 9–12</xref>).

Thanks to the AMPL-MS method we could study the effect of an RnaseA treatment on the proteomic environment of the signature proteins of chromosomal domains. As expected, neither the targeted signature factor nor proteins that mainly interact with them by protein–protein interactions such as MSL1,3 and MOF for MSL2 or Cenp-C for CID are affected by RNAase treatment. However, the proteomic composition of the characterized domains changes substantially upon RNAse treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d, f</xref>). Not surprisingly, a large percentage of proteins that depend on the presence of RNA contain RNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e, g</xref>), suggesting that the proximity is mediated by a direct interaction of these factors with RNA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>RNase treatment changes the proteomic environment of nuclear domains.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of AMPL-MS-RNase method.

The vertebrate homologue of MLE, DHX9, is an RNA–DNA helicase that has been shown to be important in the regulation of RNA–DNA hybrids (R-loops) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakraborty et al., 2018</xref>) and has been suggested to play an important role in centromere function in several organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mishra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kabeche et al., 2018</xref>). Based on the observation that MLE can be detected within the chromocenter of <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kotlikova et al., 2006</xref>), a potential role for MLE for centromere formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has also been proposed. Consistently, we also observed a minor fraction of MLE close to the centromere, which was lost upon Rnase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test whether MLE is indeed involved in R-loop formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> centromeres, we used novel synthetic probes that allowed us to enrich for R-loops in vivo. To do this we generated a <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line that allowed us to induce the expression of GFP fused to a tandem hybrid binding domain (HBD) from RNAseH1 or a mutant version that is no longer able to bind to R-loops (HBD<sub>mut</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to what has been shown in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakraborty et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kabeche et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Racca et al., 2021</xref>) using this reporter we detect R-loops at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). DHX9 recognizes and suppresses physiological R-loops at transcription termination regions and CPT-induced R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cristini et al., 2018</xref>). However, in another study DHX9 has been shown to suppress toxic R-loops as well as promote regulatory R-loops, by means of its ability to unwind secondary DNA and RNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakraborty et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, <italic>Drosophila</italic> centromeres have been shown to be rich in sequences that could potentially form non-canonical secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patchigolla and Mellone, 2022</xref>). These unusual DNA structures may help recruiting CID-specific chaperones such as HJURP in tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kato et al., 2007</xref>). Such structures form on single-stranded DNA and may therefore be stabilized through the formation of R-loops. Based on our results, we therefore speculate that MLE promotes the formation of R-loops by resolving secondary structures that will form in the centromeric RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakraborty and Grosse, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such R-loops will then drive the generation of unusual DNA structures that in turn might facilitate CID recruitment. The centromere-associated RNA could then help stabilizing MLE at the centromere thereby resolving the secondary structures and allowing CID containing nucleosomes to assemble. Consistent with this hypothesis we find a substantial reduction of the centromeric R-loops upon knocking down MLE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). This model is further supported by recent findings that a removal of R-loop causes the loss of Cenp-A from the mammalian centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kitagawa et al., 2023</xref>) and that neocentromere formed on ectopic sites are often associated with the presence of R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arunkumar et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our data show that the versatility of AMPL-MS allows us to characterize membrane less domains in the nucleus at an unprecedented molecular level and therefore identify systematic changes in these organelles upon challenge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> S2DGRC was purchased from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genomics Research Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu">https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu</ext-link>) a subclone of them (L2–4) was a gift from Patrick Heun.

Following filtering, MinProb imputation algorithm with <italic>q</italic> = 0.01 was performed to impute the missing values and limma based differential expression analysis was carried out. Proteins were considered significant if the LFC &gt;1 and FDR ≦0.05. Over representation analysis was performed using the enrichGO function from clusterProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lyon et al., 2021</xref>) package v3.12.0 by taking the significant proteins (FDR 0.05 cut-off for predicted GO terms) and without a background set. Corresponding GO plots were also generated with R environment. For the tree plot, GO terms were clustered based on GO semantic similarity. Based on the representation in each cluster, a summarized GO term was the written.

In brief, the biotinylated proteins were immunoprecipitated using streptavidin beads as earlier and eluted in 1× SDS lysis buffer. The proteins were then resolved on a precast SERVAGel TG PRiME 4–20% (SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH) gel and stained with InstantBlue Coomassie Protein Stain. Protein bands which correspond to the histones (expected between 11 and 17 kDa) were cut out and destained. Following destaining, in-gel histone acylation using propionic anhydride and digestion with trypsin [MS Grade Pierce Trypsin Protease (Thermo Scientific)] were performed. The histone peptides were then extracted and cleaned using a C8 Stagetip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rappsilber et al., 2007</xref>) before mass spectrometry analysis.

General Statements</p></disp-quote><p>We considered the Reviewers’ comments with all authors and feel that we will be able to address most of their concerns within the next two months. All four Reviewers appreciate the quality of our data but suggest that we should focus more on the biological findings rather than on the technology we use. While we agree with the comments of the Reviewers that the general concept of antibody-based proximity biotinylation we used to characterize nuclear domains is not entirely novel, we would still like to point out that our method results in a much higher sensitivity and selectivity compared to similar approaches published before. The use of HRP coupled secondary antibodies as suggested by Reviewer2 results in a much higher background when used for nuclear domains and the use of BirA suffers from a lower biotinylation efficiency. We will try to put more emphasis on this aspect of the method in a revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Description of the planned revisions</p></disp-quote><p>As the use of APEX2 also enables us to simultaneously characterize the RNA molecules in proximity to the targeted protein by using biotin-aniline as a substrate, we decided to investigate the role of RNA in the organization of nuclear domains in more detail. We have used the selective enrichment of Rox1 and the Rox2 RNA to the Msl2 domain as proof-of concept and are currently sequencing the RNA in proximity to the centromere. I have attached the data for the Rox RNAs below to demonstrate the general feasibility of the method (see figure attached). In the revised manuscript we also plan to elaborate on the functional role of our finding that Mle is found in proximity to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> centromere in an RNA dependent manner. Considering that the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-Loops) has been shown to severely harm genome integrity, we wondered whether Mle might function to resolve the formation of R-loops at centromeric regions. In fact, we can detect an increased formation of centromere proximal R-loops upon knockdown of Mle, which coincide with a substantial widening of the centromeric domain. These results underscore a general importance of R-loops removal for the organization of centromeric domains in particular.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Description of the revisions that have already been incorporated in the transferred manuscript</p></disp-quote><p>We have not yet incorporated any new experiments in the transferred manuscript.</p><p>Detailed response to reviewers</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>The vast majority the experimental results, statistical analysis, and conclusions drawn by the authors appear sound and are described in way that should allow reproduction (however, see my comments below for some suggestions for minor improvements). The authors rigorously test their method, using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromodomain as 'playground', before applying it to other chromosomal areas and histone variants/modifications. Besides providing proteomes of the targeted nuclear subcompartments, they show that RNase treatment of the cells radically changes the proteome(s) and conclude a role for RNA in the integrity of the corresponding compartments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her appreciation of our work</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is shown by immunofluorescence staining as well as proteomic analysis of the biotinylated proteins. The images in figure 4b (and to lesser extent 4c) show an increased intensity and more diffuse labelling. Can the authors exclude that RNase treatment simply leads to an increase in accessibility for the biotin-phenol, hence a visibly higher biotinylation?</p><p>Along these lines, have the authors maybe observed an increase in overall labelling/pulldown efficiency or for biotinylated proteins in their proteomic data?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment of the reviewer. While we cannot fully exclude the possibility that RNase treatment results in an increased accessibility for biotin-phenol, we do not think that this is the case. We neither observe a general increase in pulldown efficiency of biotinylated proteins nor do we see a substantially increased biotin staining per nucleus. In addition, we actually see more proteins being less efficiently labelled upon RNase treatment suggesting that the domain is actually more dispersed in the nucleus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. In figures 1a and 4a (as well as in the Methods section), the authors use the term 'biotin-tyramide' as labelling agent, but in the main text and figure legends 'biotin-phenol' is used. For clarity, only one term should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>We use Biotin-phenol throughout the manuscript when labelling proteins and biotin-anilin to label RNA</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2a shows a magnified cell/nucleus in the last column. To what cells do the magnifications in this last column refer to? Maybe these cells could be boxed in the second last column?</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and boxed the cells that are magnified in figures 1 and 2 as well as the new figure 5</p><p>3. In figures 4b + c:, the figure legend mentions the individual rows as '(I)' and '(II)' but no such label seen in the corresponding panel(s).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the mishap and added the corresponding row labels</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The Quantification method for co-localization (e.g. 1c and 2b) is insufficiently described to the reader (reference simply relates to Fiji package). What module/script within the Fiji package has been used?</p></disp-quote><p>We now described the version of the Fiji package we used for colocalization analysis in the methods section</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The RNase treatment is not described at all in the methods section or the supplementary information and should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the mishap and added the Rnase treatment in the method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The sentence on page 6 ('As expected, neither the targeted signature factor or proteins that mainly interact with them protein-protein interactions such as MSL1,3 and MOF for MSL2 or Cenp-C for Cid are not affected by RNAase treatment') should be rephrased as it is not comprehensible in the current form.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the sentence to: “As expected, neither the targeted signature factor or proteins that mainly interact with them by protein-protein interactions such as MSL1,3 and MOF for MSL2 or Cenp-C for Cid are affected by RNAase treatment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript by Choudhury et al. describes a new method for antibody-mediated proximity labeling and applies it in the cell nucleus. In short, nuclei are isolated, fix and permeabilized, proteins are labeled with primary antibodies, a bacterially expressed/purified protein-A-APEX2 fusion protein is added, conventional H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/biotin phenol labeling of proximate protein is performed, proteins are un-crosslinked and biotin-affinity captured for MS analysis. The application to nuclear proteins and results seems appropriate. The method is highly similar to and more complicated than prior methods as described in more detail below. I would focus the impact of this paper towards its biological results and not the novelty of the methods used.</p><p>Prior methods that effectively accomplish the same outcome (fixed cells/tissues, antibodies and proximity labeling for AP-MS) have been published before. Perhaps most recently it was reinvented as the so called BAR method in PMID 29256494. That paper was cited here but incorrectly as BirA-related, which it is not. Of course that prior manuscript itself ignored prior methods from years back (2008, 2012, 2014, 2015, PMID 18495923, 22936677, 24706754, 25829300) using the same approaches of antibody targeted peroxidase for the same purposes of proximity labeling.</p><p>This method seems a somewhat Rube Golderbergian approach to antibody-mediated proximity labeling, which has been performed previously in multiple reports. APEX/2was developed to function inside of living cells since HRP does not. The value of doing the proximity labeling in living cells was either to capture protein associations over time, as with BioID/TurboID, or to get snapshots of protein associations in living cells with APEX/2. HRP does however function quite well for proximity labeling outside of cells, or in fixed/permeabilized cells, as has been demonstrated in the prior methods/papers that are referenced above. Replacing commercially available secondary antibodies fused to HRP with homemade protein-A-fused to APEX2 seems counterintuitive and/or unnecessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with all four reviewers that while we optimized the method and showed its high sensitivity and versatility similar methods have been published before. We have now discussed the various approaches more extensively in the revised manuscript. However, we would also like to point out that our method allows the purification of proteins and RNA in proximity to specific bait proteins using the same highly sensitive tools we describe. Moreover, the application of these method now revealed a more detailed characterization of the centromeric chromatin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and allowed us to describe for the first time the DHX9 dependent R-loop formation at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> centromere. Following the suggestion of reviewer 2, we now put a stronger focus on the biological results rather than the method used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors explain the mechanisms that underly the reported enhanced sensitivity of AMPL-MS compared to conventional APEX2 in living cells. Is there something about the nuclear isolation that reduces interfering background, the loss of small soluble molecules in the nucleus after isolation and/or permeabilization that enhance the proximity labeling, penetration issues with the biotin-phenol in living cells, and/or something else?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a paragraph describing why we think the method is more sensitive. Indeed, we think most of the aspects suggested by the reviewer contribute to it. However, based on our experience we think the strongest contribution is the fact that we isolate and permeabilize the nuclei, which greatly enhance the accessibility of biotin-phenol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There seems to be the use of various controls based on the figures and legends, but they are not clearly described in the results or methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively described the controls used in the manuscript to better illustrate the rationale behind them</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All MS results should be provided, preferably in an Excel file format.</p></disp-quote><p>All MS results are provided in an.xls format (Supplementary files S1-S11)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>applied.</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>The manuscript entitled 'The role of RNA in the maintenance of chromatin domains as revealed by antibody mediated proximity labelling coupled to mass spectrometry' by Choudhury et al. describe a new method, which they termed AMPL-MS (Antibody mediated proximity labelling mass spectrometry). The technique is based on proximity labelling but uses antibodies instead of fusion proteins. They use this method to characterize chromatin domains containing specific signature proteins or histone modifications and focus on the composition of chromocenter as well as the chromosome territory containing the hyperactive X-chromosome in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Last but not least they include data that show that RNA is involved in maintaining the integrity of chromatin domains by RNAse treatment and mass spec analysis.</p><p>The technique works well and the results are very clear. I therefore expect that, in the right hands, it is very reproducible.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her appreciation of our work</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are a few points that the authors may want to address:</p><p>1. Title</p><p>'The' role of RNA in the maintenance of chromatin domains as…, seems too much of a statement. The title is therefore an overstatement that needs to be fixed.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree with the reviewer that the title was a bit of an overstatement in the initial version of the manuscript we now feel that it very much reflects the additional findings we present in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 1</p><p>In Figure 1 the authors show very convincingly that the methods works well in their hands. They report on 172 proteins that localized in proximity to CID containing centromeric chromatin but do not provide the list of proteins as far as I can tell. Especially the RNA binders should be named.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extended our discussion of the proteins in proximity to CID focussing on the proteins known to bind RNA. This is especially interesting as many of them have been shown or were at least suggested to play a role in the formation or resolution of R-loops.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2</p><p>Using the hyperactive X is very clever when addressing RNA function but it should be stated in the discussion that there may be certain aspects that are specific to the male x and that is impossible to discriminate general and specific effects uncovered by this method.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence pointing out that we only can not distinguish between a specific and MSL2/rox dependent effect and a general effected caused by the upregulation of transcription on the male X-chromosome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 3</p><p>The authors should state more clearly the new findings of this figure since it is not fully obvious from its current representation.</p></disp-quote><p>Such a detailed analysis of differentially modified chromatin domains has not yet been done in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system and therefore provides a rich resource for further analysis. Moreover, the highly sensitive AMPL-MS method also allowed us to investigate several novel factors involved in splicing and RNA processing that are selectively detected in the neighbourhood of H3K9me3 or H4K16ac containing chromatin, pointing towards a major and general role of RNA in the organisation of chromatin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 4</p><p>These are certainly interesting data but the authors remain in the very descriptive state. This is fine for a methods paper but then, the authors should hypothesize more on what the results mean. Are certain RNA dependent factors specific or general and they then recruit a specific set of factors that fall off upon RNAse treatment as a secondary effect or because they bind RNA directly. I feel like there may be more information that they authors got get out of there data than what they currently provide.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the data carry much more information that we can describe or analyse in a single paper. To dig a bit deeper into the data set we started to characterize the RNA that is specifically enriched in proximity to a particular chromatin domain and investigate a novel and yet unknown centromeric function of the RNA helicase MLE/DHX9 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In fact, we think our finding provides a possible function for the widely observed centromeric transcription. We purpose that stable R-loops might help recruiting helicases such as MLE to the centromere to prevent an excessive formation of a non canonical DNA structure that interferes with the assembly of centromeric nucleosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Discussion</p><p>The authors state: 'While we have not identified the RNAs responsible for the formation of theses domains, we clearly observe that they do confer specificity for the domains as we observe very little overlap in the factors lost from the corresponding domains (Figure 4h). the 'specificity' is hard to determine since factors bound to these regions are different, and therefore different factors will fall off, regardless of whether the RBP are specific unless the RNA is involved in recruiting the factors specifically, which the authors have not shown. Therefore, this result is suggestive and interesting but the statement is too strong and not backed by their results.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of the manuscript we now show that the RNAs composition is different among the two different domains studied. We agree with the reviewer that the data carry much more information that we can describe or analyse in a single paper.

The authors show here that the method can also be used to different nuclear proteins and detect changes in protein complex composition. As it is it is primarily a methods paper, and for that the results are very clear. Gain of new info is not large but it is a useful technique to continue research on this subject and is a nice start of many new avenues into how RNA effects chromatin.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for his/her positive remarks</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4This is a short report featuring an innovative proximity labeling approach to the identification of proteins enriched in distinct types of chromatin domains. The domains compared are centromeric heterochromatin and X-linked hyperactive chromatin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. These are relatively well-described domains, thus serving as an excellent test for the targeting of biotinylation in the permeabilized nucleus via interaction of specific antibodies with ProteinA-Apex2 provided exogenously. In parallel with the signature chromatin proteins CID or MSL2 as baits, the authors also target proteins in proximity to specific histone tail PTMs. Taking the work one step further, they compare the recovery of proteins +/- pretreatment of nuclei with RNase. They conclude that in each case selective interactions are specifically lost with pre-treatment of RNase.</p><p>Major comment:</p><p>As mentioned above, the approach is innovative and raises the possibility of a simpler MS method to identify protein-protein interactions. The RNase result is also provocative. However, in each case the specificity of potentially novel results are not explored further. Thus, the work is of interest but clearly still preliminary.</p><p>Did the authors dig deeper into novel interactions without obtaining convincing validation? Did they conclude that the MS approach is worth pursuing further or not? Admittedly the RNase result is difficult to follow up, but additional discussion of prior related work as well as consideration of future experiments would help improve the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers suggestion we have now further extended our investigation towards the RNA in proximity to the corresponding bait proteins. This allowed us to show that the RNAs in proximity to the baits are indeed transcribed from the DNA that constitutes the chromosomal domains. Together with the proteins found in proximity we hypothesized that the RNAs are involved in the formation of R-loops around the centromer, which we could validate using a new probe for R-loops in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
