ribosomal collisions, thereby triggering pathways for mRNA and nascent peptide degradation and ribosomal rescue. Here we use sucrose gradient fractionation combined with quantitative proteomics to systematically identify proteins associated with collided ribosomes. This approach identified Endothelial differentiation-related factor 1 (EDF1) as a novel protein recruited to collided ribosomes during translational distress. Cryo-electron microscopic analyses of EDF1 and its yeast homolog Mbf1 revealed a conserved 40S ribosomal subunit binding site at the mRNA entry channel near the collision interface. EDF1 recruits the translational repressors GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes to initiate a negative-feedback loop that prevents new ribosomes from translating defective mRNAs. Further, EDF1 regulates an immediate-early transcriptional response to ribosomal collisions. Our results uncover mechanisms through which EDF1 coordinates multiple responses of the ribosome-mediated quality control pathway and provide novel insights into the intersection of ribosome-mediated quality control with global transcriptional regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>quality control</kwd><kwd>ribosomal

coordinate the process of protein synthesis in all cells. Throughout their life-cycle, ribosomes interact with sets of factors, usually proteins, that enable their biogenesis and maturation, impact the initiation and elongation phases of the translational cycle, and coordinate their release and recycling from mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klinge and Woolford, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schuller and Green, 2018</xref>). It is well known that general stresses lead to attenuation of global protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holcik and Sonenberg, 2005</xref>). For example, genetic and environmental insults that generate defective mRNAs and proteins, damage ribosomes, or titrate the levels of accessory factors, perturb translational homeostasis and activate kinases critical for the integrated and ribotoxic stress response pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iordanov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Once triggered, these pathways alter cell fate decisions by either attenuating protein synthesis to alleviate stress and promote cell survival, or activating pro-apoptotic factors that accelerate cell death.</p><p>mRNAs that are damaged or difficult-to-translate cause the lead ribosome to stall irreversibly, resulting in collisions with trailing ribosomes on the same mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ikeuchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Juszkiewicz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matsuo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simms et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies have converged on the idea these collided ribosomes serve as a hub for recruiting a collection of ribosome-mediated quality control (QC) factors that facilitate degradation of the defective mRNAs and partially synthesized peptides, and release of the trapped ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandman and Hegde, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Inada, 2020</xref>). Prompt resolution of ribosomal stalls and removal of partially synthesized proteins are critical for restoring homeostasis, as failure of these processes can lead to cellular protein aggregation and neurodegeneration at the organismal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ishimura et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While the temporal sequence of events that lead to these clearance mechanisms are not well characterized, QC events are thought to be triggered when the composite inter-ribosomal interface between collided ribosomes is recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, ZNF598, which ubiquitylates the ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) RPS10 (eS10) and RPS20 (uS10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garzia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Juszkiewicz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simms et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>). These regulatory ribosomal ubiquitylation marks are thought to trigger a cascade of events that eventually lead to the resolution of ribosomal stalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D'Orazio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ikeuchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Juszkiewicz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matsuo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simms et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Genetic screens have been productively employed to identify a host of factors involved in the QC steps targeting the mRNA and peptides associated with problematic mRNAs for degradation. For example, genome wide screens in yeast identified the endonuclease Cue2 (N4BP2 in mammals) that degrades problematic mRNAs through the No-Go decay pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D'Orazio et al., 2019</xref>), QC factors such as Hel2, Asc1, and Slh1 (ZNF598, RACK1, and ASCC3 in mammals, respectively) involved in the recognition and resolution of stalled ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kuroha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Letzring et al., 2013</xref>), and downstream peptide targeting factors such as Rqc2, Ltn1, and Cdc48 (NEMF, Listerin, and VCP in mammals, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>). Proteomic approaches have also been employed in yeast and mammals to identify ribosome-mediated QC factors, though these have generally relied on candidate-based screens involving affinity purification of known factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garzia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sitron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zuzow et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used sucrose gradient sedimentation and fractionation coupled with quantitative proteomics to systematically characterize the distribution of factors that co-migrate with ribosomal subcomplexes (40S, 60S, 80S and polysomes). This powerful platform identified a core set of ribosome-associated proteins in HCT116 and HEK293 cells under basal growth conditions, and upon induction of transcriptome-wide ribosome collisions. EDF1 was discovered through this approach as a cellular factor that is robustly recruited to polysomes upon conditions that stimulate collisions. Cryo-electron microscopic (Cryo-EM) structures of EDF1 and its highly conserved yeast homolog Mbf1 reveal its binding site at the interface of colliding ribosomes near the mRNA entry channel. We demonstrate that EDF1 plays a central role in facilitating multiple steps associated with ribosome-mediated QC pathways. EDF1 functions upstream of ribosomal stall recognition as its depletion decreases ZNF598-mediated ubiquitylation of eS10 and uS10. Additionally, we show that recruitment of the translational repressors GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes is dependent upon EDF1 and initiates a negative feedback loop that prevents new ribosomes from translating defective mRNAs. Finally, we provide evidence that EDF1 connects ribosome collision events in the cytoplasm to transcriptional responses in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A polysome-proteomics pipeline to identify factors associated with collided ribosomes</title><p>To develop a platform to systematically identify proteins associated with collided ribosomes, we first identified conditions that induce global ribosomal collisions.

We monitored collisions by treating cell lysates with ribonuclease A (RNase A) and resolving ribosomal sub-populations across 10–35% sucrose gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In untreated cells, the majority of polysomes collapsed into monosomes upon RNase A treatment, while in cells treated with low doses of emetine (1.8 µM, 15 min), we observed a significant increase in the fraction of nuclease-resistant disomes (2°) and trisomes (3°).</p><p>Using these optimized conditions, we resolved elongating ribosomes across 10–50% sucrose gradients in the absence of RNase A treatment. Compared to untreated HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, blue trace) we observed a strong increase of ribosome density in the polysomal fractions for cells treated with low dose emetine (1.8 µM, 15 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, orange trace) and less so in cells treated with high dose emetine (360 µM, 15 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, red trace). Individual sucrose gradient fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the distribution of ribosome-mediated QC factors were monitored across the gradient.

Lysates from each sample were quantified (using A260 units) to estimate and optimize reproducibility, and resolved across 10–50% sucrose gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For each sample, 11 individual fractions were collected, digested, labeled with TMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom panel) and subjected to mass-spectrometric (MS) analysis.</p><p>We quantified a total of 4288 proteins across all fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>); 79 of the 80 annotated r-proteins were quantified with the exception being RPL41/eL41 which is small (3.5 kilodaltons) and has no tryptic peptides of sufficient length for detection. Principal component analysis (PCA) analyses of individual fractions showed that fractions 1 through 10 could be separated primarily along one principal component with the densest fraction (fraction 11) being an obvious outlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Because fraction 11 is contaminated with large molecular weight complexes comigrating with deep polysomes and nuclear contaminants we eliminated this fraction from all subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1M</xref>).</p><p>For each fraction we plotted the fold change in the intensity of identified proteins in emetine-treated compared to untreated samples (log<sub>2</sub>(EL/UT), x-axis) against its statistical significance (-log<sub>10</sub>(p-value), y-axis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–1M</xref>). Additionally, we performed unbiased clustering to separate the identified proteins into unique subsets based on their enrichment and distribution along the polysome profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While we see great diversity in the patterns of emetine-dependent enrichment along the various ribosomal subcomplexes (40S, 60S, 80S and polysomes), we chose to focus on a unique cluster of proteins (discussed below) that exhibits continuous increasing enrichment in the log<sub>2</sub>(EL/UT) ratio that tracked with sucrose density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, cluster annotated with asterisk).</p><p>The emetine-dependent enrichment profile of r-proteins served as a benchmark for annotating differential interacting partners among the ribosomal subcomplexes.

Known ribosome-binding proteins or those typically associated with ribosome-bound mRNAs followed the overall abundance profile of r-proteins (shown for LARP1, PABPC4, STAU1, and UPF1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1O</xref>). Proteins that function on distinct ribosomal subcomplexes are also revealed, such as the late stage initiation factor EIF5B which is preferentially enriched in the monosomal (fractions 4–5) but not polysomal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1O</xref>).</p><p>To report on proteins that specifically associate with collided ribosomes, we hypothesized that these proteins should not simply follow the log<sub>2</sub>(EL/UT) trajectory of r-proteins across all fractions, but should instead be enriched in specific fractions relative to r-proteins upon emetine treatment. For example, a few known components of the ribosome-mediated QC machinery such as NEMF and EIF6 were enriched in the monosomal fractions as a function of emetine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–1G</xref>, log<sub>2</sub>(EL/UT)&gt;0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1P</xref>) while cognate ribosome-binding proteins such as LARP1 and UPF1 simply followed the abundance profile of r-proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>, log<sub>2</sub>(EL/UT)&lt;0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1P</xref>). Next, we showed enrichment across the gradient profile for several known ribosome-mediated QC factors (quantitated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Notably, the cap-dependent translational repressors GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 showed little to no enrichment in the lighter fractions, but were substantially enriched in the heavier polysomal fractions; similar trends were observed for the ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) trigger complex (RQT complex), including components TRIP4 and ASCC3. The late stage RQC components, NEMF and VCP, also accumulated along polysomes in an emetine-dependent manner. Interestingly, G3BP1, a component of the USP10 deubiquitylase (DUB) complex that removes ubiquitylation marks on eS10 post ribosomal splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meyer et al., 2020</xref>), was enriched specifically in the 40S fraction of emetine treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>A subset of proteins was particularly enriched (more than 2-fold in terms of fold change) in polysomal fractions of emetine-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H–1L</xref>). The exemplary candidates in this list were EDF1, NACA, BTF3 and TCOF1. TCOF1 (Treacle protein) is a known substrate of the E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase CUL3 that regulates the pseudo-uridylation status of ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Werner et al., 2015</xref>). NACA (nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit alpha) and its binding partner BTF3 (basic transcription factor 3) bind nascent polypeptide chains emerging from the exit tunnel and prevents their mistargeting to the endoplasmic reticulum by the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gamerdinger et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, NACA/BTF3 also function as transcriptional coactivators that regulate the activity of JUN during various differentiation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Addison et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our polysome proteomics workflow provided enrichment maps of a set of ribosome-associated proteins that serve as a platform to decipher the ribosome-interactome under basal growth conditions and upon induction of ribotoxic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Characterization of EDF1 as a novel ribosome-mediated quality control factor</title><p>We focused our attention on EDF1 because it was the most enriched protein in heavy polysome fractions of emetine-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H–1L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1O</xref>). Importantly, previous genetic studies had implicated its yeast homolog Mbf1 in preventing ribosomal frameshifting on iterated rare codon stretches known to trigger ribosome-mediated QC pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We began by looking in more detail at EDF1’s enrichment distribution in our polysome proteomics data set. We were unable to detect EDF1 on 40S, 60S and 80S fractions, but saw strong enrichment ([EL/UT]~7–10) on polysome fractions of emetine-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1O</xref>). We compared the enrichment pattern of EDF1 to the cohort of r-proteins (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1O</xref>) – these analyses indicated that EDF1 was barely present in polysomes of untreated cells ([EDF1<sub>UT, polysomes</sub>] &lt;&lt; [EDF1<sub>EL, polysomes</sub>] resulting in high EDF1 [EL/UT] ratios).</p><p>To validate that EDF1 is recruited to polysomes in a collision-dependent manner, we resolved ribosomes from untreated cells or those treated with low (1.8 µM, 15 min) or high (360 µM, 15 min) doses of emetine across 10–50% sucrose gradients and immunoblotted for EDF1. While little to no EDF1 was detected in polysomal fractions of untreated and high-dose emetine treated cells, EDF1 was strongly recruited to polysomes of cells treated with low-dose emetine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). To test if EDF1 recruitment to polysomes was specific to elongation stalls promoted by emetine, we treated cells with low doses of a distinct elongation inhibitor, anisomycin (0.19 µM, 15 min), and again observed strong recruitment of EDF1 to polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we wanted to ask whether EDF1 accumulated on collided ribosomes under conditions that mimic a physiological response. Recent observations indicate that pyrimidine dimers accumulate in mRNAs of UV-irradiated cells and impede the decoding step of translational elongation leading to transcriptome-wide ribosome collisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, compared to untreated cells, polysomal fractionation of UV-irradiated cells revealed robust recruitment of EDF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>) despite the overall diminished polysome abundance resulting from activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Higgins et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data identify EDF1 as a highly-enriched factor that is recruited to collided ribosomes under conditions of translational distress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Recruitment of EDF1 and GIGYF2 to collided ribosomes is ZNF598 independent</title><p>ZNF598 (Hel2 in yeast) is an early-acting ribosome-mediated QC factor that catalyzes site-specific ubiquitylation of eS10 and uS10 at the collided ribosomal interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Juszkiewicz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simms et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>); while the mechanistic role of eS10 and uS10 ubiquitylation is unclear, it is widely thought to regulate the recruitment other ribosome-mediated QC factors, some of which have well-characterized ubiquitin binding domains. For example, Hel2 in yeast was shown to act upstream of the endonuclease Cue2 (N4BP2 in mammals), which contains four putative ubiquitin binding domains (including the namesake CUE for coupling of ubiquitin binding to ER degradation), and catalyzes the degradation of problematic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D'Orazio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ikeuchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simms et al., 2017</xref>). CUE domains are also present in Cue3 (ASCC2 in mammals) which is a part of the trimeric RQT complex (along with yKR023W and Slh1; known as TRIP4 and ASCC3 respectively in mammals) that promotes dissociation of collided ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matsuo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>). While Ltn1-mediated nascent peptide degradation is compromised in yeast carrying ubiquitin binding mutants of Cue3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>), whether the recruitment of the RQT complex is dependent on Hel2-mediated ubiquitination events is currently unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Juszkiewicz et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, in mammals, ZNF598 was previously shown to associate with the cap-dependent translational initiation repressor EIF4E2 (also called 4EHP) through its binding to the Grb10-interacting GYF protein 2 (GIGYF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garzia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tollenaere et al., 2019</xref>).

This notion of an mRNA headlock provided by EDF1/Mbf1 is further supported by the observation that in the presence of Mbf1, the mRNA follows a path which is distinct from the mRNA path in collided ribosomes in the absence of Mbf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matsuo et al., 2020</xref>).

We conclude that EDF1 and Mbf1 are more likely to be recruited to trailing ribosomes following the initial stalling event. The abnormally long-lived rotated state of the collided ribosome, which is unable to complete the tRNA-mRNA translocation step, may serve as a molecular cue for Mbf1/EDF1 recruitment.

EIF5B, LRRFIP2 and FUS were also enriched to varying degrees on light and heavy polysomes of emetine-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–1D</xref>). As before, we captured significant enrichment of GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 in heavy but not light polysomal fractions of emetine-treated WT samples (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>). These data suggest that translation initiation repressors are predominantly recruited to defective mRNAs with longer queues of collided ribosomes.</p><p>Importantly, comparing WT and ΔEDF1 samples, we found a collection of proteins whose recruitment does depend on EDF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>; upper left quadrant); these data can be contrasted with our previous observation that few proteins depended on ZNF598 for recruitment to colliding ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, upper left quadrant). Among these, we see that the recruitment of GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 to heavy polysomal fractions of emetine-treated samples strongly depended on EDF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The recruitment of LRRFIP2 and FUS to emetine-treated light and heavy polysomes also depended on EDF1, while EIF5B recruitment did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>).</p><p>To further validate our observation that recruitment of GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes relied on EDF1, we immunoblotted sucrose gradient fractions from untreated or emetine-treated WT or ΔEDF1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). GIGYF2 preferentially accumulated in heavier polysomes of emetine-treated WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, left panel); moreover, GIGYF2 was not detected in emetine-treated polysomes of ΔEDF1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, right panel). These observations establish that recruitment of the translational repressors GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes is dependent upon EDF1.</p><p>We next asked whether the EDF1-dependent recruitment of GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes could initiate a negative feedback loop preventing new ribosomes from being loaded onto defective mRNAs. To examine this possibility, we used a previously reported dual fluorescence stall reporter system where GFP and RFP are expressed in frame separated by a ribosome stalling (K<sup>AAA</sup>)<sub>20</sub> sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>). The GFP levels on their own reflect overall reporter mRNA translation while the RFP:GFP ratios reflect the ability of ribosomes to translate through the polyA stall sequence.</p><p>If EDF1 recruits GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes, then its depletion should increase the bulk translational output (as reflected by overall GFP levels) of the polyA-mediated stalling reporter. Indeed, consistent with such a role, loss of EDF1 resulted in a significant increase in GFP fluorescence compared to parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Similarly, GIGYF2•EIF4E2 depletion resulted in the expected increase in GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Moreover, GIGYF2•EIF4E2 depletion only mildly augmented the already increased GFP levels in ΔEDF1 cells. Restoring EDF1 in ΔEDF1 cells reduced GFP levels whereas expression of truncated versions of EDF1 lacking either the N-terminal MBF1 or the C-terminal HTH domain failed to reduce the elevated GFP levels observed in ΔEDF1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The inability of EDF1 truncations to restore translational repression is due to defective ribosome binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B–2C</xref>) consistent with our structural data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) showing that both domains are required for 40S association. By contrast, no significant change in GFP was observed upon loss of ZNF598 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Moreover, the GFP levels observed in ΔEDF1ΔZNF598 lines, without or with GIGYF2•EIF4E2 depletion, reflected those of ΔEDF1 and ΔEDF1•GIGYF2i•EIF4E2i respectively, with no apparent contribution from ZNF598 to the translational repression phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). RFP:GFP ratios in these different genetic backgrounds were consistent with prior studies implicating ZNF598 in preventing readthrough on problematic mRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D–2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, loss of neither EDF1 nor GIGYF2•EIF4E2 affected the bulk translational output of an identical GFP-RFP reporter without the intervening polyA-stalling sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref> for relative GFP intensity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G</xref> for RFP:GFP ratios).</p><p>In an orthogonal set of reporter experiments, loss of EDF1, but not ZNF598, led to an increase in the bulk translation output (as measured by a significant increase in Renilla luciferase (RLuc) activity) on a reporter with an unspliced Xbp1 mRNA (Xbp1u) peptide-pausing sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shanmuganathan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yanagitani et al., 2011</xref>) previously reported to trigger ribosome collisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2H</xref> for relative RLuc activity, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2I</xref> for Fluc:RLuc ratios).

We also observed increased expression of other transcripts including FOS, EGR1, ATF3, TXNIP and DUSP1, all transcriptional and signaling regulators that function in diverse stress response pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Clark, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; p. 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiu et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halazonetis et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Khachigian et al., 1996</xref>, p. 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Slack et al., 2001</xref>). Our initial findings are consistent with a model where ribosomal collisions activate a sustained transcriptional stress response program, with JUN featuring prominently among the upregulated genes.</p><p>We next compared ΔEDF1 and WT cells and looked for genes whose emetine-dependent transcript abundance increase is attenuated by loss of EDF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7E</xref>, 30 min and 120 min). Importantly, transcripts that were differentially regulated between WT and ΔEDF1 lines under basal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) were not among those perturbed by emetine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). At both early and late time points, we found that a relatively small collection of genes showed strong dependence on EDF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>, log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)&lt;0 and -log p<sub>adj</sub> &gt;2, corresponding to the upper left quadrant of the plots). Strikingly, these included the same cohort of genes (JUN, ATF3, DUSP1 and EGR1) that showed robust transcriptional upregulation in response to ribosomal collisions in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>); somewhat less strong dependence on EDF1 was also observed for JUND, FOS and FOSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>). These observations are clarified by the strong overlap (p-value&lt;10<sup>−100</sup>) between transcripts that were upregulated by emetine treatment in WT and ΔEDF1 lines at 30 and 120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>); the transcriptional response is similar, but the levels are attenuated in ΔEDF1 cells.</p><p>Given previous results describing how EDF1 regulates JUN’s transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jindra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miotto and Struhl, 2006</xref>), our results are consistent with a model where EDF1 and JUN coordinate a transcriptional program in response to widespread ribosomal collisions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we combined polysome profiling with quantitative proteomics to generate enrichment maps of a core set of ribosome-associated proteins under basal growth conditions and those recruited during induction of ribosomal collisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our maps revealed a rich landscape of proteins showing differential association with various ribosomal subcomplexes (40S, 60S, 80S and polysomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–1L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>,). Here we focused specifically on factors enriched on collided ribosomes that were likely to contribute to ribosome-mediated QC events; among these, EDF1 was an outstanding candidate.</p><p>EDF1 is a 16.4 kDa protein in humans with a two-domain architecture comprising of an N-terminal multiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBF1) domain and a conserved C-terminal cro/C1-type helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). EDF1 is conserved in eukaryotes and archaea, but not found in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aravind and Koonin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Koning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Takemaru et al., 1997</xref>); the archaeal orthologs of EDF1 retain the C-terminal HTH domain, but the N-terminal MBF1 domain is replaced by a zinc-ribbon domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aravind and Koonin, 1999</xref>). While early characterization of the EDF1 ortholog from <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> revealed that the HTH domain is important for binding the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Takemaru et al., 1997</xref>), later studies of archaeal MBF1 showed that the HTH domain weakly associates with 30S and 70S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blombach et al., 2014</xref>). Given its evolutionary conservation with the archaeal homolog, we suspected that human EDF1 would also associate with ribosomes. However, unlike archaeal MBF1, human EDF1 behaves differently in that it does not readily associate with 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. In fact, little to no association of endogenous EDF1 with polysomes is observed in rapidly growing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). This dynamic however changes upon induction of ribosomal collisions, where we observed robust association of EDF1 with polysomal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–K</xref>). Our experiments showed that recruitment of EDF1 to collided ribosomes requires the presence of RACK1, which is located at the interface of collided ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize how EDF1 associates with collided ribosomes we used cryo-EM to determine structures of EDF1 and its yeast homolog Mbf1 bound to monosomes and polysomes, respectively. EDF1 and Mbf1 bind to a conserved 40S interface strategically positioned at the mRNA entry channel. In addition to its interaction with h16, h18, h33, uS4 and eS30, EDF1/Mbf1 interacts critically with uS3 along the mRNA entry channel. Importantly, genetic screens in yeast have previously identified Mbf1, Asc1 and uS3 as factors critical for suppressing plus one frameshifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Culbertson et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hendrick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wolf and Grayhack, 2015</xref>). While the exact mechanism by which Mbf1 prevents frameshifting will require further functional characterization, our structural studies suggest that EDF1/Mbf1 may use a conserved KKW motif (KKY in Mbf1) and an alpha-helical segment to clamp the mRNA in a headlock-like arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) that prevents frameshifting and stabilizes collided ribosomes. Our functional studies support these observations by showing that loss of EDF1 reduces the efficiency of collision-dependent ZNF598-mediated ubiquitylation of eS10 and uS10 and ZAKα-mediated phosphorylation of the stress-activated protein kinase p38. Based on Mbf1’s binding preference for the trailing collided ribosomes, we propose that the abnormally long-lived rotated state of the collided ribosome, and the proximity of the neighboring ribosome, serve as cues for the recruitment of EDF1/Mbf1.</p><p>Because, ZNF598 facilitates ribosomal stall recognition through ubiquitylation of eS10 and uS10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Juszkiewicz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simms et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>), we predicted that the recruitment of EDF1 and other QC factors would be orchestrated by ZNF598. However, polysome proteomics in ΔZNF598 and ZNF598-OE cell lines surprisingly revealed few proteins whose recruitment to collided ribosomes depended on ZNF598 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). Of particular interest, we found several ribosome-mediated QC factors, some with known ubiquitin-binding domains (such as N4BP2 and members of the RQT complex), to be equivalently enriched on collided ribosomes in ΔZNF598 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). How are these ubiquitin-binding proteins recruited to collided ribosomes? Are there alternate ubiquitylation marks and other E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in the recruitment of ribosome-mediated QC components? We showed that in addition to eS10 and uS10, eS31 (RPS27A) is strongly di-ubiquitylated at lysines 107 and 113 (YY<bold><underline>K</underline></bold>VDENG<bold><underline>K</underline></bold>ISR) in response to emetine-dependent collisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, eS31 is located adjacent to eS10 on the beak of the 40S subunit in close proximity to the disome interface, and its deubiquitylation by USP16 at lysine 113 has recently been implicated in licensing the terminal steps of cytosolic 40S subunit maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Montellese et al., 2020</xref>). While the E3 ligase that ubiquitylates eS31 in response to collisions is not known, our data reveal a rich and diverse set of E3 ligases and deubiquitylases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) that warrant further characterization.</p><p>Important for this EDF1-focused study, our proteomic experiments showed that EDF1’s recruitment to collided ribosomes was ZNF598-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>). Our data also revealed that the recruitment of the translational repressors GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes was ZNF598-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) though these factors have previously been shown to interact with ZNF598 to mediate the translation repression of ARE-element containing cytokine mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tollenaere et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, using complementary interaction analyses, we discovered that GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 were among the top interacting partners of EDF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), and through polysome proteomics, that recruitment of GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes depended strongly on the presence of EDF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). Interestingly, our proteomics data revealed that GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 preferentially co-sedimented with heavier polysomes in response to emetine treatment, distinct from other studies that identified these factors predominantly in lighter polysome fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Timpano and Uniacke, 2016</xref>). We suggest that EDF1 is among the early sensors of ribosomal collisions due to its high copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wiśniewski et al., 2014</xref>). However, if collisions occur stochastically at low levels under basal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, blue trace) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2020</xref>) and are transient in nature, perhaps EDF1 fails to stably bind the composite inter-ribosomal interface efficiently, and therefore fails to recruit GIGYF2•EIF4E2. As collisions lead to terminal ‘dead-end’ stalling of ribosomes, longer ribosomal queues accumulate in the heavier fractions of polysomes, allowing for more efficient recruitment of EDF1 and eventually of GIGYF2•EIF4E2. Such a situation is more likely to occur when the clearance machinery is overwhelmed, as anticipated with cells experiencing abundant collisions.</p><p>Our functional assays established that EDF1-dependent recruitment of the translational repressors GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes initiates a negative feedback loop that prevents new ribosomes from translating certain problematic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2H</xref>). Currently, we do not have evidence for ZNF598-mediated recruitment of GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to these same stall-inducing mRNAs. However, it remains possible that there are semi-redundant mechanisms for recruiting GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 in other situations, or under different environmental perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tollenaere et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hickey et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have established that terminally stalled ribosomes on problematic mRNAs are disassembled by the RQT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D'Orazio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Juszkiewicz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matsuo et al., 2020</xref>). If stalled ribosomes are cleared by the ribosomal rescue machinery, why and when are translational repression complexes recruited to problematic mRNAs? It is possible that when the number of collisions exceed the threshold capacity of the RQT complex, the high local concentration of EDF1 at stalled ribosomes enables recruitment of GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to selectively inhibit translation initiation on these problematic mRNAs. In this capacity, EDF1 functions as a sensor for monitoring the overall extent of ribosomal collisions in the cell. In considering these balances it seems plausible that cell lines tune the expression levels of the ribosomal rescue and translational repression machineries depending on their translational output and capacity. For example, in cell lines where ribosomal rescue is efficient, there may be more modest demands on translational repression and vice versa. To begin to think about these possibilities, we compared expression levels of the rescue and repression machineries across the proteome of 375 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nusinow et al., 2020</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org">https://depmap.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Reassuringly, the expression levels of the translational repression complex (EDF1 and GIGYF2) and the ribosomal rescue machinery (ASCC2 and ASCC3) show strong correlation across cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). By contrast, the expression profiles of both EDF1 and GIGYF2 show modest but significant anti-correlation with the ASCC3-complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data hint at the possibility of cell-specific tuning of these various mechanisms for controlling expression of proteins from problematic mRNAs.</p><p>While our study defined a multifaceted role for EDF1 in promoting different arms of the ribosome-mediated QC pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), previous studies of EDF1 and its orthologs in yeast, plants, flies and mammals had identified a role for this factor as a transcriptional coactivator that enhances the transcriptional response of select bZIP transcription factors (such as JUN and GCN4) in response to environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jaimes-Miranda and Chávez Montes, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jindra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kabe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miotto and Struhl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Takemaru et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Takemaru et al., 1997</xref>). Our transcriptomics data reveal that ribosome collisions trigger a transcriptional response with a strong and sustained JUN signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>). We speculate that this sustained response may in part be driven by JUN autoregulating its own transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angel et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wisdom et al., 1999</xref>). More importantly for this study, we find that the collision-dependent transcriptional response strongly depends on EDF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>). The cohort of stress-induced genes that show robust transcriptional upregulation in response to ribosomal collisions are transcriptionally attenuated in the absence of EDF1, with JUN exhibiting the most significant dampening. Given previous results describing how EDF1 stabilizes JUN, and amplifies its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jindra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miotto and Struhl, 2006</xref>), our results are consistent with a model where an EDF1•JUN nexus coordinates a transcriptional response to ribosomal collisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Though our study established that EDF1 localizes on collided ribosomes, we did not identify JUN itself enriched on colliding ribosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), and observed only a modest enrichment of JUN (~1.6 fold) in proximity-labeling analyses of EDF1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). While it is possible that the cross-talk between EDF1 and JUN occurs through direct coupling between these two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jindra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miotto and Struhl, 2006</xref>), it could also be regulated through JUN N-terminal kinases (JNKs) which associate with ribosomes through RACK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">López-Bergami et al., 2005</xref>) and have recently been shown to be activated by ZAKα through direct interactions with colliding ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these data reveal a new paradigm for ribotoxic stress responses that originate in the cytoplasm on colliding ribosomes, and trigger an EDF1-dependent transcriptional response with a strong JUN signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). It will be interesting moving forward to define the sequence of events, on and off the ribosome, that lead to signal transduction across the nuclear-cytoplasmic boundary.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

CRISPR knockout and over-expression lines derived from parental backgrounds are listed in the Key Resources Table. Cell lines were tested, and reported to be negative for mycoplasma contamination. All cell lines were thawed and grown for more than two passages prior to any experiment. Unless otherwise stated, HEK293 and HCT116 cell lines and their variants were grown in DMEM (high glucose, pyruvate, and L-Glutamine) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), maintained in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator and passaged every 2–3 days. siRNA knockdown experiments involved two siRNA transfections on consecutive days at a concentration of 10–25 nM siRNA per day, using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. All expression plasmid transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. siRNA and plasmid co-transfections (when applicable) were performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Generation of ΔEDF1 knockout lines</title><p>EDF1 knockout lines were constructed using a CRISPR/Cas9 approach.

The next day, each well was transfected with one of the plasmids containing an EDF1 sgRNA, or a control vector containing no sgRNA. On the following day, wells were treated with 0.95 µg/ml puromycin. After 4 days of selection, cells were taken off puromycin and replaced with fresh DMEM, and allowed to grow for 1-4 more days, at which point they were trypsinized and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1 cell per well. Single colonies (verified by eye) were grown to confluency and transferred to larger plates until they were able to be frozen. Potential ΔEDF1 lines were lysed, tested by immunoblotting against an anti-EDF1 antibody, and confirmed ΔEDF1 lines were frozen.

If frozen, emetine stocks were thawed and equilibrated to room temperature before use. Anisomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) stock solutions were prepared to 94.2 mM (25 mg/ml) in DMSO and frozen at −20 °C. HCT116 or HEK293 cells were seeded at 2–4 million cells per 100 mm TC plate and allowed to grow for 48 hr.

Statistically significant genes were chosen based on a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value of 0.01.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Colin Wu for thoughtful discussions and critical reading of this manuscript; members of the Green lab, especially Jamie Wangen, for advice and helpful feedback throughout; Dr. Aitor Garzia and Dr. Thomas Tuschl for their kind gift of the HEK293 Flp-In T-Rex ΔZNF598 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garzia et al., 2017</xref>); Dr. Andrew Holland and Gina Lomastro for sharing the pLentiCRISPRv2 plasmid and assistance generating the ΔEDF1 and ΔEDF1ΔZNF598 cell lines; Dr. Shintaro Iwasaki for sharing the psiCHECK2-Renilla-2A-3xFLAG-MsXbp1u-2A-Firefly plasmid; Dr. Elizabeth J Grayhack for initial reagents for Mbf1; Dr. Otto Berninghausen for cryo-EM data collection; Lauren DeVine and Dr. Robert N Cole at the JHMI Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Facility for mass-spec support.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>eLife, reviewing editor; advisory board member for Moderna, Inc, FL63, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>J.W.H. is a reviewing editor, eLife, a founder and advisory board member for Caraway Therapeutics, Inc, and an advisor for X-Chem Inc.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>E.J.B is an advisor and scientific advisory board member for Plexium</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-58828-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw mass spectrometry data associated with the following Figures have been deposited in MassIVE repository: Source data for all proteomics-based plots are provided in Source data tables.Figure 1, Figure 1-figure supplement 1: MSV000085423; Figure 2, Figure 2-figure supplement 1: MSV000085419; Figure 2-figure supplement 2A: MSV000085422; Figure 2H, Figure 2-figure supplement 2F: MSV000085425; Figure 5A: MSV000085424; Figure 5B, Figure 5-figure supplement 1B-1C: MSV000085421; Figure 6B-6C, Figure 6-figure supplement 1: MSV000085420.

(Endothelial differentiation-related factor 1. in other species termed, MBF1; Multiprotein-bridging factor 1), which is known as a transcriptional co-activator that links between TATA-box-binding proteins and sequence-specific transcription factors to activate transcription of downstream genes, is recruited to collided ribosomes during translational distress, and engender a transcriptional response to ribotoxic stress. The paper concludes that EDF1 binds collided ribosomes, recruits translational repressors GIGYF2/EIF4E2, and initiates a transcriptional response. Thus, the transcriptional coactivation is likely to be mediated through ribosome collisions. The paper provides the first structure of a ribosome collision sensor.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;EDF1 binds collided ribosomes, recruits translational repressors GIGYF2/EIF4E2 and initiates a transcriptional response&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Nahum Sonenberg as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors show that EDF1 as a novel protein recruited to collided ribosomes during translational distress, and report the transcriptional response to ribotoxic stress. They demonstrated that (1) RACK1, but not ZNF598 is required for the recruitment of EDF1 to collided ribosomes. (2) ZNF598-mediated ubiquitylation of eS10 and uS10 and ZAKα-mediated phosphorylation of p38 by the emetine treatment is moderately reduced in the EDF1-KO cells. (3) EDF1 recruits GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes and is required for the increase of JUN, ATF3 mRNAs by emetine treatment. Based on these results, the authors propose that EDF1 binds collided ribosomes, recruits translational repressors GIGYF2/EIF4E2, and initiates a transcriptional response. EDF1 has been reported to be involved in transcription coactivation of the JUN-mediated response, thus the coactivation is likely to be mediated through ribosome collisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) The reduction of ribosome stalling by K(AAA)20 and XBP1u in ZNF598 KO is dependent on EDF1 (Figure 3 and Figure 5E). In ribosome stalling by K(AAA)20, the ZNF598-independent function of EDF1 is dependent on GIGYF2•EIF4E2 (Figure 5E). It is necessary to confirm that EDF also functions in ribosome stalling on XBP1u mRNA in ZNF598-independent but GIGYF2•EIF4E2-independent manner.</p><p>(2) ZNF598-mediated ubiquitylation of eS10 and uS10 and ZAKα-mediated phosphorylation of p38 by emetine treatment is moderately reduced in the EDF1-KO cells. However, EDF1 slightly represses ribosome stalling by K(AAA)20 and XBP1u in the presence of ZNF598 (Figure 3 and Figure 5E). This may be due to the reduced association of ZNF598 in the EDF1-KO cells.

Therefore, ZNF598 would have been the most obvious candidate for direct binding and recruitment of GIGYF2 and via that 4EHP to the stalled ribosome. In fact, the recent findings of Weissman's group (GIGYF2 and 4EHP Inhibit Translation Initiation of Defective Messenger RNAs to Assist Ribosome-Associated Quality Control. bioRxiv) support that hypothesis.

The authors then went on to explore the role of its recruitment in quality control and transcriptional response to ribotoxic stress. Human EDF1 and its homologues (called MBF1 in most organisms) have been extensively studied for their role in transcription in stress responses; they bind TATA-binding protein and bridge an interaction with transcription factors. Recently, however, yeast Mbf1 has been shown to likely associate with ribosomes through interactions with Asc1. The factor is also required to maintain reading frame of the ribosome during stalling. Furthermore, the archaeal homologue interacts with the 30S and 70S ribosome subunits.</p><p>In this study, the authors expand on this ribosome-centric role of the human factor, and provide some insights into how these two seemingly unrelated functions of the factor might be coordinated by collided ribosomes. They found the factor to be required for recruiting the translation-initiation inhibitors GIGYF2/EIF4E2 to problematic mRNAs that stall the ribosome to inhibit initiation on them. Interestingly, the factor has been implicated in transcription coactivation of JUN-mediated response, and the authors in this paper show that this coactivation is likely to be mediated through ribosome collisions.</p><p>Overall, I thought the paper provided some important details about the role of EDF1 in quality control and transcriptional regulation. I found the data on its recruitment to collided ribosomes and its requirement for RACK1 to be especially convincing. Having said that, for certain parts I felt the authors overinterpreted the data. This is especially true for the effect of the factor on Znf598 and frameshifting. Below I summarize my concerns that I feel need to be addressed before the paper can be published:</p><p>1) I was curious as to why the authors did not carry out MS or western-blotting analyses on sucrose-gradient fractions of ribosomes treated with high concentration of emetine. Did I miss that data? Also does the factor remain on polysomes following RNAse treatment.</p><p>2) It is not clear to me how the data in Figure 3A report on frameshifting. Is Fluc out of frame with Rluc? Shouldn't EDF1 deletion promote more readthrough, unless fluc is in frame. In that case, a different reporter is needed. In yeast deletion of Mbf1 on its own is sufficient to promote frameshifting.</p><p>3) I found the data on ribosomal protein ubiquitination not convincing. The changes in the levels of ubiquitinated ribosomal proteins seem small. If EDF1 indeed affects ZNF598 function, one would expect its deletion to have a similar effect on the stalling reporter.</p><p>4) Does the immunoprecipitation shown in Figure 4 work for ribosome-bound factor; is the antibody capable of recognizing the factor when it associates with the ribosome? More important, does the BirA-fused protein associate with the collided ribosomes? Does it rescue the ∆EDF1 cells?</p><p>5) Why did the authors keep changing between using siRNAs and ∆EDF1?</p><p>6) Could the authors speculate on why the deletion of ZNF598 results in less translation of the reporter (Figure 2G)? What were the GFP fluorescence values normalized to? The data in Figure 5E shows opposite results. Deletion of the factor results in slight increase of GFP in this case.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors identified EDF1 as a novel protein recruited to collided ribosomes during translational distress with proteomics combined with sucrose gradient fractionation.

In summary, we have tested the role of EDF1 (and ZNF598) in translation repression of the XBP1u stalling reporter. Consistent with results from the polyA-mediated stalling reporter (Figure 6E of revised manuscript), we show that loss of EDF1, but not ZNF598, leads to an increase in the bulk translation output from the XBP1u-stalling reporter (Figure 6—figure supplement 2H). Together, these data indicate that EDF1-dependent recruitment of the translational repressors GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to problematic mRNAs functions broadly on the multiple ribosome-stalling sequences that we tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) ZNF598-mediated ubiquitylation of eS10 and uS10 and ZAKα-mediated phosphorylation of p38 by emetine treatment is moderately reduced in the EDF1-KO cells.

This possibility could be examined by the determination of the distribution of ZNF598 in the EDF1-KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise two interesting points here. The first point demands an explanation for the modest decrease in the readthrough ratio (RFP/GFP or Fluc/RLuc) from our stalling reporters in EDF1ZNF598 compared to ZNF598 lines (Figure 6-figure supplement 2D and Figure 6-figure supplement 2I). We argue that the decrease in readthrough ratio in the double knockout (DKO) lines is due to EDF1-mediated loss of translational repression in addition to ZNF598-mediated defective stall recognition in these lines – the cumulative effect of the two phenotypes is an increase in both upstream GFP and downstream RFP (or RLuc and Fluc) levels in the DKO lines. Depletion of ZNF598 increases RFP (and Fluc) levels (reflecting increased readthrough) with no effect on the upstream GFP (and RLuc) resulting in higher RFP/GFP ratios (Figure 6E and Figure 6—figure supplement 2D and Figure 6—figure supplement 2H-2I). Thus, while ZNF598 prevents readthrough on problematic mRNAs, it does not contribute towards translation repression on these mRNAs.</p><p>To address the second point, we include data in Figure 2—figure supplement 2G of the revised manuscript. There we quantify ZNF598 recruitment to polysomes as a function of EDF1 in response to emetine treatment and observed a modest (~10-20%) decrease in ZNF598 levels. These data are consistent with our observations of a moderate reduction in the ability of ZNF598 to ubiquitylate eS10 and uS10 in ∆EDF1 cells (Figure 2G). In light of these overall modest effects, we have stated our conclusions more softly in this section of the revised manuscript: “we conclude that that loss of EDF1 compromises, but is not essential for, ZNF598-mediated ubiquitylation of eS10 and uS10”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) EDF1 recruits GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes and is required for the increase of JUN, ATF3 mRNAs by the emetine treatment (Figure 5D and Figure 6).

It should be examined whether the JUN, ATF3 mRNAs are increased by emetine treatment when EDF1 is not recruited to the collided ribosomes, like the RACK1-KO background.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this idea. Our data clearly suggest that EDF1 coordinates distinct arms of the ribotoxic stress response pathway; first, we show that EDF1 recruits GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes to initiate translational repression on problematic mRNAs (Figure 6); second, we show that EDF1 is critical for activating the transcriptional response to ribosomal collisions (Figure 7). The reviewers are interested here in an experiment that asks whether EDF1 functions on the colliding ribosome for both of these roles and suggests that the RACK1-KO background might be useful for this. We are concerned however that RACK1 is too centrally involved in all aspects of these pathways – from sitting at the interface of the collision and regulating ribosome-mediated QC to its known functions in recruiting JNKs and activating downstream signaling cascades. What is needed for this smart experiment is a ribosome binding defective EDF1 variant, and another large set of RNA-sequencing experiments – we would prefer to address this question in a subsequent study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors need to show that EDF1-fusion proteins behave like the native one (i.e. associate with collided ribosomes, activates JUN, and other properties).</p></disp-quote><p>We are a bit confused by this concern as the only experiment in the original manuscript that depended on an EDF1-fusion protein was the proximity-dependent ligation assay (Figure 5B of the revised manuscript), the results of which strongly correlated with affinity purification/mass spectrometry of endogenous EDF1 reported in Figure 5A.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have since performed new experiments in cell lines stably over-expressing C-terminally Strep-II-tagged EDF1 (EDF1-Strep II) and are able to show that EDF1-Strep II is (1) recruited to polysomes following low-dose emetine treatment (Figure 6—figure supplement 2C), and (2) rescues the loss of translational repression phenotype observed in ∆EDF1 cells with the poly A-mediated stall reporter (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A).</p><p>For cryo-EM studies reported in the revised manuscript (Figure 3), we overexpressed N-terminal 3X-FLAG tagged EDF1 (FLAG-EDF1) in HEK293 cells.

We pursued this experiment since Grayhack and colleagues (Wang et al., 2018) had clearly shown an increase in frameshifting in yeast lacking the EDF1 homolog, Mbf1. Our struggle with this experiment was in finding a reporter to use for a frameshifting experiment in mammalian cells. In our hands, poly(A) reporters are not suitable as they undergo so much slipping that there is no frame to report on. Iterated CGA codons are not problematic in mammalian cells, so these are not suitable either. We initially hoped that our loss in output (FLuc/RLuc) on the Xbp1u reporter reflected movement into a different frame and thus reflected a result consistent with Grayhack’s earlier work. However, we have now constructed Xbp1 reporters with FLuc in the +1 frame and the results are not as anticipated (that is, we do not observe +1 frameshifting of ribosomes in an ∆EDF1 background). We suspect the Xbp1u peptide stall is either too strong or the sequence itself is not amenable to frameshifting. We are left with no reporter to currently evaluate frameshifting in mammalian cells but assume, given the strong similarities between these proteins, that they function equivalently in these two systems. We have chosen to not include these biochemical data in the new version of the manuscript.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we solved cryo-EM structures of Mbf1 bound to a collided ribosome (Figure 4), which enabled us to rationalize how Mbf1/EDF1 may preventing frameshifting on stalling sequences. Mbf1/EDF1 binds a conserved 40S interface at the mRNA entry channel. In this position, EDF1/Mbf1 uses a conserved KKW motif (KKY in Mbf1) with the aromatic residue positioned to interact with the mRNA in the entry channel. In collaboration with an α-helical segment that immediately follows this KKW motif, Mbf1/EDF1 clamps the mRNA in a headlock-like arrangement (Figure 4C) that is likely to prevent frameshifting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Some of the claims for the role of EDF1 in recruiting ZNF598 need to be tuned down.</p></disp-quote><p>First, there are clearly strong previous studies about ZNF598 and its role in recruiting GIGYF2 to initiate translational repression of specific sub-classes of mRNAs (Morita et al., 2012; Garzia et al., 2019, Tollenaere., et al., 2019). Importantly, we do not rule out the possibility that semi-redundant mechanisms for the recruitment of the translational repression machinery exist, and that ZNF598 recruits GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 in other situations, or under different environmental perturbations.</p><p>Additionally, there is a recent preprint from the Weissman group (Hickey et al., 2019) – in this manuscript, the authors argue that ZNF598 is potentially important for recruiting GIGYF2 in the context of ribosomes collisions, though they acknowledge that they cannot exclude that other factors are also critical. In our manuscript, we believe that our data support a model wherein recruitment of GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes to initiate translational repression is driven by EDF1, with no measurable contribution from ZNF598.

Our initial observation of the decrease in eS10 ubiquitylation (Figure 2G) and p38 phosphorylation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2H) was made upon partial depletion of EDF1 using siRNAs. All subsequent analyses of EDF1, including the validation of the eS10-ubiquitylation depletion phenotype (Figure 2H), polysome proteomics (Figure 6B-6C, Figure 6—figure supplement 1), stalling reporter assays (Figure 6E and Figure 6—figure supplement 2) and transcriptomics (Figure 7) were performed in the ∆EDF1 knockout background.</p><p>We also acknowledge that the use of different drugs was confusing and in this case underscore that we were limited by COVID-forced termination of lab work. In our initial manuscript, the activation of c-JUN in response to ribosome collisions (Figure 7A) was performed using a different translational elongation inhibitor, deoxynivalenol, as opposed to emetine. We have now replaced the deoxynivalenol titration with emetine titration – our results are consistent with those noted for deoxynivalenol – intermediate but not high doses of both deoxynivalenol and emetine induce ribosomal collisions and activate c-JUN. We have substituted this new Figure 7A in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We include the unabridged comments of the 3 referees for better explanation of the revisions required, and for those expected in follow up work.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Ribosome quality control is an important mechanism responsible for resolving stalled ribosomes in eukaryotic cells.

Our polysome proteomics and immunoblotting analyses (Figure 6) indicate that the recruitment of GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to sites of transcriptome-wide collisions is dependent on EDF1 and that these factors are together found preferentially in deep rather than light fractions. Our experiments, however, are distinct from earlier ones in using emetine to promote transcriptome-wide collisions rather than more subtle perturbations such as those that may occur during physioxia (Timpano and Uniacke, 2016) or basal growth conditions (Garzia et al., 2019).</p><p>We suggest that there could be several reasons to explain why GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 are not found in lighter fractions. First, while we do think EDF1 could be among the early responders of ribosomal collisions due to its high cellular abundance (Wisniewski et al., 2014), if collisions are transient, perhaps EDF1 is unable to engage the collided ribosomes efficiently at first, and therefore does not effectively recruit GIGYF2•EIF4E2. As collisions lead to terminal “dead-end” stalling of ribosomes, longer ribosomal queues are expected to accumulate in heavier fractions of polysomes, thus potentially allowing more efficient recruitment of EDF1 and subsequent recruitment of GIGYF2•EIF4E2. Such a situation is more likely to occur when the clearance machinery is overwhelmed as anticipated with cells experiencing abundant collisions.</p><p>We now discuss these possibilities in the Discussion section of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also interesting to know why GIGYF2/4EHP stays associated with a stalled ribosome in WT cells, long enough to be detected by polysome profiling.

It is also possible that such mRNA decay pathways are overwhelmed under conditions that induce transcriptome-wide collisions. These possibilities may have contributed to a window that enabled us to enrich for EDF1, GIGYF2•EIF4E2 and other QC factors on heavier polysomal fractions of collided ribosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- GIGYF2 and 4EHP recruitment to the stalled ribosome are claimed to be dependent on EDF1 but independent of ZNF598.

The authors need to address this discrepancy. How does EDF1 do that? Does it also have a PPGL motif, which directly binds to the GYF motif on GIGYF2?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. Our finding that the recruitment of GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to sites of stalled ribosomes depends on EDF1, instead of ZNF598, was initially surprising. We are, however, confident in our data and in rationalizing the apparent discrepancies.</p><p>First: Our polysome proteomics experiment in ∆ZNF598 cells provided initial evidence that the recruitment of several quality control factors, including EDF1 and GIGYF2, to collided ribosomes was ZNF598-independent (Figure 2). Moreover, similar polysome proteomics experiments in ∆EDF1 cells provided strong evidence that the recruitment of GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to sites of stalled ribosomes is EDF1-dependent (Figure 6A-6D, Figures 6—figure supplement 1A-1D). These results were consistent with affinity purification experiments revealing GIGYF2•EIF4E2 as strong interacting partners of EDF1 (Figure 5A-5B).</p><p>Second: In experiments reporting on bulk translational output from polyA- (Figure 6E) and Xbp1u (Figure 6—figure supplement 2H) stalling reporters, we show that loss of EDF1 and GIGYF2•EIF4E2, but not ZNF598, lead to loss of translational repression. We further provide new evidence showing that re-expression of EDF1 rescues the loss of translational repression observed in ∆EDF1 cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). Importantly, loss of ZNF598 had no effect on translational repression on either the polyA- or the Xbp1u stalling reporter (Figures 6E and Figure 6—figure supplement 1H). Together, our results are consistent only with a role for EDF1 in mediating GIGYF2•EIF4E2 repression in our system.</p><p>Third: Yes – it will be important to figure out the molecular interaction between EDF1 and GIGYF2. EDF1 does not have a PPPPGL motif like ZNF598, which could directly bind to the GYF motif on GIGYF2. We now have a structure of Mbf1 bound to the colliding ribosome (Figure 3 and Figure 4 of the revised manuscript) and we anticipate that these structures will help us identify mutations in EDF1 that block ribosome binding and GIGYF2 interaction.</p><p>The next issue is how to address the paper by Hickey et al., 2019.</p><p>Experiments reported in Figure 4 of Hickey et al., report on the effect of ZNF598, GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 on translational repression on non-stop and no-go reporters.</p><p>First, consistent with results reported in our manuscript, the authors report that CRISPRi-mediated depletion of GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 resulted in loss of translational repression on a polyA-mediated stalling reporter (as observed by an increase in BFP levels). Depletion of ZNF598 in Hickey et al., however, has no effect on translational repression of the polyA-reporter, consistent with our data showing that ZNF598 is not involved in recruiting the translational repression machinery to poly-A stalling reporters.</p><p>Second, the authors do see effects of ZNF598 depletion on a non-stop reporter (Figure 4A and 4C): however, these effects are partial and do not phenocopy the loss of translational repression observed with GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 depletion. This partial phenotype may either be due to incomplete depletion of ZNF598 by CRISPRi, or due to redundancy in factors that are capable of recruiting GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes.</p><p>Third, the interaction studies reported by Hickey et al. are different from ours as they do not report on the ZNF598 interactome in the context of ribosomal collisions. The ZNF598-3XFLAG affinity purification reported in Hickey et al., 2019 (Figure S2) and in Garzia et al., (2019) were both performed under overexpression conditions and simply report on co-interactors of ZNF598 under basal growth conditions.</p><p>We now acknowledge in our revised manuscript that semi-redundant mechanisms for the recruitment of the translational repression machinery may exist, and that ZNF598 may recruit GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 in other situations, or under different environmental perturbations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Sinha and colleagues used quantitative mass-spec approaches to identify EDF1 as a factor that is recruited to collided ribosomes.

They found the factor to be required for recruiting the translation-initiation inhibitors GIGYF2/EIF4E2 to problematic mRNAs that stall the ribosome to inhibit initiation on them. Interestingly, the factor has been implicated in transcription coactivation of JUN-mediated response, and the authors in this paper show that this coactivation is likely to be mediated through ribosome collisions.</p><p>Overall, I thought the paper provided some important details about the role of EDF1 in quality control and transcriptional regulation. I found the data on its recruitment to collided ribosomes and its requirement for RACK1 to be especially convincing. Having said that, for certain parts I felt the authors overinterpreted the data. This is especially true for the effect of the factor on Znf598 and frameshifting. Below I summarize my concerns that I feel need to be addressed before the paper can be published:</p><p>1) I was curious as to why the authors did not carry out MS or western-blotting analyses on sucrose-gradient fractions of ribosomes treated with high concentration of emetine. Did I miss that data? Also does the factor remain on polysomes following RNAse treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>These are important points. The high concentration emetine is an important control that was lacking in our initial draft. We have now included the high-emetine treatment to monitor the distribution of EDF1 along the sucrose gradient under different concentration regimes of emetine (Figure 1I). We report that while little to no EDF1 was detected in polysomal fractions of untreated and high-dose emetine treated cells, EDF1 was strongly recruited to polysomes of cells treated with low-dose emetine (Figure 1I). For cost and instrumentation time reasons, we opted not to include the high-emetine samples in our polysome proteomics experiment.</p><p>As for the potential association with colliding ribosomes per se, we are unable to detect interaction between EDF1 and colliding ribosomes following digestion of lysates with RNaseA. While a minor fraction of EDF1 remains associated with nuclease-resistant disomes and trisomes following RNase A digestion, the majority of EDF1 shifts to monosomal and RNP fractions. In our revised manuscript, we include cryo-EM structures of Mbf1 binding to colliding yeast ribosomes. This structure reveals Mbf1 making extensive contacts with helices 16, 18, and 33 (Figure 3) of the 18S rRNA (Figure 3D-3E of revised manuscript). Details about these interactions are discussed in the revised manuscript – we suspect that some of these RNA binding interfaces between EDF1 and the colliding ribosome are sensitive to RNaseA digestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear to me how the data in Figure 3A report on frameshifting. Is Fluc out of frame with Rluc? Shouldn't EDF1 deletion promote more readthrough, unless fluc is in frame. In that case, a different reporter is needed. In yeast deletion of Mbf1 on its own is sufficient to promote frameshifting.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the experiment in Figure 3A was unclear and difficult to interpret. We performed additional experiments which are inconsistent with our previous interpretation, and have now removed this figure (and section) as suggested by the reviewer. We have provided a more detailed discussion above (Essential revisions, point 4, second section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I found the data on ribosomal protein ubiquitination not convincing. The changes in the levels of ubiquitinated ribosomal proteins seem small. If EDF1 indeed affects ZNF598 function, one would expect its deletion to have a similar effect on the stalling reporter.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment. The decrease in collision-dependent eS10 and uS10 ubiquitylation that we observe in the absence of EDF1 is modest (but reproducible).</p><p>Our initial observation of the reduced ubiquitylation phenotype (Figure 2G) with partial depletion of EDF1 (using siRNAs) prompted us to probe this effect further in ∆EDF1 cell lines using a targeted mass-spectrometry approach (Figure 2H) – these data confirmed that eS10 ubiquitylation at K138/139 was indeed affected in ∆EDF1 lines. Moreover, this phenotype was recapitulated with different clonal populations of ∆EDF1 under physiological conditions (UV-treatment) that induce ribosome collisions (Figure 2—figure supplement 2E). In each case, however, the reduction in ubiquitination is partial, and thus EDF1 is not essential for the recruitment of ZNF598.</p><p>We suspected that the decrease in eS10 ubiquitylation is due to reduced efficiency of ZNF598 recruitment or its stability on collided ribosomes in ∆EDF1 cells. Indeed, when we quantitated ZNF598 abundance on polysomes of ∆EDF1 cells in response to emetine treatment, we observed a modest (10-20%) decrease in ZNF598 protein levels (included now as Figure 2—figure supplement 2G), which is consistent with the modest decrease in eS10 ubiquitylation at K138/139 (Figure 2I).</p><p>In light of the reviewer’s comment and our new quantitation of the ZNF598 interaction, we have softened our conclusions based on this new perspective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Does the immunoprecipitation shown in Figure 4 work for ribosome-bound factor; is the antibody capable of recognizing the factor when it associates with the ribosome? More important, does the BirA-fused protein associate with the collided ribosomes? Does it rescue the ∆EDF1 cells?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. The polyclonal antibody against EDF1 was raised against an antigen comprising amino acids 98-148, which includes the C-terminal HTH domain. Since the HTH domain is required for ribosome association (Figure 3), we were concerned that the antibody would only recognize EDF1 and its associated binding partners off the ribosome; however, r-proteins and translational initiation/elongation factors accounted for a significant proportion of proteins robustly interacting with EDF1– these are indicated in Figure 5A (60S r-proteins indicated in blue, 40S r-protein in orange) and in Figure 5—source data 1. Based on these data, we conclude that ribosome-bound EDF1 is recognized by the antibody.</p><p>The complementary proximity ligation experiment with BirA*-tagged EDF1 was performed in the absence of emetine (for technical reasons). Since EDF1 does not associate with ribosomes in the absence of collisions, as anticipated, we saw no enrichment of r-proteins in our Bio-ID experiment (Figure 5B). We have not tested whether BirA*-tagged EDF1 sediments with colliding ribosomes or can rescue the translational repression phenotype in ∆EDF1 cells using our poly-A stalling reporter. However, we have performed additional experiments with EDF1-Strep II fusion variants which associate with collided ribosomes and rescue the defect in translational repression. We have provided a detailed discussion above (Essential revisions, point 4, first section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why did the authors keep changing between using siRNAs and ∆EDF1?</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this point above and apologize for the confusion (Essential revisions, point 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Could the authors speculate on why the deletion of ZNF598 results in less translation of the reporter (Figure 2G)? What were the GFP fluorescence values normalized to? The data in Figure 5E shows opposite results. Deletion of the factor results in slight increase of GFP in this case.</p></disp-quote><p>While there are several possibilities, we speculate that the differences in relative GFP intensities in the ∆ZNF598 backgrounds between Figure 2G (in HCT116 cells) and Figure 6E (in HEK293-FlpIn-TRex cells) arose from cell-specific backgrounds with differences resulting from transient overexpression of the reporter and in overall differences in translational capacity and quality control processes. We prefer not to overinterpret these small changes, as this point is not critical for any of the main conclusions in this study.</p><p>Because of the semi-redundant nature of these experiments and the space constraints arising from new cryo-EM data, we removed Figure 2G from the original draft in our revised manuscript – we consider this change to be minor and to have no impact on any main conclusions in this study.</p><p>For all conditions, the mean GFP fluorescence intensities (obtained from 10000 individual events, 48 hours following reporter transfection) were normalized to the mean fluorescence intensity of the parental (WT) cell line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors identified EDF1 as a novel protein recruited to collided ribosomes during translational distress with proteomics combined with sucrose gradient fractionation. They demonstrated that (1) RACK1, but ZNF598 is required for the recruitment of EDF1 to collided ribosomes. (2) ZNF598-mediated ubiquitylation of eS10 and uS10 and ZAKa-mediated phosphorylation of p38 by the emetine treatment is moderately reduced in the EDF1-KO cells. (3) EDF1 recruits GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes and is required for the increase of JUN, ATF3 mRNAs by the emetine treatment. Based on these results, the authors propose that EDF1 binds collided ribosomes, recruits translational repressors GIGYF2/EIF4E2, and initiates a transcriptional response.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The reduction of ribosome stalling by K(AAA)20 and XBP1u in ZNF598 KO is dependent on EDF1 (Figure 3 and Figure 5E). In ribosome stalling by K(AAA)20, the ZNF598-independent function of EDF1 is dependent on GIGYF2•EIF4E2 (Figure 5E). It is necessary to confirm that EDF also functions in ribosome stalling on XBP1u mRNA in ZNF598-independent but GIGYF2•EIF4E2-independent manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. As discussed above (Essential revisions, point 1), we have now tested the role of EDF1 (and ZNF598) in translation repression using a <italic>Renilla</italic>-2A-3xFLAG-Xbp1u-2A-Firefly reporter and a corresponding version without the intervening stalling sequence. These data have now been included in Figure 6—figure supplement 2H-2I of the revised manuscript and nicely provide an additional handle on the role of EDF1 in promoting translational repression on the multiple ribosome-stalling sequences that we tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) ZNF598-mediated ubiquitylation of eS10 and uS10 and ZAKa-mediated phosphorylation of p38 by the emetine treatment is moderately reduced in the EDF1-KO cells. However, EDF1 slightly represses ribosome stalling by K(AAA)20 and XBP1u in the presence of ZNF598 (Figure 3 and Figure 5E). This may be due to the reduced association of ZNF598 in the EDF1-KO cells. This possibility could be examined by the determination of the distribution of ZNF598 in the EDF1-KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We have provided a detailed discussion above (Essential revisions, point 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) EDF1 recruits GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes and is required for the increase of JUN, ATF3 mRNAs by the emetine treatment (Figure 5D and Figure 6). However, it is unclear whether the increase of JUN, ATF3 mRNAs by the emetine treatment depends on the EDF1-mediated recruitment of GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. As discussed above (Essential revisions, point 3), we find that EDF1 contributes to at least two arms of the ribotoxic stress response – first, to recruit GIGYF2•EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes and consequent translational repression on problematic mRNAs (Figure 6), and second to coordinate a transcriptional response to ribosomal collisions (Figure 7). Our studies do not establish whether these responses are directly coordinated, for example through GIGYF2•EIF4E2. Those will be interesting questions to pursue in subsequent studies, but we feel they are beyond the scope of this initial publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It should be examined whether the JUN, ATF3 mRNAs are increased by the emetine treatment in the condition that EDF1 is not recruited to the collided ribosomes, like the RACK1-KO background.</p></disp-quote><p>This point was addressed above (Essential revisions, point 3). While we think this is a very interesting question, we feel that the proposed experiments are beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Importantly, the new structural information that we now provide (Figure 3 and Figure 4) will guide the construction of ribosome-binding defective EDF1 variants to ask this question in a direct manner.</p></body></sub-article></article>
