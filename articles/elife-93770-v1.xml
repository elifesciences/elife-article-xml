The unicellular ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> has seven mating types, which are determined by the MTA and MTB proteins. In this study, we found that both proteins are essential for cells to send or receive complete mating-type information, and transmission of the mating-type signal requires both proteins to be expressed in the same cell. We found that MTA and MTB form a mating-type recognition complex that localizes to the plasma membrane, but not to the cilia. Stimulation experiments showed that the mating-type-specific regions of MTA and MTB mediate both self- and non-self-recognition, indicating that <italic>T. thermophila</italic> uses a dual approach to achieve mating-type recognition.

Mating type (or sex) is a key regulatory feature of gamete fusion. Most species have only two sexes/mating types (e.g. male and female, + and -, or a and α) and species usually use either self- or non-self-recognition mechanism to achieve sex/mating-type recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goodenough and Heitman, 2014</xref>). However, species in some lineages, such as some ciliates and basidiomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heitman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Phadke and Zufall, 2009</xref>), possess multiple mating types, and multiple-alleles self-incompatibility system was observed in some plants, such as Brassicaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Iwano and Takayama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Takayama and Isogai, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vekemans and Castric, 2021</xref>). This raises the interesting question of how sexes/mating types are recognized at the molecular level in multiple sex/mating-type systems.</p><p>The model unicellular ciliate, <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, has seven mating types (I–VII). Under starvation conditions, any cell of one mating type can mate with a cell of any of the other six mating types, but not with one of the same mating type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cervantes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nanney, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Orias et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Mating-type recognition in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> depends on direct cell–cell contact (temporary or persistent), which suggests that mating-type proteins localize to the cell surface. However, there is no direct evidence to indicate whether they are ciliary proteins or not. When one cell comes into contact with a cell of a different mating type, a mating-type-dependent recognition event enables both cells to enter a pre-conjugation stage (called costimulation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bruns and Palestine, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Finley and Bruns, 1980</xref>). Even when cells of different mating types are mixed in unequal ratios (e.g. 9:1), all cells become fully stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bruns and Palestine, 1975</xref>). This is because one cell can temporarily contact a number of cells and stimulate them. Processes that take place during costimulation include Tip transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wolfe and Grimes, 1979</xref>) and concanavalin A (Con-A) receptor appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wolfe and Feng, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wolfe et al., 1986</xref>). In preparation for pairing, costimulated cells of the same and different mating type(s) adhere to form very loose pairs. Heterotypic cell pairs form a stable conjugation junction, whereas homotypic pairs separate very quickly (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kitamura et al., 1986</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mating-type recognition in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>thermophila</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of self and non-self mating-type recognition. When one cell of mating type I encounters another, costimulation and mating do not occur. When a cell of mating type I encounters a cell of another mating type (II–VII), the cells enter the costimulation stage and go on to form a pair.

Cells divide asexually when nutrition is adequate. After starvation, cells of any two different mating types recognize each other and enter a pre-conjugation stage called costimulation. In this stage, cells first become round (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fujishima et al., 1993</xref>); subsequently, their cell tips are transformed into a curved shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wolfe and Grimes, 1979</xref>) and the concanavalin A (Con-A) receptor becomes detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wolfe and Feng, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wolfe et al., 1986</xref>). Costimulated cells then form pairs via a rotating behavior (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). <italic>T. thermophila</italic> possesses two types of nuclei within a single cell: the somatic macronucleus (MAC, ~90N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>) and the germline micronucleus (MIC, 2N). The <italic>mat</italic> locus on the MIC chromosome contains several mating-type gene pairs (mtGP, including <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic>) organized in a tandem array. In contrast, the MAC chromosome carries only one mtGP. During the sexual life cycle (conjugation), cells undergo a series of sexual events. MIC undergoes meiosis and reciprocal fertilization (for details, refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Orias et al., 2011</xref>). The new MAC of progeny develops from the fertilization MIC through a series of genome editing events, and increase its ploidy to ~90 via endoreduplication. During this process, mtGP loss occurs, resulting in only one mtGP remaining on the MAC chromosome. The mating-type specificity of mtGPs on each chromosome within one nucleus becomes pure to some extent relatively quickly, a phenomenon termed intranuclear coordination. Exconjugants (separated pairs) finally form parent-like progeny when nutrition becomes available, but remain sexually immature. After ~60 fissions, cells mature and their mating type is determined and becomes fixed (for details of mating-type determination, the interested readers is referred to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Orias et al., 2017</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93770-fig1-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-93770-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Mating behavior of <italic>T. thermophila</italic>.</title></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-93770-video2.mp4" id="video2"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Mating behavior of <italic>T. thermophila</italic>.</title><p>To distinguish cells of different mating types, smaller mating type VI cells and larger mating-type VII cells were used in this experiment.</p></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-93770-video3.mp4" id="video3"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Cells of different mating types form a pair, whereas cells of the same mating type become separated after a short contact.</title><p>To distinguish cells of different mating types, smaller mating type VI cells and larger mating-type VII cells were used in this experiment.</p></caption></media><p>The mating-type system of <italic>T. thermophila</italic> was described by Nanney and collaborators in the early 1950s (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Orias, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Orias et al., 2017</xref>). We previously showed that mating type is determined by a pair of mating-type genes that are organized in head-to-head orientation: <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cervantes et al., 2013</xref>). Each gene has a terminal exon that encodes five transmembrane (TM) helices and a cysteine-rich growth factor receptor (GFR) domain. The region between the two terminal exons of the gene pair encodes the N-terminal mating-type-specific extracellular regions. Based on the mating-type-specific regions, the mating-type genes are called <italic>MTA1-MTB1</italic> for mating type I, <italic>MTA2-MTB2</italic> for mating type II, and so on. We previously showed that Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells do not form pairs or produce progeny and that Δ<italic>MTA</italic> cells retain mating-type specificity but pair extremely poorly and rarely produced progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cervantes et al., 2013</xref>); we concluded that the two genes are non-redundant and both are essential for mating. In addition, our previous work demonstrated that CDK19, CYC9, and CIP1 are coexpressed with MTA and MTB and are essential for mating. These encoded proteins constitute components of a cyclin-dependent kinase complex, which localizes to the cell tip and pairing junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). However, challenges such as multiple mating types; the high molecular weight, membrane localization and extremely low expression levels of mating-type proteins; and difficulty in genetically manipulating the mating-type gene locus have so far prevented elucidation of the mode of action of the MTA and MTB proteins and of whether they mediate self- or non-self mating-type recognition.</p><p>In this study, we provide direct evidence that the MTA and MTB form an elaborate multifunctional protein complex that can identify cells of both self and non-self mating types to inhibit or activate mating, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mating-type recognition cannot be explained by the simple receptor–ligand model</title><p>Receptor–ligand interaction is a critical mechanism for intercellular communication that may regulate mating-type recognition in <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, irrespective of whether self- or non-self-recognition mechanisms are employed. Therefore, we first assessed whether mating-type recognition conforms to a straightforward receptor–ligand model (in which one individual mating-type protein acts as the receptor and the other as its ligand) and whether self or non-self is recognized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, 1 and 2</xref>). For this, we determined whether deletion of each mating-type gene affected the transmission and detection of mating signals to and from wild-type (WT) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the experimental procedure) by assessing the ability of cells to undergo costimulation (the prerequisite for mating). Our experiment allows us to test if cells missing one of the two mating-type proteins can still costimulate WT cells (for details, refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, 3–6</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mating-type proteins are essential for mating-type recognition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental procedure for the costimulation experiments.

These results were not changed by extending the pre-incubation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

This result indicates that the absence of a mating-type protein in one cell cannot be complemented by its presence in another cell in the same culture; the MTA and MTB proteins must be in the same cell to transmit the mating-type signal. This finding also suggests that mating-type recognition cannot be explained by a simple receptor–ligand model. It is possible that the MTA and MTB proteins form a complex which either serves as a recognizer (functioning as both ligand and receptor) or a co-receptor. But, since MTA and MTB are the only genes with mating-type specificity, it is unlikely that the complex is acting as a co-receptor. Whether MTA and MTB act as a ligand and a receptor independently within the complex will be discussed later.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mating-type proteins differentially regulate two steps of costimulation</title><p>During costimulation, cells undergo a sequence of developmental events that remodel the anterior cell membrane and its associated cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cole, 2013</xref>). Two hallmarks of this process are Tip transformation (in which the anterior tip of the cell becomes curved) and Con-A receptor appearance (receptors bound by the plant lectin Con-A, which binds to mannose containing glycoproteins). When WT cells of one mating type were mixed with WT cells of another mating type, the cell tips became transformed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, 4</xref>) and Con-A receptors appeared in almost all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, 4</xref>).

Similarly, when cells of each mutant were pre-incubated with WT cells, Tip transformation was not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, 8 and 9</xref>). The outcome was slightly different for Con-A receptor appearance. Con-A receptors were not observed in WT cells pre-incubated with Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, 6</xref>) or in cells of either mutant pre-incubated with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, 7 and 8</xref>).

These results indicate that neither Δ<italic>MTA</italic> and Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells can fully stimulate WT cells or be stimulated by WT cells. They also demonstrate that costimulation can be separated into two stages: (i) one represented by the appearance of Con-A receptors that only requires MTB protein in partner cells, and (ii) the other represented by morphological transformation of the cell tip, which requires both MTA and MTB.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mating-type proteins form a complex with several coexpressed proteins</title><p>According to the pre-incubation results with ‘Δ<italic>MTA</italic> cells plus Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells’, MTA and MTB cannot functionally complement each other when expressed on different cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, teal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, 7</xref>). In contrast, we previously found that Δ<italic>CDK19</italic> and Δ<italic>CYC9</italic> cells, which express both MTA and MTB, cannot mate. Pre-incubating WT cells with each of them of different mating types promotes WT cells mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). The difference in results between these two types of pre-incubation may be caused by whether MTA and MTB proteins are expressed on the same or different cells: Since TM helices fix the proteins onto the cytomembrane, the mating-type proteins are limited on each cell. Thus, in Δ<italic>MTA</italic> and Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells, the remaining mating-type protein expressed on different cells (MTB or MTA individually) is likely to be spatially separated. WT cells, even when pre-incubated with both Δ<italic>MTA</italic> and Δ<italic>MTB</italic> cells simultaneously, receive MTB or MTA signals separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, in Δ<italic>CDK19</italic> and Δ<italic>CYC9</italic> cells, MTA and MTB proteins are expressed on the same cell, allowing them to provide MTA and MTB signals together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These findings lead us to propose the hypothesis that MTA and MTB proteins form a mating-type recognition complex (MTRC).</p><p>To test whether MTA and MTB proteins physically interact, an HA-tag coding sequence was ligated to the 3ʹ end of the <italic>MTA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); cellular proteins were co-precipitated with HA-tagged MTA and analyzed by immunoprecipitation-coupled mass spectrometry (IP-MS). As expected, the MTB protein co-purified with MTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>), as did another set of proteins, which we named MRC1–MRC6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1 fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 1 and 2</xref>). Next, we produced strains expressing either HA-tagged MTB or MRC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and found that each protein pulled down a subset of the proteins that co-purified with MTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Unfortunately, these pull-down experiments were not as successful as the MTA IPs, perhaps because of the higher molecular weight of MTB (194 kDa) and MRC1 (212 kDa). Taken together, our results suggest that MTA, MTB, and MRC1–MRC6 form the MTRC. Alternatively, MTA and MTB may interact with subsets of MRC proteins to form smaller complexes or alternative MTRCs. Different protein interactors were identified in extracts from cells at different mating stages. This may reflect conformational changes in the MTRC but the huge molecular weight of the complex and extremely low expression levels of its proteins make this possibility difficult to investigate.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Proteins that interact with MTA and MTB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Construction of HA-tagged strains.

For instance, if MTA is a ligand and MTB is a receptor, treating a cell with MTAxc protein should induce a mating signal, whereas treatment with MTBxc should not. However, our results indicate that MTAxc and MTBxc have very similar effects, and the effect is stronger when treated with two proteins together. Therefore, this possibility is unlikely. In addition, we did not identify any costimulation markers when incubated with MTAxc and/or MTBxc. This may be due to the lack of other components, differences in post-translational modifications between insect cells and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, or variations in protein conditions between the cell membrane and solution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mating-type proteins also influence self-recognition</title><p>We used similar methods to examine whether pre-treatment with a cognate mating-type-specific region (i.e. self-recognition) affects mating. Treatment of WT cells (VI and VII) with MTAxc and/or MTBxc of the same mating type decreased the pairing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, green or blue). No obvious difference was found between treatments with MTAxc and MTBxc. Meanwhile, a significant synergistic effect was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, teal). For all treatments (single or combined), the pairing rate was similar by 4 hr (reaching &gt;80%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>), indicating that the initial inhibitory effect on pairing was eventually overcome. Negative regulation by MTAxc and MTBxc was also observed for other mating-type combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I, J</xref>).

When cells of the same mating type contact each other, the interaction between MTRCs inhibits mating. Conversely, when cells of different mating types contact each other, the interaction between MTRCs initiates mating. Many details remain unknown, such as (i) during self-recognition, whether the MTRC is only blocked or generates an inhibitory signal (e.g. membrane potential by Ca<sup>2+</sup>), (ii) how two MTRCs interact during cell–cell recognition, and the differences between self- and non-self-recognition, and (iii) the downstream pathway when MTRC is activated. We hope future studies will help refine and advance this model, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of how mating types are recognized in multiple mating systems.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93770-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>An open question is why <italic>T. thermophila</italic> should use such a dual approach (both self and non-self) to achieve mating-type recognition. Recent research on basidiomycetes and flowering plants (other species with multiple mating types) has shown that their mating-type recognition (or self-incompatibility) mechanisms involve either self- or non-self-recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fraser and Heitman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Iwano and Takayama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vekemans and Castric, 2021</xref>). Our previous evolutionary study showed that the length of the mating-type-specific region differs significantly among different <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species (~2000 aa for <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, ~3200 aa for <italic>T. borealis</italic>, while only ~1000 aa for <italic>T. pigmentosa</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Based on the massive difference in length, it is reasonable to speculate that different species might use different mechanisms for mating-type recognition. Therefore, dramatic evolution of the mating-type recognition mechanism seems to have occurred relatively soon after the emergence of the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> genus. Further detailed functional and evolutionary studies may reveal whether the mating-type recognition model differed in different <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species, and how and why this recognition mechanism evolved and how its evolution contributed to speciation.</p><p>MTRC is likely to be a giant protein complex which is over a million Daltons in size. The large protein complex formed is reminiscent of the fusion patches that develop in budding or fission yeasts. In these species, the mating-type receptors are activated by ligand pheromones from the opposite mating type that induce polarity patch formation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sieber et al., 2023</xref>, for a recent review). At these patches, growth (shmooing) and fusion occur, which is reminiscent (in a different order) of the tip transformation in <italic>T. thermophila</italic>. Future studies of this protein complex may reveal whether more similar processes and/or mechanisms shared in these two distant lineages.</p><p>We still do not know what intracellular signals are transduced when the MTRCs on two cells interact. Mating-type self-recognition might generate an inhibitory signal or might simply inactivate the MTRC. In many species, such as <italic>Papaver rhoeas</italic> and <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, interaction between mating-type proteins of the same mating type induces changes in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that cause self-incompatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Giamarchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). A similar system may exist in <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, since the MRC4 and MRC5 proteins are predicted to be Ca<sup>2+</sup>-translocators. Interaction between MTRCs on cells of different mating types (non-self-recognition) should result in their activation to allow the cells to initiate pairing. We propose that the activation signal involves the CDK19 complex (a cyclin-dependent kinase complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ma et al., 2020</xref>) and AKM3 (a K<sup>+</sup> channel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) because they probably interact with the MTRC. We expect future studies to lead to the discovery of more detailed mechanisms for mating-type recognition and initiation of conjugation involving these proteins. An intriguing discovery is that the <italic>MTB2-eGFP</italic> cell (VI background) can undergo selfing and mate with cells of all other mating types except VI and II. The inability to mate with VI and II supports the self-recognition model. Additionally, in theory, there should be two types of MTRCs in the <italic>MTB2-eGFP</italic> cell: MTRC of pure VI specificity (A6B6) and heterotypic MTRC of MTA6 and MTB2 (A6B2). Consequently, opposite mating-type recognition outcomes should occur simultaneously when the <italic>MTB2-eGFP</italic> cell recognizes another <italic>MTB2-eGFP</italic> cell: inhibition (A6B6–A6B6) and activation (A6B2–A6B2). The overall observed result showed that this strain can self, indicating there is no (MTRC is only blocked) or relatively weak inhibitory signal generated during self-recognition.</p><p><italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic>, a closely related Oligohymenophorean ciliate, has only two mating types, which are determined by the expression or non-expression of a <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>-MTA/B-like protein called mtA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). An intriguing question is whether mtA also engages in the formation of a MTRC with other proteins by serving as a recognizer rather than mediating a straightforward receptor–ligand interaction. Future investigations of <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic> may shed light on the origins and evolutionary aspects of this distinctive mating system. Moreover, due to the extremely long evolutionary distance, recognition mechanisms discovered in model species fall short of explaining many of the intricate biological events in protists.

This model protist possesses a total of 7 mating types/sexes and mating occurs only between individuals expressing different mating types. The authors aimed to characterize the function of mating type proteins (MTA and MTB) in the process of self- and non-self recognition, using a combination of elegant phenotypic assays, protein studies, and imaging. They showed that the presence of MTA and MTB in the same cell is required for the expression of concavalin-A receptors and for tip transformation - two processes that are characteristic of the costimulation phase that precedes cell fusion. Using protein studies, the authors identify a set of additional proteins of varied functions that interact with MTA and MTB and are likely responsible for the downstream signaling processes required for mating. This is a description of a fascinating self- and non-self-recognition system and, as the authors point out, it is a rare example of a system with numerous mating types/sexes. This work opens the door for the further understanding of the molecular bases and evolution of these complex recognition systems within and outside protists.</p><p>The results shown in this study point to the unequivocal requirement of MTA and MTB proteins for mating. Nevertheless, some of the conclusions regarding the mode of functioning of these proteins are not fully supported and require additional investigation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The authors have established a set of very useful knock-out and reporter lines for MT proteins and extensively used them in sophisticated and well-designed phenotypic assays that allowed them to test the role of these proteins in vivo.</p><p>(2) Despite their apparent low abundance, the authors took advantage of a varied set of protein isolation and characterization techniques to pinpoint the localization of MT proteins to the cell membrane, and their interaction with multiple other proteins that could be downstream effectors. This opens the door for the future characterization of these proteins and further elucidation of the mating type recognition cascade.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript is structured and written in a very clear and easy-to-follow manner. However, several conclusions and discussion points fall short of highlighting possible models and mechanisms through which MT proteins control mating type recognition:</p><p>(1) The authors dismiss the possibility of a &quot;simple receptor-ligand system&quot;, even though the data does not exclude this possibility. The model presented in Figure 2 S1, and on which the authors based their hypothesis, assumes the independence of MTA and MTB proteins in the generation of the intracellular cascade. However, the results presented in Figure 2 show that both proteins are required to be active in the same cell. Coupled with the fact that MTA and MTB proteins interact, this is compatible with a model where MTA would be a ligand and MTB a receptor (or vice-versa), and could thus form a receptor-ligand complex that could potentially be activated by a non-cognate MTA-MTB receptor-ligand complex, leading to an intracellular cascade mediated by the identified MRC proteins. As it stands, it is not clear what is the proposed working model, and it would be very beneficial for the reader for this to be clarified by having the point of view of the authors on this or other types of models.</p><p>(2) The presence of MTA/MTB proteins is required for costimulation (Figure 2), and supplementation with non-cognate extracellular fragments of these proteins (MTAxc, or MTBxc) is a positive stimulator of pairing. However, alone, these fragments do not have the ability to induce costimulation (Figure 5). Based on the results in Figures 5 and 6 the authors suggest that MT proteins mediate both self and non-self recognition. Why do MTAxc and MTBxc not induce costimulation alone? Are any other components required? How to reconcile this with the results of Figure 2? A more in-depth interpretation of these results would be very helpful, since these questions remain unanswered, making it difficult for the reader to extract a clear hypothesis on how MT proteins mediate self- and non-self-recognition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93770.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This manuscript reports the discovery and analysis of a large protein complex that controls mating type and sexual reproduction of the model ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>. In contrast to many organisms that have two mating types or two sexes, Tetrahymena is multi-sexual with 7 distinct mating types. Previous studies identified the mating type locus, which encodes two transmembrane proteins called MTA and MTB that determine the specificity of mating type interactions. In this study, mutants are generated in the MTA and MTB genes and mutant isolates are studied for mating properties. Cells missing either MTA or MTB failed to co-stimulate wild-type cells of different mating types. Moreover, a mixture of mutants lacking MTA or MTB also failed to stimulate. These observations support the conclusion that MTA and MTB may form a complex that directs mating-type identity. To address this, the proteins were epitope-tagged and subjected to IP-MS analysis. This revealed that MTA and MTB are in a physical complex, and also revealed a series of 6 other proteins (MRC1-6) that together with MTA/B form the mating type recognition complex (MTRC). All 8 proteins feature predicted transmembrane domains, three feature GFR domains, and two are predicted to function as calcium transporters. The authors went on to demonstrate that components of the MTRC are localized on the cell surface but not in the cilia. They also presented findings that support the conclusion that the mating type-specific region of the MTA and MTB genes can influence both self- and non-self-recognition in mating.</p><p>Taken together, the findings presented are interesting and extend our understanding of how organisms with more than two mating types/sexes may be specified. The identification of the six-protein MRC complex is quite intriguing. It would seem important that the function of at least one of these subunits be analyzed by gene deletion and phenotyping, similar to the findings presented here for the MTA and MTB mutants. A straightforward prediction might be that a deletion of any subunit of the MRC complex would result in a sterile phenotype. The manuscript was very well written and a pleasure to read.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93770.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors describe the role, location, and function of the MTA and MTB mating type genes in the multi-mating-type species <italic>T. thermophila</italic>. The ciliate is an important group of organisms to study the evolution of mating types, as it is one of the few groups in which more than two mating types evolved independently. In the study, the authors use deletion strains of the species to show that both mating types genes located in each allele are required in both mating individuals for successful matings to occur. They show that the proteins are localized in the cell membrane, not the cilia, and that they interact in a complex (MTRC) with a set of 6 associated (non-mating type-allelic) genes. This complex is furthermore likely to interact with a cyclin-dependent kinase complex. It is intriguing that T. thermophila has two genes that are allelic and that are both required for successful mating. This coevolved double recognition has to my knowledge not been described for any other mating-type recognition system. I am not familiar with experimental research on ciliates, but as far as I can judge, the experiments appear well performed and mostly support the interpretation of the authors with appropriate controls and statistical analyses.</p><p>The results show clearly that the mating type genes regulate non-self-recognition, however, I am not convinced that self-recognition occurs leading to the suppression of mating. An alternative explanation could be that the MTA and MTB proteins form a complex and that the two extracellular regions together interact with the MTA+MTB proteins from different mating types. This alternative hypothesis fits with the coevolution of MTA and MTB genes observed in the phylogenetic subgroups as described by Yan et al. (2021 iScience). Adding MTAxc and/or MTBxc to the cells can lead to the occupation of the external parts of the full proteins thereby inhibiting the formation of the complex, which in turn reduces non-self interactions. Self-recognition as explained in Figure 2S1 suggests an active response, which should be measurable in expression data for example. This is in my opinion not essential, but a claim of self-recognition through the MTA and MTB should not be made.</p><p>The authors discuss that <italic>T. thermophila</italic> has special mating-type proteins that are large, while those of other groups are generally small (lines 157-160 and discussion). The complex formed is very large and in the discussion, they argue that this might be due to the &quot;highly complex process, given that there are seven mating types in all&quot;. There is no argument given why large is more complex, if this is complex, and whether more mating types require more complexity. In basidiomycete fungi, many more mating types than 7 exist, and the homeodomain genes involved in mating types are relatively small but highly diverse (Luo et al. 1994 PMID: 7914671). The mating types associated with GPCR receptors in fungi are arguably larger, but again their function is not that complex, and mating-type specific variations appear to evolve easily (Fowler et al 2004 PMID: 14643262; Seike et al. 2015 PMID: 25831518). The large protein complex formed is reminiscent of the fusion patches that develop in budding or fission yeasts. In these species, the mating type receptors are activated by ligand pheromones from the opposite mating type that induce polarity patch formation (see Sieber et al. 2023 PMID: 35148940 for a recent review). At these patches, growth (shmooing) and fusion occur, which is reminiscent (in a different order) of the tip transformation in T. thermophilia. The fusion of two cells is in all taxa a dangerous and complex event that requires the evolution of very strict regulation and the existence of a system like the MTRC and cyclin-dependent complex to regulate this process is therefore not unexpected. The existence of multiple mating types should not greatly complicate the process, as most of the machinery (except for the MTA and MTB) is identical among all mating types.</p><p>The Tetrahymena/ciliate genetics and lifecycle could be better explained. For a general audience, the system is not easy to follow. For example, the ploidy of the somatic nucleus with regards to the mating type is not clear to me. The MAC is generally considered &quot;polyploid&quot;, but how does this work for the mating type? I assume only a single copy of the mating type locus is available in the MAC to avoid self-recognition in the cells. Is it known how the diploid origin reduces to a single mating type? This does not become apparent from Cervantes et al. 2013. Also, the explanation of co-stimulation is not completely clear (lines 49-60). Initially, direct cell-cell contact is mentioned, but later it is mentioned that &quot;all cells become fully stimulated&quot;, even when unequal ratios are used. Is physical contact necessary? Or is this due to the &quot;secrete mating-essential factors&quot; (line 601)? These details are essential, for interpretation of the results and need to be explained better.</p><p>Abstract and introduction: Sexes are not mating types. In general, mating types refer to systems in which there is no obvious asymmetry between the gametes, beyond the compatibility system. When there is a physiological difference such as size or motility, sexes are used.

This model protist possesses a total of 7 mating types/sexes and mating occurs only between individuals expressing different mating types. The authors aimed to characterize the function of mating type proteins (MTA and MTB) in the process of self- and non-self recognition, using a combination of elegant phenotypic assays, protein studies, and imaging. They showed that the presence of MTA and MTB in the same cell is required for the expression of concavalin-A receptors and for tip transformation - two processes that are characteristic of the costimulation phase that precedes cell fusion. Using protein studies, the authors identify a set of additional proteins of varied functions that interact with MTA and MTB and are likely responsible for the downstream signaling processes required for mating. This is a description of a fascinating self- and non-self-recognition system and, as the authors point out, it is a rare example of a system with numerous mating types/sexes. This work opens the door for the further understanding of the molecular bases and evolution of these complex recognition systems within and outside protists.</p><p>The results shown in this study point to the unequivocal requirement of MTA and MTB proteins for mating. Nevertheless, some of the conclusions regarding the mode of functioning of these proteins are not fully supported and require additional investigation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The authors have established a set of very useful knock-out and reporter lines for MT proteins and extensively used them in sophisticated and well-designed phenotypic assays that allowed them to test the role of these proteins in vivo.</p><p>(2) Despite their apparent low abundance, the authors took advantage of a varied set of protein isolation and characterization techniques to pinpoint the localization of MT proteins to the cell membrane, and their interaction with multiple other proteins that could be downstream effectors. This opens the door for the future characterization of these proteins and further elucidation of the mating type recognition cascade.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript is structured and written in a very clear and easy-to-follow manner. However, several conclusions and discussion points fall short of highlighting possible models and mechanisms through which MT proteins control mating type recognition:</p><p>(1) The authors dismiss the possibility of a &quot;simple receptor-ligand system&quot;, even though the data does not exclude this possibility. The model presented in Figure 2 S1, and on which the authors based their hypothesis, assumes the independence of MTA and MTB proteins in the generation of the intracellular cascade. However, the results presented in Figure 2 show that both proteins are required to be active in the same cell. Coupled with the fact that MTA and MTB proteins interact, this is compatible with a model where MTA would be a ligand and MTB a receptor (or vice-versa), and could thus form a receptor-ligand complex that could potentially be activated by a non-cognate MTA-MTB receptor-ligand complex, leading to an intracellular cascade mediated by the identified MRC proteins. As it stands, it is not clear what is the proposed working model, and it would be very beneficial for the reader for this to be clarified by having the point of view of the authors on this or other types of models.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful that Reviewer #1 proposed the possibility that MTA and MTB form a receptor-ligand complex in which one acting as the ligand and the other as the receptor. We considered this hypothesis when asking how dose MTRC function, too. However, our current results do not support this idea. For instance, if MTA were a ligand and MTB a receptor, we would expect a mating signal upon treatment with MTAxc protein, but not with MTBxc. Contrary to this expectation, our experiments revealed that both MTAxc and MTBxc exhibit very similar effects (Figure 5, green and blue), and their combined treatment produces a stronger effect (Figure 5, teal). This suggests a mixed function for both proteins. (We incorporated this discussion into the revised version [line 120-121, 240-244].) It is pity that our current knowledge does not provide a detailed molecular mechanism for this intricate system. We are actively investigating the protein structures of MTA, MTB, and the entire MTRC, hoping to gain deeper insights into the molecular functions of MTA and MTB.</p><p>Additionally, we also realized that the expression we used in the previous version, “simple receptor-ligand model”, is not clearly defined. As Reviewer #1 pointed out, in this section, we examined whether the individual proteins of MTA and MTB act as a couple of receptor and ligand. We think this is the simplest possibility as a null hypothesis for Tetrahymena mating-type recognition. We have clarified it in the revised version (line 90-91, 104-106). According to this section, we proposed that MTA and MTB may form a complex that serves as a recognizer (functioning as both ligand and receptor) (line 117-118).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The presence of MTA/MTB proteins is required for costimulation (Figure 2), and supplementation with non-cognate extracellular fragments of these proteins (MTAxc, or MTBxc) is a positive stimulator of pairing. However, alone, these fragments do not have the ability to induce costimulation (Figure 5). Based on the results in Figures 5 and 6 the authors suggest that MT proteins mediate both self and non-self recognition. Why do MTAxc and MTBxc not induce costimulation alone? Are any other components required? How to reconcile this with the results of Figure 2? A more in-depth interpretation of these results would be very helpful, since these questions remain unanswered, making it difficult for the reader to extract a clear hypothesis on how MT proteins mediate self- and non-self-recognition.</p></disp-quote><p>Several factors could contribute to the inability of MTA/Bxc to induce costimulation. It is highly likely that additional components are necessary, given that MTA/B form a protein complex with other proteins. Moreover, the expression of MTA/Bxc in insect cells, compared with Tetrahymena, might result in differences in post-translational modifications. Additionally, there are variations in protein conditions; on the Tetrahymena membrane, these proteins are arranged regularly and concentrated in a small area, while MTA/Bxc is randomly dispersed in the medium. The former condition could be more efficient. If there is a threshold required to stimulate a costimulation marker, MTA/Bxc may fail to meet this requirement. Much more studies are needed to fully answer this question. We acknowledged this limitation in the revised version (line 244-248).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>This manuscript reports the discovery and analysis of a large protein complex that controls mating type and sexual reproduction of the model ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>. In contrast to many organisms that have two mating types or two sexes, Tetrahymena is multi-sexual with 7 distinct mating types. Previous studies identified the mating type locus, which encodes two transmembrane proteins called MTA and MTB that determine the specificity of mating type interactions. In this study, mutants are generated in the MTA and MTB genes and mutant isolates are studied for mating properties. Cells missing either MTA or MTB failed to co-stimulate wild-type cells of different mating types. Moreover, a mixture of mutants lacking MTA or MTB also failed to stimulate. These observations support the conclusion that MTA and MTB may form a complex that directs mating-type identity. To address this, the proteins were epitope-tagged and subjected to IP-MS analysis. This revealed that MTA and MTB are in a physical complex, and also revealed a series of 6 other proteins (MRC1-6) that together with MTA/B form the mating type recognition complex (MTRC). All 8 proteins feature predicted transmembrane domains, three feature GFR domains, and two are predicted to function as calcium transporters. The authors went on to demonstrate that components of the MTRC are localized on the cell surface but not in the cilia. They also presented findings that support the conclusion that the mating type-specific region of the MTA and MTB genes can influence both self- and non-self-recognition in mating.</p><p>Taken together, the findings presented are interesting and extend our understanding of how organisms with more than two mating types/sexes may be specified. The identification of the six-protein MRC complex is quite intriguing. It would seem important that the function of at least one of these subunits be analyzed by gene deletion and phenotyping, similar to the findings presented here for the MTA and MTB mutants. A straightforward prediction might be that a deletion of any subunit of the MRC complex would result in a sterile phenotype. The manuscript was very well written and a pleasure to read.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the valuable comments and suggestions. We are currently in the process of constructing deletion strains for these genes. As of now, we have successfully obtained ΔMRC1-3 and MRC4-6 knockdown strains. Our preliminary observations indicate that ΔMRC1-3 strains are unable to undergo mating. However, we prefer not to include these results in the current manuscript, as we believe that more comprehensive studies are still needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>The authors describe the role, location, and function of the MTA and MTB mating type genes in the multi-mating-type species <italic>T. thermophila</italic>. The ciliate is an important group of organisms to study the evolution of mating types, as it is one of the few groups in which more than two mating types evolved independently. In the study, the authors use deletion strains of the species to show that both mating types genes located in each allele are required in both mating individuals for successful matings to occur. They show that the proteins are localized in the cell membrane, not the cilia, and that they interact in a complex (MTRC) with a set of 6 associated (non-mating type-allelic) genes. This complex is furthermore likely to interact with a cyclin-dependent kinase complex. It is intriguing that T. thermophila has two genes that are allelic and that are both required for successful mating. This coevolved double recognition has to my knowledge not been described for any other mating-type recognition system. I am not familiar with experimental research on ciliates, but as far as I can judge, the experiments appear well performed and mostly support the interpretation of the authors with appropriate controls and statistical analyses.</p><p>The results show clearly that the mating type genes regulate non-self-recognition, however, I am not convinced that self-recognition occurs leading to the suppression of mating. An alternative explanation could be that the MTA and MTB proteins form a complex and that the two extracellular regions together interact with the MTA+MTB proteins from different mating types. This alternative hypothesis fits with the coevolution of MTA and MTB genes observed in the phylogenetic subgroups as described by Yan et al. (2021 iScience). Adding MTAxc and/or MTBxc to the cells can lead to the occupation of the external parts of the full proteins thereby inhibiting the formation of the complex, which in turn reduces non-self interactions. Self-recognition as explained in Figure 2S1 suggests an active response, which should be measurable in expression data for example. This is in my opinion not essential, but a claim of self-recognition through the MTA and MTB should not be made.</p></disp-quote><p>We express our gratitude to Reviewer #3 for proposing the occupation model and have incorporated this possibility into the manuscript. We believe it is possible that occupation may serve as the molecular mechanism through which self-recognition negatively regulates mating. If there is a physical interaction between mating-type proteins of the same type, but this interaction blocks the recognition machinery rather than initiating mating, it can be considered a form of self-recognition. This aligns with the observation that strains expressing MTA/B6 and MTB2 mate normally with WT cells of all mating types except for VI and II (line 203-204). A concise discussion on this topic is included in the manuscript (line 288-293, 659-661). We are actively investigating the downstream aspects of mating-type recognition, and we hope to provide further insights into this question soon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors discuss that <italic>T. thermophila</italic> has special mating-type proteins that are large, while those of other groups are generally small (lines 157-160 and discussion). The complex formed is very large and in the discussion, they argue that this might be due to the &quot;highly complex process, given that there are seven mating types in all&quot;. There is no argument given why large is more complex, if this is complex, and whether more mating types require more complexity. In basidiomycete fungi, many more mating types than 7 exist, and the homeodomain genes involved in mating types are relatively small but highly diverse (Luo et al. 1994 PMID: 7914671). The mating types associated with GPCR receptors in fungi are arguably larger, but again their function is not that complex, and mating-type specific variations appear to evolve easily (Fowler et al 2004 PMID: 14643262; Seike et al. 2015 PMID: 25831518). The large protein complex formed is reminiscent of the fusion patches that develop in budding or fission yeasts. In these species, the mating type receptors are activated by ligand pheromones from the opposite mating type that induce polarity patch formation (see Sieber et al. 2023 PMID: 35148940 for a recent review). At these patches, growth (shmooing) and fusion occur, which is reminiscent (in a different order) of the tip transformation in T. thermophilia. The fusion of two cells is in all taxa a dangerous and complex event that requires the evolution of very strict regulation and the existence of a system like the MTRC and cyclin-dependent complex to regulate this process is therefore not unexpected. The existence of multiple mating types should not greatly complicate the process, as most of the machinery (except for the MTA and MTB) is identical among all mating types.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful that Reviewer #3 provide this insightful view and relevant papers. In response to the feedback, we removed the sentences regarding “multiple mating types greatly complicate the process” in the revised version. Instead, we have introduced a discussion section comparing the mating systems of yeasts and Tetrahymena (line 279-286).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Tetrahymena/ciliate genetics and lifecycle could be better explained. For a general audience, the system is not easy to follow. For example, the ploidy of the somatic nucleus with regards to the mating type is not clear to me. The MAC is generally considered &quot;polyploid&quot;, but how does this work for the mating type? I assume only a single copy of the mating type locus is available in the MAC to avoid self-recognition in the cells. Is it known how the diploid origin reduces to a single mating type? This does not become apparent from Cervantes et al. 2013.</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, the MIC (diploid) contains several mating-type gene pairs (mtGP, i.e., MTA and MTB) organized in a tandem array at the mat locus on each chromosome. In sexual reproduction, the new MAC of the progeny develops from the fertilized MIC through a series of genome editing events, and its ploidy increases to ~90 by endoreduplication. During this process, mtGP loss occurs, resulting in only one mtGP remaining on the MAC chromosome. The mating-type specificity of mtGPs on each chromosome within one nucleus becomes relatively pure through intranuclear coordination. After multiple assortments (possibly caused by MAC amitosis during cell fission), only mtGPs of one mating-type specificity exist in each cell, determining the cell’s mating type.</p><p>It is pity that the exact mechanisms involved in this complicated process remain a black box. The loss of mating-type gene pairs is hypothesized to involve a series of homologous recombination events, but this has not been completely proven. Furthermore, there is no clear understanding of how intranuclear coordination and assortment are achieved. While we have made observations confirming these events, a breakthrough in understanding the molecular mechanism is yet to be achieved.</p><p>We included more information in the revised version (line 672-683). Given the complexity of these unusual processes, we recommend an excellent review by Prof. Eduardo Orias (PMID: 28715961), which offers detailed explanations of the process and related concepts (line 685-686).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the explanation of co-stimulation is not completely clear (lines 49-60). Initially, direct cell-cell contact is mentioned, but later it is mentioned that &quot;all cells become fully stimulated&quot;, even when unequal ratios are used. Is physical contact necessary? Or is this due to the &quot;secrete mating-essential factors&quot; (line 601)? These details are essential, for interpretation of the results and need to be explained better.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry that we didn’t realize the term “contact” is not precise enough. In Tetrahymena, physical contact is indeed necessary, but it can refer to temporary interactions. Unlike yeast, Tetrahymena cells exhibit rapid movement, swimming randomly in the medium. Occasionally, two cells may come into contact, but they quickly separate instead of sticking together. Even newly formed loose pairs often become separated. As a result, one cell can come into contact with numerous others and stimulate them. We have clarified this aspect in the revised version (line 50-51, 57).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract and introduction: Sexes are not mating types. In general, mating types refer to systems in which there is no obvious asymmetry between the gametes, beyond the compatibility system. When there is a physiological difference such as size or motility, sexes are used. This distinction is of importance because in many species mating types and sexes can occur together, with each sex being able to have either (when two) or multiple mating types. An example are SI in angiosperms as used as an example by the authors or mating types in filamentous fungi. See Billiard et al. 2011 [PMID: 21489122] for a good explanation and argumentation for the importance of making this distinction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the expression in the revised version (line 20, 38, 40, 45).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>I really enjoyed reading this manuscript and I think a few tweaks in the writing/data presentation could greatly improve the experience for the reader:</p><p>(1) The information about your previous work in identifying downstream proteins CDK19, CYC9, and CIP1 (lines 170-173) could be directly presented in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved this information in the introduction in the revised version (line 74-77).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For a reader who is not familiar with Tetrahymena, a few more details on how reporter and knock-out lines are generated would be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>We introduced the knock-out method in Figure 2 – figure supplement 1B, HA-tag method in Figure 3A, and MTB2-eGFP construction method in Figure 4E. In addition, we introduced how co-stimulation markers observed in Materials and Methods (line 404-410)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figures 5 and 6: clarify the types of pairing and treatments that were done directly in the figure (eg. adding additional labels).

Additionally, we added a figure to illustrate the theoretical mating-type recognition model between WT cells and ΔCDK19, ΔCYC9 cells, MTAxc, MTBxc proteins, and ΔMTA, ΔMTB cells (Figure 2 – figure supplement 1D-G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Lines 191-196: the fact that cells expressing multiple mating types can self goes against an active self-rejection system - if this is the case there should be self-rejection among all expressed mating types. Unless non-self recognition is an active process and self-recognition is simply the absence of non-self recognition. The authors briefly mention this in lines 263-265, but it would be interesting to expand and clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that Reviewer #1 notice the interesting selfing phenotype of the MTB2-eGFP (MTVI background) strain. We further discussed it in the revised manuscript (line 298-306).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors briefly mention the possibility of different mating types using different recognition mechanisms (lines 255-260), based on the big differences in the size of the mating-specific region of MT proteins. Following this and the weakness nr. 2, I think it would be pertinent to gather and present more information on the properties and structures of the mating-type specific regions of MT proteins. Simple in silico analysis of motifs, structure, etc. could help clarify the role of these regions. It seems more parsimonious that MT proteins would have variable mating type specific regions that account for the recognition of the different mating types, and conserved cytoplasmic functions that could trigger a single downstream signaling cascade. It would be interesting to know the authors' opinion on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful for this suggestion. Actually, we are currently working on determining the 3D structure of MTRC. The Alphafold2 prediction indicates that the MT-specific region is comprised of seven global β-sheets, resembling the structure of immunoglobulins (Ig). Our most recent cryo-EM results have revealed a ~15Å structure, aligning well with the prediction. However, the main challenge lies in the low expression levels, both in Tetrahymena and insect/mammal cells. We anticipate obtaining more detailed results soon. Therefore, we prefer to present the MT recognition model with robust experimental evidence in the future, and didn’t discuss too much on this aspect in the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Adding a figure including a proposed model, as well as expanding the discussion on the points presented as &quot;weaknesses&quot; would help clarify the ideas/hypothesis on how the mating recognition works. I think this would really elevate the paper and help highlight the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a figure to introduce the model and the weaknesses in the revised version (Figure 7, line 656-665).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Line 202-203: It is far-fetched to infer subcellular localization based on the data presented here, couterstaining with other dyes and antibodies specific to certain cell components, as well as negative control images, are required.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We attempted to stain cell components using various dyes and antibodies. Unfortunately, we found that cell surface and cilia (especially oral cilia) is very easy to give a false positive signal.

Unfortunately, we didn’t find a suitable cilia-specific antibody yet. Instead, we employed MS analysis to confirm the presence of cilia proteins in this sample (line 195-196, Figure 4–Source data 1).

Therefore, we did not use the term “MTRC” here.

There are three kinds of pictures: “not incubated”, “WT pre-incubated by mutant” and “mutant pre-incubated by WT”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The methods used to generate Figure 5 are not clearly described. I understand that the obtained xc proteins were added to the cells, and then washed, after which a test was performed mixing WT-VI and WT-VII cells. Were both cells treated? Or only one of the strains? The explanation for the reused washing medium is not clear and the method is not indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>Both cells are treated. More details are provided in the revised manuscript (line 230-231, 633-634, 637-639, Fig. 5). To prepare the starvation medium containing mating-essential factors, cells were starved in fresh starvation medium for ~16 hours. Subsequently, cells were removed by three rounds of centrifugation (1000 g, 3 min) (line 330-332).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, the figures are difficult to understand without repeated inquiries in the captions. Give more information in the figures themselves.</p></disp-quote><p>More information is introduced in the figure (Fig. 2C, Fig. 3B, Fig. 4A, B, D, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).</p></body></sub-article></article>
