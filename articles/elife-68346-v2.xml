regulation is limited by incomplete knowledge of the mutations that tune allostery. Are these mutations few or abundant, structurally localized or distributed? To examine this, we conducted saturation mutagenesis of a synthetic allosteric switch in which Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is regulated by a blue-light sensitive LOV2 domain. Using a high-throughput assay wherein DHFR catalytic activity is coupled to <italic>E. coli</italic> growth, we assessed the impact of 1548 viable DHFR single mutations on allostery. Despite most mutations being deleterious to activity, fewer than 5% of mutations had a statistically significant influence on allostery. Most allostery disrupting mutations were proximal to the LOV2 insertion site. In contrast, allostery enhancing mutations were structurally distributed and enriched on the protein surface. Combining several allostery enhancing mutations yielded near-additive improvements to dynamic range. Our results indicate a path toward optimizing allosteric function through variation at surface sites.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many proteins exhibit a property called ‘allostery’. In allostery, an input signal at a specific site of a protein – such as a molecule binding, or the protein absorbing a photon of light – leads to a change in output at another site far away. For example, the protein might catalyze a chemical reaction faster or bind to another molecule more tightly in the presence of the input signal. This protein ‘remote control’ allows cells to sense and respond to changes in their environment. An ability to rapidly engineer new allosteric mechanisms into proteins is much sought after because this would provide an approach for building biosensors and other useful tools. One common approach to engineering new allosteric regulation is to combine a ‘sensor’ or input region from one protein with an ‘output’ region or domain from another.</p><p>When researchers engineer allostery using this approach of combining input and output domains from different proteins, the difference in the output when the input is ‘on’ versus ‘off’ is often small, a situation called ‘modest allostery’. McCormick et al. wanted to know how to optimize this domain combination approach to increase the difference in output between the ‘on’ and ‘off’ states.</p><p>More specifically, McCormick et al. wanted to find out whether swapping out or mutating specific amino acids (each of the individual building blocks that make up a protein) enhances or disrupts allostery. They also wanted to know if there are many possible mutations that change the effectiveness of allostery, or if this property is controlled by just a few amino acids. Finally, McCormick et al. questioned where in a protein most of these allostery-tuning mutations were located.</p><p>To answer these questions, McCormick et al. engineered a new allosteric protein by inserting a light-sensing domain (input) into a protein involved in metabolism (a metabolic enzyme that produces a biomolecule called a tetrahydrofolate) to yield a light-controlled enzyme. Next, they introduced mutations into both the ‘input’ and ‘output’ domains to see where they had a greater effect on allostery.</p><p>After filtering out mutations that destroyed the function of the output domain, McCormick et al. found that only about 5% of mutations to the ‘output’ domain altered the allosteric response of their engineered enzyme. In fact, most mutations that disrupted allostery were found near the site where the ‘input’ domain was inserted, while mutations that enhanced allostery were sprinkled throughout the enzyme, often on its protein surface. This was surprising in light of the commonly-held assumption that mutations on protein surfaces have little impact on the activity of the ‘output’ domain. Overall, the effect of individual mutations on allostery was small, but McCormick et al. found that these mutations can sometimes be combined to yield larger effects.</p><p>McCormick et al.’s results suggest a new approach for optimizing engineered allosteric proteins: by introducing mutations on the protein surface. It also opens up new questions: mechanically, how do surface sites affect allostery? In the future, it will be important to characterize how combinations of mutations can optimize allosteric regulation, and to determine what evolutionary trajectories to high performance allosteric ‘switches’ look like.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dihydrofolate reductase</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>LOV2</kwd><kwd>deep mutational scanning</kwd><kwd>coevolution</kwd><kwd>sectors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAREER Award 1942354</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reynolds</surname><given-names>Kimberly A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Data Driven Discovery Initiative GBMF4557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reynolds</surname><given-names>Kimberly A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deep mutational scanning of a synthetic allosteric chimera revealed that a sparse set of mutations on the protein surface improved regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In allosteric regulation, protein activity is modulated by an input effector signal spatially removed from the active site. Allostery is a desirable engineering target because it can yield sensitive, reversible, and rapid control of protein activity in response to diverse inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dagliyan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pincus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raman et al., 2014</xref>). One common approach for achieving allosteric regulation in both engineered and evolved systems is through domain insertion: the transposition, recombination, or otherwise fusion of an ‘input’ domain into an ‘output’ domain of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aroul-Selvam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dagliyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ostermeier and Benkovic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nadler et al., 2016</xref>). In natural proteins, domain insertions and rearrangements play a key role in generating regulatory diversity, with kinases serving as a prototypical example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peisajovich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). In engineered proteins, domain insertions have been used to generate fluorescent metabolite biosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nadler et al., 2016</xref>), sugar-regulated TEM-1 β-lactamase variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guntas et al., 2005</xref>), and a myriad of light-controlled proteins including kinases, ion channels, guanosine triphosphatases, guanine exchange factors, and Cas9 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dagliyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karginov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toettcher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shaaya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coyote-Maestas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richter et al., 2016</xref>). In all cases, domain insertion provides a powerful means to confer new regulation in a modular fashion.</p><p>However, naively created domain insertion chimeras sometimes exhibit relatively modest allosteric dynamic range, with small observed differences in activity between the constitutive and activated states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). These fusions then require further optimization by either evolution or empirical mutagenesis, but general principles to guide this process are largely absent. Which mutations tune or improve an allosteric system? Because we lack comprehensive studies of allosteric mutational effects in either engineered or natural systems, it remains unclear whether such mutations are common or rare, and what magnitude of allosteric effect we might typically expect for single mutations. Additionally, it is not obvious if such mutations are structurally distributed or localized (for example, to the insertion site). Answers to these questions would inform practical strategies for optimizing engineered systems and provide insight into the evolution of natural multi-domain regulation in proteins.</p><p>To address these questions, we performed a deep mutational scan of a synthetic allosteric switch: a fusion between the <italic>E. coli</italic> metabolic enzyme Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR) and the blue-light sensing LOV2 domain from <italic>A. sativa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>). This modestly allosteric chimera shows a 30% increase in DHFR velocity in response to light. Focusing on mutations to the DHFR residues, we found that only a small fraction (4.4%) of the mutations that retained DHFR activity had a statistically significant impact on allostery. Individual mutations exhibited generally modest effect sizes; the most allosteric single mutant characterized (H124Q) yielded a twofold increase in velocity in response to light relative to the starting construct. Structurally, allostery disrupting mutations tended to cluster near the LOV2 insertion site and were modestly enriched at both conserved and co-evolving amino acid positions. In contrast, allostery enhancing mutations were distributed across the protein, and strongly associated with the protein surface. We observed that combining a few of these mutations yielded near-additive enhancements to allosteric dynamic range. Collectively, our data elucidates practical strategies for optimizing engineered systems, and shows that weakly conserved, structurally distributed surface sites can contribute to allosteric tuning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of an unoptimized allosteric fusion of DHFR-LOV2</title><p>To begin our study of allostery tuning mutations, we selected a previously characterized synthetic allosteric fusion between DHFR and LOV2 generated in earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>). In this fusion, the LOV2 domain of <italic>A. sativa</italic> is inserted between residues 120 and 121 of the <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR βF-βG loop; we refer to this construct as DL121 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The choice of LOV2 insertion site was guided by Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA), an approach for analyzing coevolution between pairs of amino acids across a homologous protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivoire et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lockless and Ranganathan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Halabi et al., 2009</xref>). A central finding of SCA is that co-evolving groups of amino acids, termed <italic>sectors</italic>, often form physically contiguous networks in the tertiary structure that link allosteric sites to active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Halabi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Süel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>). To create the DL121 fusion, Lee et al. followed the guiding principle that sector connected surface sites in DHFR might serve as preferred sites (or ‘hot spots’) for the introduction of allosteric regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). The resulting DL121 fusion covalently attaches the N- and C-termini of LOV2 into a sector connected surface on DHFR, and displays a twofold increase in DHFR hydride transfer rate (<italic>k<sub>hyd</sub></italic>) in response to blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). Under steady-state conditions, we measured a 28% increase in the turnover number (<italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>) in response to light and a statistically insignificant change in the Michaelis constant (K<sub>m</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, the DL121 fusion is modestly allosteric in vitro. As DHFR has no known natural allosteric regulation, the LOV2 insertion confers a new, evolutionarily unoptimized regulatory input.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The DL121 DHFR/LOV2 fusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Composite structures of the individual DHFR and LOV2 domains (PDB ID: 1R × 2 and 2V0U), indicating the LOV2 insertion site between positions 120 and 121 of DHFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sawaya and Kraut, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Halavaty and Moffat, 2007</xref>).

The βF-βG loop, where LOV2 is inserted, is highlighted in cyan. In native DHFR, hydrogen bonds between this loop (Asp122) and the Met20 loop (Gly15, Glu17) are thought to stabilize the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sawaya and Kraut, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schnell et al., 2004</xref>).

DHFR catalyzes the reduction of 7,8-dihydrofolate (DHF) to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF) using NADPH as a co-factor. THF then serves as a one-carbon donor and acceptor in the synthesis of thymidine, purine nucleotides, serine, glycine, and methionine. Because of these critical metabolic functions, DHFR activity is strongly linked to growth rate, and under appropriate conditions, <italic>E. coli</italic> growth rate can be used as a proxy for DHFR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>). Prior work found that the modest in vitro allosteric effect of DL121 conferred a selectable growth rate advantage in vivo: when an <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR deletion strain (ER2566 <italic>ΔfolAΔthyA</italic>) was complemented with DL121, the resulting strain grew 17% faster in the light than in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, DL121 is a system where: (1) allosteric control is rapidly and reversibly applied, (2) the allosteric effects on activity can be readily quantified both in vitro and in vivo, and (3) there remains potential for large improvements in regulatory dynamic range through mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A high-throughput assay to resolve small changes in DHFR catalytic activity</title><p>Our goal was to measure the effect of every single amino acid mutation in DHFR on the allosteric regulation of DL121. To do this, we aimed to follow a strategy loosely akin to a double mutant cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The starting DL121 construct shows so-called V-type allostery, in which the effector (light) regulates the catalytic turnover number (<italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson and Fenton, 2016</xref>). Thus, allostery can be quantified as the ratio of <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> between lit and dark states. More generally, allostery might be considered as a ratio of velocities (v = <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> [S]/(K<sub>m</sub> + [S])) between the lit and dark states, as the allosteric effector could regulate turnover, substrate affinity, or both. In either case, we defined the allosteric effect of mutation as the fold change in allosteric regulation upon mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, blue box). We sought to infer this quantity for every mutation in a saturation mutagenesis library of DHFR by using growth rate as a proxy for catalytic activity.</p><p>As in prior work, we measured the growth rate of many <italic>E. coli</italic> strains in parallel by using next generation sequencing (NGS) to monitor the frequency of individual DHFR mutants over time in a mixed culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>).

First, we grew the <italic>E. coli</italic> populations in a turbidostat outfitted with blue LEDs to activate LOV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The turbidostat maintains each culture in exponential growth by dynamically sensing optical density and adjusting media dilution rate accordingly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Toprak et al., 2013</xref>; this ensures near-constant media conditions and eliminates the need for manual serial dilutions. Second, we selected media conditions – M9 minimal media with 0.4% glucose and 1 µg/ml thymidine supplementation – in which growth rate can resolve subtle differences in catalytic activity near the DL121 fusion. We evaluated the resolution of our assay using a ‘standard curve’ of 11 point mutations of known catalytic activity in non-chimeric DHFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Under these conditions, we observed a log-linear relationship between relative growth rate and DHFR velocity over nearly four orders of magnitude; this relationship saturates (plateaus) for the most active mutants (WT and M42F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, the relative growth rate and velocity of DL121 were near the center of the linear regime of our assay.</p><p>In using velocity to describe our data, we have incorporated two assumptions: (1) we presume minimal variation in protein abundance between mutants (enzyme concentration is equal to one) and (2) we fix the substrate concentration at 25 µM, which was previously reported as the endogenous concentration for WT <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>). Individual mutations may cause variation in protein abundance, but because allostery concerns a relative change in activity, light-independent differences in abundance can be removed by appropriate normalization (as discussed further below).</p><p>As previously observed, the exponential divergence of mutants with different growth rates in a population makes it possible to detect even small biochemical effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breslow et al., 2008</xref>). More specifically, we can discriminate a change of ±0.02 µM<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>-</sup>1 in catalytic power (<italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>/K<sub>m</sub>) under these conditions. This level of precision is on par with – and in some cases better than – literature-reported errors for in vitro steady state kinetics measurements of DHFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wagner et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 1994</xref>).

Prior work has found that deleterious mutations are enriched at evolutionarily conserved positions and within the protein sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLaughlin et al., 2012</xref>). The DHFR sector was defined by analyzing coevolution in a multiple sequence alignment of native DHFR domains, so we wished to examine if sector positions were indeed critical to function in the chimeric DL121 fusion. Good correspondence between the DHFR sector, evolutionary conservation, and deleterious mutations in DL121 would provide confidence that the core functional elements of native DHFR remain intact in the chimera. The vast majority of mutations were at least modestly deleterious to growth, with a median relative growth rate of −0.084 in the dark and −0.083 in the light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A cluster of beneficial mutations was observed just before the LOV2 insertion site at position 121 in both conditions, suggesting some potential to compensate for the inserted LOV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The overall distribution of fitness effects shows some differences relative to prior DMS studies of natural proteins including native <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garst et al., 2017</xref>). First, the distribution of fitness effects for mutations in natural proteins is often centered around neutral, implying a certain degree of mutational robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLaughlin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stiffler et al., 2015</xref>). Secondly, DMS of native DHFR – under experimental conditions designed to resolve mutational effects near WT – revealed many beneficial (activating) mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>). There are two explanations for the relative paucity of beneficial and neutral mutations in the present dataset. First, the DL121 fusion is comparably less robust because the unoptimized LOV2 insertion introduces an initial compromise to DHFR function. Secondly, the conditions of our assay (both expression and media) differ from prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>) and were selected to resolve mutational effects near DL121; consequently, mutations with native-like (or better) activity are in the saturating, non-linear regime of our assay.</p><p>To identify the slowest growing – and presumably near, or entirely, inactivating – mutations, we applied an empirical growth rate cutoff of −0.13 to the lit and dark growth rates. This corresponds to the growth rate for DL121 D27N; D27N is an active site mutation that strongly reduces the activity of WT DHFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). The DL121 D27N mutant grows very slowly in the conditions of our assay and is inviable in the absence of thymidine supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). We found that mutations with growth rates at or below this cutoff (including the null mutants) were significantly enriched in both the sector (p=7.9×10<sup>−8</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) and at evolutionarily conserved positions (p=8.7×10<sup>−20</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). When mapped to the WT DHFR structure, positions enriched for deleterious mutations surround the active site and co-factor binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), structurally overlap with the sector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), and include a number of positions known to play a critical role in WT DHFR catalysis (e.g. W22, D27, M42, and L54) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howell et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fierke et al., 1987</xref>). These data are consistent with the view that sector positions continue to play a key role in conferring DHFR catalytic activity in the DL121 fusion.</p><p>Following the thinking that (near) inactive DHFR variants are both inherently non-allosteric and associated with the least reproducible growth rate measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), we removed the set of 1247 slow-growing (growth rate &lt;−0.13) and null mutations prior to the analysis of allostery. The retained 1548 mutations – representing 51% of the growth assay data – remain well-distributed between the DL121 surface, core, sector, and evolutionarily conserved positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Given the log-linear relationship between growth rate and DHFR velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), subtracting growth rates approximates log-ratios of velocities. Thus, we estimated the allosteric effect of mutation by taking the difference in the average relative growth rates between lit and dark conditions:</p><p>In the above equations, rgr is relative growth rate (which is directly measured in our sequencing-based assay) and gr refers to absolute growth rate.

To confirm function of the fused LOV2 domain, we also measured relaxation of the FMN chromophore following light stimulation and collected absorbance spectra before and after the application of light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>). As expected, all the characterized DL121 mutations (with the exception of DL121-C450S) retained LOV2 domains with light-responsive absorbance spectra and chromophore relaxation constants similar to the unmutated DL121 construct. Evaluating the light dependence of DHFR activity, the change in K<sub>m</sub> value between lit and dark conditions was neither significant for any point mutation nor correlated to allosteric effect size (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.003) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>). The K<sub>m</sub> values for all characterized mutants (0.15–1.9 µM) were similar to that of unmutated DL121 (~1 µM). Instead, we observed that light predominantly modulated catalytic turnover (<italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>).The ratio of <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> in the light relative to the dark ranged from 1.1 (for the non-allosteric DL121-C450S construct) to 2.0 (for the most allosteric point mutation, H124Q) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>). For reference, the starting DL121 construct has a lit:dark <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> ratio of 1.3. So why might the characterized allosteric mutations predominantly effect <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>? One plausible explanation is that the conditions of our in vivo experiments fall within a pseudo-zero-order kinetics regime ([DHF]&gt;&gt;K<sub>m</sub>). In this scenario, light-associated changes in K<sub>m</sub> would have little impact on enzyme velocity (and accordingly growth rate) and go undetected in our assay. Consistent with this, the in vivo concentration of DHF for wildtype <italic>E. coli</italic> (25 µM) is well above the K<sub>m</sub> for all the characterized DL121 mutations. Alternatively, it could be that the biophysical mechanism of the DL121 fusion somehow makes it more energetically feasible for light to modulate <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> than K<sub>m</sub>. In any case, the 1.3- to 2-fold changes in <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> translate to similar fold changes in enzyme velocity. A comparison of the in vitro allosteric effect on velocity to the in vivo growth rate effect yields a near-linear relationship with a correlation coefficient of 0.83 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, these data show that our growth-based assay is quantitatively reporting on changes in allostery, and that the allosteric mutations identified here modulate DHFR activity through changes in catalytic turnover number.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The structural pattern of allostery tuning mutations</title><p>Next, we examined the distribution of allostery-tuning mutations on the WT DHFR tertiary structure. The 13 allostery disrupting mutations localized to six DHFR positions concentrated near the LOV2 insertion site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). More specifically, 90% of the allostery disrupting mutations occurred within 10 Å of the DHFR 121 cα atom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These mutations were modestly enriched in the protein sector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Overall, the observed spatial distribution suggests these mutations may disrupt allostery by altering local structural contacts needed to ensure communication between DHFR and LOV2.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Structural distribution of allosteric mutations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sites of allostery disrupting mutations (orange spheres).

These enhancing mutations were never found in the protein sector and were thus statistically significantly depleted from the protein sector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). This relationship – wherein allostery disrupting mutations were modestly enriched and allostery enhancing mutations were strongly depleted from the sector – also holds when defining the set of allosteric mutations at a relaxed cutoff of p=0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Given the prior finding that <italic>sector connected</italic> surface sites were hotspots for introducing allostery in DHFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>), we also examined the association between allostery-influencing mutations and two other groups of DHFR positions: (1) surface sites that are either within or contacting the sector and (2) surface sites that are only contacting the sector (but not within-sector). As for the analysis of sector positions only, we observed a statistically significant depletion of allostery enhancing mutations and enrichment of allostery disrupting mutations when considering the set of surface sites within or contacting the sector. This finding holds true over a range of significance thresholds for defining sector and allosteric mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). When considering the set of positions that contact (but are not within) the sector, we did not observe a statistically significant association at nearly all cutoffs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>). Indeed, a number of allostery enhancing mutations do not contact the sector at all and occur in surface exposed loops (e.g. from residues 84 to 89, and from 116 to 119). So, counter to our expectations, the optimization of allostery did not occur at sector connected sites or even proximal to the LOV2 insertion site. Instead, structurally distributed and weakly conserved surface sites provided a basis for tuning and enhancing allosteric regulation regardless of sector connectivity.</p><p>Taken together, our data show that many distributed surface sites can make modest contributions to allosteric regulation. Can these mutants be combined to further improve allosteric dynamic range? To test this, we created two mutant constructs by combining the most potent allostery enhancing mutations as characterized in vitro: the double mutant DL121-M16A,H124Q, and the triple mutant DL121-M16A,D87A,H124Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). For both constructs, we measured steady-state catalytic parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) and verified LOV2 function through absorbance spectra and chromophore relaxation kinetics experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, all three mutations exhibited near-log-additive improvements in allostery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The DL121-M16A,H124Q fusion exhibits a 2.74 fold increase in velocity upon light activation while the triple mutant shows a 3.87-fold increase in velocity. For both mutant combinations, the improvement in allostery is realized by reducing the dark state (constitutive) activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). The serial addition of allostery enhancing mutations also reduced the overall catalytic activity of DHFR, suggesting that further improvement could be obtained by combining these mutations with a non-allosteric but activity-enhancing mutation. Overall, these data suggest that a naïve sector connected fusion can be gradually evolved toward increased allosteric dynamic range through the stepwise accumulation of single mutations at structurally distributed surface sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Combinatorial effect of allostery-enhancing mutations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Location of M16, D87, and H124 (blue spheres).

Overall, allostery-influencing mutations were rare – just under 5% of viable mutations had statistically distinguishable effects on the lit and dark states of the DL121 fusion. We found that mutations at conserved and co-evolving (sector) positions were often deleterious to DHFR function and infrequently influenced allosteric regulation. In a few cases, sector mutations served to disrupt allostery; nearly all allostery disrupting mutations were localized to the LOV2 insertion site on DHFR. Counter to our expectations, allostery enhancing mutations were distributed across the DHFR structure, depleted from the sector, and enriched on the protein surface. When considered individually, the allostery-enhancing mutations had modest effects (up to twofold) on regulation, but (at least in some cases) they can be combined to yield near-additive improvements in dynamic range. A triple mutant (DL121-M16A,D87A,H124Q) rationally designed using our point mutant data produces a 3.87-fold increase in velocity upon light stimulation, up from the 1.3-fold allosteric effect of our starting construct.</p><p>These results should be considered in the context of our experiment: the DL121 fusion begins with sharply reduced DHFR activity, and our experiment intentionally used relatively stringent DHFR selection conditions to better resolve small differences in kinetic parameters. Thus, it is unsurprising that a large fraction of DHFR mutations in our library were deleterious, with an appreciable fraction near-inactive. This result echoes prior studies showing that the fraction of deleterious mutations (and mutational robustness) is strongly modulated by a variety of factors, including purifying selection strength and expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stiffler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lundin et al., 2018</xref>). Given the finding that stabilizing mutations can often improve protein evolvability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lundin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>), it would be interesting to examine how the distribution of mutational effects on both DL121 function and allostery would change in the background of a stability (and/or activity) enhancing mutation to DL121. While we observed that the number of allosteric mutations is few and the effect sizes are generally small in our model system, a previous study of allostery tuning mutations in pyruvate kinase indicated that up to 30% of mutations can tune allostery, with the maximum observed effect size approaching 22-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang and Fenton, 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, our data serve to illuminate the pattern of mutational effects on a newly established (and unoptimized) domain fusion – the presumptive first step toward regulation in a number of both natural and synthetic systems.</p><p>Interestingly, we observe a seeming disparity between the sites where we were able to introduce new allosteric regulation by domain fusion (in our earlier work), and the sites where allosteric tuning takes place (in this work). Previously, Reynolds et al. found that sector connected surface sites served as hotspots for the introduction of new light-based regulation in DHFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, allosteric regulation was never obtained when the LOV2 domain was inserted at a non-sector connected site. In contrast, in this work, we observed that allostery enhancing mutations were depleted both within the sector and at sector connected sites. For example, we observed a number of allostery enhancing mutations at positions 83–89 of the DHFR αD-βE loop, while LOV2 insertions in this region location did not initiate allostery as quantified either in vitro or in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests different structural requirements for establishing and tuning allostery in this system (and possibly others): here allostery seems to be more easily introduced at evolutionarily conserved and co-evolving sites, but once established, can be optimized through less conserved sector-peripheral residues.</p><p>Although our work focuses on a synthetic allosteric fusion, our results are broadly consistent with an emerging body of work characterizing allostery-influencing mutations in natural proteins. Together, these data point to a model in which mutations at evolutionarily conserved positions exert large (and often disruptive) effects on function while allostery is tuned at less conserved surface sites. For example, Leander et al. recently used deep mutational scanning to map the pattern of compensatory mutations that rescued allosteric function for non-allosteric tetracycline repressor (TetR) variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leander et al., 2020</xref>). In that study a ‘disrupt-and-restore’ strategy was used: an already-allosteric system was inactivated and deep mutational scanning was then used to identify compensatory mutations. While there are significant differences between rescuing a deficient variant and the optimization of a novel allosteric construct, they likewise found that the mutations at highly conserved sites were often disruptive to stability and function, while allostery-rescuing mutations occurred at weakly conserved and structurally distributed sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leander et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, mutations at ‘rheostat’ sites – weakly conserved positions distal to the site of regulation – were found to modulate allosteric control in human liver pyruvate kinase and the lactose repressor protein (lacI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campitelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, the association of allostery enhancing mutations with the protein surface hints at a possible role for solvent – and more specifically the protein hydration layer – in tuning regulation.</p><p>The finding that the allostery initiated upon naïve fusion of the DHFR and LOV2 domains can be further enhanced by single mutations implies a path to improved allosteric dynamic range by stepwise mutagenesis and selection. Three of the most allostery enhancing mutations could be combined to yield a near-additive improvement in regulatory dynamic range. This has interesting implications for both evolved and engineered allosteric systems. In evolved systems, standing mutational variation is more likely at weakly conserved surface sites (particularly under less stringent selection conditions), and this could provide a means for generating variation in allosteric regulation upon a domain fusion event. Moreover, while engineering studies sometimes use mutations near the domain insertion site to optimize regulation, our results suggest that diffuse surface site mutations could present an effective alternative. Whether by engineering or evolution, it seems that mutations at weakly conserved and structurally distributed residues can provide a path to the optimization of regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>DHFR-LOV2 121</td><td>Reynolds et al.

The reactions were then heated at 37°C for 1 hr and 65°C for 20 min.</p><p>PCR reactions were set up using 2x Q5 mastermix (NEB, cat#M0492), 10 ng of plasmid template, and 500 nM forward and reverse primers. PCR was performed in the following steps: (1) 98°C for 30 s, (2) 98°C for 10 s, (3) 55°C for 30 s, (4) 72°C for 2 min, (5) return to step 2 for 22 cycles, (6) 72°C for 5 min. 25 µL of PCR reaction was mixed with 1 µL of DpnI (NEB, cat#R0176) at 37°C for 4 hr. The samples were then purified by gel extraction and a DNA Clean and Concentrator −5 kit (Zymo Research, cat#D4014). PCR product solution were then phosphorylated with a second round of T4 PNK: 100 µL of gel-extracted PCR product,12 µL of 10x T4 ligase buffer, 5 µL of T4 PNK, 5 µL of sterile water and were incubated at 37°C for 1 hr with 90°C for 30 s. The reactions were ligated with 100 µL PNK phosphorylated PCR product, 15 µL T4 ligase (NEB, cat#M0202S), 30 µL T4 ligase buffer and, 155 µL sterile water. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 24 hr.</p><p>The concentration of each reaction was quantified by gel densitometry (ImageJ) and combined in equimolar ratios to form sublibraries. The library was divided up into four sublibraries with sublibrary 1 covering positions 1–40, sublibrary 2 covering positions 41–80, sublibrary 3 covering positions 81–120, and sublibrary 4 covering positions 121–150.

Definitions for sector identity, conservation values, and surface identity used in SectorSurfaceDefinitions.ipynb are the same as those from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>. Accessible surface area was calculated using MSMS, using a probe size of 1.4Å and excluding water as well as heteroatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanner et al., 1996</xref>). Values for total surface areas were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chothia, 1976</xref>. Together these were used to calculate relative solvent accessible surface area, and 25% was used as a cutoff for 'surface'. A surface site is considered to contact the sector if the atoms comprising the peptide bond contact *any* sector atoms. Contact is defined as the sum of the atom's Pauling radii + 20%.</p><p>To determine significant allosteric mutations, a p-value for each mutation was computed by unequal variance t-test under the null hypothesis that the lit and dark replicate measurements have equal means. Two cutoffs were used, a standard cutoff of p=0.05, and a more stringent cutoff that is adjusted to consider multiple hypothesis testing. A multiple-hypothesis testing adjusted p-value of p=0.016 was determined by Sequential Goodness of Fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvajal-Rodriguez and de Uña-Alvarez, 2011</xref>). General analysis and figures made from this data are performed in allostery_analysis.ipynb.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Dr. Tanja Kortemme for facilitating our collaboration with Samuel Thompson.

Error is calculated as standard error of the mean over three replicates. Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of the main text. (<bold>b</bold>) Fisher Exact Test p-values for the null hypothesis that the sector and inactivating mutants are independent properties. Inactivating mutations are defined as those that yield relative growth rates at or below the growth rate for DL121-D27N. Over a range of sector definitions, the null hypothesis is rejected at a confidence level of 0.05 or better, shown in red. Sector definitions were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivoire et al., 2016</xref>). (<bold>c</bold>) Fisher Exact Test p-values for the null hypothesis that conserved positions and inactivating mutants are independent. Calculations were made over a range of conservation definitions chosen to result in an equal number positions as the sector positions in Supplementary file 1b 23, 36, 40, and 49 positions respectively. In all cases, the null hypothesis is rejected at a confidence level of 0.05 or better (red), and inactivating mutations are enriched at conserved positions beyond expectation due to random chance. Conservation values are calculated as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivoire et al., 2016</xref>), and reflect the Kullback-Leibler relative entropy of amino acid frequencies at each DHFR position. (<bold>d</bold>) Fisher Exact Test p-values for the null hypothesis that the sector and allosteric mutations are independent. We compared over four sector cutoffs (as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivoire et al., 2016</xref>) and at two cutoffs for allostery significance (a standard p-value of 0.05, and an adjusted p-value of 0.016). The multiple hypothesis testing adjusted p-value was obtained by Sequential Goodness of Fit (SGoF, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvajal-Rodriguez and de Uña-Alvarez, 2011</xref>). The top table shows the association between sector positions and allostery enhancing mutations; the bottom table computes the associate between sector positions and allostery disrupting mutations. In nearly all cases, the null hypothesis is rejected at a confidence level of 0.05 or better, shown in red. (<bold>e</bold>) Fisher Exact Test p-values for the null hypothesis that the solvent accessible DHFR surface and allosteric mutations are independent. At two cutoffs for allostery (a standard p-value of 0.05, and an adjusted p-value of 0.016), the null hypothesis is rejected at a confidence level of 0.05 or better, shown in red. (<bold>f</bold>) Statistical association of allosteric mutations and surface positions that are either within or contacting the sector. Contacting was defined as two atoms within the sum of their Pauling radii plus 20%. A surface site contacts the sector if the peptide bond atoms of the surface site contact any atoms in the sector position. P-values were computed by Fisher exact test with the null hypothesis that the sector and allosteric mutations are independent. Cutoffs for sector definition as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivoire et al., 2016</xref> are shown as well as mutants determined to effect allostery either at a 95% confidence interval (p&lt;0.05) or at the multiple hypothesis testing adjusted p-value (p&lt;0.016). The null hypothesis that there is no relationship between allosteric mutations and sector or sector contacting positions on the surface of DHFR of the DL121 chimera is rejected at a confidence level of 0.05 or better over a range of cutoffs, shown in red. Allostery enhancing mutations are depleted from sector connected surface sites, while allostery disrupting mutations are enriched (in comparison with random expectation). (<bold>g</bold>) Statistical association of allosteric mutations and surface positions that are contacting the sector. In contrast to Supplementary file 1f, surface positions within the sector are excluded. Fisher Exact Test p-values were calculated for the null hypothesis that the sector and allosteric mutations are independent. Cutoffs for sector definition as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivoire et al., 2016</xref> are shown as well as mutants determined to effect allostery either at a 95% confidence interval (p&lt;0.05) or at the multiple hypothesis testing adjusted p-value (p&lt;0.016). At most cutoff combinations, there is not a statistically significant association between sector connected surface sites and either mutations that enhance (top panel) or disrupt allostery (bottom panel).</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68346-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68346-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequencing data (resulting from amplicon sequencing) have been deposited in the NCBI SRA under BioProject: PRJNA706683.

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The authors use an innovative experimental system to study how mutations can influence allosteric protein regulation. They fuse a light sensitive protein to an enzyme and examine how light can become a regulator of the enzyme. They show that allostery-improving mutations can occur on the surface of the enzyme. These experiments illustrate how allosteric regulation can evolve and be improved by mutations following protein domain fusion. This work is of broad interest for scientists interested in the structural basis of allostery, how it can be engineered into proteins and how it evolves.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structurally distributed surface sites tune allosteric regulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Georg Hochberg (Reviewer #1); Adrian Serohijos (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. You will see below changes that are recommended by the reviewers and that I would like to request. Some are comments regarding the text, missing information in the figures or supplementary figures that would better fit in the main text. Another one regards the claim about the additive effects of the mutations. The reviewers felt that the experiments or measurements were not designed to test this so it may be better to only discuss this point rather than be affirmative about the lack of non-additivity. Finally, there are few comments on results interpretation and comparison with other, already existing experiments that would help improve the manuscript if dealt with.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>McCormick et al. present a very interesting study of how mutations can affect allosteric regulation of proteins. This phenomenon is of interest to biochemists, synthetic biologists, and evolutionary biochemists. Their approach uses a synthetic fusion between an enzyme and a light regulated domain that makes the enzyme weakly regulated by light. James W. McCormick et al. perform a deep mutational single site scan to test whether single mutations in the enzyme domain can enhance or disrupt allostery. They find a small but appreciable fraction that can enhance allostery and that these mutations can in some cases be additive. These findings suggest how allosteric regulation might evolve after domain fusion: by a sequence of small effect, potentially additive substitutions. There is currently very little data about how exactly allostery evolves, so this is a valuable study and of interest to a wide audience.</p><p>There are three main conclusions that I judge to be of wide interest.</p><p>1) That allostery improving sites fall outside of so-called 'sectors'. These interconnected sets of sites, usually derived from statistical coupling analysis, have been proposed to represent allosteric networks. This works is an interesting challenge to that idea. By a well know practitioner of SCA, no less.</p><p>2) That allostery improving mutations are enriched on surface sites and have comparatively small effect sizes.</p><p>3) That at least some allostery improving mutations can act additively to produce large dynamic allosteric ranges when introduced together.</p><p>Together these data suggest that allostery can be tuned through a gradual evolutionary trajectory, in which many individually small effect steps are taken to make a protein allosteric. This view would be consistent with how early proponents of the modern synthesis would have thought about the emergence of complex traits in general.</p><p>The study is in general carefully carried out and the interpretations appropriate and interesting as far as I can tell. I find the system used to study this question quite innovative. Though I will admit that I am no expert in analyzing deep mutational scanning data. I therefore cannot comment with authority on the appropriateness of the analyses that generate fitness values from sequencing data..But based on what I can reasonably judge the major conclusions are supported.</p><p>As caveats I can only note that of course this system is somewhat artificial, but the authors are aware of this. They correctly note that it simulates what might happen directly after a domain fusion event that introduces a base level of allostery. Another criticism may be that near-additivity is only shown for a group of three mutations, so the generality of this observation is somewhat unclear. But studies on the evolvability of allostery are still so rare that this is nonetheless a valuable contribution.</p><p>I am a bit confused about exactly what correlates with growth rates. The authors initially show that k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> correlates very well with relative growth rate. When they authors then do experiments on the library in the dark and lit state, instead only the k<sub>cat</sub> value seems to matter. I was confused about this difference and didn't really understand their explanation of it. I'm pretty sure this is just a writing issue and would encourage the authors just to re-read the relevant sections with fresh eyes.</p><p>I was also unable to locate the E145R and S148C mutants in Figure 4C. They are indicated as having been characterized in vitro, is there a reason there were left out of the correlation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Allosteric regulation enables the activity of one site on a protein to modulate function at another spatially distinct site. This work by McCormick et al. studied the spectrum of mutational effects on allosteric regulation by deep mutational scanning of a well-established system of DHFR-LOV2 fused synthetic construct (Dihydrofolate reductase/Light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain). Major strengths of this work are clear statement of objectives (which mutations improve, decrease or tune an allosteric system and by how much) and well-designed approaches. As in any deep mutational scan study, the crux is in the validity of the selection system. The DHFR-LOV2 construct was previously developed by the last author (Reynolds, Cell 2011) to demonstrate the existence of &quot;protein sectors&quot; or networks of physically contiguous and coevolving amino acids that relay allosteric regulation signals. In addition, the group recently published a plasmid-based based deep mutational scan of DHFR using a folA and thyA knock-out <italic>E. coli</italic> (Thompson <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). In essence, by combining the approaches of these two earlier papers, they evaluated the effects of ~1540 single mutations on allostery. These high-throughput measurements were validated and found to be in excellent agreement with 11 DHFR point mutations whose allosteric effects were measured in isolation. Using robust statistical cut-offs, they found that only ~4.5% (69) of mutations significantly influence allostery. Mutations improving allostery are distributed and enriched on the protein surface, while mutations disrupting allostery are enriched in the LOV2 insertion site. The latter is perhaps not surprising, since LOV2 insertion at this site could have perturbed residue contacts in DHFR crucial for allosteric regulation. This also provides a valuable lesson that synthetic-coupled domains can be furthered engineered at the fusion site to improve regulatory control.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the findings from DHFR-LOV2 construct is generalizable to other proteins or to protein complexes that evolved naturally. But overall, this is a significant work towards our mechanistic understanding not only on the structural basis of protein allostery, but also of its evolution and potential optimization and design.</p><p>1) The authors claim that allosteric effects of mutations are additive (non-epistatic), which is quite profound and unintuitive. However, in there data, there is a difference between measured and expectations from log-additivity of the double (M16A,H124Q) and triple (M16A,D87A,H124Q) mutants (Figure 6B). This difference suggest epitasis for allostery. The authors may want to clarify this apparent discrepancy.</p><p>2) An interesting result is the stronger effect of allostery on k<sub>cat</sub> but not on K<sub>m</sub>. The authors surmise this from the in vivo concentration of DHF in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which is ~25 μm and well above the measured K<sub>m</sub>. In the selection system, the proteins are expressed on plasmids, presumably at concentrations higher than endogenous in vivo concentrations of DHFR. Might the protein abundance due to expression on plasmid affect this particular result?</p><p>3) Since there is a prior DHFR deep mutational scan (Thompson <italic>eLife</italic> 2020), which estimated the effects of mutations in vivo activity. I believe it would have been enlightening to correlate and compare those results with the mutational effects measured for allostery. This could shed light on the pleiotropic effects of mutations on protein properties (e.g., activity vs. allostery).</p><p>4) Overall, the manuscript is written logically and very clearly. However, the authors should consider promoting Supplementary Figure S4 as a panel in Figure 3 or Figure 4. The supplementary figure provides a compelling picture of the &quot;allosteric&quot; landscape of DHFR.</p><p>5) Reference 19 is not shown correctly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors report four key findings: 1) A highly quantitative high-throughput assay for this enzyme's function; 2) Relatively few mutants affected allostery, and those that did had a small effect; 3) Allostery-disrupting mutations tended to be near the active site; 4) Allostery-enhancing mutations tended to be on the surface.</p><p>On the whole, their conclusions were amply justified. The collected data were extraordinarily clean, and the analysis refreshingly transparent. The authors do an excellent job supporting each of their claims with evidence. The manuscript is well-written and the figures are clear. The authors do a good job in their supplement of showing the material, controls, and methods necessary to reproduce their work.</p><p>The work is well-done, but not flashy. The effect-sizes were small and the structural patterns of the mutational effects relatively weak. The sheer quality of the work, however, makes it an important and interesting addition to the literature. Further, the structural pattern of allostery-enhancement on the surface and not in &quot;sectors&quot; detected by co-evolution was intriguing and somewhat unexpected.</p><p>1. I think the manuscript could benefit from a discussion of context. The number of allostery-altering mutations and effect-sizes are small. Is this unexpected? The authors note that their results could come from the fact that they are in an artificial, unoptimized system. But what sorts of numbers/magnitudes would they expect in a naturally evolved or optimized protein?</p><p>2. I also felt there was a relative paucity of structural rationale for their findings. Do the authors have any hypotheses for why surface positions would be uniquely good at enhancing allostery in this context? They note several other studies that found unconserved sites were a bit better at tuning allostery than conserved. Does their new work provide any insights (or hints of insights) as to why this would hold?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68346.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>[…]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am a bit confused about exactly what correlates with growth rates.

Our control library consists of well characterized DHFR point mutants chosen to span a range of values for both <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> (0.05-79.2 s<sup>-1</sup>) and K<sub>m</sub> (330-1.1 µM). Somewhat by serendipity, the assumption that all of these enzyme mutations operate in a first order kinetics regime where <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> and K<sub>m</sub> contribute equally to growth rate (in the plot of growth rate vs catalytic power) yielded a high correlation.</p><p>However, the DL121 fusion construct and all characterized mutations have a K<sub>m</sub> less than 2, far below the reported in vivo DHF concentration of 25µM in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Kwon et al., 2008, Nat Chem Biol v4:602-608). If these values are accurate in vivo, we would expect the DHFR domain of our chimera to operate under a pseudo-zero-order regime where perturbations to <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> are disproportionately or entirely responsible for alterations in growth rate. Indeed, the correlation plots in Figure 4—figure supplement 6 lend evidence to this explanation. As reviewer 1 has rightly identified, this has resulted in confusion and serves to add a layer of difficulty for the reader.</p><p>To rectify this we have simplified the main text to use only velocity (V = V<sub>max</sub>[S]/(K<sub>m</sub> + [S])) at 25µM DHF to compare with growth rate, and we now use the ratio in lit/dark velocity to quantify the allosteric effect. We have altered figures 1D, 2C, 4D, 6B, as well as the text to reflect this change. The original version of Figure 4D has been moved to the supplement (Figure 4—figure supplement 6). This change allows us to relate growth rate to a consistent biochemical measure in all figures.</p><p>In using velocity to describe our data, we have incorporated two assumptions: 1) we presume minimal variation in protein abundance between mutants (enzyme concentration is equal to one) and 2) we fix the substrate concentration at 25 µM. These assumptions are described in the main text, on page 7, lines 140-146. The strong correlation between velocity and our experimentally measured growth rates (Figure 2C) indicates these assumptions are reasonable. Additionally, the observed correlation between the allosteric effect as measured in vitro and in vivo (Figure 4D) is robust to variation in the concentration of DHF above ~5 µM. Thus, the precise choice of substrate concentration is not critical to our claims (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa1fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Given that presenting our results in terms of velocity allows for a more consistent presentation of the data, we have chosen to go forward with these assumptions.</p><fig id="sa1fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68346-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was also unable to locate the E145R and S148C mutants in Figure 4C.

However, in there data, there is a difference between measured and expectations from log-additivity of the double (M16A,H124Q) and triple (M16A,D87A,H124Q) mutants (Figure 6B). This difference suggest epitasis for allostery. The authors may want to clarify this apparent discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additivity in the allosteric effects of single mutations is unintuitive. However, when considering error in the measurements, the difference between the log-additive expectation (given single mutation data) and the experimentally observed allosteric effect for the mutant combinations is statistically insignificant. This was true whether we considered the ratio of lit and dark <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> values (as in the original Figure 6B), or the ratio of lit and dark velocities (as in the updated Figure 6B). For clarity we have added the phrase: “There is not a statistically significant difference between the expected and observed allosteric effects (p = 0.07 for M16A,H124Q, p=0.48 for M16A,D87A,H124Q; as computed by unpaired t-test).” To the figure legend of Figure 6B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An interesting result is the stronger effect of allostery on k<sub>cat</sub> but not on K<sub>m</sub>. The authors surmise this from the in vivo concentration of DHF in E. coli, which is ~25 μm and well above the measured K<sub>m</sub>. In the selection system, the proteins are expressed on plasmids, presumably at concentrations higher than endogenous in vivo concentrations of DHFR. Might the protein abundance due to expression on plasmid affect this particular result?</p></disp-quote><p>Here, we understand the reviewer is asking about potential explanations for the fact that all of the biochemically characterized mutations modulated allostery through <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> rather than K<sub>m</sub>. In the manuscript, we suggest this could be a consequence of in vivo experimental conditions that reflect pseudo-zero-order kinetics ([DHF] &gt;&gt; K<sub>m</sub>). In this scenario, K<sub>m</sub> has little impact on enzyme velocity (and thus growth rate), and we would expect that our assay would predominantly detect mutations effecting <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>. This idea is loosely supported by the fact that the in vivo concentration of DHF in wildtype <italic>E. coli</italic> is 25 µM, an order of magnitude above the measured K<sub>m</sub> for the characterized DL121 mutations (~1 µM).</p><p>However, as the reviewer correctly points out, our system differs from wild type <italic>E. coli</italic> in several important ways: 1) the DL121 chimera has much-reduced activity relative to native DHFR, 2) it is expressed on a low-copy plasmid using a non-native promoter, and 3) the plasmid also contains the gene encoding thymidylate synthase, a folate metabolic enzyme which produces DHF (<italic>thyA</italic> is deleted from the chromosome in our selection strain). It is difficult to intuit what the combined effect of these changes on DHF concentration might be, and quite possible that the in vivo concentration of DHF varies from the 25 µM measurement made for wild type <italic>E. coli</italic>… potentially even in a mutant-specific fashion. Nevertheless, the strong correlation between DHFR velocity (calculated at 25 µM DHF) and relative growth rate suggests that 25 µM is a reasonable choice (new Figure 2C). Importantly, we observe that the correlation between allosteric effect (as measured in vivo) and the ratio of lit:dark enzyme velocities (as determined in vitro) is stable across a broad range of intracellular DHF concentrations (&gt;5 µM, see also the response to reviewer 1), so our results do not strongly depend on a specific choice of DHF concentration. Thus, we feel our original explanation is plausible, though the present data do not conclusively demonstrate it.</p><p>Alternatively, it could be that the allosteric mutations predominantly impact <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> for biophysical reasons. Perhaps the placement of the LOV2 domain makes it more energetically feasible for light to modulate <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> than K<sub>m</sub>. Our result that distributed surface mutations modulate allosteric regulation requires additional mechanistic explanation, and this is something we hope to address in future work. We now include a more developed and nuanced explanation of these ideas on page 14, line 285 – page 15, line 336:</p><p>“So why might the characterized allosteric mutations predominantly effect k<sub>cat</sub>? One plausible explanation is that the conditions of our in vivo experiments fall within a pseudo-zero-order kinetics regime ([DHF] &gt;&gt; K<sub>m</sub>). […] In any case, the 1.3 to 2 fold changes in k<sub>cat</sub> translate to similar fold changes in enzyme velocity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Since there is a prior DHFR deep mutational scan (Thompson eLife 2020), which estimated the effects of mutations in vivo activity. I believe it would have been enlightening to correlate and compare those results with the mutational effects measured for allostery. This could shed light on the pleiotropic effects of mutations on protein properties (e.g., activity vs. allostery).</p></disp-quote><p>In Thompson et al., the authors (which partly overlap with those of this manuscript) investigated how the presence of Lon protease reshapes the single mutation fitness landscape of DHFR. The selection conditions for that experiment were chosen to resolve changes in catalytic activity near WT DHFR, while the conditions of the present work (McCormick et al) were chosen to resolve changes in activity near the less-active DL121 chimera. Accordingly, these experiments differ in the stringency of selection in two ways: (1) McCormick et al. included 1 µg/mL thymidine supplementation in the media, while Thompson et al. did not (2) In the McCormick et al. experiments, DHFR is translated from a Shine-Delgarno consensus ribosome binding site (RBS) with high translation initiation rate, while the construct in Thompson et al. makes use of an RBS that is predicted to have 0.05x translation rate (by the RBS calculator, Salis et al., 2009, Nat Biotech v27:946). Beyond these differences in experimental setup, the LOV2 insertion in DL121 renders the DHFR domain less active, and potentially less stable. For these reasons, a strong relationship between the two datasets is not expected.</p><p>Nonetheless, we very much agree with the reviewer that it is important to have a look at the two datasets together and see what can be learned. We scaled each deep mutational scanning dataset by the appropriate reference WT growth rate (unmutated DL121 for McCormick et al., WT DHFR for Thompson et al) to facilitate comparison. In the following plot, zero represents non-growing mutations, while one represents WT-like growth. DL121 mutations classified as slow-growing are not shown (growth rate &lt; DL121 D27N).</p><p>The data reveal that DL121 was far less robust to mutation than native DHFR. Native DHFR exhibited a peak of relative growth rates near one, with a tail of deleterious mutations. In contrast, the distribution of fitness effects for DL121 was strongly skewed towards deleterious mutations with no observable peak near one. Indeed, many of the mutations that were deleterious to DL121 activity displayed growth rates near WT in the context of native DHFR (lower right quadrant of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa1fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="sa1fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68346-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Importantly, the set of null mutations for each experiment (those mutations which were too deleterious to fit a reliable growth rate) show statistically significant overlap (p-value = 0.0002), indicating that the mutations yielding gross disruptions to activity are largely the same. There was no relationship between DHFR mutations that significantly altered Lon protease sensitivity and DL121 mutations that significantly altered allostery (p-value = 0.826). Due to the significant differences in the model system, experimental design, and limited comparability between the two sets of experiments, we have refrained from including a comparison and a discussion of Thompson et al. in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Overall, the manuscript is written logically and very clearly.

I think the manuscript could benefit from a discussion of context. The number of allostery-altering mutations and effect-sizes are small. Is this unexpected? The authors note that their results could come from the fact that they are in an artificial, unoptimized system. But what sorts of numbers/magnitudes would they expect in a naturally evolved or optimized protein?</p></disp-quote><p>The number and effect size of allosteric mutations in naturally evolved systems still remains relatively uncharacterized. Quantifying the <italic>frequency</italic> of allostery-altering mutations requires a comprehensive single mutation study. We are aware of only two near-comprehensive mutagenesis experiments that have directly measured the allosteric effects of mutations in native proteins. The first is an alanine scan of human liver pyruvate kinase wherein allosteric effect was characterized in vitro (Tang and Fenton, 2017, Hum Mutat. 38:1132). The second is the pioneering work of Jeffrey Miller on lac repressor (Kleina et al., 1990, JMB 212:295, Markiewicz et al., 1994, JMB 240:421, Suckow et al., 1996, JMB 261:509). In the lac repressor studies, mutations that impact allostery are categorized with those that fail to bind inducer, so it is difficult to distill out the separate roles of mutations. For pyruvate kinase, only ~5% of mutations effected allosteric inhibition by alanine, while nearly ~30% impacted allosteric activation by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Given this, it remains difficult to define a general expectation for <italic>how many</italic> mutations tune allostery in an evolved system. However, the results on pyruvate kinase suggest it might be higher than what we observed for DL121.</p><p>These same studies also provide some insight into mutational effect sizes, and suggest that effect sizes in natural proteins can be larger than what we observed here. Tang et al. write that “most mutations that increased allosteric inhibition by alanine only did so marginally”, though they did identify a single mutation that increased alanine inhibition by six-fold. They also reported a single mutation of pyruvate kinase that increased allosteric activation by 22-fold. With further study – including deep mutational scans of natural allosteric systems – we should gain a better appreciation of how our results (in a synthetic system) compare to more optimized or evolved systems.</p><p>To provide this additional context, we have added a reference to Tang and Fenton, on page 22 – lines 447-450:</p><p>“While we observed that the number of allosteric mutations is few and the effect sizes are generally small, a previous study of allostery tuning mutations in pyruvate kinase indicated that up to 30% of mutations can tune allostery, with the maximum effect size approaching 22-fold [54].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I also felt there was a relative paucity of structural rationale for their findings. Do the authors have any hypotheses for why surface positions would be uniquely good at enhancing allostery in this context? They note several other studies that found unconserved sites were a bit better at tuning allostery than conserved. Does their new work provide any insights (or hints of insights) as to why this would hold?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with the reviewer – we intentionally provide only limited structural rationale for our findings. While the experiments here map the extent, distribution, and strength of allosteric mutations on an unoptimized allosteric system, they do not provide information on the mechanism by which this allosteric signal is modulated. Beyond briefly mentioning a possible role for solvent and the protein hydration layer (p.24, lines 485-487), we have refrained from commenting about the structural mechanism of allostery from a concern of unsupported claims and misrepresenting our findings. While a mechanistic analysis of these mutations is out of the scope of this work, we strongly agree our findings now demand biophysical explanation. This is an active area of interest and the subject of ongoing research in our laboratory.</p></body></sub-article></article>
