A polymorphism in <italic>FAAH</italic> (FAAH C385A) reduces FAAH expression, increases anandamide levels, and increases the risk of obesity. Nevertheless, some studies have found no association between FAAH C385A and obesity. We investigated whether the environmental context governs the impact of FAAH C385A on metabolic outcomes. Using a C385A knock-in mouse model, we found that FAAH A/A mice are more susceptible to glucocorticoid-induced hyperphagia, weight gain, and activation of hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK inhibition occluded the amplified hyperphagic response to glucocorticoids in FAAH A/A mice. FAAH knockdown exclusively in agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons mimicked the exaggerated feeding response of FAAH A/A mice to glucocorticoids. FAAH A/A mice likewise presented exaggerated orexigenic responses to ghrelin, while FAAH knockdown in AgRP neurons blunted leptin anorectic responses. Together, the FAAH A/A genotype amplifies orexigenic responses and decreases anorexigenic responses, providing a putative mechanism explaining the diverging human findings.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glucocorticoids</kwd><kwd>endocannabinoids</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>FAAH</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Matthew N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>953881</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chelikani</surname><given-names>Prasanth K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balsevich</surname><given-names>Georgia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009192</institution-id><institution>Alberta Innovates</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balsevich</surname><given-names>Georgia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genetic knock-in mouse model reveals that the endocrine state governs the effect of the common fatty acid amide hydrolase C385A variant on body weight through a hypothalamic-mediated mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since 1975, the prevalence of worldwide obesity has nearly tripled and has reached epidemic proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>). An incomplete understanding surrounding the etiology of obesity has hindered the development of therapeutic interventions. Regardless, it is well known that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to its development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodarzi, 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is important to identify how specific genetic and environmental factors interact to contribute to the mechanisms underlying the etiology of obesity.</p><p>The endocannabinoid system (ECS), comprised of two receptors (CB1 and CB2), endogenous cannabinoids (<italic>N</italic>-arachidonoylethanolamide, [anandamide], AEA and 2-arachidonoylglycerol), and their synthetic and degradative enzymes, is recognized as a powerful regulator of energy homeostasis and body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mazier et al., 2015</xref>). In general, activation of the ECS promotes energy storage, food intake, and increased weight gain. Therefore, components of the ECS are perfectly positioned to moderate individual susceptibility to obesity. In humans, there is a common genetic variant in the gene for fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sipe et al., 2002</xref>), the primary enzyme responsible for the inactivation of the endocannabinoid AEA. This missense mutation in FAAH (C385A; rs324420) destabilizes the FAAH protein, reduces AEA metabolism, and increases AEA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sipe et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, increased body mass index (BMI) has been associated with the low-expressing FAAH variant (A-allele carriers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Monteleone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sipe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). This agrees with the well-known role of AEA to stimulate feeding and enhance energy storage through the activation of CB1 receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mazier et al., 2015</xref>). However, the human data surrounding the C385A variant of FAAH and body weight regulation are oftentimes conflicting, with some studies showing no effect of FAAH C385A on metabolic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jensen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lieb et al., 2009</xref>). The conflicting findings may be attributed to differences in an individualâs environmental context and resulting endocrine milieu. In this regard, gene Ã environment interactions could govern whether the FAAH C385A genotype affects obesity susceptibility under particular environmental contexts.</p><p>Environmental conditions dictate an individualâs physiological endocrine state. For example, chronic stress and high fat diet feeding are associated with shifts in levels of circulating hormones that regulate appetite and energy homeostasis, including, but not limited to, glucocorticoids (GCs), ghrelin, and leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouassida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwarz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ulrich-Lai and Ryan, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the metabolic actions of orexigenic signals, such as GCs and ghrelin, increase endocannabinoid signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balsevich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edwards and Abizaid, 2016</xref>). By contrast, the anorectic peptide leptin suppresses endocannabinoid signaling to mediate its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balsevich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Marzo et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, differences in FAAH expression, due to distinct genetic FAAH variants, may influence the metabolic outcomes resulting from shifts in endocrine states. Specifically, we have previously shown that chronic exposure to GCs leads to obesity through an endocannabinoid-mediated mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowles et al., 2015</xref>). It was likewise shown that GCs increase the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), through a CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism in the hypothalamus to promote weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scerif et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed hypothalamic AMPK plays an integral role in the regulation of feeding and body weight, where its activation leads to increased feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Minokoshi et al., 2004</xref>). Similar to GCs, the orexigenic gastric hormone ghrelin increases the activity of hypothalamic AMPK and consequently feeding through an CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kola et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, we hypothesized that the discrepancies in the human literature for FAAH C385A and body weight outcomes are attributed to differences in their environmental context and ultimately their endocrine milieu. Therefore, we sought to characterize the behavioral, cellular, and molecular changes associated with the FAAH C385A variant in response to GC (corticosterone [CORT]) exposure using the FAAH C385A knock-in mouse model, recapitulating the common human mutation in the <italic>FAAH</italic> gene. We furthermore assessed a role for FAAH in ghrelin- and leptin-dependent feeding outcomes to determine the generalizability of these effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Body weight and body composition are similar between FAAH C/C and FAAH A/A mice under basal conditions</title><p>As a first step, we examined the metabolic outcomes arising in FAAH C/C (wild-type [WT]) and FAAH A/A (HOM) mice under baseline conditions. FAAH C/C and FAAH A/A mice presented similar body weights, fat mass, and lean mass at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Yet despite no difference in body weight or composition, there was a genotype Ã time trend (p=0.082) for 24 hr cumulative food intake, whereby post hoc analysis indicated that FAAH A/A mice present decreased food intake compared to FAAH C/C mice. In support of this finding, 24 hr energy expenditure was lower in FAAH A/A mice compared to FAAH C/C mice. Furthermore, FAAH A/A mice presented an overall lower respiratory exchange ratio (RER), favoring fat utilization compared to FAAH C/C mice. Collectively, these data suggest that under baseline conditions, there is no effect of the C385A variant on body weight or composition despite differences in underlying metabolic parameters. The lower food intake in FAAH A/A mice matches their lower energy expenditure. These findings support the human studies reporting no association between A-allele carriers and obesity susceptibility under standard feeding conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) C385A variant has no effect on baseline body weight or body composition.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) Under basal conditions, there is no effect of the FAAH C385A variant on body weight (T(39) = 0.1516, p=0.88), fat mass (T(39) = 0.2640, p=0.79), or lean mass (T(39) = 0.4219, p=0.6754).

At baseline, circulating CORT was comparable between FAAH C/C and FAAH A/A mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, prolonged CORT exposure significantly elevated circulating CORT measured during the dark (active) stage regardless of genotype. There was furthermore a corresponding decrease in adrenal weights following prolonged CORT treatment, supporting previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karatsoreos et al., 2010</xref>). With regards to metabolic outcomes, prolonged CORT exposure led to significant body weight gain and increased fat mass regardless of genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, a genotype Ã treatment trend (p=0.0520) followed by post hoc analysis indicated that FAAH A/A mice gained significantly more weight on account of CORT treatment compared to FAAH C/C mice. There was neither an effect of genotype nor treatment on lean mass. Importantly, prolonged CORT treatment significantly increased 24 hr cumulative food intake exclusively in FAAH A/A mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In accordance with this, food intake throughout the 4-week treatment was significantly elevated by CORT solely in FAAH A/A mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). However, regardless of genotype, prolonged CORT exposure favored carbohydrate utilization as reflected in the increased RER across genotypes as well as decreased total energy expenditure (TEE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

In order to decipher the signaling mechanism through which the FAAH C385A variant impacts GC-mediated feeding outcomes, we examined the feeding responses of FAAH C/C and FAAH A/A mice to an acute (single) injection of CORT (3 mg/kg). CORT was delivered at the onset of the light/inactive phase, a period of low feeding, to capture any hyperphagic effects of CORT. In agreement with our previous findings, an acute injection of CORT significantly elevated light phase feeding exclusively in the FAAH A/A mice within 10 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The effects of CORT on cumulative food intake were no longer evident by 24 hr post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

Given a previous study demonstrating that GCs increase hypothalamic AMPK activity through an endocannabinoid-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scerif et al., 2013</xref>), we examined the effects of the FAAH C385A variant on GC-mediated effects on hypothalamic AMPK signaling. We first examined the phosphorylation status of AMPK and the direct targets of AMPK as a proxy of AMPK signaling activation. For this purpose, FAAH C/C and A/A mice were injected with CORT (3 mg/kg) or vehicle, and exactly 1 hr later, hypothalamic tissue was collected. For protein quantification, we used capillary-based immunoblotting (BioTechne, ProteinSimple, WES), a novel technique that allows automated separation and detection of proteins from lysates with very low amounts. We found that AMPK signaling was markedly increased exclusively in FAAH A/A mice following administration of CORT. Specifically, while we did not detect a significant increase in AMPK activity per se (as reflected through the phosphorylation status of AMPK), we observed a significant increase in the activation status of direct downstream AMPK targets (as reflected through the increased phosphorylation status of targets expressing the AMPK-consensus sequence) in CORT-treated FAAH A/A mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To complement these findings, we treated immortalized hypothalamic cells (GT1-7 cells) with the FAAH inhibitor URB597 to mimic the increased AEA signaling present in FAAH A/A mice. Following 4 hr pretreatment with either URB597 (1 ÂµM) or vehicle, GT1-7 cells were treated for an additional 2 hr with CORT (1 ÂµM) or vehicle in a 2Ã2 design.

For this purpose, we allowed AgRP<sup>control</sup> and AgRP<sup>FAAH</sup> mice to recover for 5 weeks following the single CORT injection. Following recovery, AgRP<sup>control</sup> and AgRP<sup>FAAH</sup> mice were fasted overnight and then injected with either vehicle (saline) or leptin (2 mg/kg) immediately before receiving food. As expected, leptin reduced body weight gain and food intake following an overnight fast in AgRP<sup>control</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5EâF</xref>). However, AgRP<sup>FAAH</sup> mice were insensitive to leptinâs effects on weight gain or feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5GâH</xref>), indicating that FAAH knockdown exclusively in hypothalamic AgRP neuron is sufficient to block the anorexigenic effects of leptin. Similar to the effects of CORT, this demonstrates that knockdown of FAAH explicitly in AgRP neurons is sufficient to recapitulate the altered effects of leptin seen in the FAAH C385A mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balsevich et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>FAAH A/A mice are more sensitive to the acute hyperphagic effects of ghrelin</title><p>Endocannabinoids not only play a central role in GC-mediated metabolic outcomes, but furthermore are integral to the orexigenic effects of ghrelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tucci et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we further investigated the generalizability of this phenomenon to other orexigenic signals beyond GC, and as such explored whether the FAAH C385A variant affects ghrelin-mediated feeding effects. To address this question, we examined the feeding responses of FAAH C/C and FAAH A/A mice to a single, subthreshold injection of ghrelin (1 mg/kg) or saline delivered during the light/inactive phase to capture the hyperphagic effects of ghrelin during a period of low feeding. Similar to acute GC exposure, a single exposure to ghrelin increased light phase feeding exclusively in FAAH A/A mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). By 24 hr post-injection, the effects of ghrelin on cumulative food intake were no longer evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). There was also no lasting effect of ghrelin on body weight gain measured at 24 hr post-injection. Ghrelin likewise significantly increased RER during the light phase exclusively in FAAH A/A mice, which agrees with the hyperphagic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The elevated RER tended (p=0.068) to continue 24 hr post-ghrelin injections in FAAH A/A mice.

To determine whether hypothalamic AMPK is differentially affected by the FAAH C385A variant, we again examined the phosphorylation status of AMPK and the direct targets of AMPK as a proxy of AMPK signaling activation in FAAH C/C and A/A mice. Ghrelin (1 mg/kg) significantly increased hypothalamic levels of phosphorylated AMPK and direct downstream AMPK targets specifically and exclusively in FAAH A/A mice 1 hr post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Together, our data indicate that the effects of the FAAH C385A variant are not selective for GC-mediated effects. Rather, the FAAH C385A variant exaggerates both GC and ghrelin orexigenic effects, which may suggest a generalized sensitivity of the FAAH A/A genotype to orexigenic signals, coupled to an impairment in the sensitivity to anorectic signals, such as leptin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ECS has an important role in the regulation of body weight. In terms of anandamide, activation of anandamide signaling is known to promote a positive energy balance and weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mazier et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, endocannabinoid signaling lies downstream of several metabolic signals. For example, it is known that GCs and ghrelin, both orexigenic signals, mobilize endocannabinoid signaling, whereas anorexigenic leptin is known to suppress endocannabinoid signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balsevich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Marzo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tucci et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, genetic factors that modify endocannabinoid signaling may affect individual responses to orexigenic and anorexigenic signals. FAAH, the primary catabolic enzyme for anandamide, regulates anandamide signaling by controlling its levels. In humans, the common missense mutation (C385A) in FAAH affects FAAH protein stability, with the A/A genotype associated with approximately half the FAAH protein expression and enzymatic activity compared with the C/C genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiang et al., 2004</xref>). More specifically, T-lymphocytes from patients homozygous for the FAAH A/A variant express less than half of the FAAH protein and activity compared to WT lymphocytes. Here, we fully characterized the effects of the functional FAAH C385A mutation on GC-dependent metabolic outcomes in a novel C385A knock-in mouse model. Importantly, this FAAH C385A knock-in mouse model recapitulates the reduction in FAAH expression and activity observed in humans expressing the FAAH A/A variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dincheva et al., 2015</xref>). Using this model, we established the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms that couple FAAH-AEA signaling to GC-induced feeding responses. We furthermore demonstrated that the FAAH C385A variant is not selective for GC-mediated metabolic responses, but rather governs an individualâs sensitivity to additional orexigenic signals, namely ghrelin.</p><p>As a first step, we monitored the metabolic phenotype of FAAH C/C and A/A mice under basal conditions. In this condition, FAAH C/C and A/A mice did not present differences in body weight or body composition. Interestingly, the underlying metabolic parameters contributing to body weight regulation differed between FAAH C/C and A/A mice at baseline. Compared to FAAH C/C mice, FAAH A/A mice showed lower basal food intake and matching lower energy expenditures. This phenotype could be driven by basal elevations in AEA causing reduced basal metabolism, which in turn results in lower food intake to balance the alterations in energy expenditure. Alternately, in addition to AEA, FAAH also regulates the metabolism of fatty acid amides such as oleoylethanolamide, which is known to be a potent anorectic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaetani et al., 2003</xref>). Regardless of the exact mechanism of this subtle basal phenotype, this balance between food intake and energy expenditure offsets any differences in body weight or body composition at baseline. However, it may also predispose subjects with the FAAH A/A genotype to weight gain from overconsumption. Indeed, a low basal metabolic rate is a risk factor for weight gain in both humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astrup et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astrup et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buscemi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kunz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lazzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sadowska et al., 2017</xref>). Lower basal energy expenditure relates to lower basal maintenance costs, and consequently an energy imbalance could easily arise from overconsumption in response to specific environmental contexts (abundant access to palatable food) or endocrine states (elevated levels of orexigenic signals). In fact, this is in line with our findings that FAAH A/A mice show an amplified feeding response to GC and ghrelin orexigenic signals.</p><p>In terms of GC-endocannabinoid signaling interactions, it is recognized that the duration of GC exposure affects the interaction between them (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balsevich et al., 2017</xref>). For example, GCs mobilize endocannabinoids through both rapid, non-genomic mechanisms and delayed, genomic mechanisms. Therefore, we examined three treatment durations to assess whether the FAAH C385A polymorphism is relevant to the chronic (4 weeks), immediate (48 hr), and/or acute (single exposure) metabolic outcomes of GCs. For chronic and immediate GC treatments, we delivered a low dose of CORT (25 Î¼g/ml) in the drinking water, which maintains the diurnal rhythmicity of circulating GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karatsoreos et al., 2010</xref>). We found that regardless of treatment duration, GC exposure increased food intake exclusively in FAAH A/A mice. Furthermore, continuous GC exposure delivered for 48 hr, increased weight gain within the first 24 hr and 4 weeks of continuous GC exposure exaggerated GC-dependent weight gain. By contrast, there was no body weight phenotype 24 hr following acute GC injections, suggesting that continuous GC treatment is required to elicit weight gain. This agrees with the body of literature demonstrating that in the short term, GC actions are adaptive, redirecting energy stores and increasing food intake without affecting body weight maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dallman et al., 2004</xref>). However, prolonged GC exposure becomes maladaptive, as seen with chronic stress, which is associated with hypercortisolism, fat accumulation, and central obesity. In this context, our findings indicate that individuals with the FAAH A/A genotype are more susceptible to weight gain when confronted with elevations in GC signaling, and therefore may be particularly vulnerable to the influence of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pecoraro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ulrich-Lai, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The effects of the FAAH C385A variant on GC-mediated metabolic outcomes were specific to feeding responses. In particular, whereas the FAAH A/A genotype amplified the hyperphagic effects of GCs, there was no genotype effect on GC-dependent changes to energy expenditure or substrate utilization. Specifically, GC exposure decreased energy expenditure and increased carbohydrate utilization in both FAAH C/C and A/A mice. This agrees with the known role of GCs to suppress energy expenditure and promote carbohydrate utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dulloo et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flatt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Poggioli et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, our data suggest that while GCs mobilize AEA signaling to mediate feeding responses, it is unclear whether AEA signaling lies downstream of GC actions to regulate energy expenditure or substrate utilization. Regardless, the data herein delineate how the FAAH C385A variant affects energy balance by demonstrating that the FAAH C385A polymorphism modifies GC-induced weight gain through its effect on feeding rather than energy expenditure.</p><p>The exaggerated hyperphagic response to GC exposure was associated with increased hypothalamic anandamide levels exclusively in FAAH A/A mice. The hypothalamus is certainly recognized as one of the major brain regions responsible for endocannabinoid-mediated effects on feeding. Therefore, it is likely that elevated hypothalamic anandamide in the FAAH A/A genotype drives the heightened feeding response to orexigenic signals. Interestingly, one human study found that the C385A SNP did not associate with increased BMI per se, but rather higher levels of anandamide were positively associated with both the FAAH A/A genotype and a higher BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martins et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with this, we show that under basal conditions there is neither an effect of the A/A genotype on body weight nor anandamide content in brain regions central to endocannabinoid-mediated feeding. However, under the influence of specific endocrine drivers, such as GCs, anandamide levels increased exclusively in FAAH A/A mice within the hypothalamus, which likewise associated with a hyperphagic response selectively in the FAAH A/A mice. Taken together, GCs elevate hypothalamic anandamide levels selectively in the FAAH A/A genotype to sensitize the FAAH A/A genotype to hyperphagic feeding outcomes.</p><p>We next sought to characterize the cellular population within the hypothalamus driving the AEA-dependent exaggerated feeding response to GC exposure. Within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, POMC- and AgRP-expressing neurons are considered the prototypic regulators of homeostatic food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gautron et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas POMC neuronal activity promotes satiety, AgRP neuronal activity promotes feeding. Interestingly, GCs increase AgRP neuronal firing rates to induce hyperphagia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perry et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether FAAH knockdown exclusively in AgRP neurons is sufficient to recapitulate the exaggerated feeding response to GC exposure seen in FAAH A/A mice. For this purpose, we employed a recently described conditional single vector CRISPR/SaCas9 virus system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hunker et al., 2020</xref>) for efficient cre-dependent mutagenesis of <italic>Faah</italic> (or control) into <italic>AgRP-Ires-cre</italic> mice. Considering there is low FAAH activity in the sparsely distributed hypothalamic AgRP neurons, it was unfeasible to functionally measure changes in AgRP FAAH activity, driven by the saCas9-FAAH construct, using an enzymatic FAAH activity assay. Therefore, to confirm cre-dependent reductions of FAAH activity on account of our SaCas9-FAAH construct, we assessed FAAH enzymatic activity in the hippocampus where FAAH expression is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">EgertovÃ¡ et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gulyas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsou et al., 1998</xref>). Following targeted intra-hippocampal delivery of the SaCas9-FAAH construct in <italic>CaMKIIÎ±-cre</italic> mice to drive cre expression in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsien et al., 1996</xref>), we measured a dramatic, significant reduction in FAAH activity compared to the SaCas9-Control vector, validating the construct. Remarkably decreasing FAAH expression selectively in AgRP neurons paralleled the feeding phenotype of FAAH A/A mice in response to acute CORT injections. Specifically, under vehicle conditions AgRP<sup>FAAH</sup> mice displayed reduced cumulative food intake despite no difference in basal body weights compared to AgRP<sup>Control</sup> mice. However, following a single injection of CORT, AgRP<sup>FAAH</sup> mice increased their light phase feeding, a period when feeding is typically low. By contrast, this hyperphagic response to acute CORT was absent in Agrp<sup>Control</sup> mice.</p><p>Since there are no reliable FAAH antibodies to detect FAAH expression nor is there a fluorophore in the <italic>AgRP-Ires-cre</italic> mice, we could not quantify the percent of AgRP neurons targeted by our viral delivery system. Therefore, it is possible that only a subset of AgRP neurons were targeted and lacked FAAH. In fact, our HA-tagged SaCas9 protein expression profile, used to confirm cre-mediated DNA recombination, supports the notion that a discrete subset of AgRP neurons was targeted. Specifically, the HA-tagged SaCas9 protein expression spread into the dorsal aspects of the arcuate nuclei whereas AgRP neurons are largely concentrated in the ventral aspects of the arcuate nuclei. This suggests that indeed only a subset of AgRP neurons were targeted. It is possible that we targeted more dorsally positioned AgRP neurons based on our injection strategy wherein we positioned the tip of the cannula toward the dorsal aspects of the arcuate nuclei to avoid penetrating the base of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that lowering FAAH expression exclusively in AgRP neurons (targeted or widespread) is sufficient to recapitulate the hyperphagic feeding response of FAAH A/A mice to acute GC treatment. Of course, both GCs and AEA act broadly across several cell types and brain regions to regulate feeding. Our findings that reducing FAAH expression in AgRP neurons heightens GC-mediated feeding does not preclude the involvement of other brain regions. Whether other neuronal populations are likewise involved will require further work.</p><p>Given the effects of FAAH knockdown in AgRP neurons on GC-dependent feeding responses, we investigated whether AgRP neurons are likewise important cellular mediators of FAAHâs effects on leptin-dependent feeding outcomes. It is known that leptin suppresses hypothalamic endocannabinoid signaling to decrease feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balsevich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardinal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Marzo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jo et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, we have specifically shown that elevated AEA signaling in FAAH A/A mice prevents the anorectic effects of leptin following 16 hr food deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balsevich et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that FAAH deletion specifically in AgRP neurons would dampen the hypophagic responses to leptin, similar to what was seen in FAAH A/A mice. In agreement with this, AgRP<sup>Control</sup> mice exhibited weight loss and reduced feeding in response to acute leptin exposure. However, AgRP<sup>FAAH</sup> mice were unresponsive to acute leptin. Our results indicate that AgRP neurons are an important cellular population mediating the effects of FAAH-AEA signaling events of multiple upstream endocrine signals regulating feeding behavior.</p><p>We next explored whether the FAAH C385A variant modulates the metabolic outcomes of additional orexigenic signals. Specifically, we examined the metabolic phenotypes of FAAH C/C and A/A mice in response to ghrelin exposure based on the known interactions between ghrelin and endocannabinoid signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edwards and Abizaid, 2016</xref>). A single, subthreshold dose of ghrelin paralleled the outcomes arising from acute GC exposure, wherein ghrelin increased light phase food intake exclusively in FAAH A/A mice. Again, the effects were specific to feeding as ghrelin had no effect on energy expenditure across genotypes. Considering chronic stress elevates circulating GC and ghrelin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abizaid, 2019</xref>), it is reasonable to suspect that individuals presenting the FAAH A/A genotype are more susceptible to stress-associated weight gain on account of amplified responses to these orexigenic signals. Follow-up studies should address the feeding response of FAAH C/C and A/A mice to acute and chronic stress exposures.</p><p>An important question raised by this study is how does the FAAH C385A variant coordinate the feeding responses to multiple orexigenic signals? For instance, is there a common pathway downstream of FAAH-AEA signaling driving the orexigenic feeding responses? Along these lines, it has previously been shown that GCs and ghrelin activate hypothalamic AMPK through a CB1R-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scerif et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, hypothalamic AMPK activity elicits powerful feeding responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Minokoshi et al., 2004</xref>). In agreement with this, we found that AMPK signaling is heightened in the hypothalamus following acute exposure to either GCs or ghrelin exclusively in FAAH A/A mice. Moreover, pretreatment with an AMPK inhibitor blocked the orexigenic response to acute GC treatment in FAAH A/A mice. The data herein provide unequivocal evidence that AMPK lies downstream of FAAH-AEA signaling to coordinate ghrelin and GC signaling.</p><p>The current study clearly demonstrates that the FAAH A/A genotype predisposes individuals to the feeding responses of orexigenic signals, CORT and ghrelin. Specifically, our working model is that orexigenic signals mobilize AEA in AgRP neurons of the hypothalamus. This effect is amplified in the A/A genotype (with low FAAH expression) because there is reduced enzymatic degradation of AEA. The exaggerated AEA levels lead to heightened CB1R activation and downstream AMPK activation to ultimately sensitize A/A individuals to orexigenic signaling outcomes. By contrast, our previous work determined that FAAH A/A mice are less responsive to the anorexigenic signal leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balsevich et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the current study established that FAAH knockdown exclusively in AgRP neurons is sufficient to blunt feeding and body weight responses to leptin. Thus, based on the current study and our previous findings, we demonstrate that the FAAH C385A variant shifts an individualâs sensitivity to metabolic feeding signals, where individuals with the FAAH A/A genotype are more responsive to orexigenic signals at the expense of being less responsive to anorexigenic signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Given orexigenic signals favor weight gain and anorexigenic signals favor weight loss, individuals with the minor A/A genotype may show exaggerated weight gain in response to environmental conditions that increase orexigenic signals (such as GCs and ghrelin) and decrease anorexigenic signals (such as leptin). Chronic stress, for example, is known to increase levels of both GCs and ghrelin while also producing decreased levels of leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouillon-Minois et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2006</xref>).

The control AAV vector (SaCas9-Control) had an identical guide except the three terminal base pairs in the seed region of the guide sequence were mutated. Following sequence validation, AAV serotype 1 (AAV1) vectors were generated for SaCas9-FAAH and SaCas9-Control using the packaging plasmid pDG1 and transient transfection of HEK293T cells, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hunker et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Stereotaxic surgical procedure</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and placed on a stereotaxic frame. For FAAH knockdown in AgRP neurons, a cre-dependent CRISPR/Cas9 AAV vector targeting <italic>Faah</italic> (SaCas9-FAAH) or control (SaCas9-Control) was delivered bilaterally (210 nl per side) into the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (AP: â1.6 mm, ML: Â±0.15 mm, DV: â5.8 mm). For FAAH knockdown in CamKIIÎ±-cre mice, SaCas9-FAAH or SaCas9-Control was bilaterally injected (400 nl per side) into the dorsal hippocampus (AP: â2.1 mm, ML: Â±1.3 mm, DV: â1.4 mm). Virus was injected at a rate of 0.1 âÎ¼lâmin<sup>â1</sup>. Metacam (3 mg/kg) was given as a postoperative analgesic. Animals recovered for a minimum of 4 weeks in their home cage to allow for viral expression before the onset of experimentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>FAAH activity</title><p>To assess FAAH activity, hippocampi were collected from CamKIIÎ± mice that either received SaCas9-FAAH or SaCas9-Control vector. Briefly, hippocampi were excised on ice and immediately snap frozen and stored at â80Â°C. Hippocampi were homogenized and membrane fractions were isolated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gray et al., 2015</xref>). Enzymatic activity of FAAH was measured as the conversion of [<sup>3</sup>H]-labeled AEA (in the ethanolamine portion of the molecule) to [<sup>3</sup>H]ethanolamine as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maccarrone et al., 1999</xref>). Membranes were incubated in TME buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 3.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.0 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 1.0 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 0.2 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]AEA. Calibration curves were prepared using eight concentrations of AEA at concentrations between 10 nM and 10 Î¼M. Incubations were kept at 37Â°C and were stopped by adding ice-cold chloroform/methanol (1:2). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min before the addition of chloroform and water. Aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The concentration of [<sup>3</sup>H] in the aqueous phase was determined by liquid scintillation counting and the conversion of [<sup>3</sup>H]AEA to [<sup>3</sup>H]ethanolamine was calculated. The maximal hydrolytic activity (Vmax) for this conversion was determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation in Prism v8 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Metabolic measurements</title><p>Energy expenditure (heat), food intake, and RER (=CO<sub>2</sub> produced/O<sub>2</sub> consumed) were measured by indirect calorimetry in Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS) metabolic chambers (Columbus Instruments; Columbus, OH, USA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pezeshki et al., 2015</xref>). Following 2â4 days of acclimatization to the chambers, metabolic measurements were performed every 14 min over the experimental period (flow rate 0.5 L min<sup>â1</sup>). TEE was calculated using O<sub>2</sub> consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>, [ml h<sup>â1</sup>]) and CO<sub>2</sub> production (VCO<sub>2</sub>, [ml h<sup>â1</sup>]) in the following equation following a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pezeshki et al., 2015</xref>): Calorific value = VO<sub>2</sub> Ã [3.815 + (1.232ÃRQ)], with data collection and processing using Oxymax v5.2 and CLAX v2.2.2. Data are represented as kcal h<sup>â1</sup>. When mice spilled their food, their food intake was excluded from analyses (see Supplementary source data). Body composition was examined by quantitative magnetic resonance using the Minispec LF-110 NMR Analyzer (Bruker Optics, Milton, ON, Canada) on awake mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Home-cage activity</title><p>Mice were surgically implanted with a telemetric transponder (Data Sciences International, DSI, St. Paul, MN, USA) to examine activity counts in their home-cages. Briefly, under isoflurane anesthesia, a small incision was made along the midline of the abdomen. The abdominal wall was opened and the transponder was implanted into the abdominal cavity of the mice. The incision was closed with absorbable sutures and the mice were allowed to recover for 1 week before home-cage activity counts were measured under basal conditions and during 24 hr CORT exposure (delivered in their drinking water). Metacam (3 mg/kg) was given as a postoperative analgesic.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Endocannabinoid quantification</title><p>Lipids were extracted from harvested tissues as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, weighed tissue samples were homogenized in borosilicate glass culture tubes containing 2 ml of acetonitrile with 84 pmol of [<sup>2</sup>H8]anandamide. Tissues were subsequently sonicated for 30 min. To precipitate proteins, samples were incubated overnight at â20Â°C proteins, followed by centrifugation at 1500 Ã <italic>g</italic> to remove particulates. The supernatants were collected and evaporated to dryness using N<sub>2</sub> gas. Next, samples were suspended in methanol and dried using N<sub>2</sub> gas. The resulting lipid extracts were suspended in methanol and stored at â80Â°C until further processing. AEA tissue levels were subsequently determined using isotope-dilution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>CORT quantification</title><p>Plasma CORT levels were determined using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay kit (Arbor Assays, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, Catalogue Number K014-H5; sensitivity 20.9 pg/ml) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>The GT1-7 hypothalamic cell line (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0281">CVCL_0281</ext-link>) was kindly provided by Dr. Pamela Mellon (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA). Cells were grown in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mM glucose, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37Â°C in 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Once cells reached ~80% confluence, experiments were initiated. Briefly, cells were starved for 4 hr in DMEM supplemented with 1 mM glucose. During this incubation period, FAAH inhibitor URB597 (1 ÂµM for 4 hr) or vehicle (DMSO for 4 hr) was added to the media. To examine the effects of CORT and CORTÃFAAH interactions on AMPK activity, CORT (1 ÂµM) or vehicle (DMSO) was added to the media for an additional 2 hr. After 6 hr, cells were immediately trypsinized, centrifuged, and stored as pellets at â80Â°C until further processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Capillary-based immunoblotting of proteins</title><p>Tissues or cells were homogenized in Pierce IP Lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail 3 (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and phosphatase inhibitor PhosSTOP (Roche, Penzberg, Germany).

Samples were subsequently prepared for the automated capillary-based immunoblotting system, WES (ProteinSimple, Bio-Techne, San Jose, CA, USA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Target proteins were probed with the following primary antibodies: AMPKÎ± (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, #2532, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_330331">AB_330331</ext-link>), pAMPK (T172) (1:50, Cell Signaling Technology, #2531, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_330330">AB_330330</ext-link>), pAMPK substrate motif (1:50, Cell Signaling Technology, #5759, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10949320">AB_10949320</ext-link>), and secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked antibody (1:10,000, Cell Signaling Technology, #7074, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2099233">AB_2099233</ext-link>). Total protein was quantified using the protein normalization module (ProteinSimple, Bio-Techne, San Jose, CA, USA, #DM-PN02). Signal intensities of phosphorylated proteins were normalized to their respective non-phosphorylated proteins. According to standard practice, virtual bands are not presented since obtained results are signal intensities in a digital format.

Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbitol before undergoing intracardial perfusion. Mice were perfused with PBS before being fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (PFA). Brains were then removed and dropped into a 4% PFA solution for 24 hr. Following drop fixing, brains were placed into a 30% sucrose solution for 48 hr for cryoprotection. Fixed brains were frozen and sliced at 40 Âµm thickness on a microtome and stored in an anti-freeze solution until they were ready to be stained. Before staining for HA, slices were washed three times in PBS and three times in PBST. Following washing steps, slices were stained in a 1:1500 dilution of anti-HA for 24 hr at 4Â°C. Following staining, slices were washed in PBST three more times, then stained with a 1:200 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 for 1 hr. Slices then underwent three more washes in PBST before being mounted on glass slides and covered with Fluoroshield with DAPI stain (Sigma F6057). Mounted slices were imaged using a fluorescent microscope (Leica DM4000 B LED), and CRISPR expression was imaged under an L5 filter cube. Brightness and contrast were adjusted equally across all images in ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26 software (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). Independent t-tests were used to compare genotype effects. Two-way ANOVAs (analysis of variance) were used to examine studies with a 2Ã2 design. Where the initial test yielded a significant interaction, independent Studentâs t-tests (two-tailed) were conducted to locate the interaction effect using simple comparisons. Repeated measures on CLAMS data (energy expenditure, respiratory quotient, and food intake) were analyzed by linear mixed models. The fixed effects of treatment, genotype, time, and their interactions were included in the model. Animal nested in the group was the random variable on which repeated measures were taken and covariance structures modeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pezeshki et al., 2015</xref>). Body weight was included as a covariate in the analyses of energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">TschÃ¶p et al., 2011</xref>). Post hoc analyses were undertaken using Bonferroniâs multiple comparison post hoc test where appropriate. Statistical analyses of CLAMS data were performed using individual data points (every 15 min) collected over the experimental period. For 24 hr measurements, CLAMS data were graphed using the four-point averages of individual data points. Outlier testing was performed using Grubbâs test for outliers, and when an outlier was detected (p&lt;0.05), it was omitted from analysis. For the 48 hr CORT exposure study, select metabolic chambers (see Supplementary source data) had dysfunctional O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> sensors and were excluded from RER and TEE analyses. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05; a statistical tendency was set at p&lt;0.1. For interactions at p&lt;0.1, we also examined lower order main effects. Data are presented as the mean Â± SEM.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All studies were carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.

We agree that it is important to examine body weight at different time points across the lifespan. Our animals are bred in a separate facility and we do not gain access to the animals until ~2-4 weeks before the onset of the experiments. Nevertheless, we compiled our body weight data across all experiments to examine body weights at 2-, 3-, and 4- months of age under basal (home cage) conditions. Regardless of their age, FAAH C/C and FAAH A/A mice show no difference in body weight under basal conditions. We have added these results to the revised manuscript as Supplemental Figure S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I do not see full blots for Figure 4.

This system is based on automated quantification of luminescence signals generated from horseradish-peroxidase secondary antibodies, similar to classical western blots, but more sensitive. Obtained results are signal intensities in a digital format. Usually, virtual bands are not presented for that method. We added more info in the methods section for clarification and titled this section âImmunoblotting of Proteinsâ to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In figure 2 the N or 4-5 is not convincing that this is a robust and reproducible effect. This is also highlighted by the trend level significance via ANOVAs in figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>For the CLAMS data (Figures 2D â 2I), the sample size of n = 4-5 is sufficient to achieve robust effects based on the repeated measurements taken ~ every 15 minutes on an individual mouse over almost 24 h (~80 measurements per mouse). The statistics affirm the robustness. With regards to Figure 2A, the reviewer pointed out that we detected a trend for body weight change following 4 weeks of CORT treatment. Specifically, we ran a 2-way ANOVA with genotype and treatment as independent factors. We detected a main effect of CORT treatment as well as a genotype x treatment trend (F(1,15) = 4.456, p = 0.052). As indicated in the âStatistical Analysisâ subsection embedded in the Methods, we examined lower order main effects for interactions at p &lt; 0.1 in order to understand what is driving the interaction. Using this methodology, we found that CORT-treated HOM A/A mice gained significantly more weight than vehicle-treated HOM A/A mice, whereas CORT-treated WT C/C mice did not gain significantly more weight than vehicle-treated WT C/C mice. This agrees with our CLAMS data that CORT treatment significantly increased feeding in HOM A/A mice but not in WT C/C mice. As a follow-up to the reviewerâs concern about Figure 2Aâs interpretation, we performed a cohenâs d-test to assess the effect size for the t=T-test between vehicle-treated and CORT-treated HOM A/A mice.</p><p>The cohenâs d-test:</p><p>Cohen's d = (M2 â M1) â SD<sub>pooled</sub></p><p>Cohen's <italic>d</italic> = (4.12 â 0.7) â 0.869511 = 3.933244.</p><p>Based on the cohenâs d-test, the effect size is large. Together, based on the effect size and agreement between food intake and changes in body weight, we are confident in the robustness of our data and our interpretation of the genotype x treatment trend for body weight gain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Hypothalamic measures of AEA and AMPK activity would suggest that AGRP neurons might play a major role in determining the measurements.

It is quite possible that our viral system only reached a subset of AgRP-expressing neurons. Due to the lack of fluorophore in the Agrp-ires-cre mice, we are unable to quantify the number/percent of AgRP neurons that were infected by our viral system. However, we compared our cre-dependent CRISPR/SaCas9 AAV-HA-tag expression in Agrp-ires cre mice to previously published expression profiles in Agrp-ires cre mice using cre-dependent viral delivery systems (1, 2) and see a similar visual expression profile. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that it should be acknowledged that it is possible that only a subset of AgRP neurons are targeted, yet it is still sufficient to recapitulate the exaggerated hyperphagic response to CORT observed in FAAH A/A mice. Furthermore, we should clearly state that it is very possible that other neuronal populations are also involved in mediating anandamideâs downstream effects on glucocorticoidâs orexigenic effects. Therefore, we have added more details in the Results (Section âFAAH knockdown exclusively in hypothalamic AgRP neurons is sufficient to mediate the exaggerated hyperphagic response to glucocorticoids and ablate the anorexigenic effects of leptinâ) and Discussion.

We agree that we should have described the validity of the FAAH C385A knock-in mouse model in more detail. Therefore, we have added details to the Discussion describing the biochemical similarities between the human and mouse FAAH alleles. Specifically:</p><p>âIn humans, the common missense mutation (C385A) in FAAH affects FAAH protein stability, with the A/A genotype associated with approximately half the FAAH protein expression and enzymatic activity compared with the C/C genotype (Chiang et al., 2004). More specifically, T-lymphocytes from patients homozygous for the FAAH A/A variant express less than half of the FAAH protein and activity compared to wild-type (WT) lymphocytes. Here we fully characterized the effects of the functional FAAH C385A mutation on GC-dependent metabolic outcomes in a novel C385A knock-in mouse model. Importantly, this FAAH C385A knock-in mouse model recapitulates the reduction in FAAH expression and activity observed in humans expressing the FAAH A/A variant (Dincheva et al., 2015)â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>&quot;The ECS, and specifically anandamide signaling, has an important role in the regulation of body weight.&quot;- there is just as much evidence to support 2-AG signaling in the regulation of body weightâ¦ maybe more.

Therefore, we have revised the particular sentence mentioned as follows:</p><p>âThe ECS, and specifically anandamide signaling, has an important role in the regulation of body weight. In particularterms of anandamide, activation of anandamide signaling is known to promote a positive energy balance and weight gain (Mazier et al., 2015).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The HA-tag imaging of Cas9 expression does not recapitulate AGRP neuron distribution within the ARC, which is concentrated in the ventromedial aspects of the two ARC nuclei whereas the HA-tag labeling shows a very diffuse and sparse distribution within the dorsolateral aspects of the ARC as well as the spaces between the ARC and the VMN.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a fair concern. In our discussion, we now discuss our HA-tag expression pattern relative to the typical distribution of AgRP neurons. Briefly, in our study the HA-tagged SaCas9 protein expression spread into the dorsal aspects of the arcuate nuclei whereas AgRP neurons are largely concentrated in the ventral aspects of the arcuate nuclei. This suggests that indeed only a subset of AgRP neurons were targeted. It is possible that we targeted more dorsally positioned AgRP neurons based on our injection strategy wherein we positioned the tip of the cannula towards the dorsal aspects of the arcuate nuclei to avoid penetrating the base of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that lowering FAAH expression exclusively in AgRP neurons (targeted or widespread) is sufficient to recapitulate the hyperphagic feeding response of FAAH A/A mice to acute GC treatment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
