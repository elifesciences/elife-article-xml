falciparum</italic> parasites is believed to rely on the import of three-carbon phosphate compounds for use in organelle anabolic pathways, in addition to the generation of energy and reducing power within the organelle. We generated a series of genetic deletions in an apicoplast metabolic bypass line to determine which genes involved in apicoplast carbon metabolism are required for blood-stage parasite survival and organelle maintenance. We found that pyruvate kinase II (PyrKII) is essential for organelle maintenance, but that production of pyruvate by PyrKII is not responsible for this phenomenon. Enzymatic characterization of PyrKII revealed activity against all NDPs and dNDPs tested, suggesting that it may be capable of generating a broad range of nucleotide triphosphates. Conditional mislocalization of PyrKII resulted in decreased transcript levels within the apicoplast that preceded organelle disruption, suggesting that PyrKII is required for organelle maintenance due to its role in nucleotide triphosphate generation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>apicoplast</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>Pyruvate Kinase</kwd><kwd>plasmodium</kwd><kwd>microarray</kwd><kwd>carbon metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI065853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prigge</surname><given-names>Sean T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI101589</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prigge</surname><given-names>Sean T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25GM109441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keutcha</surname><given-names>Cyrianne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI007417</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rajaram</surname><given-names>Krithika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The pyruvate kinase contained in the apicoplast organelle of malaria parasites makes the nucleotide triphosphates required for several processes including transcription of the organellar genome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>With increasing resistance to current front-line antimalarials, there is a crucial need to find new therapeutic interventions with novel mechanisms of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dondorp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trape, 2001</xref>). The apicoplast organelle within the parasite has often been considered as a source of new drug targets since it is required for blood-stage survival, in addition to possessing evolutionarily distinct biochemical pathways that are not present in the human host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodman and McFadden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janouskovec et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mukherjee and Sadhukhan, 2016</xref>). One pathway within the apicoplast that represents a source of potential drug targets is carbon metabolism, due to its predicted role in supporting metabolism within the organelle.</p><p>In order to fuel metabolism within the apicoplast, sources of reducing power, carbon backbones, and energy in the form of nucleotide triphosphates are required. It is hypothesized that the apicoplast meets these needs primarily through the import and metabolism of three-carbon phosphates generated by parasite glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zocher et al., 2012</xref>). These three-carbon phosphate compounds include dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which are imported into the organelle through the outer triose phosphate transporter (oTPT) and inner triose phosphate transporter (iTPT) embedded in the outer and inner apicoplast membranes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mullin et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Carbon metabolism in the apicoplast.</title><p>Carbon backbones are imported into the apicoplast organelle in the form of 3-carbon phosphates by the apicoplast membrane outer triose phosphate transporter (oTPT) and inner triose phosphate transporter (iTPT). Pyruvate kinase II (PyrKII) converts the substrates phophoenolpyruvate (PEP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into the products pyruvate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Pyruvate is used by PDH to generate acetyl CoA, which is fed into the FASII fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P). Pyruvate and GA3P are used by 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) synthase (DXS) to form DOXP, which is further converted by a series of enzymes to form the essential isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP).

GA3P and PEP are then fed into the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) isoprenoid pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim and McFadden, 2010</xref>). These substrates first interact with 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) synthase (DXS) to form DOXP, which is further converted by a series of enzymes to form the essential isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunter, 2007</xref>). GA3P is also believed to be used for the generation of reducing power through its conversion into 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3-DPGA) by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), reducing NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleige et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Waller et al., 1998</xref>). However, the functionality of the GAPDH cycle is questionable since GAPDH does not appear to localize to the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daubenberger et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The PEP imported into the apicoplast is believed to be used along with ADP as substrates by the enzyme pyruvate kinase II (PyrKII) to generate pyruvate and ATP, providing the only predicted source of these products within the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim and McFadden, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Israelsen and Vander Heiden, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maeda et al., 2009</xref>). The pyruvate generated enters into the MEP isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim and McFadden, 2010</xref>). Additionally, pyruvate can be converted into acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), reducing NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH in the process, providing one of the few predicted sources of reducing power within the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zocher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foth et al., 2005</xref>). The ATP generated presumably powers all energy requiring reactions within the organelle and provides adenine bases for RNA synthesis. However, it is not clear how the apicoplast acquires the remaining NTPs for RNA synthesis and other reactions since apicoplast transporters for NMPs or NDPs have not been described, and there are no other predicted sources of NTPs within the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maeda et al., 2009</xref>). The activity of PyrKII from the closely related apicomplexan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> has been characterized in vitro and exhibits a strong substrate preference for GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saito et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting the likely requirement for additional NTP sources. However, the substrate specificity of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PyrKII has not been characterized, and doing so may help elucidate its potential role in apicoplast nucleotide metabolism.</p><p>In order to interrogate the role and essentiality of the various proteins involved in carbon metabolism within the organelle, we used an apicoplast metabolic bypass line to generate a series of genetic deletions. Our results showed that both TPI and PDH are dispensable for blood-stage parasite survival, and do not require mevalonate for survival. Additionally, we demonstrated that oTPT, iTPT, and PyrKII are not only essential, but are also required for apicoplast maintenance. However, deletions in the FASII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Schaijk et al., 2014</xref>) and MEP pathways, the only two pathways predicted to use pyruvate, did not result in the same phenotype. This suggested that organelle maintenance is not reliant on the pyruvate generated by PyrKII, but instead may rely on ATP (or possibly other NTPs) produced by the enzyme.</p><p>In vitro enzymatic characterization of PyrKII revealed activity with all NDPs and dNDPs that were tested, demonstrating broad substrate specificity. We hypothesized that PyrKII may be playing a critical role in NTP production within the apicoplast. To test this, we generated a parasite line that allowed us to conditionally mislocalize PyrKII and measure the rate of loss of apicoplast mRNA via microarray, as a proxy for measuring the change in NTP production. Using this approach, we found that mRNA levels within the organelle decreased relatively rapidly (withinÂ ~24â40 hr of inducing PyrKII mislocalization), while the organelle did not become disrupted until much later (~88â110 hr). These results help to support the hypothesis that PyrKII plays a critical role in NTP production within the apicoplast, with the removal of PyrKII resulting in a decrease in apicoplast transcript levels, likely causing the resulting organelle loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Essentiality of the outer and inner triose phosphate transporters</title><p>For the apicoplast, carbon metabolism begins with the import of the three-carbon phosphate compounds PEP and DHAP, mediated by the outer and inner triose phosphate transporters (oTPT/iTPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2010</xref>). Previous deletions in <italic>P. berghei</italic> demonstrated that oTPT is essential, while iTPT is dispensable in blood-stage parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2012</xref>). To investigate the role and essentiality of carbon metabolism within the organelle of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites, we attempted to delete the genes encoding oTPT (PF3D7_0508300) and iTPT (PF3D7_0530200) using Cas9-mediated genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghorbal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>). Deletions were generated in the PfMev apicoplast bypass line, which is engineered to convert supplemented mevalonate into isoprenoid precursors in the parasite cytosol, allowing these parasites to survive disruption of the apicoplast organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Swift et al., 2020</xref>). We confirmed the deletion of oTPT and iTPT, and the absence of parental parasites using genotyping PCR reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>). We were unable to amplify a gene from the apicoplast genome (<italic>sufB</italic>) in the PfMev Î<italic>otpt</italic> and PfMev Î<italic>itpt</italic> parasite lines, indicating that the organellar genome had been lost in both lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gisselberg et al., 2013</xref>). To visualize the apicoplast, super-folder green (SFG) was appended to the first 55 amino acids of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ACP (api-SFG), constituting the signal and transit peptide to direct trafficking to the apicoplast, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Swift et al., 2020</xref>). Disruption of the apicoplast was confirmed via live epifluorescence microscopy, which showed multiple vesicles throughout the cell instead of the discrete intact structure that is typically observed in wild type parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gisselberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>). Additionally, upon removal of mevalonate both deletion lines failed to grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). These results demonstrate that both oTPT and iTPT are required for apicoplast maintenance in addition to blood-stage parasite survival. While these results are consistent with what was found in <italic>P. berghei</italic> for oTPT they are notably in conflict with what was found for iTPT, which did not cause a significant growth defect in <italic>P. berghei</italic> when deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of the PfMev Î<italic>otpt</italic> and Î<italic>itpt</italic> parasite lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genotyping PCR confirming deletion of oTPT or iTPT, with amplification demonstrating integration of the drug resistance cassette at the 5â and 3â loci of the target gene (Î5â and Î3â), and lack of wild type parasites due to failure to amplify at the wild type 5â and 3â loci in the PfMev Î<italic>otpt</italic> or Î<italic>itpt</italic> parasites, as compared to the parental control (WT).

Genetic deletion of PyrKII in the PfMev line resulted in apicoplast disruption, but these deletion lines do not allow us to observe what led to the loss of the organelle. If PyrKII is critical for NTP production within the apicoplast, deletion of PyrKII should result in a rapid reduction of NTPs that would precede apicoplast disruption.

Transferring the parasites into glucose-free medium (CHO-) resulted in a rapid loss of luminescence, consistent with apicoplast ATP production being dependent on the glycolytic product PEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that PyrKII is involved in the production of NTPs, which are required for apicoplast gene transcription and organelle maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The work outlined here has helped to better elucidate the role and importance of carbon metabolism within the apicoplast organelle.

However, our results for the deletion of iTPT are at odds with previous results showing that iTPT is dispensable in blood-stage <italic>P. berghei</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2012</xref>). This inconsistency may be due to differences in metabolic requirements, or it could be due to the relative roles that oTPT and iTPT play in blood-stage <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. However, the results found in this work are consistent with forward genetic screens conducted in <italic>P. berghei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwach et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> which suggest that iTPT is actually likely to be essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Once PEP and DHAP are imported into the apicoplast, they are used as substrates by PyrKII and TPI, respectively. TPI is believed to convert DHAP into GA3P, providing the MEP pathway with one of its two initial substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>). While the MEP pathway is essential, we demonstrated that TPI is dispensable. The dispensability of TPI can potentially be attributed to the lack of specificity of the upstream oTPT/iTPT transporters. Homologous transporters in plant plastids are relatively nonspecific and can import various triose phosphate compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fischer et al., 1997</xref>). The <italic>P. falciparum</italic> oTPT and iTPT triose phosphate transporters were also demonstrated to be relatively nonspecific when tested in vitro, capable of importing 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PGA), a compound not predicted to be used within the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the oTPT/iTPT transporters can import GA3P directly, bypassing the need for the conversion of DHAP to GA3P by TPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Roles of carbon metabolism proteins in the apicoplast.</title><p>Apicoplast proteins and pathways are colored according to gene deletion results (dispensableÂ =Â green, essentialÂ =Â orange, and essential for apicoplast maintenanceÂ =Â red). Pyruvate kinase II (PyrKII) generates nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) products used for transcription, translation, and for several metabolic pathways including the synthesis of fatty acids (FA), isoprenoids (isopr) and iron-sulfur clusters (FeS). The dispensability of the triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) suggests that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P) may be directly imported by oTPT/iTPT for use in the isoprenoid synthesis pathway (gray arrow). This result also indicates that malaria parasites do not rely on a two-enzyme reductive pathway involving TPI and a hypothetical GAPDH enzyme.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50807-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Previously, TPI was also thought to be involved in the generation of reducing power within the apicoplast working along with a hypothetical GAPDH in a two-enzyme cycle. In this cycle, TPI would convert DHAP into GA3P, which would be used by GAPDH to generate 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3-DPGA), converting NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleige et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Waller et al., 1998</xref>). The 1,3-DPGA would then presumably be exchanged for DHAP by oTPT/iTPT, forming an electron shuttle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Waller et al., 1998</xref>). This putative cycle would provide reducing power in the form of NADH or NADPH within the organelle, with the only other predicted sources being PDH and glutamate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zocher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laine et al., 2015</xref>). We were able to demonstrate that TPI is dispensable in blood-stage parasites. Additionally, the only GAPDH in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has been shown to localize to the cytosol of the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daubenberger et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, this cycle is not essential and is likely not even present within the apicoplast.</p><p>PyrKII is the only predicted source of pyruvate within the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2010</xref>). We expected PyrKII to be essential for the generation of pyruvate needed by the MEP pathway, but we were surprised to find that PyrKII is required for apicoplast maintenance. To understand this phenomenon, we deleted the two proteins predicted to use pyruvate in the apicoplast, DXS and PDH. Deletion of DXS from the MEP pathway demonstrated that this protein is essential for parasite survival but is not required for organelle maintenance. Deletion of the PDH E2 subunit, which converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foth et al., 2005</xref>), revealed that this gene is not required for blood-stage parasite survival or apicoplast maintenance. The dispensability of PDH replicates what has been seen previously with the deletion of the PDH E1Î± and E3 subunits in <italic>P. yoelli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pei et al., 2010</xref>) and the PDH E1Î± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cobbold et al., 2013</xref>) and E3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laine et al., 2015</xref>) subunits of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The dispensability of both TPI and PDH is interesting because these are two of the few predicted sources of reducing power within the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zocher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foth et al., 2005</xref>). The dispensability of these proteins indicates that other sources of reducing power are capable of compensating for their loss during this stage of the parasite cycle. Overall, these results suggest that the requirement of PyrKII for organelle maintenance is not driven by a need for pyruvate by downstream metabolic pathways.</p><p>The findings for PyrKII in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> do not hold for all apicomplexan species, as the apicoplast-localized PyrKII has been shown to be dispensable in <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites without any observed growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xia et al., 2019</xref>). Pyruvate should be required for fatty acid (FASII) and isoprenoid precursor synthesis in the apicoplast of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. The FASII pathway was thought to be essential for apicoplast maintenance and parasite survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mazumdar et al., 2006</xref>; however, recent studies show that several PDH subunits and FASII enzymes can be deleted; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krishnan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). These FASII-null parasite lines grow poorly in vitro and one would expect the PyrKII deletion line to share this phenotype unless the apicoplast has some other source of pyruvate. Similarly, work on isoprenoid synthesis enzymes suggests that a source of apicoplast pyruvate is essential for parasite survival. Although <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites can scavenge some host cell isoprenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blume and Seeber, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imlay and Odom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2013</xref>), the apicoplast-localized synthesis enzyme LytB was shown to be essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nair et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, both the FASII and isoprenoid precursor synthesis pathways are required for normal in vitro growth of <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites, whereas PyrKII is not. As suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xia et al., 2019</xref>), the dispensability of PyrKII may indicate that pyruvate can be imported into the apicoplast of <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites.</p><p>Our work with PyrKII led us to focus on its role in nucleotide metabolism in the apicoplast. To investigate which NTPs or dNTPs PyrKII may be capable of generating, we determined the substrate specificity of pure recombinant protein. These assays demonstrated that PyrKII has a relatively broad substrate specificity, and the K<sub>m</sub> values shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> could be consistent with the levels of NDPs in the apicoplast. The concentrations of nucleotides in the apicoplast have not been determined; however, NDP concentrations of 0.1â1 mM are typical for other cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Traut, 1994</xref>). Thus, PyrKII may be capable of generating a variety of nucleoside triphosphates within the apicoplast. This finding is not unprecedented, as other pyruvate kinase enzymes have been shown to be relatively non-specific in their use of nucleotide substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saeki et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbe and Yamada, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boehme et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knowles et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plowman and Krall, 1965</xref>). We hypothesized that if PyrKII is required for NTP generation, then the loss of this enzyme would result in a decrease in mRNA levels in the apicoplast. To probe this question, we created two different parasite lines that allow for conditional control of the endogenous PyrKII enzyme. Parasites incorporating the aptamer-based knockdown method of Ganesan and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ganesan et al., 2016</xref>) displayed a growth defect 5 days after triggering the knockdown of PyrKII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>), whereas parasites incorporating a conditional localization (CLD) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>) grew poorly 3 days after initiating mislocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We used the CLD-PyrKII parasites to quantify mRNA levels during the 2-day period following PyrKII mislocalization. We found that apicoplast transcript levels droppedÂ ~24â40 hr after PyrKII mislocalization, whereas nuclear transcript levels were not affected during this time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Importantly, this drop in apicoplast transcript levels preceded disruption of apicoplast morphology by over 50 hr, which was not observed untilÂ ~88â110 hr after mislocalization. This demonstrated that reduced apicoplast gene expression is an early event in the process of apicoplast disruption. This is in contrast to results from the analysis of apicoplast RNA levels in PfMev Î<italic>dxs</italic> parasites, which did not drop significantly upon removal of mevalonate and loss of isoprenoid synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Experiments with firefly luciferase strengthened the hypothesis that PyrKII generates NTPs in the apicoplast. We expressed luciferase in the apicoplast of PfMev CLD-PyrKII parasites and used it to probe ATP levels. Cellular ATP levels are known to fall rapidly in malaria parasites deprived of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Teng et al., 2009</xref>). We observed significantly decreased luminescence after a short period in glucose-free medium (~20 min), linking parasite glycolysis to the activity of apicoplast luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Presumably, the glycolysis product PEP is required for the production of ATP by PyrKII in the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Treatment with the isoprenoid biosynthesis inhibitor fosmidomycin has been shown to kill parasites within one 48 hr life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jomaa et al., 1999</xref>). We observed a reduction in luminescence 24â40 hr after treatment with 100x IC<sub>50</sub> of fosmidomycin, consistent with parasite death during the second half of the parasite life cycle. Importantly, mislocalization of PyrKII resulted in lowered luminescence during the first half of the life cycle (8â24 hr), demonstrating that lowered ATP is an early consequence of reduced PyrKII activity. It is not clear why luciferase activity didnât drop to zero after PyrKII mislocalization or fosmidomycin-treatment. It may be that other essential nutrients are depleted before apicoplast ATP is fully consumed.</p><p>Inhibition of NTP production within the apicoplast could result in parasite death through various molecular mechanisms due to the requirement of NTPs for a number of biochemical processes within the organelle. For example, within the MEP pathway the enzyme IspD uses CTP along with 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) to generate 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME), which goes on to form the essential isoprenoid precursors IPP and DMAPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunter, 2007</xref>). GTP is required for multiple steps of protein translation including translation initiation, peptide chain elongation, translation termination, and ribosome recycling, which are processes mediated by translational GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maracci and Rodnina, 2016</xref>). ATP is required for tRNA charging by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pang et al., 2014</xref>), iron-sulfur cluster formation by the SufC ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saini et al., 2010</xref>), DNA gyrase subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mukherjee and Sadhukhan, 2016</xref>), as well as numerous other energy requiring pathways within the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim and McFadden, 2010</xref>). Additionally, NTPs and dNTPs are required for transcription and DNA replication, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joyce and Steitz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nudler, 2009</xref>). Thus, inhibiting the generation of these products would ultimately cause several important biochemical processes to fail within the organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>For plastid organelles ATP/ADP transport is typically mediated by a nucleotide transporter (NTT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fischer, 2011</xref>). While NTT is widespread in plastid organelles this transporter has not been found in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Facchinelli and Weber, 2011</xref>). With no other sources of ATP identified, this has led to the hypothesis that PyrKII is responsible for generating all ATP required within the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim and McFadden, 2010</xref>).</p><p>While the NTP generating activity of PyrKII appears to be required for organelle maintenance and parasite survival, the import mechanism and the phosphorylation state (NMP, NDP, or NTP) of nucleotides remain unknown. We found that PyrKII is active against NDPs, but it has essentially no activity against NMPs. This suggests that nucleotides need to be imported as NDPs, or additional mechanisms for converting NMPs into NDPs would need to be present within the apicoplast. A putative UMP-CMP kinase (PF3D7_0111500) with predicted apicoplast localization could convert at least some NMPs to NDPs, but its substrate specificity has not been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zuegge et al., 2001</xref>). None of the other nucleotide kinases, purine interconversion and pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes are predicted to localize to the apicoplast. Additionally, only single copies of the ribonucleotide reductase subunit genes and thymidylate synthase are present in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. These enzymes presumably function in the cytoplasm to supply dNDPs for nuclear and organellar DNA synthesis. Thus, nucleotide transport should also be required for these deoxyribose nucleotides. Overall, nucleotide import and metabolism in the apicoplast are poorly studied and remain to be fully elucidated.</p><p>Taken together, the results herein help elucidate the role and importance of carbon metabolism within the apicoplast of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. We showed that PDH and TPI are dispensable for asexual parasite survival, raising additional questions as to how reducing power is sufficiently generated in the absence of these enzymes. Importantly, this work also demonstrated that PyrKII is essential for parasite survival and apicoplast maintenance. In addition to PyrKII being essential for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite survival, PyrKII enzymes are also evolutionary distinct, and appear to occur only within apicomplexans, and thus may represent an attractive drug target for <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2007</xref>). While the pyruvate generated by PyrKII is required to generate essential isoprenoid precursors in the MEP pathway, our results indicate that pyruvate is not needed for apicoplast maintenance. Instead, it appears that the requirement of PyrKII for organelle maintenance is driven by its role in NTP production within the apicoplast, with loss of this activity likely being the cause of subsequent apicoplast disruption. Loss of PyrKII activity in the apicoplast results in a reduction of apicoplast mRNA, tRNA and rRNA significantly prior to organelle disruption and parasite death. These observations provide new insight into carbon metabolism and the generation of reducing power within the apicoplast and demonstrate an unexpected role for PyrKII in apicoplast maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>P. falciparum</italic> culture and maintenance</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, blood-stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites were cultured in human erythrocytes at 1% hematocrit in a 10 mL volume of CMA (Complete Medium with Albumax) containing RPMI 1640 medium with L-glutamine (USBiological Life Sciences), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES, 0.2% sodium bicarbonate, 12.5 Î¼g/mL hypoxanthine, 5 g/L Albumax II (Life Technologies) and 25 Î¼g/mL gentamicin.

The PyrKII pMG74 plasmid was generated by using the primers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Briefly, the PyrKtetR.HA1.F and PyrKtetR.HA1.R primers were used to amplify the region of the gene corresponding to homology arm 1 (HA1), and the PyrKtetR.HA2.F and PyrKtetR.HA2.R primers were used to amplify the region of the gene corresponding to homology arm 2 (HA2).

bypasses the sole metabolic pathway within the Plasmodium plastid (apicoplast) that is essential during asexual culture. This allows them to test which apicoplast metabolic steps are essential, and to dissect whether they are important for metabolic pathways that serve the rest of the parasites, or are instead necessary for apicoplast maintenance. They demonstrate that pyruvate kinase II is essential for organelle maintenance due to its unexpected ability to generate a broad range of nucleotide triphosphates.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The NTP generating activity of pyruvate kinase II is critical for apicoplast maintenance in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Neil Ferguson as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors provide a detailed genetic and functional study of six apicoplast proteins with central roles in Plasmodium organelle metabolism. Results for PDH and DXS are consistent with prior inhibitor and/or genetic studies of PDH and the MEP pathway. The important novelties of this study are (1) observation that iTPT (a proposed inner-membrane 3-carbon phosphate transporter) and the apicoplast-targeted pyruvate kinase II are essential for apicoplast biogenesis independent of their previously proposed roles in supporting MEP pathway isoprenoid synthesis and (2) the insightful proposal (with strong though not air-tight support) that PyrKII is essential for producing multiple NTPs needed for broad apicoplast metabolism.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors present microarray data showing diminished apicoplast versus nuclear RNA levels upon PyrKII mislocalization as evidence for a specific role for this enzyme in supporting RNA transcription. This experiment lacks a negative control to rule out that defects in RNA abundance can result non-specifically from any lethal apicoplast dysfunction. For example, is RNA abundance affected upon mevalonate washout from the DXS KO line, since DXS/MEP pathway activity is not expected to directly influence RNA abundance? A full microarray analysis is not necessary, and a simple RT-qPCR of SufB versus nuclear LDH would suffice.</p><p>2) Is broad NDP substrate specificity by PyrKII required for its essential role in apicoplast biogenesis apart from pyruvate production? Does a cytosolic PyrK homolog with much narrower substrate specificity rescue loss of the apicoplast PyrKII and its broad(er) NDP substrate specificity? (Suggestion: do an episomal rescue of their conditional mislocalization, where they transfect the CLD line with plasmids constitutively expressing PK variants with differing NTP specificities and ask which rescue(s) effects of mislocalizing the endogenous PKII).</p><p>3) It would be the best if authors can directly check the NTP/dNTP levels in apicoplast, by means like biosensors. It will also be important to see the how timing of NTP/dNTP/mRNA level changes correlate with the PyrK2 mislocalization. In addition, to further support the authors' model, would they see the same phenotypes if they CLD tag DXS in WT parasites (or other genes like DMT2 known to affect the apicoplast maintenance but do not affect NTP/dNTP levels)?</p><p>4) If PyrKII is essential for broad NTP production, where do the NDP precursors come from and why are they but not NTPs available in the apicoplast? The mechanisms here may be incompletely understood but explicit discussion of this point at the end of the paper seems warranted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50807.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors present microarray data showing diminished apicoplast versus nuclear RNA levels upon PyrKII mislocalization as evidence for a specific role for this enzyme in supporting RNA transcription.

We conducted this experiment with synchronized ÎDXS parasites and collected parasite samples at 8hr increments. We used three RT-qPCR probes to apicoplast RNAs in addition to the suggested LDH probes. The results are now shown in Figure 6âfigure supplement 2 and show that there is no significant decrease in RNA abundance until hour 48 of the experiment. Thus, during most of the first growth cycle, apicoplast RNA levels are independent of isoprenoid synthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is broad NDP substrate specificity by PyrKII required for its essential role in apicoplast biogenesis apart from pyruvate production?

Earlier in the project we thought a lot about using other PyrK enzymes as probes, but we ran into several conceptual problems. The first has to do with demonstrated substrate specificity. The most homologous probe would be the apicoplast PyrKII from <italic>T. gondii</italic> since it is the only other type II pyruvate kinase that has been studied. While this enzyme has been shown to prefer GDP over ADP, no other nucleotides were tested. We would have to fully characterize recombinant TgPyrKII before we could determine whether it would be an appropriate probe of nucleotide metabolism. Even less is known about the specificity of the cytosolic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PyrKI enzyme. Many pyruvate kinases from bacteria and other sources have also been studied, but none have been characterized with the full range of possible substrates. Regardless of which pyruvate kinase is chosen as a probe, the real problem has to do with proving that the probe is enzymatically active after expression in the apicoplast. If the probe fails to compensate for the loss of PyrKII, it could be because the probe enzyme has a different substrate specificity, or it could be because it is not active. This is a significant concern because the activity of type I pyruvate kinases is modulated by many factors including the binding of effectors like alanine, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and potassium ions.</p><p>Instead of using a pyruvate kinase as a probe, we tried to express an enzyme that consumes pyruvate, without affecting the nucleotide pool. We chose the well-characterized lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> as the probe with the hypothesis that LDH expression would deplete pyruvate and affect isoprenoid synthesis, but not cause apicoplast loss. Importantly, we had a method to confirm LDH activity in the apicoplast. Parasites expressing active LDH should require mevalonate supplementation to compensate for loss of isoprenoid synthesis.</p><p>We expressed LDH with an amino-terminal conditional localization domain (CLD) to control apicoplast localization and appended a carboxy-terminal mCherry protein for verifying localization with live fluorescence. We also included a new 10x aptamer array for an additional level of control using the TetR-DOZI system. We were able to obtain parasite clones with proper insertion of the transfection plasmid (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). When we added anhydrotetracycline (aTC) to induce full production of LDH, we did not observe parasite death (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Expressed CLD-LDH-mCherry was largely apicoplast localized (M1=0.42, n=17), but often appeared as puncta in the region defined by the apicoplast (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Under mevalonate supplementation conditions, this result could be interpreted as confirming our hypothesis that pyruvate is not essential for apicoplast biogenesis. However, the parasites also grew without mevalonate. This result showed that the LDH probe did not deplete enough pyruvate to affect isoprenoid synthesis. Since we could not confirm LDH activity, we did not include these results in the paper. This example highlights why we would have had difficulty using another pyruvate kinase as a probe. Without a mechanism to assess the activity of the probe, it would be impossible to draw any conclusions from the experiment.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Expression and localization of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the apicoplast.</title><p>A) Genotyping PCR confirming insertion of CLD-LDH-mCherry (clone E7), with amplification demonstrating plasmid integration at the 5â and 3â loci of the P230p locus (lanes a, b), and lack of wild-type parasites due to failure to amplify at the wild type locus (lane c), as compared to the parental control (WT).

It will also be important to see the how timing of NTP/dNTP/mRNA level changes correlate with the PyrK2 mislocalization. In addition, to further support the authors' model, would they see the same phenotypes if they CLD tag DXS in WT parasites (or other genes like DMT2 known to affect the apicoplast maintenance but do not affect NTP/dNTP levels)?</p></disp-quote><p>This suggestion is similar to point 2, above, in that the idea is to better connect PyrKII to nucleotide metabolism in the apicoplast. We searched for an appropriate biosensor, but did not find one that would allow us to measure the levels of multiple nucleotides. Instead, we focused on using firefly luciferase to track the abundance of one nucleotide, ATP. We inserted a luciferase expression cassette into the P230p locus in PfMev CLD-PyrKII parasites. After confirming protein expression and localization, we conducted experiments to determine how mislocalization of PyrKII affects ATP levels in the apicoplast. Starting with synchronized parasites, we mislocalized PyrKII and quantified the change in luminescence every 8 hours for 48 hours. We found that mislocalization of PyrKII results in a decrease in the level of luminescence, suggesting that PyrKII may be playing an important role in ATP production/regeneration within the organelle (See Figure 6D in the manuscript). Figure 6âfigure supplement 3 and Figure 6âfigure supplement 4 provide additional information about this approach.</p><p>The second part of this question is similar to the first question, inquiring if the same trends in apicoplast RNA loss are the same between PyrKII and an essential apicoplast protein not required for organelle maintenance, such as DXS. We have conducted the experiment in which we remove mevalonate in DXS KO parasites and have shown that the loss of apicoplast RNA levels does not follow the same trend as that seen when mislocalizing PyrKII. While this experiment is not exactly the same as mislocalizing DXS it does approximate a similar effect that would have likely occur if we had, because mevalonate is bypassing the requirement for DXS, and is then removed. While we recognize that we were not measuring NTP/dNTP levels directly in that experiment, we believe that measuring RNA levels is a fair approximation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If PyrKII is essential for broad NTP production, where do the NDP precursors come from and why are they but not NTPs available in the apicoplast? The mechanisms here may be incompletely understood but explicit discussion of this point at the end of the paper seems warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, there arenât very many studies that shed light on nucleotide metabolism in the apicoplast.
