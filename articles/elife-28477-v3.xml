cells to diversify their antigen receptors. Remarkably, we found SHM acting in the thymus on α chain locus of shark TcR. SHM in developing shark T cells likely is catalyzed by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and results in both point and tandem mutations that accumulate non-conservative amino acid replacements within complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Mutation frequency at TcRα was as high as that seen at B cell receptor loci (BcR) in sharks and mammals, and the mechanism of SHM shares unique characteristics first detected at shark BcR loci. Additionally, fluorescence in situ hybridization showed the strongest AID expression in thymic corticomedullary junction and medulla. We suggest that TcRα utilizes SHM to broaden diversification of the primary αβ T cell repertoire in sharks, the first reported use in vertebrates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>somatic hypermutation</kwd><kwd>T cell receptor</kwd><kwd>shark</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>AID</kwd><kwd>thymus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1257829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Criscitiello</surname><given-names>Michael F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01OD0549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flajnik</surname><given-names>Martin F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Shark's T cells suggest plasticity in diversification mechanisms used by vertebrate lymphocytes, including somatic hypermutation in the thymus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All jawed vertebrates share fundamental components of the adaptive immune system. The cartilaginous fish (including sharks) are the most divergent jawed vertebrate group relative to mammals and use a polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kasahara et al., 1992</xref>), multiple isotypes of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy and light chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Flajnik, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Criscitiello and Flajnik, 2007</xref>), and the typical four T-cell receptor (TcR) chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rast et al., 1997</xref>). Shark lymphocyte antigen receptors are diversified by RAG-mediated V(D)J somatic rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bernstein et al., 1994</xref>). After antigen exposure, B cells also use the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) for receptor modification via somatic hypermutation (SHM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Conticello et al., 2005</xref>), allowing activated B cells to extensively alter their rearranged Ig variable region genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Muramatsu et al., 2000</xref>). Some of the variants produced by this process bind antigen with higher affinity, enhancing humoral immunity through affinity maturation. In addition to SHM in all jawed vertebrate Igs, AID catalyzes the processes of heavy chain class switch recombination (CSR) in tetrapods (and is implicated in shark CSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>]) and Ig gene conversion (in birds and some mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barreto and Magor, 2011</xref>). AID is a member of the APOBEC family of nucleic acid mutators, two of which likely diversify the variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR) system in the more ancient vertebrate lineages of lamprey and hagfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guo et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Although in general immunologists think TcR loci do not undergo somatic hypermutation, a few reports do exist of AID-mediated SHM in T cells. However, non-productive TcRα rearrangements in hybridomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marshall et al., 1999</xref>), TcRβ sequences from HIV-positive individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cheynier et al., 1998</xref>), and reports of SHM in TcRα murine germinal center T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 1994</xref>) are not thought to describe any normal physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bachl and Wabl, 1995</xref>). More recent studies indicate that TcR δ and γ in the dromedary camel and TcR γ in the sandbar shark somatically hypermutate (see below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Antonacci et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these findings, the general consensus has remained that AID does not target TcR loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pavri and Nussenzweig, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Choudhary et al., 2018</xref>). In over 30 years of studies of TcR repertoires, it has been clear that SHM is not functioning to either generate or further enhance the TcR repertoire of mouse and human.</p><p>Recent studies in the sandbar shark (<italic>Carcharhinus plumbeus</italic>) revived the notion of SHM at TcR loci. Sequencing of the entire TcRγ translocon in <italic>C. plumbeus</italic> showed definitively that SHM is occurring at that locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Shark TcRγ SHM occurs in two distinct patterns: point mutations and tandem mutations characteristic of B cell SHM in cartilaginous fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rumfelt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>), possibly suggesting two different cellular mechanisms for generating mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). The sandbar shark analysis found targeted nucleotide motifs of AID activity at the TcRγ locus. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al. (2012)</xref> examined ratios of replacement (R) and silent (S) mutations between CDR and framework regions to determine if mutation altered affinity of receptors, a method commonly used to study B cell affinity maturation by SHM. Finding no difference between R/S ratios in CDR versus framework regions, they concluded that TcRγ uses SHM to generate a more diverse repertoire rather than for affinity maturation. SHM-induced changes to TcRδ in camels showed similar results.</p><p>Early work in our lab also suggested that SHM occurs in the less restricted γδ T cells in nurse shark (<italic>Ginglymostoma cirratum</italic>) and perhaps in the alpha chain of MHC-restricted αβ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Criscitiello et al., 2010</xref>), encouraging us to examine this phenomenon further. Thus, we performed a systematic analysis of this process in shark primary and secondary lymphoid tissues using thymocyte clones containing the same unique third complementarity-determining region (CDR3). Our data suggest that SHM of TcRα is involved in primary T cell repertoire diversification and the enhancement of positive or negative selection in the thymic cortex. This finding is consistent with a model put forward by Niels Jerne over 40 years ago to explain antigen receptor positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jerne, 1971</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Somatic hypermutation in TcR γV and TcR δV</title><p>We assessed the presence of possible SHM within TcR V segments from γ, δ, and β chains.

Even with a conservative assignment of clones to predicted germline V sequences, we found nearly twice as many V genes as in the sandbar shark locus (which only contains five Vs).

Only one of these families (TcR δ10) lacked mutation. We found that in five of the seven δV families, the same V-δ segments used to generate δ cDNA sequences also generated α cDNA sequences.

Unfortunately, these segments matched only two groups of sequences in our TcRα dataset (TcRα/δ V4 and V9), likely due to inter-individual polymorphisms. In the absence of a complete germline sequence for this locus, we limited our database for TcRα to thymocyte clones with the same unique CDR3 signature. The CDR3 region results from the somatic recombination and assembly of variable (V) and joining (J) gene segments during lymphocyte development in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kuklina, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lantelme et al., 2008</xref>). The recombination process cleaves DNA and initiates repair mechanisms that result in the random insertion of non-template (N) nucleotides within the join, forming a unique binding sequence that contributes to the diversity and specificity of a TcR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gellert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kuklina, 2006</xref>). Once recombination ceases and the thymocyte proliferates, this distinctive CDR3 sequence is perpetuated in all daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murphy and Weaver, 2017</xref>). Since it is unlikely that two thymocytes would generate identical CDR3 sequences during VJ recombination, we predict that amplicons containing identical CDR3 sequences derived from the same progenitor and thus must contain the same germline V and J segments. Alpha CDR3s exhibited substantial variation within our shark sequences, despite the absence of diversity (D) segments. For example, TcRα V1 sequences using the same V and J segments had CDR3 lengths that differed by as many as six amino acids (18 nucleotides), and few CDR3s shared more than one amino acid within this V-J join (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Further, the majority of sequences in our overall dataset do contain N and palindromic (P) nucleotides within this join. Using clones containing the same V segment from different sharks, we determined the putative end of each V segment. We first aligned sequences containing the same V segment. Then, assuming that any nucleotide present in the same position within more than one shark must be germline, we determined which nucleotides within a join belong to the V segment. We then repeated this process for each J segment. Of 290 clones, we found 197 (68%) unique sequences within this join (0–34 nucleotides in length), suggesting that most sequences contain N/P nucleotides (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Finally, we never observed the same CDR3 sequence in more than one shark, suggesting both exonuclease activity and addition of N and P nucleotides help diversify alpha CDR3s in nurse shark. Therefore, even in the absence of an assembled locus, we were able to evaluate mutation to germline αV segments by considering changes within only those thymocyte clones containing identical CDR3s. Our extremely conservative approach of using <italic>only clones containing the same CDR3 encoding rearrangement and N and P nucleotide sequences</italic> provided us the assurance that we had distinct αVs descendant from clonal T cells, since it would be extremely unlikely that two T cells created receptors that contained the exact same nucleotide sequence by chance.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28477.005</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CDR3s of TcR Alpha chain are diverse.</title><p>Amino acid (aa) alignment of TcR αV1 thymocyte clones illustrating diversity of the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3).

We divided our 45 clones into 13 CDR3-sharing groups from seven different α V families and then analyzed sequences within groups for potential mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We excluded two groups (four sequences) from analyses (αV1.3 and αV7.1) that contained no mutations within FR or CDR regions (leaving 41 clones for analysis). Two sequences (<italic>aV7.4m_THY09_051410</italic> and <italic>aV5J_SPV17_102810</italic>) contained one 3-base insertion and one sequence (<italic>aV1.4J_SPV07_090110</italic>) contained an 18-base insertion; although SHM can result in insertions and deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Diaz et al., 2002</xref>), we did not include insertion nucleotides in mutation counts. All sequences were in-frame and contained no internal stop codons, suggesting functionality of cells. Average lengths of CDRs were as follows: CDR1: 7.0 amino acids (range: 5–8); CDR2: 5.7 amino acids (range: 5–7); and CDR3: 6.0 amino acids (range: 1–10). Naming of families and subfamilies followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Criscitiello et al. (2010)</xref>. However, with the accumulation of sequence data over our previous analysis of nurse shark TcRα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Criscitiello et al., 2010</xref>), we expanded our nomenclature considerably. Additional annotation followed the IMGT guidelines for TcRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lefranc et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28477.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Alignment of Alpha V cDNA clones suggest somatic hypermutation at shark TCRα.</title><p>Thymocyte clones for all 11 αV groups with the same CDR3 from six different predicted V genes. Locations of framework regions (FR), complementarity determining regions (CDR), joining regions (J), and constant (C) regions are marked above the scale for each αV. In absence of germline sequence information, we used a Geneious-derived nucleotide consensus sequence for analysis of nucleotide changes in thymocyte clones. Amino acids are shown under the consensus sequence, and dots represent identity to this sequence. Nonsynonymous changes are highlighted in black; synonymous changes are underlined. Gaps are used for alignment purposes and indicate either a shortened sequence (at the beginning or end) or insertions or deletions within the sequence. Sequences are identified by a single clone number or a group of identical clones condensed to a single line (the number of clones are indicated). Clone numbers that contain ‘THY’ are from thymus, ‘PBL’ are from peripheral blood leukocytes, and ‘SPV’ are from spiral valve (intestine). We did not use clones from αV1.3 and αV7.1 because they did not contain mutations in FR or CDR regions.

The overall TcRα mutation frequency was 0.0226 substitutions per nucleotide (S/N), with 66% of all substitutions (187 of 283) resulting in amino acid replacements. The CDRs accumulated significantly more mutations than FRs (CDR: 0.0352 S/N; FR: 0.0188 S/N; p=0.0373), and substitutions in CDRs were twice as likely to be nonsynonymous changes (NSYN) than those in FRs (CDR: 0.0235 S/N; FR: 0.0122 S/N; p=0.0312; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). There was no difference in frequency of synonymous (SYN) mutations between regions (CDR: 0.0117 S/N, FR: 0.0066 S/N; p=0.0705). Finally, although we found more tandemly mutated bases in CDRs (41 of 81, or 50.6% of all CDR mutations) than in FRs (73 of 192, or 38.0% of all FR mutations), this difference was not significant; p=0.721; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).

CDR3 displayed an unusually low mean mutation frequency (2.97%). However, these frequencies may be artificially low since our groups were based only on clones containing the same CDR3 sequence, and clones whose CDR3s deviated markedly from the consensus would have been excluded by our conservative grouping approach.

Since Stellaris RNA FISH uses a mixture of shorter probes (~20 bp in length) that hybridize along the length of the target RNA, the resulting signal is detectable only when tens of probes hybridize to the target. This makes the technology very specific -- only those transcripts bound to numerous probes are visible -- and limits the potential for false-positive or false-negative results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Orjalo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Raj and Tyagi, 2010</xref>).

AID expression occurred in ‘rings’ around areas of expressed TcR αC messages within the inner cortex and CMJ (where positive selection occurs in mammals) and the medulla (where negative selection occurs in mammals). Further, AID always co-localized with TcR αC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, we observed a consistent pattern of expression where a ‘ring’ of cells expressing both TcR αC and AID surround a central cell expressing only TcR αC. The more specific signal generated by FISH may suggest that, once a T cell completes RAG-mediated somatic rearrangement of its alpha chain locus, it clonally expands to form a ring of daughter cells around it. These daughter T cells then express AID (and TcR αC), promoting somatic hypermutation within their TcR alpha sequences during times when cells also undergo positive and negative selection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28477.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>AID expression localized to inner cortex and cortico-medullary junction.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) H and E staining of fixed shark thymus tissue illustrating thymic architecture (10x).

In B cells, AID mediates SHM within germinal centers of lymph nodes and spleen in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Crouch et al., 2007</xref>), and we predict this is similarly occurring in the B cells zones identified in the shark splenic white pulp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rumfelt et al., 2002</xref>). Somatic mutations occur in rearranged variable regions of B cells responding to antigen at rates of 10<sup>−3</sup> mutations per base pair per cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Odegard and Schatz, 2006</xref>). These changes are dominated by point mutations (and in shark, tandem mutations), biased toward transitions (G:A and C:T), and preferentially targeted to the AID motifs D<underline>G</underline>YW/WR<underline>C</underline>H (and less to W<underline>A</underline>/<underline>T</underline>W) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Malecek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Odegard and Schatz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rogozin and Diaz, 2004</xref>). The sequences of B cell V genes have evolved to maximize mutational effects, targeting the accumulation of replacement mutation within the antigen-binding CDRs and limiting mutation within the more structural FRs. In humans, this focused mutation correlates with the long-term survival of B cell receptor repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Saini and Hershberg, 2015</xref>). The ability of B cells to use SHM for receptor diversification and improved antigen affinity is the basis of adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Saini and Hershberg, 2015</xref>). Despite having similar developmental machinery as B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gellert, 2002</xref>), the assumption has long been held that αβ T cells do not undergo SHM because mutation could have deleterious effects on the binding of TcRs to MHC:Ag complexes (MHC:Ag) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wagner et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mantovani et al., 2002</xref>). Despite some suggestion that SHM was occurring in T cells, studies designed to either quantify or characterize mutation in mouse or human TcRs did not gain traction and the textbook definition of SHM still defines it as an exclusively B cell mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murphy and Weaver, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies reported the incidence of SHM in the γ chain of γδ T cells of sandbar shark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2009</xref>) and in both γ and δ chains of dromedary camel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Antonacci et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ciccarese et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vaccarelli et al., 2012</xref>). In each study, SHM mirrored the mutational patterns observed in B cells during affinity maturation. However, in both sandbar shark γ and dromedary camel γ and δ chains, the authors hypothesized that T cells employ mutation as a means to generate a more diverse receptor repertoire rather than to improve receptor affinity to Ag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Antonacci et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vaccarelli et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to αβ T cells, γδ T cells that interact with non-classical MHC often recombine tissue-specific, restricted sets of genes that have limited junctional diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allison et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to consider that SHM could be used as a receptor-diversifying mechanism to fine-tune ligand recognition within a prospective tissue or to allow changes within the loci that allow receptors to evolve more rapidly to changing ligand environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kazen and Adams, 2011</xref>). Further, many γδ T cells typically bind Ag in a manner more similar to that of Ig than to αβ T cells, recognizing and directly binding to small molecules and intact proteins without presentation by classical MHC:Ag complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allison and Garboczi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allison et al., 2001</xref>). Inflammation stimulates activation of γδ T cells earlier in an immune response, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and killing infected macrophages. Thus, γδ T cells combine an innate-like response with an adaptive recognition strategy, providing both an immediate response to pathogen invasion and an ongoing, adaptive response to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allison and Garboczi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allison et al., 2001</xref>). It is evident that how SHM presents a useful solution for accomplishing these tasks by creating a more diverse repertoire of these antibody-like γδ TcRs. Taken together, these studies clearly demonstrate that we can no longer regard SHM as a uniquely B cell mechanism. Considering the diversity of TcRs and TcR diversification mechanisms being found even in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hansen and Miller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miller, 2010</xref>), perhaps we should prepare for more surprises in TCR antigen recognition.</p><p>In the present study, we verified SHM occurring within the γ and δ chains of γδ T cells in both thymic and peripheral immune tissue of nurse shark. Remarkably, we also detected SHM occurring in the α chain of αβ T cells. We observed mutational characteristics within α chain of nurse sharks similar to those found in B cell SHM. We observed an overall mutation frequency of 0.0226 substitutions per nucleotide (S/N) and a bias toward transition mutations. Further, we detected both single and tandem mutations, a pattern unique to sharks that also occurs in shark B cells. Changes to G and C nucleotides comprise 66.1% of all mutations. Mutation was twice as frequent in CDRs as in FRs (0.0352 versus 0.0188 S/N, respectively), and substitutions in CDRs were significantly more likely to result in amino acid changes. Further, mutations were strongly associated with AID hotspots, and substitutions to G and C nucleotides occurred nearly 1.4x as often within CDR hotspots than FR hotspots. Out of curiosity, we compared counts of AID hotspot motifs within CDR and FR regions between our 11 nurse shark TcR αV consensus sequences and 6 human TcR αV segments (V1.1, V1.2, V2, V3, V4 and V5). We found that shark TcR V segments exhibit far more WR<underline>C</underline>H/D<underline>G</underline>YW motifs per sequence than do human V segments (p=0.02). Further, motifs in CDRs of shark occurred 2-3x as often as in humans [human: average of 2.27 motifs per FR (range 1.97–2.65), 2.28 per CDR (range 1.97–2.59); shark: average of 3.25 motifs per FR (range 2.85–3.88), 5.09 per CDR (range 4.02–6.16); data not shown]. The bias we found for nonsynonymous and non-conservative mutations in TcRα CDRs in the shark thymus are consistent with more than simple repertoire diversification; it suggests selection for changes in paratope.</p><p>We identified SHM from identical cDNA clones originating from both thymus and spiral valve tissues (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>), suggesting that T cells with SHM-modified receptors must have originated within the thymus and then traveled to peripheral gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Unsurprisingly, we detected the most AID expression within the inner cortex, medulla, and CMJ of shark thymus, where rearrangement and testing of TcRα takes place in mammals. Positive selection on self-MHC/self peptide for mature thymocytes begins with the CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) stage of development while differentiation into CD4/CD8 single positive (SP) cells requires that the TcR interact with MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huesmann et al., 1991</xref>). If there is no TcR: MHC/peptide match found, T cell differentiation stalls with failure to be positively selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reinherz et al., 1999</xref>). However, the unusual nature of the TcRα locus, with up to 100 J segments depending on species, permits multiple successive rearrangements within a single cell, rescuing non-productive or self-selectable receptors with further gene rearrangements, a process called <italic>receptor editing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bedel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Borgulya et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Petrie et al., 1993</xref>). In mice, unlike the situation in developing B cells, receptor editing does not seem to rescue T cells from negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kreslavsky et al., 2013</xref>) and thus provides several opportunities for positive selection of DP thymocytes. Thymic nurse cells may help optimize these opportunities for selection by providing microenvironments favorable to secondary alpha chain rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakagawa et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In developing shark thymocytes, SHM in TcRα loci in conjunction with receptor editing (note that sharks, like all other gnathostomes, have a large number of TcRα J segments) could be involved in salvaging cells for positive selection or rescuing cells from death by negative selection. If AID-induced SHM occurs in conjunction with receptor editing and positive selection, AID should be upregulated in cells undergoing RAG-mediated alpha rearrangement (and thus in cells also expressing RAG). However, if SHM occurs <italic>after</italic> rearrangement of TcR α and thus used for rescuing cells during negative selection, the same T cell would not express both AID and RAG. While we cannot determine conclusively without RAG expression data, the patterns of AID and TcRα expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) suggest that AID is upregulated after cells proliferate and diversify following alpha rearrangement (within the ‘ring’ of cells). Thus, it is likely that AID is used primarily to rescue cells from negative selection, providing a ‘mini-expanded self-referential repertoire’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) and reducing the ‘profligate waste of thymocytes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murphy and Weaver, 2017</xref>). However, based on the works above by Kreslavsky et al. and Nakagawa et al. in mice, we cannot discount the possibility that TcRs use SHM in conjunction with receptor editing for positive selection since developing shark T cells could still undergo negative selection after SHM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). We cannot completely rule out AID use in mature shark T cells, although our sequence data show no greater mutation frequency in the periphery, and abatement of AID expression in the thymic medulla are consistent with AID being a mechanism used only in T cell development. Further studies examining expression data from single cells could elucidate the timing of AID-catalyzed SHM in relation to T cell development.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28477.022</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model predicting how AID acts on T cells in the thymus.</title><p>CD4/CD8 double negative (DN) thymocytes in the subcapsular region (SC) and cortex rearrange the β chain, using a surrogate pTα receptor to test for expression signaling. Cells with productive β arrangements then proliferate and express both CD4 and CD8, becoming double positive thymocytes (DPs). As DPs move toward the inner cortex and cortico-medullary junction (CMJ) where α chain rearranges, cells may begin to express AID. Non-productive rearrangements can be rescued from apoptosis by receptor editing or by receptor salvaging, in which AID catalyzes SHM to produce cells with improved affinity to MHC:Ag complexes (to pass positive selection). Salvaged thymocytes then proliferate and express either CD4 or CD8 on their surface as single-positive (SP) cells.

(2011</xref>) reported endogenous AID expression by peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and immature B cells in mice. T cells that expressed AID also produce a distinctive cytokine profile, are associated with cell activation, and increase in abundance with age, suggesting these cells have distinctive long-term functions in aging cells. In immature B cells, AID expression may help negatively select autoreactive B cells and contribute to primary repertoire diversity. Together these results may indicate that AID expression in mice is a relic of a more extended expression in earlier species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qin et al., 2011</xref>). Some mammals (e.g. rabbit, sheep, and cattle) use SHM in B cell primary repertoire diversification in the gut associated lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alitheen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Archer et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Becker and Knight, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Butler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lanning et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Reynaud et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reynaud et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Reynolds and Morris, 1983</xref>). Even more recently, research implicated AID in central B cell tolerance in mammalian pre-B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cantaert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kuraoka et al., 2011</xref>), and there are examples of AID-mediated SHM being used alongside RAG-mediated V(D)J recombination in primary B cell repertoire generation in many mammals and in AID-mediated primary B cell diversification during gene conversion in the bird bursa of Fabricius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reynaud et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Thompson and Neiman, 1987</xref>). We suggest that these B-cell-specific features are much later mechanisms of AID-driven primary lymphocyte repertoire diversification and honing, perhaps mechanisms convergent with the thymic process we describe here. However, we predict that studies of this type in other vertebrate species will reveal the use of SHM as a T cell diversifying mechanism in a much broader collection of species.</p><p>Although recent studies report B cells present in the thymus of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Perera and Huang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Perera et al., 2013</xref>), Miracle et al. examined B cell expression levels (IgM and IgX) in various tissues (including thymus) at different ages in the clearnose skate. While skate thymus expressed both IgM and IgX in early life stages, adult skates no longer express Ig in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miracle et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Criscitiello and Flajnik, 2007</xref> also found little evidence that Ig light chain is expressed in adult nurse shark thymus (see Fig S3 of paper), corroborating older northern blot studies with heavy chain in the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rumfelt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rumfelt et al., 2004</xref>). A concurrent study within our lab used RT-qPCR to analyze IgM expression within shark thymus and found that, while young sharks do express IgM in the thymus, adult nurse sharks (which we used in the current study) do not express IgM (data not shown). Further, preliminary results using FISH probes to IgM constant region also indicate that adult nurse sharks do not express IgM in the thymus. What little Ig expression we found in the thymus did not co-localize with AID expression.</p><p>Shark TcRs are capable of a wide variety of diversification mechanisms. In addition to RAG-mediated combinatorial and junctional diversity from complex loci, TcRδ (and possibly α) rearrange Ig-TcR chimera using IgM and IgW V exons with TcR D-J-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Criscitiello et al., 2010</xref>). The TcR δ locus also encodes the doubly rearranging NAR-TcR, a δ chain with two diverse V domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Criscitiello et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, our existing data do not suggest that SHM targets the IgHV or the TcR δV of the NAR-TcR δV chains for diversification. This suggests great control over the (nearly synchronous if not concomitant) expression of the potentially genotoxic AID and RAG. Thus, SHM at the γ, δ, and α loci adds to the battery of extraordinary diversification mechanisms used by shark lymphocytes in antigen recognition, although we do not yet understand the full effects of SHM on the animal’s immunity to infectious disease. As for the dangers of any aberrant mutational activity genome-wide, sharks could be more resilient than other taxa due to their inherent slow rate of mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Martin, 1999</xref>), possibly linked to the exceptional longevity of some individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nielsen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the broader scope of lymphocyte evolution, we must consider whether the ancestral vertebrate lymphocyte employed APOBEC-family-mediated diversification before the ‘big bang’ of RAG (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hirano, 2015</xref>]). Lamprey lymphocytes express at least two lymphocyte-specific cytidine deaminases (CDA1/CDA2) in the AID/APOBEC family. These deaminases emerged phylogenetically as the closest sister group in the AID/APOBEC family to the AID used by gnathostomes for Ig class-switch recombination, somatic hypermutation, and Ig gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rogozin et al., 2007</xref>). CDA-mediated gene rearrangement in lampreys occurs in a manner similar to AID-induced immunoglobulin gene conversion in some birds and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rogozin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 1994</xref>). One study suggested that VLRA (the analog to αβ TcR in jawed vertebrates) also might use CDA to affinity mature its receptors, indicating that CDA contributes both to repertoire generation and to somatic mutation after antigen exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Deng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Flajnik, 2014</xref>). If this is true, it may be possible that the ancestor to modern vertebrates also used an AID-like enzyme to assist with lymphocyte receptor development in a thymus-like organ. The expression of AID in the thymus of primitive sharks may be a remnant of this ancestral process, a mechanism lost in later vertebrates because of its potential for breaking down self-tolerance in mature lymphocytes. Perhaps, agnathans evolved specific APOBEC molecules for diversification of their B and T like VLRs, while gnathostomes evolved AID for T cell primary repertoire diversification (Neils Jerne’s ‘mutant breeding organ’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jerne, 1971</xref>]) and B cell affinity maturation, eventually co-opting AID for use in class switch recombination at IGH translocons, and later still, gene conversion and SHM for primary B cell repertoires.</p><p>From this trend of comparative TcR studies, we conclude with two hypotheses that we will test with further immunogenetic and functional studies in shark and other vertebrate models. First, the division between B and T cell repertoire diversification components and mechanisms was not as clear-cut in ancestral lymphocytes as in modern humans and mice. The second is that different vertebrate groups have not only evolved myriad diversifications for Ig repertoires and function, but TcR biology may be just as varied. This premise is already accumulating ample supporting evidence as IgHV domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Parra et al., 2012</xref>), high allelic polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Criscitiello et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Criscitiello et al., 2004b</xref>), germline joined V exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang and Miller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), and now mechanisms such as SHM, all once considered the immune privilege of Ig or MHC genes, are also employed for TcRs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study animals</title><p>TCR sequence data used in this study came from two adult female nurse sharks (‘Joanie’ and ‘Mary Junior’; <italic>Ginglymostoma cirratum</italic>) delivered by caesarian section off the Florida Keys and matured in the aquatic vivarium of the University of Maryland’s Center of Marine Biotechnology.

We aligned nucleotide and amino acid sequences using the ClustalW Multiple Alignment tool in Geneious with a gap penalty of 15, a gap extension penalty of 6.66, and free end gaps. We manually adjusted the alignments as necessary. We determined sequence relationships phylogenetically using the Geneious tree builder with default settings. We grouped sequences into unique V families based on 70% nucleotide sequence identity and 75% amino acid sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brodeur and Riblet, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rumfelt et al., 2004</xref>) using the same α V numbering scheme as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Criscitiello et al.

We cultured several positive clones and isolated BAC DNA according to manufacturer’s protocol with the Qiagen Large Construct Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). We sent purified BAC DNA to the Duke University Center for Genomic and Computational Biology (Durham, NC) for PacBio SMRT (Menlo Park, CA) large insert (15–20 kb) library preparation, sequenced on the PacBio RSII platform with P6-C4 chemistry.

Of these 17 segments, only 13 contained unique nucleotide sequences, and all V segments were highly similar to each other (69–100% nucleotide and 52–100% amino acid identity). Twelve germline V segments shared &gt;93% nucleotide identity (&gt;85% amino acid identity), with three segments differing by only a single nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Based on the variability we observed in our sequence data, these 17 germline α/δ V segments must represent only a small portion of the available Vs in the nurse shark genome.</p><p>We compared these 17 germline α/δ V segments to our TcR αV database containing all nine potential V families from two different sharks. All 17 germline α/δ V segments aligned to our αV4 data with &gt;75% nucleotide identity, while 15 segments shared &gt;93% nucleotide identity to at least one sequence in our αV4 dataset. Of the 60 sequences in our αV4 dataset, 37 sequences aligned specifically to eight germline α/δ V segments, with alignments containing one to 17 aV4 sequences per germline segment (nucleotide alignments shared &gt;97% identity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12.</xref>). While we did observe nucleotide differences within alignments, most differed by fewer than four nucleotides from the germline α/δ V segments. Because several germline segments differed by only a single nucleotide and we are certain that we have not found all α/δ V segments in the genome, these differences could represent variation in alleles or individuals rather than mutation. Thus, we chose not to rely on these data for mutational analysis.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28477.024</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Observed TcR Alpha/Delta germline Vs exhibit high sequence identity.</title><p>Nucleotide (<bold>A</bold>) and amino acid (<bold>B</bold>) alignments of 17 germline variable (V) region gene segments.

For each domain, we first counted the number of target nucleotides within D<underline>G</underline>YW/WR<underline>C</underline>H or W<underline>A</underline>/<underline>T</underline>W hotspots. We then examined each mutation to determine if it occurred inside or outside a hotspot. We counted changes from the consensus sequence to a target nucleotide within its respective motif as a hotspot mutation. We defined the frequency of hotspot mutation as the number of mutations (of target nucleotides) occurring within hotspots divided by the total number of mutations for each region. From these data, we compared the mutability of bases between FR and CDR regions using χ<sup>2</sup> Analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Base substitution indices</title><p>We calculated a mutability index for each nucleotide using methods similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al.

We then defined the mutability index as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michel Nussenzweig (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, David Schatz (Reviewer #1), served as a Guest Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors demonstrate and characterize somatic hypermutation (SHM) in TcRα, γ, and δ chains in the nurse shark. TcRα hypermutation is described for the first time in any TcRαβ system, although it was previously observed in sandbar shark TcRγδ chains. No mutation was observed for nurse shark TcRβ. SHM had been predicted to be disallowed in TcRαβ systems as it was never observed in mammals and has the potential to disrupt TcR-MHC I/II interactions. The findings here challenge that view and suggest that at least in shark, SHM of TcRα in the thymus contributes to repertoire diversification and potentially to α-β T cell positive selection. Consistent with the findings from TcR chain sequencing, the authors provide evidence in favor of AID expression in the thymic cortex and corticomedullary junction. The authors are experts in the field of comparative VDJ immunity and have published widely on this topic. The presentation of the findings and the discussion of their implications are clear and interesting. The finding highlights an important and unexpected aspect of TcR biology with implications for TcRαβ function in jawed vertebrates. This study should be of significant general interest to immunologists and evolutionary biologists.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major challenge facing the authors is that they do not have the germline sequence of most nurse shark Vαα gene segments, and hence they have to infer a germline sequence from the cDNA sequences they obtain. To do this, the authors assume that if the same CDR3 sequence arises more than once, it must derive from the same original V-to-J rearrangement, and hence that sequence differences between two such clones must represent somatic mutations. Unfortunately, while this argument is strong for IgH, TcRδ, and TcRβ sequences that include D segments, it is potentially weak for TcRα rearrangements where a single joint is formed and junctional diversity can be low. To have confidence that duplicate CDR3 sequences represent unique rearrangements, one would want to examine the extent of nucleotide deletion and addition; only in joints with significant addition/deletion would one be confident that the junction is likely to be unique. The problem is compounded by the fact that VDJ recombination has a tendency to use microhomologies (if they exist) at the ends of the two gene segments to mediate joining, and this can lead to the same junction repeatedly. Was the same CDR3 sequence ever observed in different sharks? The authors need to justify their underlying assumption and provide an explicit discussion of the specificity of CDR3 sequence for rearrangements in each chain.</p><p>2) In addition, the data contain a significant puzzle: a very high level of shared CDR3 among a relatively small number of unique sequences. Specifically, 72 unique amino acid sequences, representing 12 V-α families, were obtained, which would correspond to an average of 6 unique sequences per V family, and an average of only 3 unique sequences per V family per shark. Given that the starting 5 microgram aliquots of RNA should derive from hundreds of thousands of cells, each starting RNA sample should contain a large number of independent V-J rearrangements for any given V. Given this and that there appear to be multiple Jα gene segments in the nurse shark, the chance of finding the same CDR3 sequence in a handful of sequences for a given V would be predicted to be very low. The chance of finding 42 sequences out of the 72 (more than half!) that share CDR3 with another sequence seems exceedingly unlikely. The authors need to carefully address this issue. The authors should provide a table that lists the number of unique aa sequences obtained for each V family within the 72 sequences, and of those, the number that have an identical CDR3.</p><p>The authors did in fact derive the germline sequence of two V family members (V4 and V9). Why not focus the analysis on these two families, where such ambiguities would be less of an issue? Furthermore, one of the reported set of sequences does arise from the V4 family, but it does not appear that the germline sequence information was taken advantage of. Why? And, were other sequences from V4 and V9 obtained in the dataset, and did they show mutations compared to the germline sequences?</p><p>It is noted that all reviewers agreed that the nature of the sequence differences observed (focus on hotspots, abundance of tandem mutations, etc.) are consistent with the mutations being real SHM events.</p><p>3) Expression of Aicda is not particularly clear in the ISH analysis. The data show a generally darker appearance with the antisense compared to the sense probe, but these differences are not completely convincing. Furthermore, it was difficult to distinguish the cortex vs. the medulla and the appearance is so uniform overall that claims for region specificity for Aicda are unconvincing. More annotation highlighting thymic structure and the probes used would be helpful. Scale bars should be included instead of objective magnification. Overall, it was felt that the Aicda ISH data need to be improved. Possibly other images or higher magnification images would help.</p><p>4) There were some concerns about the Aicda RT-PCR data. The results are expressed in delta Ct, which is a logarithmic measure, and it would be better to calculate a fold-difference in the expression of AID in spleen and thymus. How much of a difference in expression is there between the negative control (forebrain) and thymus? Was the resulting PCR product cloned and sequenced to confirm its identity? Are there B cells in the nurse shark thymus as there are in mouse and perhaps other cartilaginous fish such as the skate? If so, are the authors sure that AID expression is in T cells in the ISH and RT-PCR analyses? The authors should consider discussing this in the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Somatic hypermutation of T cell receptor α chain contributes to positive selection in nurse shark thymus&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michel Nussenzweig (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom served as Guest Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have added new RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization data that strengthen the claim that AID is expressed in the shark thymus, and have adequately addressed some of the points previously raised. There remain a number of significant issues that need to be addressed satisfactorily before publication can be considered.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>1) Based on the information provided by the authors in their response to the review, it is now clear that the analysis of mutations in TcRβ, γ, and δ (no CDR3 sequence obtained) was less rigorous and less definitive than in TcRαα (and, the TcRβ analysis is weaker than the rest because of the small number of sequences obtained (56)). Hence, all claims that mutations were not found in TcRβ must either be removed or carefully qualified. For example, the second sentence of the Abstract contrasts the findings at TcRβ (no mutation) and TcRα (mutation found) with no qualification, leaving the reader with the mistaken impression that the two analyses were equivalent and the two conclusions equally strong. The same problem was found in the last paragraph of the Introduction, subsection “Somatic hypermutation in TcR γV and TcR δV but not TcR βV”, and in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>2) &quot;Since it is highly improbable that two thymocytes would generate identical CDR3 sequences during VJ recombination…&quot; As was pointed out in the original review, this claim is not obvious; it should not be stated in this fashion. Indeed, there are a priori reasons to think that the same CDR3 sequence could readily arise from independent V-J rearrangements. The authors should present this claim as a hypothesis that they then carefully validate with data (which they begin to do in the first paragraph of the subsection “Somatic hypermutation in nurse shark TcR αV”). Furthermore, the conclusion of this sentence that &quot;amplicons containing identical CDR3 sequences must have derived from the same progenitor&quot; is overstated. At best, the conclusion could be that they are &quot;likely to have derived from the same progenitor&quot;. A statistical analysis of the V-J sequences might allow the authors to make a quantitative claim of just how likely this is, but in the absence of such an analysis, the claims should be stated cautiously. The manuscript needs to be rewritten to accommodate these points. Same issue in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><p>3) Closely related to this: The authors have clarified that a larger number of sequences were obtained than was apparent in the initial submission, but this information is not provided in the Results section. Since most readers will not look at the Materials and methods section, it is suggested that the authors add information to the second paragraph of the subsection “Somatic hypermutation in nurse shark TcR αV” to inform readers of the total number of underlying sequences from the two relevant sharks. In addition, the Materials and methods states that sequences were obtained from four sharks; it is confusing that data from only two of the sharks was actually used. Why are all 4 sharks mentioned if data from only two of them were used? How many total sequences were obtained from the two relevant sharks? This is highly relevant given that these are (apparently) the only data from which the analyzed TcRα sequences are derived. This is directly relevant to the concern, expressed in the original review, that the identification of so many repeated CDR3 regions from a small sequence dataset is extremely unlikely. This issue has not been satisfactorily resolved in the resubmission. The requested table that shows how many unique aa sequences were obtained for each V family, and of those, the number that have an identical CDR3, was not provided. Nor have the authors provided a detailed description of the proportion of TcRα sequences that have N/P nucleotides (which would provide higher confidence of assigning SHM) versus those that are directly joined (less confidence). The reviewers remain concerned by the possibility that the number of repeat CDR3 sequences is exceedingly unlikely given the number of sequences obtained. The authors should carefully address this concern.</p><p>4) The new RNA fluorescence FISH analysis is a significant improvement over the ISH analysis, but despite the claimed specificity of the method used, experiments to document specificity are needed. Ideally, a tissue not expressing AID would be analyzed (or do the authors feel that the negative portions of the thymus provide sufficient specificity controls?). Given that the authors now present a detailed model for AID expression/SHM in shark thymus (Figure 10) based on the RNA fluorescence FISH data, it is particularly important to address specificity.</p><p>5) The claim made in the last paragraph of the subsection “Mutations, in situ hybridization, and AID expression in thymus “that TcRα expression is more diffuse than that of AID is unconvincing. TcRαA and AID expression appear to coincide in all areas visible in Figure 9. The authors should not push their interpretation just because it fits with the proposed role of AID in selection. Similarly, the organization of AID in rings around TcRα+ regions is intriguing and while the authors' interpretation in terms of relative timing of expression is plausible, it is quite speculative and should be clearly stated as such.</p><p>6) The in situ hybridization in Figure 8B (panels 3,4) for AID is still hard to interpret as the signal is weak and diffuse. The apparent expression pattern suggested by these images does not seem to correspond to the localized patterns seen in the fluorescent in situs in Figure 9 and Figure 9—figure supplement 1. Why is this? Is this a matter of scale? It is a concern that one set of data seems to contradict the other.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28477.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major challenge facing the authors is that they do not have the germline sequence of most nurse shark Vα gene segments, and hence they have to infer a germline sequence from the cDNA sequences they obtain.

We present data to illustrate CDR3 junctional diversity and include a new figure (Figure 4) depicting this diversity. (We observed similar results in other α V segments as well.) We never observed the same CDR3 sequence in more than one shark.</p><p>We included a paragraph under the “Somatic hypermutation in nurse shark TcR αV” section of the results to discuss these data: “Despite the absence of diversifying segments, α CDR3s exhibited substantial variation within our shark sequences. For example, TcRα V1 sequences using the same V and J segments had CDR3 lengths that differed by as many as 6 amino acids (12 nucleotides), and few CDR3s shared more than one amino acid within this V-J join (Figure 4). Further, we never observed the same CDR3 sequence in more than one shark, suggesting both exonuclease activity and addition of N and P nucleotides help diversify α CDR3s in nurse shark.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition, the data contain a significant puzzle: a very high level of shared CDR3 among a relatively small number of unique sequences.

However, we actually acquired significantly more sequences than the 72 we describe in the paper. We have revised this section to include a discussion of the total number of sequences (564) from which we found those with shared CDR3s.</p><p>Within the Materials and methods section titled “Sequence Alignment and Tree Building,” we added: “Our preliminary dataset contained 564 TcRα clones (encoding 286 unique amino acid sequences representing nine Vα families) from three tissues (PBL, spleen, thymus) of four sharks (Joanie, Mary Junior, Yellow, and 1299). Using this dataset, we separated sequences containing identical CDR3 rearrangements and counted mutations within each TcR “clone family” bearing the V-J rearrangement from single founder thymocytes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors did in fact derive the germline sequence of two V family members (V4 and V9).

The development of this technique delayed our resubmission. In a new figure (Figure 9), we provide a composite of seven Z-stacked images (10x) depicting the localization of AID expression to the cortico-medullary junction and medullary regions of shark thymus. We also present individual fluorophore images of DAPI, TcRα, and AID and the Z-stacked merged images (10x, 20x, and 63x) to illustrate the pattern of AID and TcRα expression within four locations of shark thymus. To ensure our probes were hybridizing independently of one another, we probed AID and TRA individually on adjacent slides and looked for co-localization of the probes (see Figure 9—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We also included a paragraph in the Results section describing these data: “We confirmed our colorimetric ISH results with RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes against the TcR α constant region (αC) and exons 2 and 3 of AID.

We also included the expression-fold difference between forebrain and thymus: “We confirmed the expression of AID in the thymus through real-time RT-qPCR, where thymus tissue expressed AID at roughly half (0.7x) the levels found in spleen (where B cell SHM is known to occur) and nearly 6x the levels observed in forebrain (negative control; Figure 8A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was the resulting PCR product cloned and sequenced to confirm its identity?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes.

The bar graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) illustrates RT-qPCR expression of various immune cell markers in thymus tissue from sharks of varying ages.

We need more evidence to make further conclusions.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28477.029</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28477-resp-fig2-v3"/></fig><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Points:</p><p>1) Based on the information provided by the authors in their response to the review, it is now clear that the analysis of mutations in TcRβ, γ, and δ (no CDR3 sequence obtained) was less rigorous and less definitive than in TcRα (and, the TcRβ analysis is weaker than the rest because of the small number of sequences obtained (56)). Hence, all claims that mutations were not found in TcRβ must either be removed or carefully qualified. For example, the second sentence of the Abstract contrasts the findings at TcRβ (no mutation) and TcRα (mutation found) with no qualification, leaving the reader with the mistaken impression that the two analyses were equivalent and the two conclusions equally strong. The same problem was found in the last paragraph of the Introduction, subsection “Somatic hypermutation in TcR γV and TcR δV but not TcR βV”, and in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We are in the process of repeating the mutation analysis of the other chains to the same rigor as α. Collecting enough CDR3-sharing sequences is taking some time. However, for this manuscript, we removed language that implies the analyses or conclusions are equivalent. In the above order, these changes are as follows:</p><p>“Remarkably, we found SHM acting in the thymus on α chain of shark T cell receptors (TcR).”</p><p>“Our data suggest that SHM of TcRα is involved in primary T cell repertoire diversification and the enhancement of positive selection in the thymic cortex.”</p><p>“Somatic hypermutation in TcR γV and TcR δV”.</p><p>“Remarkably we also detected SHM occurring in the α chain of αβ T cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) &quot;Since it is highly improbable that two thymocytes would generate identical CDR3 sequences during VJ recombination…&quot; As was pointed out in the original review, this claim is not obvious; it should not be stated in this fashion. Indeed, there are a priori reasons to think that the same CDR3 sequence could readily arise from independent V-J rearrangements. The authors should present this claim as a hypothesis that they then carefully validate with data (which they begin to do in the first paragraph of the subsection “Somatic hypermutation in nurse shark TcR αV”). Furthermore, the conclusion of this sentence that &quot;amplicons containing identical CDR3 sequences must have derived from the same progenitor&quot; is overstated. At best, the conclusion could be that they are &quot;likely to have derived from the same progenitor&quot;. A statistical analysis of the V-J sequences might allow the authors to make a quantitative claim of just how likely this is, but in the absence of such an analysis, the claims should be stated cautiously. The manuscript needs to be rewritten to accommodate these points. Same issue in the aforementioned paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified this section to be less speculative. “Since it is highly unlikely that two thymocytes would generate identical CDR3 sequences during VJ recombination, we predict that amplicons containing identical CDR3 sequences derived from the same progenitor and thus must contain the same germline V and J segments. […] Therefore, even in the absence of an assembled locus, we were able to evaluate mutation to germline αV segments by considering changes within only those thymocyte clones containing identical CDR3s.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Closely related to this: The authors have clarified that a larger number of sequences were obtained than was apparent in the initial submission, but this information is not provided in the Results section. Since most readers will not look at the Materials and methods section, it is suggested that the authors add information to the second paragraph of the subsection “Somatic hypermutation in nurse shark TcR αV” to inform readers of the total number of underlying sequences from the two relevant sharks. In addition, the Materials and methods states that sequences were obtained from four sharks; it is confusing that data from only two of the sharks was actually used. Why are all 4 sharks mentioned if data from only two of them were used? How many total sequences were obtained from the two relevant sharks? This is highly relevant given that these are (apparently) the only data from which the analyzed TcRα sequences are derived. This is directly relevant to the concern, expressed in the original review, that the identification of so many repeated CDR3 regions from a small sequence dataset is extremely unlikely. This issue has not been satisfactorily resolved in the resubmission. The requested table that shows how many unique aa sequences were obtained for each V family, and of those, the number that have an identical CDR3, was not provided. Nor have the authors provided a detailed description of the proportion of TcRα sequences that have N/P nucleotides (which would provide higher confidence of assigning SHM) versus those that are directly joined (less confidence). The reviewers remain concerned by the possibility that the number of repeat CDR3 sequences is exceedingly unlikely given the number of sequences obtained. The authors should carefully address this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not including the requested table. We misunderstood the initial request. We include this table now (Table 1) and discuss the table in the Results section titled “Somatic hypermutation in nurse shark TcR αV”:</p><p>“Our preliminary V α dataset contained 539 TcRα clones (encoding 286 unique amino acid sequences representing nine V α families) from three tissues (PBL, spleen, thymus) of two sharks (Joanie, Mary Junior). […] We include these 45 sequences in our TcR Vα dataset (see Table 1 – source data for sequence data).”</p><p>During the construction of this new table, we realized we had omitted sequences in our initial mutation analysis. Further, we decided to divide our aV4 group so that we estimated mutation even more conservatively. Thus, we reanalyzed our entire mutation data set. While the overall conclusions of this study did not change, some of the results did change. Most notably, we found that A:T mutations did not prefer WA/TW hotspots. This is consistent with data reported in sandbar sharks for TcR γ (Chen et al., 2012). However, our data suggest a different A:T motif may be targeted or that sharks employ a different mechanism than DNA pol eta use during mismatch repair to alter A:T nucleotides.</p><p>“A:T nucleotides did not appear to prefer W<underline>A</underline>/<underline>T</underline>W hotspots (p=0.2248), though they were 2.3x as likely to mutate within hotspots than outside hotspots. […] This result suggests that an alternate A:T motif is targeted or that sharks employ another mechanism altogether to alter A:T nucleotides.”</p><p>Further, we no longer found a significant difference in tandemly mutated bases between CDRs and FRs, which is consistent with results observed for TcR-γ in sandbar sharks. “Finally, though we found more tandemly mutated bases in CDRs (41 of 81, or 50.6% of all CDR mutations) than in FRs (73 of 192, or 38.0% of all FR mutations), this difference was not significant; p=0.721; Table 2).”</p><p>We also added a section at the beginning of the Materials and methods to clarify the confusion over sharks. We used sequences from only two sharks in our mutation analyses. However, we used published data from two different sharks to aid in loci identification to ensure consistency. This paragraph reads as follows: “Study Animals: TCR sequence data used in this study came from two adult female nurse sharks (“Joanie” and “Mary Junior”; <italic><underline>Ginglymostoma cirratum</underline></italic>) delivered by caesarian section off the Florida Keys and matured in the aquatic vivarium of the University of Maryland’s Center of Marine Biotechnology. We used published T cell αV sequences (Criscitiello et al., 2010) as a baseline for αV locus numbering (sharks Yellow and 1299), though we did not analyze any of these sequences for mutation.”</p><p>As for the presence of N/P nucleotides, please see our response to #2, above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The new RNA fluorescence FISH analysis is a significant improvement over the ISH analysis, but despite the claimed specificity of the method used, experiments to document specificity are needed. Ideally, a tissue not expressing AID would be analyzed (or do the authors feel that the negative portions of the thymus provide sufficient specificity controls?). Given that the authors now present a detailed model for AID expression/SHM in shark thymus (Figure 10) based on the RNA fluorescence FISH data, it is particularly important to address specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed a non-immune tissue (shark brain) as a negative FISH control for AID and TcRα fluorescence. We created a new supplementary figure with images of these slides (Figure 9—figure supplement 2). This figure depicts some background fluorescence regardless of probe application. However, we observed no AID or TcRα expression in brain tissue like the patterns we saw in thymus (immune tissue).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The claim made in the last paragraph of the subsection “Mutations, in situ hybridization, and AID expression in thymus “that TcRα expression is more diffuse than that of AID is unconvincing. TcRαA and AID expression appear to coincide in all areas visible in Figure 9. The authors should not push their interpretation just because it fits with the proposed role of AID in selection. Similarly, the organization of AID in rings around TcRα+ regions is intriguing and while the authors' interpretation in terms of relative timing of expression is plausible, it is quite speculative and should be clearly stated as such.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the text to better reflect what our images depict (see also #7, below). “Our FISH results indicated a more specific TcR αC signal within the inner cortex and medulla adjacent to the CMJ (Figure 9; Figure 9—figure supplement 1), regions where, in mammals, cells actively rearrange their α chain and where mature αβ T cells are found. […] Thus, we observed a consistent pattern of expression where a “ring” of cells expressing both TcR αC and AID surround a central cell expressing only TcR αC.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The in situ hybridization in Figure 8B (panels 3,4) for AID is still hard to interpret as the signal is weak and diffuse. The apparent expression pattern suggested by these images does not seem to correspond to the localized patterns seen in the fluorescent in situs in Figure 9 and Figure 9—figure supplement 1. Why is this? Is this a matter of scale? It is a concern that one set of data seems to contradict the other.</p></disp-quote><p>We auto-adjusted the colors on the CISH image in ImageJ to darken the signal expression [old image (L) and darkened image (R), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>]. We adjusted images in all eight panels uniformly, ensuring we did not alter expression differences between panels. This should make it easier to see the signal itself, with AID expression localized to the cortex and CMJ and minimal expression within the medulla.</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28477.030</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28477-resp-fig3-v3"/></fig><p>As you point out, it is a much more diffuse signal. Because the Stellaris FISH method uses a mixture of short probes for binding the transcript, the pattern we see in the is much more specific – the image will only show those areas with many bound probes rather than the presence of a transcript in general. For example, the CISH image of TcR αC from Criscitiello et al.,2010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>) shows a much more diffuse pattern of expression than what we see with FISH as well.</p><fig id="respfig4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28477.031</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28477-resp-fig4-v3"/></fig><p>We believe the expression patterns revealed with the two different methods are both correct, but they tell us different things. AID (and TcR αC) expression occurs throughout the cortex (and medulla for TcR αC; based on the diffuse signal from CISH), but the greatest expression of both messages occurs near the CMJ (based on the much more precise and higher intensity signal from FISH). We currently are working with another method that incorporates both a colorimetric and fluorescent signal to verify this explanation, but we have not been successful with that approach yet.</p><p>We modified the text to explain this difference in method.</p><p>CISH section: “Further, colorimetric in situ hybridization (CISH) of nurse shark thymus revealed a diffuse signal of TcR β (Figure 8B, panels 1,2) and AID (Figure 8B, panels 3,4) mRNA expression throughout the thymic cortex. However, AID expression was greatest in the central cortex and cortico-medullary junction (CMJ), while TcR β expression was highest in the outer cortex.”</p><p>FISH section: “We refined our CISH results with RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes against the TcR α constant region (αC) and exons 2 and 3 of AID. […] These daughter T cells then express AID (and TcR αC), promoting somatic hypermutation within their TcR α sequences during a time when cells also undergo positive and negative selection.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
