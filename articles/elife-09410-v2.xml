We are pursuing the hypothesis that they arose by fusion and accretion from an ancestral set of peptides active as co-factors in RNA-dependent replication and catalysis. Should this be true, contemporary domains may still contain vestiges of such peptides, which could be reconstructed by a comparative approach in the same way in which ancient vocabularies have been reconstructed by the comparative study of modern languages. To test this, we compared domains representative of known folds and identified 40 fragments whose similarity is indicative of common descent, yet which occur in domains currently not thought to be homologous. These fragments are widespread in the most ancient folds and enriched for iron-sulfur- and nucleic acid-binding.

Many of these domains can be traced back to the time of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kyrpides et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Koonin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ranea et al., 2006</xref>), a hypothetical primordial organism from which all life on earth is thought to have descended approximately 3.5 billion years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Glansdorff et al., 2008</xref>). The origin of domains themselves, however, is poorly understood. An origin de novo, by random concatenation of amino acids, appears impossible due to the high sequence complexity and low folding yield of polypeptides, as well as to the absence of abiotic processes that could produce peptide chains of more than 5–10 residues. The abiotic scenario would also leave open the fundamental question as to how the information contained in successful polypeptides could have been passed on.</p><p>Many lines of evidence, including the identification of local sequence and structure similarity within domains of different fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brennan and Matthews, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doherty et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Copley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grishin, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Friedberg and Godzik, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Andreeva et al., 2007</xref>), or the frequent construction of domains by repetition of subdomain-sized fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McLachlan, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andrade et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hocker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaudhuri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Remmert et al., 2010</xref>), show that domains might not constitute the only evolutionary unit of protein structure. These observations led to the proposal that the first folded domains arose by repetition, fusion, recombination, and accretion from an ancestral set of peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fetrow and Godzik, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lupas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Soding and Lupas, 2003</xref>) that emerged in the RNA world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gilbert, 1986</xref>), in which RNA served both as carrier of genetic information and catalyst of metabolic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jeffares et al., 1998</xref>). According to this model, the local similarities found in modern proteins represent the observable remnants of such peptides. In the RNA world, which is widely thought to have been an important intermediate stage in the origin of cellular life, simple peptides may have been recruited by RNA to expand its functional repertoire. The catalytic range of RNA molecules is restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Joyce, 2002</xref>) and peptides are good chelators of metals and small molecules. Peptides are also beneficial for RNA thermostability and folding specificity, and for the formation of oligomeric complexes. For these reasons, peptides of initially abiotic origin may have been co-opted as cofactors. In time, selective pressures on availability, interaction specificity, and functional effectiveness would have driven the emergence of longer, RNA-encoded and -produced peptides, optimized for the formation of secondary structure by exclusion of water with the RNA scaffold. It is known that many peptides formed of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids have an intrinsic affinity for RNA and form secondary structures upon binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Patel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Das and Frankel, 2003</xref>). By repetition, fusion, recombination, and accretion, these preoptimized peptides would have reached a level of complexity enabling them to exclude water by hydrophobic contacts, making them independent of the RNA scaffold. In this theory, protein folding would have been an emergent property of peptide-RNA coevolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A comparative approach to domain evolution</title><p>Given the striking conservation of many proteins in sequence and structure across evolutionary time, we conjectured that if this hypothesis is true, we might be able to see remnants of these primordial peptides in modern proteins. To this end, we decided to take a comparative approach based on the systematic analysis of present-day domains, similar to the approach taken by linguists to reconstruct ancient vocabularies by comparing modern languages. The comparative studies of languages and of proteins, in fact, exhibit many parallels because of their shared linear nature of information storage, the high conservation of evolutionary modules, and the similarity of evolutionary constraints acting upon them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gray and Atkinson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pagel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Searls, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">List et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Today, for instance, it is known that hundreds of words in European languages contain the conserved Semitic root qnw (*qanaw-) meaning ‘reed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huehnergard, 2011</xref>), despite it having diversified into a wide range of functional forms by the same processes as already familiar from biological evolution (e.g., orthology, paralogy, horizontal transfer).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09410.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The evolution of words and proteins shows many parallels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Semitic root <italic>qnw (*qanaw-)</italic>, meaning reed, is the ancestor of hundreds of words in many different languages, following the same mechanisms as already known from biological evolution. Here we track the descendants of this root in the English language, arisen through the intermediary of Latin and Greek. In addition to the orthologous Greek word <italic>kanna</italic> (reed), paralogous cognates arose in antiquity based on certain attributes of reed, e.g., the levelling rule <italic>kanon</italic> (taking the straight and rigid attribute of reed), the wicker basket <italic>kanastron</italic> (flexible), and the Latin water duct <italic>canalis</italic> (round and hollow). A few examples of analogous words, which appear to be related to the descendants of <italic>qnw</italic> but have different evolutionary origins, are shown in green. (<bold>B</bold>) The primordial β-hammerhead motif (shown in red) is seen in four different folds, which cover a wide array of functions. Following our hypothesis of an origin in the RNA world, we propose that RNA binding is the orthologous function of this peptide, seen today in ribosomal protein L27 and exosome subunit RRP4. Paralogous functions arose around the time of the Last Universal Common Ancestor from its ability to form a biotin-binding domain by duplication, yielding the biotin-dependant enzymes of the barrel-sandwich hybrid fold, and to serve as a structural element in domains formed by accretion, yielding a domain of RNA-polymerase β’ subunit, as well as a range of enzymes with an α/β-hammerhead fold. By our analysis, enzymes classified in the α/β-hammerhead fold superfamily d.41.5, such as MoaE, are analogous to the other superfamilies in this fold, due to a lack of detectable sequence similarity, but nevertheless contain a supersecondary structure resembling the β-hammerhead.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09410.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09410.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09410-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>To reconstruct the ‘vocabulary’ of ancient peptides, we aimed at finding local similarities in sequence and structure within globally different folds, which are presently thought to have arisen independently, by convergent evolution. Since the events that led to the emergence of domains took place before the time of LUCA, modern domains might only retain weak signals thereof in their sequences. As protein structures diverge much more slowly than their sequences, structural similarity is often used for identifying such distant events. However, similar structures may have arisen convergently, owing to the limited number of conformations available to a folded polypeptide chain, particularly at the supersecondary structure level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Salem et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fernandez-Fuentes et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, structure similarity alone does not provide conclusive evidence of common ancestry. In contrast, the combinatorial sequence space is enormous and many sequences are compatible with a particular local structure, so that sequence convergence is rare. Thus sequence similarity is a more reliable marker for common ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soding, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). We have therefore employed sequence similarity, as evaluated by the comparison of profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soding et al., 2005</xref>), as a first criterion for inferring common ancestry of domains in this study. Due to the large evolutionary divergence of sequences, we used structural similarity as a second criterion to confirm the potential homology relationships.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reconstructing a vocabulary of primordial peptides</title><p>To implement this comparative approach between domains of different fold, we needed a reference database for the assignment of domains to fold types. For this we used the SCOPe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Murzin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fox et al., 2014</xref>) database (release 2.03), which is a point of reference in the classification of protein folds. In this database, the first two classification levels (family and superfamily) capture homologous relationships, while the grouping of structurally similar superfamilies into the same fold reflects convergent evolution, i.e. analogy. In order to reduce the very large background of obvious homologous matches, we filtered SCOPe to a maximum of 30% sequence identity (SCOPe30). At this level, many relationships considered homologous by SCOPe are removed, whereas representatives for all families and superfamilies are still retained. As detailed in the ‘Materials and methods’, we then compared the resulting domain set in sequence space using HHsearch with stringent settings, and subsequently in structure space using TM-align (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang and Skolnick, 2005</xref>). We plotted the obtained scores separately for comparisons within families (presumed homologous relationships; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and between folds (presumed analogous relationships; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The expected score distributions would have been at the top, right (high HHsearch probabilities, high TM-scores) for homologous relationships and bottom, left (low HHsearch probabilities, low TM-scores) for analogous ones. In fact, the distributions we obtained were bimodal, with a higher incidence of scores at both the top, right and bottom, left of the plots. The presence of some low-scoring relationships in the homologous set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) did not appear too surprising, given the considerable evolutionary distance of some relationships captured in SCOPe, but the presence of some high-scoring relationships in the analogous set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) did, as it suggested the presence of hitherto unrecognized homologous relationships. We decided to explore these further, using cut-offs at HHsearch probabilities of 70% (corresponding to P-values &lt; 5e-05) and TM-scores of 0.5. At these threshold values, about a fourth of presumed homologous relationships in SCOPe30 and &gt;99.95% of matches between folds, which are presumed to be analogous, are omitted. This provided a substantial margin of safety in evaluating the high-scoring relationships between domains presumed to be analogous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09410.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Estimation of cut-offs for HHsearch probability and TM-score.</title><p>We compared all domains in the SCOPe30 set in sequence space using HHsearch and subsequently in structure space using TM-align (see ‘Materials and methods’), and plotted the obtained scores. Separate plots for comparisons of domains within families (<bold>A</bold>) and between folds (<bold>B</bold>) were generated. Scores would have been expected at high HHsearch probabilities and TM-scores for intrafamily comparisons (presumed homologs, Panel A) and low HHsearch probabilities and TM-scores for interfold comparisons (presumed analogs, Panel B), but the score distributions were in fact bimodal, as also illustrated by the histograms top and right in each panel, which are plotted as probability density functions. In the comparison of domains of different fold, matches with an HHsearch probability of &lt; 10% are not plotted.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09410.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09410.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09410-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Since the comparisons made in the analogous set were between domains of different fold, the high-scoring matches always involved subdomain-sized fragments. Those fragments that satisfied the cut-offs and a number of additional criteria, as detailed in the ‘Materials and methods’, were clustered together automatically if they overlapped by at least 80% of their length. Following upon this step, clusters were inspected individually and merged further where appropriate, as described in the ‘Materials and methods’. We obtained 65 clusters, of which 20 relied on a global similarity of the folds and were omitted from further consideration. Such cases of globally similar folds that are nevertheless classified as different are mainly due to homologous fold change events, such as strand invasion, hairpin swapping, or circular permutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grishin, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andreeva and Murzin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alva et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, for instance, SCOPe superfamilies d.12.1 and d.58.7 are clearly related globally by circular permutation, despite being classified into different folds. A further 5 groups were due to artifacts in domain boundaries assigned by SCOPe and were also omitted. For example, the d.79.4.1 family makes connections to the a.5.10.1 family, as its sequence in SCOPe encompasses the latter.</p><p>This yielded a final set of 40 clusters, within which all fragments were inspected individually, superimposed, and trimmed to a consensus length where appropriate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). As examples, we show the different embodiments of the β-hammerhead motif, found in 4 folds comprising 8 superfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: fragment 12), and the nucleic acid-binding helix-hairpin-helix motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doherty et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shao and Grishin, 2000</xref>), found in 8 folds comprising 15 superfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: fragment 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The median length of the 40 consensus fragments is 24 residues, with the shortest fragment comprising 9 and the longest 38 residues. This is in accord with the expectation that ancient peptides were simple and subdomain-sized. Of these fragments, only about half correspond to typical supersecondary structure elements, such as α-hairpins, β-hairpins, β-meanders, and βαβ-elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Salem et al., 1999</xref>), whereas the others are unusual fragments with odd shapes, which frequently do not form compact structures. This supports the notion that they predate the emergence of hydrophobic contacts as a driving force for protein folding and that their open structures reflect the association with an RNA scaffold, as still seen in ribosomal proteins today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Soding and Lupas, 2003</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09410.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Vocabulary of primordial peptides that gave rise to folded proteins.</title><p>The 40 peptides we detected are shown as ensembles in backbone representation; α-helices are coloured in yellow, β-strands in green, and loops in gray.

Indeed, of these 36 fragments, 34 had more than half of their structure matches to fragments with undetectable sequence similarity. This shows that essentially every one of the structures we detected can be formed by fundamentally different sequences. To verify this anecdotal observation in a systematic way, we analyzed the relationship between sequence and structure similarity in our fragments by comparison with a reference set of 40 of the most frequent supersecondary structure elements from the Smotifs library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fernandez-Fuentes et al., 2010</xref>) (assembled as described in the ‘Materials and methods’). We reasoned that a correlation should be detectable in homologs, as these would have started ancestrally with identical sequences and structures, before gradually diverging towards a baseline of similarity. There should be no correlation however in analogs, unless structural constraints had limited the number of residues allowed at specific positions, causing a convergence of the sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Remmert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kopec and Lupas, 2013</xref>). We therefore computed sequence similarity scores using structure-based sequence alignments for each fragment in the two sets against all domains in SCOPe30. For fragments in our set, we considered matches to other superfamilies in which we had detected the respective fragment (listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) as homologous and to all other folds as analogous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For the Smotifs fragments, we considered matches to the same superfamily as homologous and to all other folds as analogous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). For both fragment sets, the presumed homologous matches show a strong correlation between sequence and structure similarity. The correlation for the Smotifs reference set is expected, as the homologs there follow the generally accepted criteria laid out in the SCOPe classification. Observing a nearly equivalent correlation for our fragment set therefore underscores our inference of homology. Note that, although the correlation is slightly weaker in our fragments than in the Smotifs, this is likely due to the fact that comparisons in our set are made between superfamilies, whereas in the Smotifs they are made within superfamilies, i.e. across smaller evolutionary distances. In contrast, the correlation between sequence and structure similarity in the presumed analogous matches is very weak for both our fragments and the Smotifs. This shows that structurally induced sequence convergence is very low and the fragments can be formed by a broad range of different sequences. Biophysical constraints can therefore not explain the sequence similarity exhibited by our fragments.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09410.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sequence similarity of our fragments cannot be explained by structural constraints.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) For each occurrence of any of our 40 fragments, we searched for structural matches in SCOPe30 and plotted the TM-align score versus the profile-similarity score for the fixed alignment given by TM-align.

Due to the conservative nature of our sequence comparisons and the range of additional criteria we applied in order to eliminate potentially spurious matches, we expect that we did not extend these boundaries substantially beyond what is already established in the field. Given the depth of analysis in many structural studies, we therefore surmised that at least some of our fragments should have been noted previously. In fact, 40% (16) have been described individually before and connected to deep evolutionary events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, indicated by a dot; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), showing that we are moving within the boundaries of established sequence-structure analyses. To our knowledge, our fragments comprise all but one previously reported case. We failed to detect the ASP-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>: B1), found in six different folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Copley et al., 2001</xref>), owing to the stringency of our search criteria (if the HHsearch probability cut-off is lowered to 60%, this fragment is included, along with four others). Examples of previously described fragments include the dinucleotide-binding β-α-β motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buehner et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rossmann et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wierenga et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dym and Eisenberg, 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 8), the KH motif of type I and type II KH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grishin, 2001b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 6), the helix-hairpin-helix motif of nucleic acid-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doherty et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shao and Grishin, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the EF-Tu-binding α-hairpin of elongation factor EF-Ts and ribosomal protein L7/12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wieden et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 24), and the P-loop of PEP carboxykinases and P-loop NTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walker et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matte et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 16). For many of these fragments, our systematic approach, the growth of structure databases, and improved sequence comparison methods allowed us to identify new instances of occurrence. For example, another occurrence of the P-loop is in the catalytic domain of MurD-like peptide ligases (SCOP c.72.2), where it is involved in binding the phosphate group of a mononucleotide as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Primordial peptides in an RNA world</title><p>If our starting assumption of ancestral peptides in the context of an RNA world is correct, some of the most basic functions would be nucleic-acid binding and catalysis. We would therefore expect these properties to be enriched in our set. Indeed, we find that about a third of our fragments make contact with nucleic acids (13), based on evidence from known structures (fragments with a yellow background in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). For comparison, the Smotifs reference set yielded only 2 nucleic-acid binders, even though it covers about three times as many superfamilies and folds as our fragment set (see ‘Materials and methods’). Our nucleic acid-binding fragments include four of the six most highly represented fragments in our dataset, particularly the helix-turn-helix motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sauer et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pabo and Sauer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brennan and Matthews, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Suzuki and Brenner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Aravind et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 1- found in 14 folds and 20 superfamilies, abbreviated in the following as 14, 20) and the helix-hairpin-helix motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 2- 8, 15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A special case of nucleic-acid interaction is provided by ribosomal proteins, which contain 8 of our 13 nucleic acid-binding fragments (indicated by red font color in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Ribosomal proteins are likely to represent the oldest proteins observable today and, for the most part, still require the RNA scaffold to become structured, providing a window into the time when protein domains were being established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hsiao et al., 2009</xref>). For comparison, of the nine folds proposed to be the most ancient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caetano-Anolles et al., 2007</xref>), based on the comparative analysis of proteomes from diverse branches of life, six encompass at least one of our 40 fragments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The second basic function peptides would plausibly have had in the RNA world would have been catalytic, as coordinators of metals, iron-sulfur clusters, nucleotides, and nucleotide-derived cofactors (coenzyme A, NAD(P), FAD), all of which are thought to already have played an essential role in prebiotic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">White, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wachtershauser, 1992</xref>). Here, however, an enrichment relative to the Smotifs reference set is less clearly apparent, being primarily seen for iron-sulfur clusters which are absent in the reference set. Seven of our fragments coordinate metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters (red background in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), e.g., the cytochrome-heme-attachment motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mathews et al., 1985</xref>) and the 4Fe-4S coordinating peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lupas et al., 2001</xref>), and five bind nucleotides and nucleotide-derived cofactors (blue background in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Particularly two of these fragments, the P-loop motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 16) and the dinucleotide-binding β-α-β motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 8), are at the core of some of the largest enzyme superfamilies in nature and play a central role throughout metabolic processes. We note that in all these fragments, the contribution of the peptides is the coordination of catalytic cofactors and not the provision of catalytic residues <italic>per se,</italic> in accordance with a primordial role as cofactors of RNA-driven catalysis. Thus, for example, the role of the P-loop in nucleotidases is to coordinate the nucleotide, the mechanism for its hydrolysis having evolved independently in different lineages of this superfamily.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Repetition as a dominant force in the origin of folds</title><p>When we initiated this study, we believed that assembly from non-identical fragments may have been one of the primary forces in the evolution of domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lupas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Soding and Lupas, 2003</xref>), and we expected to find many examples demonstrating it. However, we did not find even one domain that contained two or more different fragments from our set. Our fragments either form their folds by repetition or in single copy, decorated by heterologous structural elements. At present, we find the reasons for the lack of fragment combinations unclear, but we note that many of our fragments might represent dominant cores that guide the folding of the remainder of the polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Religa et al., 2007</xref>) and would, as such, not be generally compatible with each other. In the few cases where they would be sufficiently compatible to produce an initial fold capable of entering biological selection, they would be under considerable pressure to adapt to the new structural environment. This, in most cases, might lead to the retention of only one dominant fragment, the other(s) adjusting by rapid divergence, making them undetectable by our methods. For an initial exploration of this possibility, we asked whether any fold in SCOPe30 could be found to contain two or more of our fragments if we relaxed the sequence similarity requirement for all but one of them. We analyzed in detail the largest family from each superfamily containing one of our fragments (188 in all) for such combinations of 'significant' and 'non-significant' fragments. As long as we retained any sequence similarity cutoff for the 'non-significant' fragments, even as low as HHsearch probabilities of 10%, no combinations could be found. If we however removed the sequence similarity requirement entirely for the 'non-significant' fragments, asking only for structural similarity (TM-score ≥ 0.5), over 50% of the families showed fragment combinations. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we have collected examples, in which the fold is substantially formed by the combination of a 'significant' with a 'non-significant' fragment, showing that the incompatibility we observe for our fragments is not of a geometrical nature.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09410.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Folds showing two nonidentical fragments, one of which is which is not significant by our criteria.</title><p>No SCOP fold combines two of our fragments at the cutoffs used in this study (TM-score ≥ 0.5 and HHsearch probability ≥ 70%).

Nine of these are also capable of forming folds in single copy, with additional decoration. For example, the TPR element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 28) is found in multiple copies in domains belonging to the TPR-like superfamily (a.118.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">D'Andrea and Regan, 2003</xref>), but only in single copy in other folds that contain it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Also, the β-hammerhead motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 12), which resembles a hammerhead, is duplicated in the barrel-sandwich hybrid fold (b.84), but occurs in single copy in the α/β-hammerhead fold (d.41) and in two other folds (e.29 and f.46). Two further fragments also occur in variable numbers per fold, but never in single copy. These are the outer membrane β-hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Remmert et al., 2010</xref>), which forms β-barrels of between four and twelve hairpins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), and the four-stranded β-meander (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaudhuri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kopec and Lupas, 2013</xref>), which forms propeller-like toroids containing between four and twelve copies.

The importance of repetition has been pointed out by many earlier studies. Starting in the 1970's Andrew McLachlan charted out in more than 20 publications the origin of many proteins by repetition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McLachlan, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">1987</xref>), in some cases clearly of subdomain-sized fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blundell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McLachlan, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">1980</xref>). Aided by computational tools to detect repeats in sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heger and Holm, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Szklarczyk and Heringa, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Biegert and Soding, 2008</xref>) and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Myers-Turnbull et al., 2014</xref>), analyses of fold space have shown the high incidence of repetitive folds, amounting to as many as one fifth of all folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andrade et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Balaji, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Forrest, 2015</xref>). These include some of the most frequent folds, such as ferredoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eck and Dayhoff, 1966</xref>), immunoglobulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang and Xiao, 2007</xref>), β-propellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murzin, 1992</xref>) and TIM-barrels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Soding et al., 2006</xref>); indeed, of the 10 most populated folds in SCOPe, 6 (including the top 5), have repetitive structures and all of them have members in which the repetition is also detectable at the sequence level. In most cases, the repetitive structure of these folds has been interpreted as evidence for their origin by amplification of a subdomain-sized fragment and in some cases, such as for β-propellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yadid et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Voet et al., 2014</xref>), β-trefoils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee and Blaber, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Broom et al., 2012</xref>), and TIM-barrels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bharat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Richter et al., 2010</xref>), this process has also been explored by protein engineering. Only a subset of these fragments that form folds by repetition are present in our set, since we require them to occur in at least two folds to consider them antecedent to folded proteins, but many are currently only detectable in one fold.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Primordial peptides in proteins today</title><p>Our fragments are spread across a total of 130 folds and 188 superfamilies in SCOPe. Given that the current version of SCOPe comprises 1194 folds and 1961 superfamilies, they could be considered to cover only a small of fraction. However, of the 25 most populated folds in SCOPe, which comprise about 25% of all superfamilies, 14 contain one of the fragments and 7 of the top 10 do. We conclude that, far from being anecdotal, our fragments are indeed widespread in today’s domains.</p><p>The 40 fragments we describe clearly represent a lower bound, given the stringent significance cut-offs in our study, the as yet incomplete fold assignment for known structures, and the fact that some ancestral fragments may have survived only in a single fold and are thus invisible to our method. Indeed, our goal in this study was not completeness, given the extensive overlap in statistical scores that can be expected between the least likely false negatives and the most likely true positives. Rather, it was to assemble a comprehensive set of confident positives in order to show that a signal of homology that predates folding as a widespread property is still detectable in proteins today.</p><p>How many fragments may we be missing? With respect to the significance cut-offs we find, for example, that relaxing the sequence similarity requirement to a probability of 60% leads to the inclusion of 5 further fragments, some with substantial arguments in their favor, such as the aforementioned ASP-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Copley et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>: B1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Also, the availability of more sequences and structures, particularly for proteins from poorly sampled branches of life, should allow to bridge more widely separated folds by increasing the significance of their matches. For the fragments that occur in a single fold, we note that because of the importance of repetition, it might be possible to reconstruct further fragments by specifically analyzing repetitive folds. Certainly some of the chemical activities provided by these folds appear sufficiently ancient to justify the expectation that they were covered early in the genesis of folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Farias-Rico et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lupas et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For these reasons we think that the number of ancestral fragments that could be reconstructed at a satisfactory level of confidence may well approach 100 in the next decades. Nevertheless, the set of 40 fragments we have described here should cover both the most frequent and best conserved ancestral peptides, and support a viable theory for the emergence of folded proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Detection of sequence- and structure-similar fragments</title><p>To assemble domains representative of all known fold types, we chose the SCOPe database (release 2.03) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fox et al., 2014</xref>) and filtered it to a maximum of 30% sequence identity, obtaining 9452 domains. Multiple alignments were built for each of these domains using the buildali.pl script (with default parameters) from the HHsearch package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soding, 2005</xref>). This script uses PSI-BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) and contains heuristics to reduce the inclusion of nonhomologous sequence segments at the ends of PSI-BLAST sequence matches, the leading cause of high-scoring false positive matches. We used PSI-BLAST, rather than the more sensitive HHblits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Remmert et al., 2012</xref>), because in our experience the sensitivity of HHblits leads it to occasionally assign elevated probabilities to analogous matches. Profile HMMs were calculated from the alignments using hhmake, also from the HHsearch package, and subjected to pairwise comparisons with HHsearch. Comparisons were thus always made with the full domains, never with fragments thereof. We used default settings, but switched off secondary structure scoring (option ssm 0) in order to reduce the likelihood that matches were scored highly because of a chance similarity of their (predicted) secondary structures. The HHsearch probabilities we obtained are therefore conservative with respect to the ones obtained for example from the HHpred server in default settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soding et al., 2005</xref>), which is the most frequent source of HHsearch-based deep homology analyses in publications today. We only considered reciprocal matches (of the form domain A matches domain B <italic>and</italic> domain B matches domain A), and assigned these the average of the two obtained HHsearch probabilities. The structures of the aligned segments of SCOPe30 domains were subsequently compared using TM-align (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang and Skolnick, 2005</xref>). We filtered out all matches in which the aligned segment involved only a single secondary structure element.</p><p>To establish cut-offs for the comparison of domains of different fold, we plotted comparisons of domains within families (presumed homologs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The plot shows a bimodal distribution, with the highest representations at the top and bottom. At HHsearch probabilities of ≥ 70% and TM-scores of ≥ 0.5, about a fourth of all homologous relationships in SCOPe30 are filtered out. We used these cut-offs for the comparison of domains of different fold, as it gives us a substantial margin of safety in the interpretation of relationships presumed analogous by SCOPe.</p><p>We gathered all matches between domains of different fold with an HHsearch probability of ≥ 70% and a TM-score of ≥ 0.5. Next, we eliminated all matches between larger superfamilies that nevertheless only made a single connection. This was done in order to minimize the number of potential false positives. We then applied single-linkage clustering to this resulting set of matches. Fragments from matches between folds were pooled together if they overlapped by at least 80% of their length, i.e. domains A, B, and C were combined together if domain A matched domain B <italic>and</italic> domain B matched domain C such that the boundaries in B overlapped by at least 80%. The resulting clusters were analyzed interactively and merged together if their similarity was based on the presence of a shared sequence- and structure-similar fragment. This yielded a final set of 64 potentially interesting clusters. We generated sequence and structure alignments for the fragments that formed the basis of these clusters and assigned boundaries by manual inspection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Smotifs reference set</title><p>To obtain a reference set of fragments for our study, we assembled the 40 most frequent supersecondary structure motifs seen in proteins, according to the Smotifs database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fernandez-Fuentes et al., 2010</xref>). This is an exhaustive library of geometrically defined local supersecondary structure motifs, composed of two consecutive secondary structures connected by a loop. In this library, motifs of varying lengths, but with similar geometry and secondary structures, are grouped together into clusters, 2296 in total. The Smotifs library is available as a MySQL database; however, the frequency of occurrence of the motif clusters cannot be directly calculated from this database. We were therefore kindly provided with the frequency table by Andras Fiser (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York). Using this table, we randomly selected one representative each for the 50 most frequent motif clusters; we required the representative to comprise 24 residues, the median length of our fragments, with at least 6 residues in each secondary structure element and a connecting loop of at most 6 residues. Next, we inspected these representatives and picked the 40 most frequent fragments after eliminating non-compact ones. Finally, for each of these 40 fragments, we picked a prototype in the SCOPe30 database by performing structure searches using TM-align and by selecting the match with the best TM-score. These 40 fragments formed our reference set.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Correlation of structure and sequence similarity</title><p>To evaluate whether the sequence similarity shown by our fragments could be the result of structural convergence, rather than origin from a common ancestor, we searched the SCOPe30 database with each fragment from our set and the Smotifs reference set using TM-align at a cut-off of 0.5. Since our 40 fragments are structurally very similar in all their respective embodiments, we randomly picked one representative of each type. To calculate a sequence-versus-structure plot for our set and the Smotifs set, we followed the methodology described by us in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Remmert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kopec and Lupas, 2013</xref>). We used TM-align to compare the Smotifs set with domains from within the respective superfamily (presumed homologous set) and with the background set that comprised all other folds (presumed analogous set) to search for structurally similar fragments. For our fragments, we compared each representative fragment with domains of all other superfamilies in which we had detected it (homologous) and with all other folds (analogous). In both cases, the TM-score was normalized based on the length of the query motifs. For each structure match, we calculated the profile-profile sequence similarity score with HHalign from the HHsearch package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soding, 2005</xref>), however based on the fixed structural alignment obtained from TM-align. The HHalign score was normalized based on the number of aligned residues. Next, each pair of structure and sequence scores was plotted in a scatter plot. To calculate the correlation between TM- and HHalign-scores, we assumed a linear dependency between them and performed linear regression using SciPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jones et al., 2001</xref>). We performed a t-test to determine whether the slope of the regression line differs significantly from zero; we chose a significance level of 1e-10.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Identification of interactions with nucleic acids, metals, iron-sulfur clusters, nucleotides and nucleotide-derived cofactors</title><p>First, we searched the SCOPe30 database for occurrences of each of the 40 reference Smotifs using TM-align at a TM-score cut-off of 0.5 and length coverage of 100%. This yielded occurrences in 323 folds and 447 superfamilies. For comparison, our 40 fragments occur in 130 folds and 188 superfamilies. Following this step, for all occurrences of our fragments and the Smotifs fragments in SCOPe30, we searched for potential interactions with nucleic acids, metals, iron-sulfur clusters, nucleotides, and nucleotide-derived cofactors. A fragment was deemed to interact with these molecules if it made at least three inter-atomic contacts to them within a distance cut-off of 3Å. In addition, we included one of our fragments, the β-α-β motif seen in cradle-loop barrels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alva et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: 7) into the nucleic acid binding set, even though only a high-resolution model of its interaction with DNA is currently available, based on NMR data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zorzini et al., 2015</xref>). Even discounting this addition, the 12 other nucleic acid-binding fragments of our set substantially exceed the two nucleic acid binders found in the Smotifs set, even though these cover about three times as many superfamilies and folds.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work would not have been possible without Rob Russell (University of Heidelberg) and Chris Ponting (University of Oxford), with whom we framed the original hypothesis for the origin of folded proteins from subdomain-sized peptides.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers.</p><p>The following individual responsible for the peer review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Rob Russell (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Review:</p><p>In this most interesting study, Lupas and colleagues hypothesize that modern protein domains arose from ancestral peptides. This is not a new idea; however, the current work is a systematic study of many proteins, while previous work focused on individual fold families. The authors have systematically revisited the original &quot;antecedent domain segment&quot; notion for protein structure, published some 15 years ago, by now using a systematic interrogation of structure and sequence. The authors identify 40 short 3D-structural motifs (they call them &quot;fragments&quot;) that are most likely to be some of the ancestral primordial peptides that gave rise to the present-day protein world. These are subdomain-size segments found by sequence profile similarity and validated by 3D structure similarity. They typically lack a well-defined hydrophobic core and are complemented to form complete domains in several different and likely evolutionarily independent ways.</p><p>This work stems from a hypothesis that proteins originated by fusion of ancestral peptides. These peptides likely functioned in complex with RNA. The crux of the authors' argument is that subdomain sequence similarity between different domains indicates deep homology for the subdomain. Because the containing domains are not homologous, they argue that the homology at the subdomain level indicates an ancestral peptide shared by the domains. They further argue that this sequence similarity does not arise from structural constraints on sequence, as similar subdomain structures with apparently unrelated sequences can be found. The authors' arguments are mostly clear. They also do not overstate their conclusion that these peptides are ancestral, which necessarily remains somewhat speculative.</p><p>This study is made possible by the development of the HHsearch algorithm to find statistically supported similarity between sequence profiles. While some of the HHsearch hits represent false positives, most are predictive of 3D structure, as has been validated in many CASP experiments. It is indeed most likely that if the HHsearch sequence-based alignment is nearly the same as the 3D structure-based alignment then the two segments are homologous. This is the main assumption of this work.</p><p>Some of these fragments have been detected before and studied, e.g. in the SISYPHUS database and various publications (e.g. about HHH motifs), but this manuscript provides the first principled and comprehensive approach to find them all and therefore deserves attention. Interestingly, no example of multiple different peptides in any fold was found, which goes slightly against the original idea, though multiplication/repetition of fragments seems definitely to have been a theme in the evolution of the folds.</p><p>In summary, the elaboration presented in this paper of the idea that short sub-structure motifs might have arisen through primordial interactions with RNA will be of general interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, and the paper is potentially suitable for publication provided that the authors can address the following issues raised by the referees.</p><p>Important issues to address:</p><p>1) There is concern about the argument that the sequence correlation between these motifs must arise from history rather than convergence. This argument – the core argument in the paper – hinges on the idea that the sequence space compatible with the subdomain motif is too vast to lead to chance convergence. The authors do not, however, provide any estimate for the number of sequences compatible with a given subdomain motif. Their median fragment length is 24 residues. How many different amino acids can be tolerated at each site in the fragment? With what probability? If only a few amino acids can be tolerated at each position, the space associated with a 24 residue fragment could be quite small, potentially leading to a spurious signal of homology.</p><p>The reviewers wonder whether it would be feasible to compute more of a significance of the overall observation (i.e. considering whether such a distribution of sequence similarities might be expected by chance) than just what seems to be a rather lenient sequence similarity measure. The reviewers are concerned that the authors support the lack of convergence with anecdotal rather than statistical analysis.</p><p>As an aside, the reviewers recognize that a compelling point is that these ancient peptide candidates are associated with ancient functions, and perhaps this isn't emphasized enough in the paper.</p><p>2) One thing that is missing is more discussion of the fragments that were common, but not significant in terms of sequence. For instance, the point about there being no single fold containing two fragments leads to the question of just how many there were that satisfied only stringent structural criteria. The reviewers realise that this is considerable work, but wonder if the authors have these data lying around anyway. For example, of the most popular folds, how many have two common fragments or more, even if HMMsearch doesn't give a significance? This would lend some insight into the really ancient, no-longer-detectable, but still related relationships.</p><p>3) Some discussion of some old favorites is also missing. The two halves of the Immunoglobulin fold or Rossmann fold, etc. – that is the cases that most structurally-obsessed readers will have in their minds, could also, if fitting, do with some discussion in the same light.</p><p>Other issues to address:</p><p>1) The authors can reference more relevant publications (e.g. SISYPHUS and those dedicated to individual motifs, like HHH).</p><p>2) The description of your methods to establish the statistical cutoffs for sequence and structural similarity took multiple reads to understand (both in the text, Results and discussion, and in the graphic and legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

It can only be approached by probabilistic arguments, which are constantly renegotiated in the scientific community. In our experience, this renegotiation has consistently admitted as evidence increasingly distant sequence matches made with new tools, after a period of doubt. Some examples that we have witnessed, where today the sequence evidence is considered conclusive (and we feel sure that the reviewers could report similar examples): The 1985 paper reporting the homology of response regulators was rejected by <italic>Science</italic> because FASTP scores could not be taken as evidence of homology; the paper was eventually published using the member track at PNAS. A 1998 paper delineating the superfamily of 8-stranded OMPs encountered similar criticism aimed at PSI-Blast, but was eventually published, as was a 2010 paper describing the homology of SMP, BPI and Takeout proteins, where HHpred connections at 50-80% were considered inconclusive, even when made multiply across the superfamilies. After an initial lag in acceptance, all these methods became standard applications for homology searches at significance cutoffs that just a few years earlier had seemed too lenient to be significant. Today, HHpred has become the method of choice for detecting deep homology and is used in hundreds of publications each year at more lenient cutoffs than those that we had such problems getting past the reviewers in 2010.</p><p>The question is thus whether our approach is still within the currently accepted boundaries for inferring homology, or pushes into new territory. As evidence that we are in fact within the currently accepted boundaries, we place great importance on the observation that our approach systematically recapitulates all reports of common evolutionary fragments made individually over more than 40 years. This covers 40% of our fragments. While we agree that it does not represent statistical analysis, we think that it goes well beyond anecdotal support. We can further substantiate that we stay well within these boundaries by comparing our use of HHsearch to what is already common usage in a wide range of publications. This comparison shows that our use is more conservative than the current standard. Thus:</p><p>We made all searches with full domains, never with fragments thereof;</p><p>We turned off secondary structure scoring;</p><p>We built the profile HMMs with PSI-Blast, not with the more sensitive HHblits.</p><p>Given these constraints, the HHsearch probabilities we use are much more stringent than the same probabilities obtained in default settings from the HHpred server (the most common source of HH searches). Indeed, their stringent nature can be seen by the large number of intrafamily matches (i.e. “safe” homologs) falling beneath the threshold in our analysis of the SCOP database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>We further raised the bar for observed matches by requiring that:</p><p>They be above our thresholds in both directions of the comparison between two superfamilies of different fold;</p><p>They cover more than a single secondary structure;</p><p>They be supported by at least two reciprocal connections made between different families within the superfamily (provided the superfamily contained two families or more).</p><p>Given all these restrictions, we would argue that our procedure is stringent, rather than lenient, with respect to the procedures commonly used today in publications that describe deep homology.</p><p>We did consider carefully avenues for statistical support of our argument prior to submission and all the more so after receiving the reviewers’ comments. Based on our attempts, we do not think, however, that the approach proposed by the reviewers would work in a satisfactory fashion.</p><p>For an estimate of the number of sequences compatible with a given fragment we would need to solve the reverse protein folding problem – not a feasible proposition. Failing that, we could try an approximation, identifying a given fragment by structure comparisons in known protein structures and tabulating a frequency matrix of amino acids at the individual positions. The quality of this approximation would depend on the number of structurally similar fragments identifiable outside our presumed homologous set. We have explored this for a few of our fragments and estimate that SCOPe30 would yield less than 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> instances even for fragments corresponding to common supersecondary structures, such as α- or β-hairpins. For fragments that are uncommon, there would be correspondingly fewer instances outside our homologous set, in some cases (such as for fragments 6, 9, 10, and 11) there would be none. If we scaled our search up to the larger SCOPe95 (a laborious endeavor), we would still not exceed numbers in the low hundreds for all but a few fragments; scaling up further to PDB would be unfeasible, as we would have to separate the structures into domains and classify them in order to be able to judge whether they should be in the homologous or analogous set for any given fragment.</p><p>Thus, even if we were able to implement this approach, the low number of instances would doom the approximation. At the restricted number of occurrences available, it would be impossible to decide whether a given fragment <italic>could</italic> not have been made with a broader sequence representation, or simply had not been explored by nature in more than a few folds. It is well established that nature has not explored more than an infinitesimal part of sequence space at the domain level; the extent to which it has done so at the supersecondary structure-level has not been established so far.</p><p>For these reasons, our statement that almost all of our fragments have matches with substantial structural similarity, but undetectable sequence similarity, in SCOPe30 is indeed anecdotal evidence that these fragments can be made in more than one way. This is however just the preamble to a statistical analysis, described in the same paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. This analysis, tracking the correlation between sequence and structure similarity in presumed homologs vs. presumed analogs, is much less sensitive to a small number of instances for any given fragment and can be applied collectively to all fragments. A correlation between sequence and structure similarity should not be detectable in analogs, if structural constraints do not result in a sequence bias. It should however be detectable in homologs, as these would have ancestrally started with identical sequences and structures, decaying in time towards the baseline.</p><p>As a control database for this analysis we used 40 of the most frequent supersecondary structures in PDB (from the Smotifs dataset), identified them in SCOPe30 and plotted their pairwise sequence and structure similarities, separately for matches within superfamilies (presumed homologs; red) and matches between folds (presumed analogs; blue). The result confirms our expectation that for these fragments, sequence bias resulting from structural constraints is very low, as judged from the very low correlation in the analogous set (r = 0.12); certainly it disproves the notion that only a few amino acids could be tolerated at each position of a fragment. In contrast, again as expected, homologs show a clear correlation (r = 0.56).</p><p>Performing the same analysis for our 40 fragments yields substantially the same result. Matches outside our list of postulated homologs (blue) show as little correlation between sequence and structure as the Smotifs set (r = 0.14), emphasizing the very low sequence bias introduced by structural constraints. Matches between our proposed homologs, however, show a similar correlation as the SCOP homologs (r = 0.38), even though our comparisons are made across a wider evolutionary distance (between superfamilies) than the reference comparisons (within superfamilies).</p><p>In conclusion, we think that our analysis of sequence-structure correlation can discriminate between homology and analogy, and directly addresses the question raised by the referees as to whether structural constraints may have caused the sequence similarity of our fragments: They have not.</p><p>We have attempted to expand the points made here in the manuscript and make our reasoning more explicit in the text and the Materials and methods; we hope that our arguments have become clearer as a result.</p><p><italic>2) One thing that is missing is more discussion of the fragments that were common, but not significant in terms of sequence. For instance, the point about there being no single fold containing two fragments leads to the question of just how many there were that satisfied only stringent structural criteria. The reviewers realise that this is considerable work, but wonder if the authors have these data lying around anyway. For example, of the most popular folds, how many have two common fragments or more, even if HMMsearch doesn't give a significance? This would lend some insight into the really ancient, no-longer-detectable, but still related relationships.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent point, given our conjecture that fragment combinations “might lead to the retention of only one dominant fragment, the other(s) adjusting by rapid divergence, making them undetectable by our methods”. We were happy to follow it up. Since these data were not available and the effort is indeed not trivial, we only selected one family for each superfamily that contains one of our fragments (188 in all) for the purposes of this revision, but we intend to do this analysis comprehensively in the future.</p><p>For combinations between a “significant” and a “nonsignificant” fragment, we first asked that the second fragment have a TM-score ≥ 0.5 and an HHsearch probability ≥ 50%, in order to see whether there were any fragment combinations that had remained just under our sequence cutoff. There were none. We then relaxed the sequence cutoff to HHsearch probabilities ≥ 10%, but again there were no combinations apparent. Only when we omitted sequence cutoffs entirely for the second fragment did we find combinations and these were in fact quite frequent, arguing that the lack of compatibility was not due to geometric considerations. We now explicitly address this point in the paper and have generated a new figure to show some of the most attractive instances of fragment combinations.</p><p><italic>3) Some discussion of some old favorites is also missing. The two halves of the Immunoglobulin fold or Rossmann fold, etc. – that is the cases that most structurally-obsessed readers will have in their minds, could also, if fitting, do with some discussion in the same light.</italic> </p><p>Agreed. We had provided only a cursory reference to the broad range of studies exploring internal symmetry in domains and its potential evolutionary implications, where these had not led to identification of an ancestral fragment by our criteria (last paragraph of the section on “Repetition as a dominant force in the origin of folds”). For several of these, however, ancestrality could well be argued, as we state in the last paragraph of the manuscript (“For the fragments that occur in a single fold, we note that because of the importance of repetition, it might be possible to reconstruct further fragments by specifically analyzing repetitive folds.”).</p><p>We have now expanded this point in the manuscript at the abovenamed locations.</p><p><italic>Other issues to address:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors can do a better job referencing relevant publications (e.g. SISYPHUS and those dedicated to individual motifs, like HHH).</italic> </p><p>Agreed and done. We have added more than 40 references in revision and hope to have thus provided a broader context to our manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The description of your methods to establish the statistical cutoffs for sequence and structural similarity took multiple reads to understand (both in the text, Results and discussion, and in the graphic and legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).
