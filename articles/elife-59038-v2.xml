Previously, we demonstrated that ENaC subunits – α, β, and γ – assemble in a counterclockwise configuration when viewed from outside the cell with the protease-sensitive GRIP domains in the periphery (Noreng et al., 2018). Here we describe the structure of ENaC resolved by cryo-electron microscopy at 3 Å. We find that a combination of precise domain arrangement and complementary hydrogen bonding network defines the subunit arrangement. Furthermore, we determined that the α subunit has a primary functional module consisting of the finger and GRIP domains. The module is bifurcated by the α2 helix dividing two distinct regulatory sites: Na<sup>+</sup> and the inhibitory peptide. Removal of the inhibitory peptide perturbs the Na<sup>+</sup> site via the α2 helix highlighting the critical role of the α2 helix in regulating ENaC function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heteromeric ion channel</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>proteolysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5OD017871</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baconguis</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19TPA34760754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baconguis</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18PRE33990205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noreng</surname><given-names>Sigrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1937961</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houser</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The in-depth structural and functional work provide a deeper understanding as to how the epithelial sodium channel is a heteromeric ion channel that is regulated by Na<sup>+</sup> and proteolysis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to balance the amount of water inside and outside cells is absolutely essential for life. In the specialized epithelial tissues, the apical expression of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) gives rise to a transepithelial directional flow of Na<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palmer and Frindt, 1986</xref>). ENaC function is therefore crucial in proper regulation of blood volume and pressure, as well as surface liquid volume in the respiratory and reproductive systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boggula et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hummler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rossier, 2014</xref>). In humans, the essential role of ENaC in blood volume and pressure regulation is highlighted in gain-of-function mutations, as observed in Liddle syndrome, and also in loss-of-function mutations in pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, severe genetic diseases that lead to hyper- and hypotension, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palmer and Alpern, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liddle and Coppage, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shimkets et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheek and Perry, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanukoglu, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strautnieks et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Edelheit et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>ENaC belongs to the ENaC/degenerin family, defined by Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity, voltage independence, and amiloride sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kellenberger and Schild, 2002</xref>). Members of this family, including the well-studied relative Acid-Sensing Ion Channel (ASIC), have subunits that consist of short intracellular N- and C-termini, two membrane-spanning helices, and a large cysteine-rich extracellular domain (ECD) that can form homo- or heterotrimeric ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noreng et al., 2018</xref>). In the case of ENaC, three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ, form trimers which are arranged in a counterclockwise direction when viewed from the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noreng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Collier and Snyder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Collier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Seminal cloning and functional studies of the ENaC subunits demonstrated that while homomeric α and diheteromeric forms of ENaC containing α/β or α/γ can form functional ion channels, the α-β-γ presents robust Na<sup>+</sup> currents indicating that the triheteromeric form is the favored assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canessa et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canessa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Staruschenko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lingueglia et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Firsov et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Unlike other ion channels, ENaC activity is primarily modulated by proteases that remove peptidyl tracts in the ECD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vallet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kashlan et al., 2015</xref>). Removal of these polypeptides irreversibly converts ENaC channels from a low-channel-activity state to constitutively active channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carattino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bruns et al., 2007</xref>). Canonically, the α subunit is cleaved twice by furin, while the γ subunit is cleaved once by furin and once by prostasin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carattino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bruns et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hughey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carattino et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Passero et al., 2010</xref>). Of note, the β subunit does not have canonical protease sites. Conversely, extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> attenuates ENaC activity by binding to allosteric sites in the ECD, an effect referred to as Na<sup>+</sup> self-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuchs et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awayda, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, cleavage of the α subunit has been shown to abrogate Na<sup>+</sup> self-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheng et al., 2006</xref>). The molecular mechanisms of neither proteolytic activation nor Na<sup>+</sup> self-inhibition are currently understood.</p><p>We have previously solved the first structure of human ENaC at a nominal resolution of 3.9 Å by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noreng et al., 2018</xref>). The structure provided valuable insight into channel assembly, stoichiometry and positions of the protease-sensitive domains, deemed the <bold>G</bold>ating <bold>R</bold>elease of <bold>I</bold>nhibition by <bold>P</bold>roteolysis (GRIP) domain. This initial study took advantage of ENaC constructs biochemically designed to be resistant to endogenous proteases, trapping the molecule in the uncleaved state. Our structure showed critical structural divergence from close relative ASIC in the peripheral region of the ENaC ECD, particularly in the finger and the specialized GRIP domains, which are not found in ASIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we determined the structure of ENaC by single-particle cryo-EM at 3 Å to gain molecular insight into the roles of Na<sup>+</sup> and the protease-sensitive GRIP domains in ENaC function. The overall improvement of the map quality reveals for the first time the molecular source of the preferred channel assembly, and hints at mechanisms of Na<sup>+</sup> self-inhibition and proteolytic activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Determinants of channel composition</title><p>To investigate the structural source of ENaC trimer assembly, we exploited a set of constructs, deemed ENaC<sub>FL</sub>, which comprises wild-type α and β, and N-terminally eGFP-tagged γ, and behaves like wild-type ENaC as measured by electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We solved a 3 Å cryo-EM structure of ENaC<sub>FL</sub>, based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Resolution is higher in the channel core, calculated up to 2.6 Å, with β strands and smaller side chains clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>). To determine the structure of ENaC<sub>FL</sub>, we expressed ENaC<sub>FL</sub> in HEK293T/17, solubilized in digitonin, and added two different Fabs, 7B1 (recognizes the α subunit) and 10D4 (recognizes the β subunit), to facilitate particle alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>). Reference-free 2D class averages and 3D classifications reveal that ENaC<sub>FL</sub> channels form as α-β-γ counterclockwise when viewed from outside the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). However, the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the cytosolic domain (CD) were not resolved; we speculate that preferred particle orientation, air-water interface denaturation, and intrinsic protein flexibility and conformational heterogeneity contribute to the lack of 3D reconstruction of the TMD and CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4f</xref>). Therefore, we did not include the TMD and CD portions in the ENaC<sub>FL</sub> structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The higher resolution of ENaC<sub>FL</sub> structure affords us confidence in the placement of side chains for the first time, providing unprecedented insight into how the ECD mediates ENaC

Additionally, because the γ subunit gene contained the purification tag, all purified ENaCs contain at least one γ subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Thus, if other combinations of ENaC heteromers were present, classes with one (α-γ-γ) or two Fabs (α-γ-β or α-α-γ) forming a 35° and 120° angle about the pseudo three-fold axis, respectively, would be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baldin et al., 2020</xref>).

All subunit interfaces share van der Waals interactions between the first two helical turns of the α2 helix and the α6 helix of the adjacent subunit.

First, nonpolar contacts involve a tyrosine only found in α and γ; the equivalent residue is a leucine in β (βLeu127). The αTyr162 is surrounded by the hydrophobic αLeu161 and βVal474 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The equivalent γTyr129, however, is tucked further into its own subunit, in a pocket comprising residues from the γ-α1 helix, γ-α2 helix, and γGRIP domain, as well as the adjacent αMet505 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The nonpolar interactions at β/γ interface present yet another combination, in which two hydrophobic residues, βIle126 and βLeu127, make multiple hydrophobic contacts with the γ-α6 helix. In a conformation distinct to this interface, γTrp486 is wedged between the C-terminal end of the β-α1 helix and the βGRIP domain loop, locking the residue in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This conformation would result in a clash if the β and γ subunits were swapped, indicating that the positions of the aromatic residues may play a large role in defining the counterclockwise arrangement of channel subunits.</p><p>Second, polar interactions via hydrogen bonds are only found at two interfaces. The α/β interface αTyr162 is also poised to participate in a hydrogen bonding network with neighboring αArg190 in the αGRIP domain and βGlu478 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Thus, the α subunit acts as a hydrogen bond donor to the β subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). However, at the γ/α interface, the γ subunit is a hydrogen bond acceptor, with the backbone carbonyl oxygens of γGly130 and γPhe131 forming hydrogen bonds with the guanidino group of αArg508 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Finally, there is no clear hydrogen bond network at the β/γ subunit interface. Thus, the hydrogen bond networks at the different interfaces confer specificity for the counterclockwise α-β-γ channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).</p><p>We extended our analysis of homomeric channels by generating in silico models of homomeric forms of each ENaC subunit. To generate homomeric α, β, and γ channels (α<sub>homo</sub>, β<sub>homo</sub>, and γ<sub>homo</sub>), we used the coordinates of the ENaC<sub>FL</sub> structure, assuming C3 symmetry around the three-fold axis (e.g. α<sub>homo</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We believe that this is a reasonable assumption, based on structures of the closely related ASIC. Comparison of these homomeric models reveals steric clashes in both the distal (finger/knuckle domain interface, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>) and core (lower palm/thumb domain interface, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–g</xref>) ECD of the β and γ subunits. Focusing on the distal ECD, the β<sub>homo</sub> channel α6 and α2 helices are 3 Å closer than the α<sub>homo</sub> channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), pointing to potential steric clash in the interface. The γ<sub>homo</sub> channel appears even less stable in this region, with α6 and α2 clearly intersecting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Conversely, in the core ECD, the β<sub>homo</sub> channel shows clear steric clash between the β11-β12 linker and the adjacent β10 strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). The core ECD of the γ- and α subunits are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>) and, interestingly, the β11-β12 linkers are both similar to that of the ASIC open and closed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, the β subunit β11-β12 linker resembles that of ASIC trapped in the desensitized state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gonzales et al., 2009</xref>). However, the functional consequences of the β11-β12 linker asymmetry, when comparing all three subunits, have not been investigated in detail, so caution is required in interpreting the state of the β11-β12 linker in the β subunit. None of these steric clashes are obvious in the α<sub>homo</sub> channel, as expected given this channel’s ability to pass current in vitro.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Human ENaC is a heteromeric channel with three different subunits.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Generated model of homomeric α ENaC using coordinates of the α subunit from the ENaC<sub>FL</sub> structure.

To determine the consequences of the shift in β and γ, we measured the distances between the Cα atoms of the conserved tryptophan residue in finger domain α2 helix in the homomeric models.

The map quality in this region is estimated to be well beyond 3 Å and thus the positions of the side chains are reliable. We speculate that this map feature is a cation, perhaps a Na<sup>+</sup> ion, based on the surrounding residues, the above-mentioned functional studies, and the presence of high Na<sup>+</sup> (150 mM) during purification, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The cation interacts closely with several negative charges: the carboxyl group of αAsp338, and the carbonyl oxygens of αLeu135, αGlu335, and αVal346; all of these interactions are within distances of 2.5 – 3.5 Å. The hydroxyl group of αSer344 likely interacts with the cation via a water molecule, at a distance of approximately 4 Å. While these measured distances suggest that this feature is a positively charged ion, the cation site is perhaps not very highly selective for Na<sup>+</sup>. This is consistent with the ability of other cations like K<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup> to reduce ENaC macroscopic currents, although the inhibitory effect of Na<sup>+</sup> is larger in comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kashlan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bize and Horisberger, 2007</xref>).

Moreover, where αSer344 contributes a favorable polar interaction to the binding site, the equivalent positions in the β- and γ subunits are aliphatic (βAla311 and γVal322). In all three subunits, there is an acidic-aromatic residue pair at the segment of the β6-β7 loop believed to modulate Na<sup>+</sup> self-inhibition.

The acidic residues in the β- and γ subunits are exposed to solution, while the tyrosine hydroxyl groups are buried, participating in a network of internal hydrogen bonds.

Our sample had partially proteolyzed α and γ subunits, as expected given the wild type GRIP domain. Using focused classification, we aimed to identify the different cleavage states - absence or presence of the inhibitory peptide – that our SDS-PAGE analysis suggests to exist. Particles from the final 3D refinement in both cryoSPARC and cisTEM were subjected to focused classification in cisTEM, centered on the αGRIP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grant et al., 2018</xref>). Assuming that the αGRIP domain is only cleaved at the canonical protease sites, there are four major combinatorial classes: uncleaved, fully cleaved, and two cleavage states at either protease sites. We requested five classes in each focused classification to allow for some heterogeneity in the particles.</p><p>In the αGRIP classification, the largest class (50% of the total number of particles) demonstrated features similar to ΔENaC, which could not be cleaved. We thus consider this the uncleaved class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>). We merged two classes which lacked features of the inhibitory peptide and the P3 strand into the fully-cleaved class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The fully-cleaved class contains 10% of the total particles. The other two classes, comprising 40% of the total particles, had a similar overall potential map to the uncleaved class, but contained some differences along the inhibitory peptide and P3 strand. We consider these classes undefined, and believe that they likely are an intermediate cleavage state or too low-contrast for proper classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c,e</xref>). While on the one hand the western blot analysis showed a large population of cleaved α subunit, on the other hand, the focused classification analysis demonstrated a small population of the fully cleaved class. We speculate that there are three major reasons for the discrepancy. First, the existence of the relatively large class of undefined molecules in which the cleavage state of the P1 peptide is unresolved could contribute to the discrepancy between the observed intensity of the cleaved α band observed in western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Second, due to the binding site of our antibody spanning both cleavage sites, what appears to be a single large band may in fact represent both partially-cleaved and fully-cleaved α subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noreng et al., 2018</xref>). And third, the set of particles used for focused classification was derived from rounds of 2D and 3D classifications, which removed denatured complexes and particles in thick ice, as examples. Thus, the population of particles used for SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses is not the same as the population used for focused classification. Nevertheless, implementing focused classification resulted in 3D maps that demonstrate differences in map features in the GRIP domain. A difference map between the cleaved and uncleaved maps shows a prominent feature overlapping the position of the uncleaved inhibitory strand, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The difference map also highlights deviations in the P3 strand potential, in agreement with observations in the cleaved and undefined classes indicating increased flexibility of this region upon cleavage. This disordered region begins near αGly225 in αP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We thus speculate that αP3 becomes more mobile when the inhibitory peptide is proteolytically removed.</p><p>The γ subunit is known to be cleaved by several proteases aside from the canonical furin and prostasin, the latter of which is not present in our expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kleyman et al., 2009</xref>). We expect these non-canonical cleavages, if present, to segregate into the undefined class. All five classes still showed features of the γ-inhibitory peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>). There are detectable differences in the inhibitory peptide between the five classes, with class one showing the most striking difference from the overall structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We observed a small reduction of electron potential at the C-terminus of the inhibitory peptide and the γP3 strand, as expected. Nevertheless, this analysis suggests that the vast majority of the particles used for the initial map contain intact γGRIP domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>7B1 Fab binds to the uncleaved and cleaved states of αGRIP</title><p>Given that all of the classes (cleaved, uncleaved, and undefined of both α and γ subunits) have the same overall topology, we more closely investigated Fab binding and its effect on ENaC activity. 7B1 binds primarily to the finger domain and finger/thumb interface of the α subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). 7B1 map feature at the αECD is equally strong in both the cleaved and uncleaved states of αGRIP and the cleaved and partially-cleaved states of γGRIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). Additionally, we did not observe any structural rearrangements in between the two states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), which does not align with the proposed gating mechanism derived from the structures of different functional states of ASIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that 7B1 traps ENaC in the conformation natively adopted by the uncleaved channel, regardless of the actual state of the channel. We thus assayed ENaC current before and after application of 100 nM 7B1 (10-fold greater than the observed K<sub>D</sub> for purified ENaC<sub>FL</sub>, data not shown). If 7B1 traps the ECD in the uncleaved state, channel current would be low after application of protease in the presence of 7B1. We did not detect measurable acute differences in current magnitude or profile upon addition of 7B1 to either closed or open channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,b</xref>). We confirmed surface binding by confocal microscopy of cells expressing ENaC<sub>FL</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).

We performed fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) and western blots of purified ENaC<sub>FL</sub>, either as-purified (mostly uncleaved) or treated with trypsin. Additionally, to assay whether 7B1 can bind any ENaC or only Na<sup>+</sup>-bound ENaC, we performed these experiments with an additional variable of Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> buffer, the latter of which should not induce a Na<sup>+</sup>-bound conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, uncleaved ENaC<sub>FL</sub> binds both 7B1 and 10D4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results are in agreement with prior studies on ΔENaC. Purifying and analyzing the protein in K<sup>+</sup> buffer showed no apparent difference in binding behavior. We thus conclude that 7B1 is able to bind uncleaved ENaC<sub>FL</sub> in both high- and low-Na<sup>+</sup> conditions. Encouragingly, this trend holds after ENaC<sub>FL</sub> is treated with trypsin, moving the channels into a cleaved state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In summary, 7B1 can bind ENaC regardless of cleavage or Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and does not modulate ENaC current. Thus, we believe that 7B1 does not trap ENaC in a closed-like conformation, and our classifications of the cleaved αGRIP structures are valid.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we employed single-particle cryo-EM to identify the structural determinants of subunit stoichiometry and arrangement in ENaC, and to illuminate the structural basis of ENaC modulation by Na<sup>+</sup> and proteolysis. Functional analysis of different combinations of ENaC subunits demonstrated that robust Na<sup>+</sup> currents were measured only when α, β, and γ were expressed together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canessa et al., 1994</xref>). The first structure of human ENaC, ΔENaC, provided the first direct observation of the preferred assembly of the channel -- counterclockwise α-β-γ when viewed from outside the cell. Our new structure, ENaC<sub>FL</sub>, confirms the observed assembly and, with a more reliable placement of side chains, it deepens our understanding of the molecular principles that govern the heteromeric assembly of ENaC. The precise nature of how the subunits are positioned around the pseudo-three-fold axis involves an asymmetric arrangement of domains and unique molecular properties at interfaces.</p><p>The ECD of ENaC<sub>FL</sub> deviates significantly from C3 symmetry. The swapped conformations of the β11-β12 linker in the β subunit and the β6-β7 aspartate and phenylalanine side chains in the α subunit are clear in the ENaC<sub>FL</sub> map. The functional consequences of the swapped conformation of the β11-β12 linker in the β subunit are currently unknown but the findings provide a new direction for investigating the role of the β subunit in channel function. Furthermore, the presence of a phenylalanine adopting a different conformation in the α subunit from the tyrosines in the β and γ subunits, near the cation site confers a specialized function for the α subunit as the primary Na<sup>+</sup> sensor.</p><p>Additionally, the high-resolution information of the GRIP domains in ENaC<sub>FL</sub> allowed us to investigate the specific interactions between the inhibitory peptides and their binding pockets in the channel. We note that the loss of strong features in the P3 strands in the cleaved state is in agreement with functional studies of the α subunit by Kashlan and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kashlan et al., 2010</xref>). While equivalent studies in the γ subunit have not been performed, our focused-classification maps of γGRIP indicate that similar structures and mechanisms exist between both the α and γ subunits. We speculate that the P3 strand anchors the N-terminal side of the α2 helix in place in the presence of the P1 peptide. After removal of P1, P3 is released, which destabilizes the α2 helix and β6/β7 interactions, disrupting the pocket for the novel α subunit Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site we identified in the present study. This provides a structural explanation for the observed loss of Na<sup>+</sup> self-inhibition after proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheng et al., 2006</xref>). Surprisingly, we did not observe large-scale conformational differences in the α subunit between cleaved and uncleaved ECD maps. This is in contrast with the closed and open states of ASIC, in which the finger and thumb collapse in the open state. We confirmed that our tightly-binding 7B1 Fab does not trap the channel in a closed-like state. It is possible that the lack of observed conformational changes is a result of particle selection for an overall, closed structure, and then isolating those particles with a cleaved inhibitory peptide. It is possible that ENaC has a different gating mechanism from ASIC. Our maps highlight the importance of the α2 helix in mediating ENaC activity.</p><p>In this present study, we were unable to capture a fully cleaved state of γGRIP, which has a dominant effect on ENaC <italic>P<sub>O</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carattino et al., 2008b</xref>). The different classes derived from the focused classification analysis of the γGRIP all demonstrate that unlike the αP1 peptide, the γP1 peptide spans the finger domain forging extensive contacts with the thumb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balchak et al., 2018</xref>). Whether complete removal of the γP1 peptide gives rise to conformational changes at the finger/thumb interface will be addressed by resolving a structure of a fully cleaved γGRIP. It is of vital importance to resolve the TMD and CD, especially the pore-forming region of ENaC. A recent structure of ASIC in a lipid bilayer reveals that a highly conserved ‘His-Gly’ (HG) motif forms a reentrant loop that lines the lower ion permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoder and Gouaux, 2020</xref>). The HG motif is found in all ENaC/Degenerin family members and is critical for ENaC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gründer et al., 1997</xref>). With better methods for isolating ENaC with stable TMD and CD in addition to further improvement of sample preparation, we hope to resolve the full channel to understand the mechanistic link between removal of inhibitory peptides in the ECD and channel gating.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

constructs were designed for functional and structural studies. First, wild-type human α, β, and γ subunits were N-terminally fused with 8xHis tag, eGFP, and a thrombin recognition site (LVPRG); together, we refer to this set of constructs as ENaC<sub>eGFP</sub>. The ENaC<sub>eGFP</sub> complex was ideal for whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology because the three eGFP per ENaC molecule facilitate in identifying ENaC-expressing cells. Second, for the biochemical aspects of the investigation, we put together another set of ENaC constructs in which the wild-type α and β subunits are untagged. As in ENaC<sub>eGFP</sub>, the wild-type γ subunit is N-terminally fused with an 8xHis tag, eGFP, and a thrombin site, and together with WTα and WTβ make a heteromeric ENaC<sub>FL</sub>. Because ENaC<sub>FL</sub> only contains one eGFP per ENaC molecule, we reduced eGFP contamination during the purification step when using eGFP nanobody for affinity purification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation and isolation of Fabs</title><p>The protocol for generation and isolation of Fabs are as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noreng et al., 2018</xref>. Mouse monoclonal antibodies 7B1 and 10D4 were generated using standard procedure by Dan Cawley at the Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute (OHSU). The 7B1 and 10D4 mAbs were previously selected because they recognize tertiary epitopes of ENaC. The mAbs were purified, and their Fabs were generated by papain cleavage. Fab 7B1 was isolated by anion exchange using HiTrap Q HP column while Fab 10D4 was eluted using Protein A column to remove Fc.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Expression and purification of ENaC-Fab complexes</title><p>Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T/17) were grown in suspension at a density of 2 – 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in Freestyle medium with 2% FBS and transduced with ENaC subunit virus to generate complexes ENaC<sub>eGFP</sub> and ENaC<sub>FL</sub> at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and incubated at 37°C. 5 - 8 hr post transduction, amiloride was added to a final concentration of 1 μM, and cells were incubated at 30°C. After 24 – 48 hr, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4790 xg for 20 min. The pellet was washed with 20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl and followed by a second round of centrifugation at 4790 xg for 15 min.</p><p>There were two approaches to purification of ENaC<sub>FL</sub> that the cryo-EM data set arrived from. In both purifications, GFP-cleaved ENaC<sub>FL</sub>-diFab at pH 7.4 was the final purified complex used for cryo-EM sample preparation and will be referred to as ENaC<sub>FL</sub>. In one purification, membranes were prepared and ENaC<sub>FL</sub> was purified from the prepared membranes, while in the second purification ENaC<sub>FL</sub> was purified from the cell pellet.</p><p>In the first purification, cells expressing ENaC<sub>FL</sub> were homogenized with a dounce homogenizer and sonicated in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 U/mL nuclease and protease inhibitors. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 9715 xg for 20 min and the resulting supernatant containing the membrane fractions were further centrifuged at 100,000 xg for 1 hr. Membrane pellets were resuspended and solubilized in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2, </sub>1% digitonin (high purity, Millipore Sigma), 25 U/mL nuclease and protease inhibitors for 1 hr at 4°C. The solubilized fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation 100,000 xg for 1 hr at 4°C.</p><p>In the second purification, cells expressing ENaC<sub>FL</sub> were homogenized with a dounce homogenizer in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 U/mL nuclease and protease inhibitors. Homogenized cells were solubilized by adding the same buffer containing 2% digitonin (high purity, Millipore Sigma) and 4 mM ATP at 1 x initial volume (final volume 2x) for 2 hr at 4°C. The solubilized fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation 100,000 xg for 1 hr at 4°C and supernatant was filtered through 0.45 μm filters.</p><p>Solubilized ENaC<sub>FL</sub> (from both purifications) was bound to GFP nanobody resin by batch binding for 2 hr at 4°C. ENaC<sub>FL</sub> bound to GFP nanobody resin was packed into an XK-16 column, and the column was washed with 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% digitonin and 25 U/mL nuclease (second purification: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% digitonin and 25 U/mL nuclease) followed by an additional wash of the same buffer containing 2 mM ATP. For elution, thrombin at 30 μg/mL and 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in the same buffer was applied to the column and incubated for 30 min. GFP-cleaved ENaC<sub>FL</sub> was eluted off with the same wash buffer and the eluted fractions were concentrated and then incubated with the Fabs 7B1 and 10D4 (DiFab complex) in a 1:2 molar ratio of ENaC<sub>FL</sub>:Fab for 10 min, and clarified by ultracentrifugation 100,000 xg for 1 hr at 4°C. The supernatant was injected onto a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% digitonin (second purification: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% digitonin) to isolate the protein complex by size-exclusion chromatography. Monodispersed peaks were pooled and concentrated to 2 – 3 mg/mL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image acquisition and data processing</title><p>Purified GFP-cleaved ENaC<sub>FL</sub>-DiFab complexes at a concentration of 2 – 3 mg/mL was applied on holey-carbon cryo-EM grids which were glow discharged at 15mA for 60 s (Quantifoil Au 1.2/1.3 μm 300 mesh) prior to use. Grids were prepared using a Vitrobot Mark III (FEI) at 100% humidity and 12°C, where 3.5 μL of purified ENaC<sub>FL</sub>-DiFab complexes were applied followed by a manual blot on the side of the grid. Then another 3.5 μL of purified ENaC<sub>FL</sub>-DiFab complexes were applied before a wait time of 10 s, 3.5 s blot time at blot force 1, and then plunge frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen.</p><p>Three large data sets were collected on the same microscope, a Titan Krios at the Multiscale Microscopy Core at OHSU, equipped with a Gatan K3 detector. One of the data sets, with a total of 9435 movies, were collected from the purification of ENaC<sub>FL</sub> solubilized from membranes, while the other two data sets were collected from ENaC<sub>FL</sub> purified directly from cells (see section ‘expression and purification’ for more details), one containing 9605 movies and the other containing 6153 movies. For all three data sets, movies were collected in super resolution mode with a pixel size of 0.415 Å. Total acquisition time was 3 s, and all three data sets were dose-fractionated to 60 frames with a dose rate of 1 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>/frame and total dose of 60 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>. Multishot with image shift between four holes was performed to speed up data collection using the automated acquisition program SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mastronarde, 2003</xref>). Hotspur was used to initiate image alignment and ctf estimation during data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elferich et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>All data sets were binned 2 × 2 and motion corrected using motioncor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) with patch of 5 × 5. Each data set was processed individually using the software cryoSPARC v2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) to determine the overall quality of final cryo-EM map before all three data sets were combined for final data processing. Defocus values were estimated using CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>), and cryoSPARC blob picker was used for automated particle picking, initially resulting in 1,787,887 particles. Multiple rounds of 2D classification in cryoSPARC were performed where positive 2D classes of ENaC<sub>FL</sub> were saved, and particles belonging to false-positive classes were combined and re-classified by 2D classification to further reveal and include true ENaC<sub>FL</sub>-diFab classes. After multiple rounds of 2D classification, a set of 453,875 particles was classified by cryoSPARCv2 <italic>ab initio</italic> and three rounds of 3D classification by heterogeneous refinement in cryoSPARCv2. To include as many true positive ENaC<sub>FL</sub>-diFab particles as possible, 3D classes of false – positive particles went through additional 2D classification and positive ENaC<sub>FL</sub>-diFab 2D classes were re-added for heterogeneous 3D classification.</p><p>The final data set containing 252,071 particles was processed using non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC with default settings and C1 symmetry for a final 3D reconstruction with a Gold standard Fourier Shell Correlation (GS FSC) resolution of 3.06 Å. In addition, the same particles were exported from cryoSPARC by using the pyem conversion script (csparc2star.py) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asarnow et al., 2019</xref>), and then imported to cisTEM 1.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grant et al., 2018</xref>). In cisTEM particles were sorted by 2D classification, and 248,079 particles were refined with a mask that contained the ECD only to a solvent adjusted FSC of 3.11 Å. The final 3D map from 252,071 particles created in cryoSPARC v2 was used for model building and refinement. The improved resolution is potentially due to the advancement of the detector that was used for data collection (Gatan K2 switched to a Gatan K3 detector), as well as improvement of sample preparation where ENaC<sub>FL</sub> grids were imaged in regions containing thinner ice.</p><p>To separate cleaved states of ENaC<sub>FL</sub>, focused classification (only refining the translational x and y parameters in cisTEM 1.0.0) was performed in the GRIP domain of the α and γ subunits. Subsequent classes obtained from focused classification were imported to cryoSPARC and <italic>ab initio</italic> was performed followed by non-uniform heterogeneous refinement to confirm the missing densities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Model building</title><p>The extracellular coordinates of the ΔENaC structure and the antigen-binding domains of 7B1 and 10D4 (PDB code: 6BQN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noreng et al., 2018</xref>]) were docked into the cryo-EM map using Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). The coordinates were then manually inspected and adjusted using the computer program COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). The overall improved map quality shows many well-defined features that were not resolved in the ΔENaC map. These features include additional residues in the α- and γ-P1 peptides, Na<sup>+</sup> ion, and N-acetylglucosamines (GlcNac). The final model contains all residues proposed to comprise the inhibitory peptides, LPHPLQRL and RFSHRIPLLIF, in the α- and γ-GRIP domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carattino et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Passero et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, seven glycosylation sites were modeled: two in α, four in β, and one in γ subunit.</p><p>Due to the lack of map features corresponding to the segments that connect the GRIP domains to the α1 and α2 helices, the loops were not included in the final model. Importantly, the ENaC<sub>FL</sub> TMD was also excluded from the final model. While the 2D class averages and 3D maps demonstrate micelles features, which suggest the presence of the ENaC<sub>FL</sub> TMD, the ion channel portion of the complex was not resolved. Overall, the following residues were modeled into the ENaC<sub>FL</sub> cryo-EM map: residues 114–166, 183–191, 223–541 in α, 78–131, 139–167, 179–481, 486–512 in β, and 80–133, 152–164, 200–521 in γ. Iterative rounds of manual building and real-space refinement were conducted using COOT and PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>), respectively. The final model was determined to have good stereochemistry as assessed by MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Distance measurements and figures were made using the software Pymol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schrodinger, LLC, 2015</xref>) and chimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Confocal fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noreng et al., 2018</xref>). The antibody was conjugated to TRITC at a final dye:protein molar ratio of 3.7:1 in TBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blotting</title><p>For western blots, ENaC<sub>FL</sub> was purified as described above (solubilized with 20 mM DDM and 3 mM CHS instead of 1% digitonin). For the biochemical characterization of ENaC<sub>FL</sub> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, the following polyclonal antibodies were used: sc-21012 (αENaC), ABclonal A1765 (βENaC), and ABclonal A15097 (γENaC). To validate purified ENaC<sub>FL</sub> samples treated with trypsin, we also used western blotting as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. The sample was split into groups, one kept untreated while the other was treated with 25 μg/mL of trypsin for 5 min at room temperature. Both samples were injected individually onto a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column. The peak fractions from each condition were collected, pooled, and split into two groups. The first group was concentrated and prepared for FSEC and western blotting. The second group was concentrated and diluted multiple times with 0.5 mM DDM, 75 μM CHS, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, and 150 mM KCl to attain a NaCl concentration of approximately 0.24 mM and a KCl concentration of 149.76 mM. As a result, there were four total samples: uncleaved ENaC<sub>FL</sub> in Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> and cleaved ENaC<sub>FL</sub> in Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>. SDS-PAGE samples of 2.9–3.2 μg each (the same amount within a blot) were loaded into the wells of 4 – 15% Tris-HCl Criterion Precast Gel. Proteins were electrophoresed at 180 V for 60 min and then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane at 80 V for 40 min. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4°C while rocking in 5% nonfat dry milk (NFDM). For staining, the primary antibody used was either αENaC (6 μg/ blot, rabbit polyclonal Ab to SCNN1A raised against amino acids 131–225, sc-21012) or γENaC (11 μg/blot, rabbit polyclonal Ab to SCNN1G raised against amino acids 100–200, ab133430). Primary antibodies were left on the membrane for 2 hr at room temperature while rocking. IRDye 680RD Goat anti-mouse IgG (LI-COR, 925–68070) was used as the secondary antibody on both blots. The secondary antibody was diluted to 1:25000 (1 μg/ 25 mL TBST) and allowed to bind for 1 hr at room temperature while rocking. The blots were imaged on an Odyssey western blot detection system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Whole cell patch clamp experiments</title><p>HEK293T/17 cells were grown in suspension at a density of 2 – 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in Freestyle medium with 2% FBS and transduced with the virus (ENaC<sub>eGFP</sub>) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and incubated at 37°C. After approximately 5 hr the transduced suspension cells were incubated in the presence of 500 nM phenamil mesylate at 30°C for 12 – 14 hr. About 2–3 hr before recording, cells were transferred to wells containing glass coverslips at a density 0.3 – 0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 2% FBS and 500 nM phenamil mesylate. Whole cells recordings were carried out 17 – 24 hr after transduction. Pipettes were pulled and polished to 2.5 – 3.5 MΩ resistance and filled with internal solution containing (in mM): 150 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES pH 7.4. For IC<sub>50</sub> experiments, external solutions that were used contained (in mM): 150 NMDGCl or NaCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 HEPES pH 7.4. Increasing concentrations (1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 μM, 10 μM, 100 μM) of amiloride, phenamil mesylate, or benzamil were added to the solution containing 150 mM NaCl. The macroscopic ENaC current was determined as the blocker-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup>-current that was blocked by 100 μM amiloride, phenamil mesylate, or benzamil. To determine the voltage sensitivity of each blocker, steps of +20 mV, from a starting holding potential at −60 mV up to 0 mV was performed for each experiment and the IC<sub>50</sub> was determined for each voltage step (−60 mV, −40 mV, −20 mV and 0 mV). All recording experiments were repeated independently five times.</p><p>For whole cell patch clamp experiments to determine the effect of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7B1, current amplitudes were measured before and after addition of 100 nM of 7B1 for 3 min. Cells were then washed with buffer before application of trypsin (5 μg/mL) for 5 min to increase amiloride-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> currents. Post treatment with trypsin, cells were incubated with mAb 7B1 at a final concentration of 100 nM for 3 min. The amiloride-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup>-current was recorded before and after incubation with mAb.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank L Vaskalis for help with figure design.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sriram Subramaniam as Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lawrence Palmer (Reviewer #1); Erhu Cao (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Since each of the reviewers emphasized distinct points in their comments, we are enclosing them individually.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a follow-up to a paper published in 2018 that reported the first atomic-level structure of ENaC. The authors report results from a full-length channel construct, as opposed to the truncated subunits previously used. Furthermore the new construct can be proteolytically cleaved, permitting the study of an important regulatory process. The new structure has increased resolution in the extracellular aspects of the protein, allowing conclusions to be drawn regarding subunit assembly. The work explains why the channel is a heterotrimer, and why the preferred arrangement of subunits in a counter clockwise direction. A possible site of interaction of extracellular Na with the channel is identified. These are significant advances that should be of interest to the field.</p><p>I have a number of suggestions for revision.</p><p>1) The new structure includes the cytoplasmic domains of the channel subunit, but nothing is said about them. Presumably they are not sufficiently resolved but this should be stated explicitly.</p><p>2) The Na binding site is a major part of the story. The density map showing this site should be shown as a part of Figure 3, to convince the reader that the density ascribed to Na is real. Furthermore, the position of this site within the whole channel structure should be illustrated.</p><p>3) The identification of this site with the Na self-inhibition process cannot be made definitively at this point. Although the authors question the ion selectivity of this site, the original description of the phenomenon (Fuchs, Larsen and Lindemann, 1977) defines it as the response to replacing K with Na, implying strong selectivity between these ions. If this is the true site at which Na inhibits its own conductance, one would expect either a change in ion binding or a change in structure when K replaces Na in the medium. If this experiment cannot be done I suggest that the conclusions be softened.</p><p>4) In Figure 5, the conclusions rest on a structure from a small fraction (~10%) of channels. This is surprising since the Western blot in Figure 1—figure supplement 4D seems to show that most of the α subunits are in the cleaved state. I also wonder about the identification of the bands in this blot. To what part of the subunit does the antibody bind? How can it recognize both cleavage fragments? Please state the sources of the antibodies.</p><p>5) Figure 8 was not helpful to me in understanding the proposed mechanism. It should be improved or dropped.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Noreng and colleague investigates the assembly and activation/inhibition mechanism of the human epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). The channel is activated via proteolysis on their extracellular domains. Using cryo-EM, the authors obtained maps of the entire protein as well as partially cleaved channels. Based on these, they were able to proposed a model of the hetero-trimeric assembly of the channel, a sodium binding site and mechanism of inhibition by peptides. These results are significant contributions to the ENaC field. While the experiments were done carefully, the presentation of the results in the manuscript is somewhat difficult to follow. Significant clarification and modification are required before its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The nomenclatures of the structural elements in subunits are confusing. While the three protein subunits are already named α, β and γ, the structural elements in all the subunits are again called α1 and β6, etc. αGly225 is obviously in the α-subunit, but α1, α2, β6 and β7 appear in many places in the text without defining which subunit they belong to, making the text difficult to follow.</p><p>2) The number of possible conformations after partial proteolysis is unclear. The three protein subunits can be cleaved, twice, once and once, respectively. Therefore, the possible number of their states are 3 (α: 0, 1, 2 cuts), 2 (β: 0, 1) and 2 (γ: 0, 1), respectively. The total number of their possible combinations is 12 even if the order of cleavage at the two α sites are not considered. Explanations are needed to show why only 4 conformations are considered (subsection “Investigation of the GRIP domains”, second paragraph).</p><p>3) The data presentation for cryo-EM data collection and processing in Table 1 in inadequate. Instead of software used, more details on data processing and model refinement should be included.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Noreng et al. report a 3 Å resolution structure of the ENaC channel. With greatly improved resolution than the previous structure determined by the same group, the authors can now define the molecular mechanisms that underlie the assembly of the triheteromeric ENaC channel. Moreover, they were also able to visualize an inhibitory Na<sup>+</sup> binding site within the α subunit that is known to play crucial roles in the regulation of ENaC activity. The structure also revealed the GRIP domain that confers channel activation upon cleavage by proteases. Overall, although structure of the transmembrane domain that harbors the ion conduction pathway is yet to be determined, these findings represent an important step toward understanding the structure-function relationship of the ENaC channel.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59038.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I have a number of suggestions for revision.</p><p>1) The new structure includes the cytoplasmic domains of the channel subunit, but nothing is said about them.

The HG motif is found in all ENaC/Degenerin family members and is critical for ENaC function. With better methods for isolating ENaC with stable TMD and CD in addition to further improvement of sample preparation, we hope to resolve the full channel to understand the mechanistic link between removal of inhibitory peptides in the ECD and channel gating.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Na binding site is a major part of the story.

This panel is now Figure 3A. In this new panel, we have also added a label to show the putative cation site. Furthermore, we have modified the panel, now Figure 3B, showing the α subunit β6- β7 loop electrostatic potential. We have removed the sphere representation from the model to emphasize the presence of the map feature we observe in the 3D map of ENaC<sub>FL</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The identification of this site with the Na self-inhibition process cannot be made definitively at this point.

Obtaining the structure of ENaC where Na<sup>+</sup> is replaced by K<sup>+</sup> is important in order to determine whether there is a change in ion binding and/or structural change in absence of Na<sup>+</sup>. This experiment cannot be done within a reasonable time frame, but we are committed to future studies addressing these concerns. We have modified the text to read, “We speculate that this map feature is a cation, perhaps a Na<sup>+</sup> ion, based on the surrounding residues, the above-mentioned functional studies, and the presence of high Na<sup>+</sup> (150 mM) during purification (Figure 3B). […] Indeed, definitive identification of this feature as the Na<sup>+</sup> self-inhibition site would require resolving the structure of ENaC in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> and determining if there are any associated structural changes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 5, the conclusions rest on a structure from a small fraction (~10%) of channels.

Please state the sources of the antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this concern. The polyclonal antibodies used to detect the different ENaC subunit bands are as follows: αENaC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, SC-21012), βENaC (ABclonal, A-1765), and γENaC (ABclonal A15097). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows a schematic that demonstrates the epitope for the α subunit polyclonal antibody ENaC, SC-21012, based on the information provided by the vendor.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of human ENaC-α subunit (hENaC-α).</title><p>The two furin sites are illustrated as white dotted lines.

Additionally, we have updated the Materials and methods section to include the sources of all polyclonal antibodies that were used in each Western blot experiment, as well as updated the figure legend of Figure 7—figure supplement 1 where we also used polyclonal antibodies to detect α and γ subunits.</p><p>We have also added in the text to provide three possible reasons for the results of the Western blot and focused classification experiments. It reads, “While on the one hand the Western blot analysis showed a large population of cleaved α subunit, on the other hand, the focused classification analysis demonstrated a small population of the fully cleaved class. […] Thus, the population of particles used for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses is not the same as the population used for focused classification. Nevertheless, implementing focused classification resulted in 3D maps that demonstrate differences in map features in the GRIP domain.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 8 was not helpful to me in understanding the proposed mechanism.

The use of either ENaC domains or specific α helices and β strands within each ENaC subunit creates difficulties when reading the text. To improve clarity, we have defined the different domains in the text (Results). Furthermore, we have modified the text so when referring to interactions within subunit interfaces we either refer to the ENaC subunit and α helix (for example, γ-α1 helix refer to the α1 helix in the γ subunit), or refer to the specific residues directly (βVal474). Additionally, we have labeled the residues in Figure 1 to provide more clarity. We have also added the secondary structure terms “helix” or “strand” after “α” or “β,” respectively, to refer to the structural elements within ENaC subunits. All these changes have been added throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The number of possible conformations after partial proteolysis is unclear. The three protein subunits can be cleaved, twice, once and once, respectively. Therefore, the possible number of their states are 3 (α: 0, 1, 2 cuts), 2 (β: 0, 1) and 2 (γ: 0, 1), respectively. The total number of their possible combinations is 12 even if the order of cleavage at the two α sites are not considered. Explanations are needed to show why only 4 conformations are considered (subsection “Investigation of the GRIP domains”, second paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We have modified the text to clearly explain the basis of our approach. First, we have added a sentence to clearly state that the β subunit does not have any protease sites. It now states, “Of note, the β subunit does not have canonical protease sites.” This information is once again mentioned, “The first structure of ENaC, referred to as ΔENaC which comprised of subunits with truncated amino and carboxy termini and other mutations in the ECD, demonstrated that all GRIP domains, including the protease-insensitive βGRIP, adopt similar anti-parallel β strand architecture (Noreng et al., 2018).”</p><p>In terms of conformational states, we would like to clarify that our goal for implementing focused classification is to identify the different cleavage states, not conformational states. We, thus, looked for presence or absence of the inhibitory peptide. Once cleavage states were identified, we proceeded to ask whether there were detectable conformational changes, which in this current study, we were unable to measure. We have added in the text, “Using focused classification, we aimed to identify the different cleavage states – absence or presence of the inhibitory peptide – that our SDS-PAGE analysis suggests to exist.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data presentation for cryo-EM data collection and processing in Table 1 in inadequate. Instead of software used, more details on data processing and model refinement should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that the cryo-EM data collection and processing may appear inadequate. The table of the data processing and model refinement follows standard table configurations for cryo-EM data processing. However, we agree that information of model building contain less details. We have, thus, included additional lines in our table (initial model: 6BQN, Non-hydrogen atoms: 11,740, Ligands (Na, NAG): 1,10, Rotamer outliers: 0.84%) (see Table 2). We also included more details to explain the data processing strategy in the figure legends of Figure 1—figure supplements 2 and 3. The description provides more detailed information as to how we obtained the final cryo-EM map of ENaC<sub>FL</sub>. The revised figure legends are as follows:</p><p>“Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Cryo-EM initial data processing workflow. […] The sixth class was further classified by 2D classification to recover true-positive ENaC<sub>FL</sub> classes, and added to a final stack of 315,477 particles.”</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 3. Cryo-EM data processing for the final map. […] This refined particle stack was also imported to cisTEM 1.0.0, classified by 2D classification, before final 3D refinement of 248,079 particles resulted in a cryo-EM map at a resolution of 3.11 Å (solvent-adjusted FSC).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
