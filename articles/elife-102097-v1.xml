This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological, environmental, and dynamic single-cell features. BEHAV3D-TP integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers without advanced computational expertise to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data from mouse models. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>image analysis</kwd><kwd>confocal microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Veni fellowship by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09150161910076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zomer</surname><given-names>Anoek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0472cxd90</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>804412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rios</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0537dnd74</institution-id><institution>Leonardo Grant for Scientific Research and Cultural Creation, BBVA Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LEO23-2-10305-BBM-BAS-144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alieva</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>V FERO ASEICA Research Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFERO2024.04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alieva</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/040scgh75</institution-id><institution>Comunidad de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022-T1/BMD-24021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alieva</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler enables researchers without computational expertise to uncover heterogeneous cell behaviors and explore their relationships with microenvironmental features in intravital microscopy data.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer is a complex disease driven by a sequence of genetic and microenvironmental changes. As a result, tumors comprise many different cell populations that are in constant evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vitale et al., 2021</xref>). This tumor heterogeneity has important biological and clinical implications as it differentially promotes key characteristics of individual cancer cells, including proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lawson et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, we are far from fully understanding all the dynamic and bi-directional interactions in heterogeneous tumors, and how these interactions influence cancer cell behavior at the single-cell level. Emerging single-cell technologies and analysis tools provide a new opportunity to profile individual cells within tumors. For example, recent spatial transcriptomic and proteomic profiling provides evidence for the existence of multiple distinct microenvironmental niches within one tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elhanani et al., 2023</xref>). However, these techniques can only provide static information and make use of thin tissue sections that are only one cell layer thick. To investigate the real-time behavior of individual cells, intravital microscopy (IVM) has been developed to study tumor cell behavior evolution over time but also in their three-dimensional native tissue environment.</p><p>IVM is a technique used to capture both spatial and temporal information at a single-cell level in living animals. Over the past years, it has provided many new insights into the dynamics of tumor heterogeneity and the development of therapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scheele et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Entenberg et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alieva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alieva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alieva and Rios, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zomer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alieva et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janssen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croci et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zomer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zomer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). For example, intravital imaging of mouse breast cancer models revealed that only a small portion of tumor cells is motile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), and that fast- and slow-migrating cells are present in distinct regions of the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alieva et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bayarmagnai et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, additional heterogeneity exists among migrating tumor cells that can, for instance, move randomly or directionally relative to other tumor cells and/or surrounding healthy tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alieva et al., 2019</xref>). However, traditional IVM analyses have considered cancer cells or the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a homogeneous population, thereby ignoring heterogeneity at the single-cell level and the influence of the local microenvironment, where interactions between neighboring cells may affect cellular behavior. To address these complexities, recent studies have used unbiased approaches using morpho-kinetic parameters derived from live in vitro <italic>(</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shannon et al., 2024</xref>) or in vivo imaging to classify cells and explore the single-cell behavioral landscape as an additional omic layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crainiciuc et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekkers et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Freckmann et al., 2022</xref>). In line with this concept of characterizing cellular dynamic properties for cell classification, we have previously developed an analytical platform termed BEHAV3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekkers et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alieva et al., 2024</xref>) allowing us to perform behavioral phenotyping of engineered T cells targeting cancer. While BEHAV3D was initially developed to analyze T cell migratory behavior under controlled in vitro conditions, we sought to expand its application to investigate tumor cell behaviors in IVM data, where the complexity of the TME presents distinct analytical challenges. This manuscript builds on our foundational work but represents a significant advancement by adapting the pipeline specifically for IVM datasets.</p><p>While significant efforts have been made to develop open-source segmentation and tracking tools for live imaging data, including IVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pizzagalli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pizzagalli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joseph et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Molina-Moreno et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hidalgo-Cenalmor et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ershov et al., 2022</xref>), fewer tools exist for the unbiased analysis of tumor dynamics. One major barrier is that implementing such analytical methods often requires substantial computational expertise, limiting accessibility for many biomedical researchers conducting IVM experiments. To bridge this gap, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP) by providing a robust, user-friendly tool that allows researchers to extract meaningful insights from dynamic cellular behaviors without requiring advanced programming skills. BEHAV3D-TP expands the capabilities of BEHAV3D by incorporating key features designed for in vivo tumor cell dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The pipeline includes extensions that integrate tumor cell behavior with spatial features within the native TME, using either in situ (IVM) or fixed correlative imaging to reveal how distinct spatial niches influence tumor dynamics.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler pipeline.</title><p>Schematic representation of the workflow showing data preparation, input, and outputs in each of the three modules.

Our approach allowed us to observe associations between DMG cell migration behavior and specific microenvironmental factors, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature, by visualizing TME components either during or after IVM. In our study, we specifically focused on cancer cell migration as a specific feature of DMG, but our methodology could easily be extended to other cancer cell behaviors such as intravasation or metastatic colonization. Overall, BEHAV3D-TP provides an accessible computational approach for a better understanding of tumor-TME crosstalk and the functional implications of this communication in heterogeneous tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler: an accessible tool for mapping heterogeneity in tumor dynamics</title><p>To comprehensively map and analyze the dynamic heterogeneity of tumor cells within their TME, we developed BEHAV3D-TP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/imAIgene-Dream3D/BEHAV3D_Tumor_Profiler">https://github.com/imAIgene-Dream3D/BEHAV3D_Tumor_Profiler</ext-link>). To enhance accessibility and encourage widespread adoption among researchers studying single tumor cell dynamics in live imaging and inspired by previous work on democratizing advanced image analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hidalgo-Cenalmor et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gómez-de-Mariscal et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Von Chamier et al., 2021</xref>), we designed BEHAV3D-TP as a modular Jupyter Notebook featuring an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). The platform runs directly in a web browser and requires only a Google account for access. BEHAV3D-TP implementation within the Google Colaboratory (Colab) framework not only ensures efficient cloud-based computation with free and scalable resources but also enhances tool accessibility by eliminating the need for local software installation, a common barrier for inexperienced users. Regardless of programming proficiency, users can navigate the computational pipeline to extract comprehensive insights into tumor dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). After time-lapse image file processing and preparation using various frameworks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), the central component of BEHAV3D-TP — called the <italic>heterogeneity module</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) — enables researchers to uncover diverse patterns of tumor morphodynamic behavior. Additionally, we provide two extension modules—the <italic>large-scale phenotyping module</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) and the <italic>small-scale phenotyping module</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>)— which integrate tumor cell behavior identified with the <italic>heterogeneity module</italic> with TME features based on different data types. The <italic>large-scale phenotyping</italic> module uses post-IVM fixed imaging data for tissue phenotyping, identifying extensive regions with specific TME characteristics, and assessing the distribution of distinct tumor cell behavioral patterns within these regions. The <italic>small-scale phenotyping</italic> module uses in situ-labeled TME structures from IVM data, facilitating the correlation of these TME features within the microenvironment of individual tumor cell neighborhoods. Both modules, in conjunction with the <italic>heterogeneity</italic> module, help to identify how different aspects of the TME influence distinct behavioral patterns of tumor cells.</p><p>To evaluate the capability of the BEHAV3D-TP <italic>heterogeneity module</italic> in identifying diverse morphodynamic cell patterns, we applied it to IVM datasets from various tumor and healthy models.

BEHAV3D-TP provided a more granular characterization of these behaviors, uncovering additional migratory patterns not reported in the original study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b–c</xref>). Specifically, we identified behaviors such as <italic>Fast</italic>, <italic>Intermediate</italic>, <italic>Very slow,</italic> and <italic>Static</italic> that had a different distribution among both tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d–e</xref>).</p><p>To further assess the versatility of BEHAV3D-TP, we applied it to 2D IVM data of terminal end buds (TEB) from healthy mammary gland tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dawson et al., 2024</xref>). This dataset features confetti-labeled epithelial cell types and was analyzed using maximum intensity projections of multiple z planes showing cell morphology changes. As described in the original publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dawson et al., 2024</xref>), cell segmentation was performed with Cellpose 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pachitariu and Stringer, 2022</xref>) within the MaSCOT-AI workflow, followed by tracking using the TrackMate plugin in Fiji (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). This workflow not only confirmed the compatibility of BEHAV3D-TP with advanced segmentation frameworks but also its usage to unravel distinct morphodynamic patterns in non-tumor epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b and c</xref>). Consistent with previous findings that HR +TEB (Pr-cre/Confetti) exhibit greater migratory capacity than HR- TEB (Elf5-rtTA/TetO-Cre/Confetti), our analysis suggests that this difference is primarily driven by a distinct morphodynamic behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c and d</xref>). Specifically, HR +TEB more frequently exhibited characteristics of Cluster 2, defined by a rounder shape and increased motility. Despite the small sample size requiring further validation, these results demonstrate BEHAV3D-TP’s ability to uncover complex, multiparametric cellular behaviors that are often missed in analyses focused on single-value comparisons across conditions.</p><p>We next tested BEHAV3D-TP with a 3D image processing pipeline applied to IVM data from adult glioma (GBM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alieva et al., 2019</xref>). In this case, cells were segmented using μSAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Archit et al., 2025</xref>), a deep-learning foundation model adapted for microscopy data (Segment Anything for Microscopy), and subsequently tracked with TrackMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ershov et al., 2022</xref>) Fiji plugin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>). BEHAV3D-TP identified distinct GBM morphodynamic patterns, each characterized by unique combinations of morphological and dynamic features and associated with specific spatial distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b–d</xref>). Cluster 1, consisting of large and slow-moving cells, was more isolated and located farther from neighboring cells compared to Cluster 6 (small, fast, persistent cells) and Cluster 4 (very small, static cells). These findings suggest that the compact spatial arrangement of small cells within the tumor may contribute to their reduced size.</p><p>Collectively, these findings underscore the versatility and broad applicability of BEHAV3D-TP across diverse biological systems, dimensionalities (2D and 3D), imaging modalities, and data processing pipelines, supporting its utility as a robust tool for the in-depth analysis of cellular behavioral patterns in IVM data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of highly heterogeneous in vivo cell behavior displayed by DMGs</title><p>We then applied our platform to get insights into the behavioral heterogeneity among pediatric DMG tumors, characterized by a highly invasive nature. We implanted mice with patient-derived DMG cells expressing H2BmNeonGreen marker and performed IVM for up to 5.4 hr upon tumor development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We tracked intravitally imaged DMG cells from different mice using Imaris, a commercial software widely adapted by the IVM community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dawson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jung et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crainiciuc et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chauveau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kienle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jarade et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Persson et al., 2022</xref>) for its intuitive 3D visualization and analysis capabilities. In each imaged position, we evaluated not only the dynamic characteristics of individual DMG cells but also their spatial relationship to the tumor edge, which was delineated using Imaris Surface module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, see Methods). Next, to untangle the complexity of tumor cell dynamics in an unbiased manner, we used the BEHAV3D-TP <italic>heterogeneity module,</italic> implementing multiparametric single-cell time-series classification to identify distinct single-cell behavioral patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). For this, we used kinetic parameters, including displacement, speed, persistence, and movement direction relative to the tumor edge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), followed by dimensionality reduction to classify cells. The BEHAV3D-TP <italic>heterogeneity module</italic> identified 7 DMG behavioral clusters: <italic>retreating</italic>, <italic>slow retreating</italic>, <italic>erratic</italic>, <italic>static</italic>, <italic>slow</italic>, <italic>slow invading,</italic> and <italic>invading</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). To accurately describe each of the clusters, we analyzed their most predominant features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) and back-projected the cluster information into the original time-lapse to visually inspect cell behavior in relation to the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Of particular interest were cells from the <italic>invading</italic> and <italic>retreating</italic> clusters, characterized by fast movement away from and towards the tumor edge, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). In fact, in this particular DMG model, approximately 10% of the cancer cells were displaying <italic>invasive</italic> behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>), in line with the intrinsic infiltrative nature of DMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Ineveld et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, about another 10% of DMG cells were moving back to the tumor edge (<italic>retreating</italic>, <italic>slow retreating</italic> clusters; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>), behavior that has been previously observed for glioblastoma and suggested to be regulated by differential chemotactic signaling by the tumor edge and the surrounding brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alieva et al., 2019</xref>). We also observed <italic>erratic</italic> cells that display fast non-directed migration behavior and <italic>static</italic> cells that are non-migratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–f</xref>). Crucially, the distinct behavioral patterns were detected in all intravitally imaged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>), ruling out any sample bias that might lead to clusters consisting solely of cells from a single tumor or mouse.

We selected microenvironmental components of interest, such as perivascular niches and glial cells, as they have been previously reported to play an important role in the invasive behavior of glioblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alieva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seano and Jain, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ravin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gupta et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nimmerjahn et al., 2004</xref>). Specifically, intravitally imaged brains were collected immediately after the IVM imaging sessions and were fixed and stained for blood vessels (CD31), oligodendrocytes (Olig2), and tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMM; Iba1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Subsequent CytoMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Winkler et al., 2009</xref>) spatial phenotyping analysis identified three different environmental niches: <italic>Void</italic> regions (less vascularized and with low glial infiltration), <italic>TAMM/oligo</italic> regions (enriched in oligodendrocytes, TAMM, and tumor cells), and <italic>TAMM/vascularized</italic> regions (highly vascularized regions enriched in TAMM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a-c</xref>). To investigate the heterogeneity of tumor cell behavior in relation to the identified microenvironmental niches, BEHAV3D-TP <italic>large-scale phenotyping module</italic> mapped the different niches (<italic>Void</italic>, <italic>TAMM/Oligo</italic>, and <italic>TAMM/vascularized</italic>) identified by CytoMAP onto 3D intravital imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3c</xref>). In the TME-defined IVM-imaged positions, we compared the frequencies of the different behavioral clusters that we identified with the BEHAV3D-TP <italic>heterogeneity</italic> module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>invading</italic> cells were more abundant in <italic>TAMM/vascularized</italic> regions compared to <italic>Void</italic> regions that contain a higher proportion of <italic>static</italic> cells, and <italic>TAMM/Oligo</italic> microenvironments contain more <italic>slow retreating</italic> cells compared to the other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Finally, we compared the results obtained with BEHAV3D-TP to a more classical IVM analysis approach that relies on assessing single dynamic parameters. Interestingly, single parameters showed a restricted ability to identify differences in cellular behavior among various environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e–g</xref>), underscoring the importance of multiparametric behavioral mapping in revealing more nuanced cellular behavior that cannot be captured solely by individual dynamic parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Linkage of in vivo tumor cell behavior to the composition of the microenvironment at a single-cell level</title><p>With the goal of further refining TME phenotyping to better understand tumor cell behavior determinants, we implemented an alternative approach using the BEHAV3D-TP <italic>small-scale phenotyping module</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4a</xref>). This module utilizes the detection of TME components during IVM to offer insights into their abundance and spatial relationship with DMG cells at a single-cell level. It complements the <italic>heterogeneity module</italic>, which captures tumor cell behavioral profiles and offers two options of integration: (1) <italic>upstream integration</italic>, where TME-derived spatial features—such as proximity or interactions with specific components—are used as input variables for clustering tumor cells; and (2) <italic>downstream integration</italic>, where previously defined behavioral clusters are correlated with TME spatial features in a subsequent analytical step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4a</xref>). When using the upstream integration approach, it is essential to include only biologically meaningful features, as the presence of irrelevant or redundant variables can introduce noise and compromise the interpretability of the resulting clusters.</p><p>For in vivo TME labeling, we injected mice with an anti-CD31-AF647 antibody to label blood vessels, and with either SR101, a fluorescent marker known to label oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Appaix et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rasmussen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagos and Hülsmann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), or CD20r, a novel molecule described to label microglial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>). This allowed us to measure spatial TME characteristics of each single DMG cell, such as minimal distance to a certain TME component, the number of these cell types in a certain radius, or the cell density for this particular cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We applied option 2 of the BEHAV3D-TP <italic>small-scale phenotyping module</italic> to explore the local TME context of distinct behavioral DMG clusters, revealing substantial microenvironmental heterogeneity across clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Compared to <italic>static</italic> cells, <italic>invading</italic> cells tended to be more sparsely distributed relative to neighboring DMG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>), consistent with their invasive behavior into the brain parenchyma. In agreement with our large-scale TME phenotyping results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), <italic>invading</italic> DMG cells were found to reside in regions enriched with TAMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Specifically, a higher proportion of <italic>invading</italic> cells were in close proximity to TAMMs compared to <italic>static</italic>, <italic>retreating</italic>, and <italic>slow-retreating</italic> clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). They frequently migrated directionally toward TAMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>), suggesting that migration of this behavioral cluster is at least partially mediated by chemotaxis. Furthermore, all fast-migrating behavioral clusters (<italic>invading</italic>, <italic>erratic,</italic> and <italic>retreating</italic>) were found to be generally closer to blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and e</xref>), suggesting that perivascular invasion is a more efficient movement route for these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), a mode of migration that has been previously observed for adult glioblastoma cells as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alieva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ravin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gupta et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nimmerjahn et al., 2004</xref>).

Altogether, these data demonstrate the power of our BEHAV3D-TP pipeline in correlating single-cell tumor cell behavior to its local environment, with an important opportunity to identify novel environmental regulators of invasion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we provide a new user-friendly platform tailored for IVM single tumor cell dynamics analysis, termed BEHAV3D-TP, aiming to better understand the mechanisms underlying tumor heterogeneity. In contrast to traditional pipelines that rely on the analysis of single parameters such as cell speed or displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Venkataramani et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bera et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gertler and Condeelis, 2011</xref>) or that use an artificial threshold to assign a specific behavior to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alieva et al., 2017</xref>), BEHAV3D-TP is an unbiased approach based on the integration of multiple parameters measured by IVM. Using the <italic>heterogeneity module</italic> of our BEHAV3D-TP pipeline, we uncovered behavioral phenotypes that have not been described before and that could not have been identified using single parameter analysis. For example, our analysis revealed <italic>invading</italic> and <italic>retreating</italic> clusters, composed of cells with a similar cell speed but with an opposite migration direction, an important biological and clinical difference. Likely, bidirectional migration is mediated by different chemotactic cues and by the composition of the local TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kluiver et al., 2020</xref>). It is of vital importance for DMG and other cancer patients to better understand the biology underlying the different behavioral phenotypes, especially concerning <italic>invading</italic> cells that are difficult to therapeutically target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quail and Joyce, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies suggest a major role for the microenvironment in promoting tumor cell spread into the healthy brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taylor and Monje, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erices et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patel et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, using the complementary <italic>large-</italic> and <italic>small-scale TME phenotyping modules</italic> of BEHAV3D-TP, we identified substantial differences in the TME composition of the different behavioral DMG clusters. Our results also show that the small-scale TME analysis has a higher predictive value compared to the large-scale TME analysis, suggesting that a cell’s direct microenvironment is a more important regulator of its behavior compared to its macroenvironment. Future experiments directed towards identifying more TME components, for example using multispectral LSR-3D imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Van Ineveld et al., 2021</xref>), could therefore further refine the <italic>large-scale phenotyping module</italic> by detecting subregion heterogeneity.</p><p>IVM enables simultaneous labeling of various TME components and allows real-time investigation of their association with tumor cell behavior. Indeed, we found that TAMMs and blood vessels were associated with specific behavioral phenotypes, showing the power of BEHAV3D-TP <italic>small-scale phenotyping module</italic> in identifying novel regulators of cellular behavior. This is exemplified by our finding that <italic>slow-retreating</italic> DMG cells were found in environments enriched for SR101<sup>+</sup> cells, an observation that has not been made before. To take further advantage of BEHAV3D-TP, future work should be directed toward identifying more TME components, including cells of the adaptive immune system. For example, it would be interesting to use our pipeline on recently developed immunocompetent mouse models of DMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Du Chatinier et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Srivastava et al., 2023</xref>), or in mice with a humanized immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wezenaar et al., 2025</xref>). While our findings suggest that microenvironmental factors may influence tumor cell migration, further studies will be necessary to establish causal relationships. Additional experimental validation, such as macrophage ablation experiments, could help clarify the specific contributions of these factors.</p><p>While our current study does not provide direct functional validation of the distinct motility clusters identified, existing literature strongly supports the notion that cell dynamics can serve as a proxy for functional states and phenotypic heterogeneity. Prior work, including studies by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekkers et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aragones et al., 2024</xref>) as well as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crainiciuc et al., 2022</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Freckmann et al., 2022</xref>), has demonstrated that variations in cell motility patterns can reflect underlying functional characteristics. Specifically, cell morpho-dynamic features have been shown to correlate with differences in cell type identity, T-cell engagement, metastatic potential, and drug resistance states. This growing body of evidence suggests that tumor cell behavior, as captured by BEHAV3D-TP, may serve as a predictive tool for deciphering functional tumor heterogeneity. Future studies integrating transcriptomic or proteomic profiling of motility-defined subpopulations could further elucidate the biological significance of these behavioral phenotypes.</p><p>In addition to motility-based classification, features such as tumor cell morphology, proliferation state, and interactions with the TME can further refine tumor phenotyping. BEHAV3D-TP allows for the selection of diverse feature types, supporting datasets that include both dynamic, morphological, spatial, and environmental parameters. However, we recognize that expanding the feature set may introduce biologically irrelevant noise, particularly in 3D microscopy data where limited z-axis resolution can lead to morphological artifacts. This highlights the potential need in the future to include unbiased feature selection strategies, such as bootstrapping methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klein et al., 2010</xref>), to ensure the identification of meaningful and biologically relevant parameters. Careful consideration of these aspects is key to maximizing the interpretability and predictive value of analyses performed with BEHAV3D-TP.</p><p>To enhance the accessibility of BEHAV3D-TP for researchers keen on studying tumor cell behavioral profiles through live imaging, we have incorporated our software in a Google Colab notebook, allowing researchers with minimal programming skills to employ the tool online without the requirement to install specific software environments nor the need to directly interact with the code. The user can easily install the necessary dependencies, set up the working environment, process datasets, and adjust parameters without requiring deep coding skills. Google Colab provides the necessary computational resources to be able to run the pipeline without demanding a powerful local machine. However, there are RAM usage and runtime limitations that could affect the analysis, given a big enough dataset in the free version of Google Colab. Given this and data privacy concerns, the workflow can also be run locally via a Jupyter Notebook that can be downloaded from the Google Colab notebook. Aligned with the goals of BEHAV3D-TP, other methods utilizing the Google Colab framework are emerging, such as CellTracksColab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gómez-de-Mariscal et al., 2023</xref>), which is a general tool for tracking data analysis. While CellTracksColab offers valuable insights into tracking data, BEHAV3D-TP is specifically designed for IVM data and includes additional features. These features include directionality metrics crucial for invasion studies, detailed analysis of identified behavioral populations, data back-projection, and correlation of these behaviors with both large-scale and small-scale TME features. This comprehensive approach provides a deeper understanding of the TME drivers behind intratumoral heterogeneity, making BEHAV3D-TP a robust tool for researchers investigating the complex behaviors of tumor cells in their natural environments. BEHAV3D-TP supports a broad range of data formats, including those generated by commercial Imaris and by open-source Fiji plugins such as TrackMate, MTrackJ, and ManualTracking, increasing the tool’s applicability to researchers using both commercial and open-source pipelines.</p><p>In summary, BEHAV3D-TP allows getting insights into the heterogeneity of tumor cell migration behavior in an accessible way; however, it would be exciting to extend the application to other behaviors, such as cell division or therapy response to study TME-mediated drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal material</title><p>NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (France).

The ‘Label Image Detector’ was employed to identify individual cells, and the LAP Tracker was used to link cells across timeframes. Tracking parameters were optimized to account for missing frames and ensure accurate cell trajectories. The statistics for each tracked cell were subsequently exported. To integrate both dynamic and morphological data, a custom script was developed to merge the dynamic information from TrackMate with the morphological data obtained from the μSAM segmentation labels for each individual cell. This integration was achieved by assigning the ‘TRACK_ID’ from the TrackMate ‘allspots’ output file to each segmented instance extracted from the TIFF file.

For tracked tumor cells, time-lapse data containing the coordinates of each cell, the values of cell speed, mean square displacement, displacement delta length, displacement length, and relative distance to ‘Tumor edge’ were used to calculate a cross-distance matrix between time series.

For each tumor cell and each environmental component, the number of microenvironmental objects in a 30 µm radius and the distance to the closest object were computed. For each behavioral cluster, the values of closest neighbors, minimal distance to each environmental factor, and number of environmental objects in the 30 µm radius were plotted and compared. To quantify the percentage of DMG cells in proximity to CD20r<sup>+</sup> TAMMs, we classified cells located within 15  µm of TAMM surfaces as ‘close’. For proximity to blood vessels, DMG cells were considered ‘close’ if they were within 3  µm of blood vessel spots. The difference in distance thresholds reflects the nature of the reference objects: while TAMMs are defined by ‘Surface’ boundaries, blood vessels were represented by smaller centroid-based ‘Spots’, necessitating a more stringent cutoff.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using R.

A key strength is that it is designed as an open-source modular Jupyter Notebook with a user-friendly graphical user interface and can be implemented with Google Colab, facilitating efficient, cloud-based computational analysis at no cost. In addition, demo datasets are available on the authors GitHub repository to aid user training and enhance the usability of the developed pipeline.</p><p>To demonstrate the utility of BEHAV3D-TP, they apply the pipeline to timelapse IVM imaging datasets to investigate the in vivo migratory behaviour of fluorescently labelled DMG cells in tumour bearing mice. Using the tool's 'heterogeneity module' they were able to identify distinct single-cell behavioural patterns (based on multiple parameters such as directionality, speed, displacement, distance from tumour edge) which was used to group cells into distinct categories (e.g. retreating, invasive, static, erratic). They next applied the framework's 'large-scale phenotyping' and 'small-scale phenotyping' modules to investigate whether the tumour microenvironment (TME) may influence the distinct migratory behaviours identified. To achieve this, they combine TME visualisation in vivo during IVM (using fluorescent probes to label distinct TME components) or ex vivo after IVM (by large-scale imaging of harvested, immunostained tumours) to correlate different tumour behavioural patterns with the composition of the TME. They conclude that this tool has helped reveal links between TME composition (e.g. degree of vascularisation, presence of tumour-associated macrophages) and the invasiveness and directionality of tumour cells, which would have been challenging to identify when analysing single kinetic parameters in isolation.</p><p>While the analysis provides only preliminary evidence in support of the authors conclusions on DMG cell migratory behaviours and their relationship with components of the tumour microenvironment, conclusions are appropriately tempered in the absence of additional experiments and controls.</p><p>The authors also evaluated the BEHAV3D TP heterogeneity module using available IVM datasets of distinct breast cancer cell lines transplanted in vivo, as well as healthy mammary epithelial cells to test its usability in non-tumour contexts where the migratory phenotypes of cells may be more subtle. This generated data is consistent with that produced during the original studies, as well as providing some additional (albeit preliminary) insights above that previously reported. Collectively, this provides some confidence in BEHAV3D TP's ability to uncover complex, multi-parametric cellular behaviours that may be missed using traditional approaches.</p><p>While the tool does not facilitate the extraction of quantitative kinetic cellular parameters (e.g. speed, directionality, persistence and displacement) from intravital images, the authors have developed their tool to facilitate the integration of other data formats generated by open-source Fiji plugins (e.g. TrackMate, MTrackJ, ManualTracking) which will help ensure its accessibility to a broader range of researchers. Overall, this computational framework appears to represent a useful and comparatively user-friendly tool to analyse dynamic multi-parametric data to help identify patterns in cell migratory behaviours, and to assess whether these behaviours might be influenced by neighbouring cells and structures in their microenvironment.</p><p>When combined with other methods, it therefore has the potential to be a valuable addition to a researcher's IVM analysis 'tool-box'.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102097.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors produce a new tool, BEHAV3D to analyse tracking data and to integrate these analyses with large and small scale architectural features of the tissue. This is similar to several other published methods to analyse spatio-temporal data, however, the connection to tissue features is a nice addition, as is the lack of requirement for coding. The tool is then used to analyse tracking data of tumour cells in diffuse midline glioma. They suggest 7 clusters exist within these tracks and that they differ spatially. They ultimately suggest that these behaviours occur in distinct spatial areas as determined by CytoMAP.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The tool appears relatively user-friendly and is open source. The combination with CytoMAP represents a nice option for researchers.</p><p>The identification of associations between cell track phenotype and spatial features is exciting and the diffuse midline glioma data nicely demonstrates how this could be used.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102097.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The manuscript by Rios-Jimenez developed a software tool, BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler, to analyze 3D intravital imaging data and identify distinctive tumor cell migratory phenotypes based on the quantified 3D image data. Moreover, the heterogeneity module in this software tool can correlate the different cell migration phenotypes with variable features of the tumor microenvironment. Overall, this is a useful tool for intravital imaging data analysis and its open-source nature makes it accessible to all interested users.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>An open-source software tool that can quantify cell migratory dynamics from intravital imaging data and identify distinctive migratory phenotypes that correlate with variable features of the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Motility is the main tumor cell feature analyzed in the study together with some other tumor-intrinsic features, such as morphology. However, these features are insufficient to characterize and identify the heterogeneity of the tumor cell population that impacts their behaviors in the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). For instance, there are important non-tumor cell types in the TME, and the interaction dynamics of tumor cells with other cell types, e.g., ﬁbroblasts and distinct immune cells, play a crucial role in regulating tumor behaviors. BEHAV3D-TP focuses on analysis of tumor-alone features, and cannot be applied to analyze important cell-cell interaction dynamics in 3D.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article

reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>In this work, Rios-Jimenez and Zomer et al have developed a 'zero-code' accessible computational framework (BEHAV3D-Tumour Profiler) designed to facilitate unbiased analysis of Intravital imaging (IVM) data to investigate tumour cell dynamics (via the tool's central 'heterogeneity module') and their interactions with the tumour microenvironment (via the 'large-scale phenotyping' and 'small-scale phenotyping' modules). A key strength is that it is designed as an open-source modular Jupyter Notebook with a user-friendly graphical user interface and can be implemented with Google Colab, facilitating efficient, cloud-based computational analysis at no cost. In addition, demo datasets are available on the authors GitHub repository to aid user training and enhance the usability of the developed pipeline.</p><p>To demonstrate the utility of BEHAV3D-TP, they apply the pipeline to timelapse IVM imaging datasets to investigate the in vivo migratory behaviour of fluorescently labelled DMG cells in tumour bearing mice. Using the tool's 'heterogeneity module' they were able to identify distinct single-cell behavioural patterns (based on multiple parameters such as directionality, speed, displacement, distance from tumour edge) which was used to group cells into distinct categories (e.g. retreating, invasive, static, erratic). They next applied the framework's 'large-scale phenotyping' and 'small-scale phenotyping' modules to investigate whether the tumour microenvironment (TME) may influence the distinct migratory behaviours identified. To achieve this, they combine TME visualisation in vivo during IVM (using fluorescent probes to label distinct TME components) or ex vivo after IVM (by large-scale imaging of harvested, immunostained tumours) to correlate different tumour behavioural patterns with the composition of the TME. They conclude that this tool has helped reveal links between TME composition (e.g. degree of vascularisation, presence of tumour-associated macrophages) and the invasiveness and directionality of tumour cells, which would have been challenging to identify when analysing single kinetic parameters in isolation.</p><p>While the analysis provides only preliminary evidence in support of the authors conclusions on DMG cell migratory behaviours and their relationship with components of the tumour microenvironment, conclusions are appropriately tempered in the absence of additional experiments and controls.</p><p>The authors also evaluated the BEHAV3D TP heterogeneity module using available IVM datasets of distinct breast cancer cell lines transplanted in vivo, as well as healthy mammary epithelial cells to test its usability in non-tumour contexts where the migratory phenotypes of cells may be more subtle. This generated data is consistent with that produced during the original studies, as well as providing some additional (albeit preliminary) insights above that previously reported.

Overall, this computational framework appears to represent a useful and comparatively user-friendly tool to analyse dynamic multi-parametric data to help identify patterns in cell migratory behaviours, and to assess whether these behaviours might be influenced by neighbouring cells and structures in their microenvironment.</p><p>When combined with other methods, it therefore has the potential to be a valuable addition to a researcher's IVM analysis 'tool-box'.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for carefully considering our manuscript and providing constructive comments. We appreciate the recognition of BEHAV3D-TP’s user-friendliness, modular design, and ability to link cell behavior with the tumor microenvironment.

Moreover, the heterogeneity module in this software tool can correlate the different cell migration phenotypes with variable features of the tumor microenvironment. Overall, this is a useful tool for intravital imaging data analysis and its open-source nature makes it accessible to all interested users.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>An open-source software tool that can quantify cell migratory dynamics from intravital imaging data and identify distinctive migratory phenotypes that correlate with variable features of the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Motility is the main tumor cell feature analyzed in the study together with some other tumor-intrinsic features, such as morphology. However, these features are insufficient to characterize and identify the heterogeneity of the tumor cell population that impacts their behaviors in the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). For instance, there are important non-tumor cell types in the TME, and the interaction dynamics of tumor cells with other cell types, e.g., ﬁbroblasts and distinct immune cells, play a crucial role in regulating tumor behaviors. BEHAV3D-TP focuses on analysis of tumor-alone features, and cannot be applied to analyze important cell-cell interaction dynamics in 3D.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful assessment and encouraging remarks regarding BEHAV3D-TP.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the concern about the tool’s current focus on motility features, we would like to clarify again that BEHAV3D-TP is designed to be highly flexible and extensible. Users can incorporate a wide range of features—including dynamic, morphological, and spatial parameters—into their analyses. In the latest revision, we have make this even more explicit by explaining that the feature selection interface allows users to either (i) directly select them for clustering or (ii) select features for correlation with clusters (See Small scale phenotyping module section in Methods).</p><p>Importantly, while our current analysis emphasizes clustering based on dynamic behaviors, Figure 4 demonstrates that these behavioral clusters are associated at the single-cell level with distinct proximities to key TME components, such as TAMMs and blood vessels. These spatial interaction features could also have been included in the clustering itself—creating dynamic-spatial clusters—but we deliberately chose not to do so. This decision was guided by established principles of feature selection: including features with unknown or potentially irrelevant variability can introduce noise and obscure biologically meaningful patterns, ultimately reducing the clarity and interpretability of the resulting clusters. Instead, we adopted a two-step approach—first identifying clusters based on core dynamic features, then examining their relationships with spatial and interaction metrics. This allowed us to reveal meaningful associations of particular cell behavior such as the invading cluster in proximity of TAMMs without overfitting or complicating the clustering model.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s point in the latest revision round, we have updated the Small-scale phenotyping module to highlight the possibility of including spatial interaction features with various TME cell types. We also revised the manuscript text and Figure 1 to clarify that these environmental features can be used both upstream as clustering input (Option 1) and for downstream analysis (Option 2), depending on the user’s experimental goals. Attached to this rebuttal letter, we also provide an additional figure illustrating these options in the feature selection panels of the Colab notebook.</p><p>In summary, while the clustering presented in this study is based on dynamic parameters, BEHAV3D-TP fully supports the integration of interaction features and other non-motility descriptors. This modularity enables users to customize their analysis pipelines according to specific biological questions, including those involving cell–cell interactions and spatial dynamics within the TME.</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Intravital microscopy (IVM) is a powerful tool that facilitates live imaging of individual cells over time in vivo in their native 3D tissue environment. Extracting and analysing multi-parametric data from IVM images however is challenging, particularly for researchers with limited programming and image analysis skills. In this work, RiosJimenez and Zomer et al have developed a 'zero-code' accessible computational framework (BEHAV3D-Tumour Profiler) designed to facilitate unbiased analysis of IVM data to investigate tumour cell dynamics (via the tool's central 'heterogeneity module') and their interactions with the tumour microenvironment (via the 'large-scale phenotyping' and 'small-scale phenotyping' modules).

A detailed step-by-step video and demo datasets are also included to support its uptake.</p><p>• The different computational modules have been tested using relevant datasets, including imaging data of normal and tumour cells in vivo.</p><p>• All code is open source, and the pipeline can be implemented with Google Colab.</p><p>• The tool combines multiple dynamic parameters extracted from timelapse IVM images to identify single-cell behavioural patterns and to cluster cells into distinct groups sharing similar behaviours, and provides avenues to map these onto in vivo or ex vivo imaging data of the tumour microenvironment</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>• The tool does not facilitate the extraction of quantitative kinetic cellular parameters (e.g. speed, directionality, persistence and displacement) from intravital images. To use the tool researchers must first extract dynamic cellular parameters from their IVM datasets using other software including Imaris, which is expensive and therefore not available to all.

The authors acknowledge this however, and conclusions are appropriately tempered in the absence of additional experiments and controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thorough and constructive assessment of our work and are pleased that the accessibility, functionality, and potential impact of BEHAV3DTumour Profiler were well received. We particularly appreciate the acknowledgment of the tool’s ease of use for researchers with limited computational expertise, the clarity of the manuscript, and the relevance of our approach for identifying multi-parametric migratory behaviours and their correlation with the tumour microenvironment.</p><p>Regarding the weaknesses raised:</p><p>(1) Lack of built-in tracking and kinetic parameter extraction – As noted in our initial revision, while we agree that integrating open-source tracking and segmentation functionality could be valuable, it is beyond the scope of the current work. Our tool is designed to focus specifically on downstream analysis of already extracted kinetic data, addressing a gap in post-processing tools for exploring complex migratory behaviour and spatial correlations. Since different experimental systems often require tailored imaging and segmentation pipelines, we believe that decoupling tracking from the downstream analysis can actually be a strength, offering greater versatility. Researchers can use their preferred or most appropriate tracking software—whether proprietary or opensource—and then analyze the resulting data with BEHAV3D-TP. To support this, we ensured compatibility with widely used tools including open-source Fiji plugins (e.g., TrackMate, MTrackJ, ManualTracking), and we also cited several relevant studies and that address the upstream processing steps. Importantly, the main aim of our tool is to fill the gap in post-tracking analysis, enabling quantitative interpretation and pattern recognition that has until now required substantial coding effort or custom solutions.</p><p>(2) Preliminary nature of the biological conclusions – We fully agree with this assessment and have explicitly acknowledged this limitation in the manuscript. Our aim was to demonstrate the utility of BEHAV3D-TP in uncovering heterogeneity and spatial associations in vivo, while encouraging further hypothesis-driven studies using complementary biological approaches. We are grateful that the reviewer recognizes the cautious interpretation of our results and their added value beyond single-parameter analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors produce a new tool, BEHAV3D to analyse tracking data and to integrate these analyses with large and small scale architectural features of the tissue.

While the statistics have been clarified within the legends and this is a great improvement in terms of clarity the underlying assumptions of the tests used are violated. The problem is that individual imaging positions or tracks are treated as independent and then analysed by ANOVA. As separate imaging positions within the same mouse are not independent, nor are individual cells within a single mouse, this makes the statistical analyses inappropriate. For a deeper analysis of this that is feasible within a review please see Lord, Samuel J., et al. &quot;SuperPlots: Communicating reproducibility and variability in cell biology.&quot; The Journal of cell biology 219.6 (2020): e202001064. Ultimately, while this is a neat piece of software facilitating the analysis of complex data, the fact that it will produce flawed statistical analysis is a major problem. This problem is compounded by the fact that much imaging analysis has been analysed in this inappropriate manner in the past, leading to issues of interpretation and ultimately reproducibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful reading and thoughtful feedback. We are encouraged by the recognition of BEHAV3D-TP’s ease of use, open-source accessibility, and the value of integrating cell behaviour with spatial features of the tissue. We appreciate the positive remarks regarding our application to diffuse midline glioma (DMG) and the potential for the tool to enable new biological insights.</p><p>We also appreciate the reviewer’s continued concern regarding the statistical treatment of the data. While we agree with the broader principle that care must be taken to avoid violating assumptions of independence, we respectfully disagree that all instances where individual tracks or imaging positions are used constitute flawed analysis. Importantly, our work is centered on characterizing heterogeneity at the single-cell level in distinct TME regions. Therefore, in certain cases—especially when comparing distinct behavioral subtypes across varying TME environments and multiple mice—it is appropriate to treat individual imaging positions as independent units. This approach is particularly relevant given our findings that large-scale TME regions differ across positions. When analyzing features such as the percentage of DMG cells in proximity to TAMMs, averaging per mouse would obscure these regional differences and reduce the resolution of biologically meaningful variation.</p><p>To address this concern further, we have revised the figure legends, main text, and documentation, carefully considering the appropriate statistical unit for each analysis. As detailed below, we used mouse-level aggregation where the experimental question required inter-mouse reproducibility, and a position-based approach where the aim was to explore intra-tumoral heterogeneity.</p><p>Figure 3d and Supplementary Figure 5d: In this analysis, we treated imaging positions as independent units because our data specifically demonstrate that, within individual mice, different positions correspond to distinct large-scale tumor microenvironment phenotypes. Therefore, averaging across the whole mouse would obscure these important spatial differences and not accurately reflect the heterogeneity we aim to characterize.</p><p>Figure 4c-e; Supplementary Figure 6d: While our initial aim was to highlight single-cell variability, we acknowledge that the original presentation may have been misleading. In the revised manuscript, we have updated the graphs for greater clarity. To quantify how often tumor cells of each behavioral type are located near TAMMs (Fig. 4c) or blood vessels (Fig. 4e), we now calculate the percentage of tumor cells &quot;close&quot; to environmental feature per behavioral cluster within each imaging position. This classification is based on the distance to the TME feature of interest and is detailed in the “Large-scale phenotyping” section of the Methods. For the number of SR101 objects in a 30um radius we averaged per position.</p><p>We treated individual imaging positions as the units of analysis rather than averaging per mouse, as our data (see Figure 2) show that positions vary in their TME phenotypes—such as Void, TAMM/Oligo, and TAMM/Vascularized—as well as in the number of TAMMs, SR101 cells or blood vessels per position. These differences are biologically meaningful and relevant to the quantification that we performed – percentage of tumor cell in close proximity to distinct TME features.</p><p>To account for inter-mouse and TME region variability, we applied a linear mixedeffects model with both mouse and TME class included as random effects.</p><p>Supplementary Figure 3d: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have averaged the distance to the 3 closest GBM neighbours per mouse, treating each mouse as an independent unit for comparison across distinct GBM morphodynamic clusters. To account for inter-mouse variability when assessing statistical significance, we employed a linear mixed model with mouse included as a random effect.</p><p>Distance to 3 neighbours is a feature not used in the clustering, thus variability between mice can be more pronounced—for example, due to differences in tumor compactness or microenvironment structure across individual mice. To appropriately account for this, mouse was included as a random effect in the model.</p><p>Supplementary Figure 4c: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we averaged cell speed per mouse, treating each mouse as an independent unit for comparison across distinct DMG behavioral clusters. Statistical significance was assessed using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. When comparing cell speed, which is a feature used in the clustering process, inter-mouse variability was already addressed during clustering itself. Therefore, in the downstream analysis of this cluster-derived feature, it is appropriate to treat each mouse as an independent unit without including mouse as a random effect.</p><p>Supplementary Figure 5e-g: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we averaged cell speed per mouse, treating each mouse as an independent unit for comparison across distinct DMG behavioral clusters. Statistical significance was assessed using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test.</p><p>Supplementary Figure 6c: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we averaged cell distance to the 10 closest DMG neighbours per mouse, treating each mouse as an independent unit for comparison across distinct DMG behavioral clusters. To account for inter-mouse variability, we used a linear mixed model with mouse included as a random effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Rios-Jimenez developed a software tool, BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler, to analyze 3D intravital imaging data and identify distinctive tumor cell migratory phenotypes based on the quantified 3D image data.

As discussed in detail in our point-by-point response to Reviewer #2, we have revised several figures to enhance clarity and statistical rigor, including Figure 4c,e; Supplementary Figures 3d, 4c, 5e–g, and 6c–d. Specifically, we adjusted how data are summarized and displayed—averaging per mouse where appropriate and clarifying the statistical methods used. Where imaging positions were retained as the unit of analysis, this decision was grounded in the biological relevance of intra-mouse spatial heterogeneity (as demonstrated in Figure 2). Additionally, we applied linear mixed-effects models in cases where inter-mouse or inter-Large scale TME regions variability needed to be accounted for. We believe these changes address the core concern about reproducibility and statistical interpretation while preserving the biological insights captured by our approach.</p></body></sub-article></article>
