Some anaerobic bacteria overcome the energetic hurdle by flavin-based electron bifurcation/confurcation (FBEB/FBEC) using a lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) in concert with the electron-transferring proteins EtfA and EtfB. The electron cryo-microscopically characterized (Ldh-EtfAB)<sub>2</sub> complex of <italic>Acetobacterium woodii</italic> at 2.43 Å resolution consists of a mobile EtfAB shuttle domain located between the rigid central Ldh and the peripheral EtfAB base units. The FADs of Ldh and the EtfAB shuttle domain contact each other thereby forming the D (dehydrogenation-connected) state. The intermediary Glu37 and Glu139 may harmonize the redox potentials between the FADs and the pyruvate/lactate pair crucial for FBEC. By integrating Alphafold2 calculations a plausible novel B (bifurcation-connected) state was obtained allowing electron transfer between the EtfAB base and shuttle FADs. Kinetic analysis of enzyme variants suggests a correlation between NAD<sup>+</sup> binding site and D-to-B-state transition implicating a 75° rotation of the EtfAB shuttle domain. The FBEC inactivity when truncating the ferredoxin domain of EtfA substantiates its role as redox relay. Lactate oxidation in Ldh is assisted by the catalytic base His423 and a metal center. On this basis, a comprehensive catalytic mechanism of the FBEC process was proposed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>electron bifurcation</kwd><kwd>bioenergetics</kwd><kwd>flavin</kwd><kwd>lactate dehydrogenase</kwd><kwd>electron-transferring flavoprotein</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012318</institution-id><institution>International Max Planck Research School for Advanced Methods in Process and Systems Engineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kayastha</surname><given-names>Kanwal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katsyv</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cryo-EM structural and functional analyses reveals the lactate dehydrogenase/electron-transferring flavoprotein (Ldh-EtfAB) in its enzymatically active form and the geometry of the confurcating flow of two energetically spitted electrons <italic>via</italic> 2 FAD and 1 [4Fe-4S] cluster to a central FAD.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anaerobic energy metabolisms frequently operate at the thermodynamic limit of life. For energy yield optimization, various microorganisms developed early in evolution an energy-coupling process termed flavin-based electron bifurcation/confurcation (FBEB/FBEC) embedded into a modular, mostly soluble enzyme complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buckel and Thauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herrmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2018</xref>). In the more familiar FBEB direction, an endergonic reduction, normally of oxidized ferredoxin (Fd<sub>ox</sub>), is driven by a simultaneous exergonic reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This two-reaction process can also proceed in the opposite direction thereby catalyzing a confurcating event. One example is the reversible bifurcating hydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katsyv et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schuchmann and Müller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schut and Adams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) that oxidizes hydrogen gas to two protons and two single split electrons; the latter are transferred to the two-electron acceptors, NAD(P)<sup>+</sup> and Fd<sub>ox</sub>. In the confurcation mode H<sub>2</sub> is produced from reduced ferredoxin (Fd<sub>red</sub>) and NAD(P)H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katsyv et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schuchmann and Müller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). As key player for energy coupling in FBEB/FBEC serves a flavin endowed with an extremely inverted one-electron redox potential implicating a very short-living FAD•<sup>–</sup> state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lubner et al., 2017</xref>). In the confurcation mode, the rate-determining endergonic reduction of FAD to FAD•<sup>–</sup> (&lt; –700 mV) by Fd<sub>red</sub> (E ≈ –500 mV) is strongly coupled with the exergonic reduction of FAD•<sup>–</sup> to FADH<sup>–</sup> (E &gt;+200 mV) by an electron originating from the high-potential (weak) electron donor (E≤0 mV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baymann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nitschke and Russell, 2012</xref>). One-electron redox potentials of E(FAD/FAD•<sup>–</sup>) = –911 mV and E(FAD•<sup>–</sup>/FADH<sup>–</sup>) = +359 mV are experimentally determined for the bifurcating NADPH dependent Fd<sub>ox</sub>:NAD<sup>+</sup> oxidoreductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lubner et al., 2017</xref>).

It involves two reduction reactions (2+3) using the same electron donor (MH) of medium redox potential and two electron acceptors (N and Fd<sub>ox</sub>) of high and low redox potential. Fd can be only replaced by flavodoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chowdhury et al., 2016</xref>). Biochemical reactions are normally characterized by a pair-wise exchange of electrons between substrates that are protonated in their reduced state. FBEB occur when the positive difference redox potential ΔE<sub>2</sub> between the strong electron acceptor (N) and the medium electron donor (MH) has a higher absolute value than the negative ΔE<sub>3</sub> between Fd<sub>ox</sub> and MH. In other words, ΔE<sub>1</sub> has to be positive resulting in a negative Gibbs free energy (ΔG = -nFΔE, n: moles of electrons exchanged, F: Faraday constant). As example, the electrochemical treatment and the thermodynamic scheme was provided for the reaction of the bifurcating Bcd-EtfAB complex, in which the b-FAD reduced by NADH endergonically donates one electron <italic>via</italic> a-FAD to d-FAD and then exergonically one electron to Fd<sub>ox</sub>.

Analysis of the EM micrographs with the aim to find a small population in the B-state failed. So far, bifurcating oxidoreductase-EtfAB complexes are only experimentally trapped in the D-state therefore considered as stable resting conformation.

The maintained NADH:DCPIP oxidoreductase activity excludes larger rearrangements of the binding site of b-FAD and thus supports the crucial importance of Arg205 for its unusual redox behavior. D189 of EtfA is 11 Å apart from b-FAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and in the B-state 4.5 and 10 Å apart from the previously proposed and AlphaFold2-calculated a-FAD position, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). The moderate 35% and 15% decrease of the FBEC and FCEC activities measured for the D189A variant rather argues for a FAD binding site farther from D189 and thus for the AlphaFold2-derived B-state.

In addition, DCPIP could not be reduced by NADH anymore but ferricyanide with lactate with a twofold lower activity (8.5±7.3 U/mg; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Altogether, the vital role of b-FAD as bifurcating flavin and of NADH as its hydride donor/acceptor was demonstrated for the EtfB family independent from structural and electrochemical interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Demmer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sucharitakul et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we exchanged the highly conserved residues S223, P224, and T225 localized at the anchor of the EtfB arm in the vicinity of the NAD<sup>+</sup> binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Its distance of 18 Å to b-FAD is still a bit too long for effective ET. However, the highly mobile Fd domain is shifted towards EtfB reaching a suitable ET distance between the [4Fe-4S] cluster and b-FAD when using the EtfA and EtfB sequences stringed together for AlphaFold2 calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Ferredoxin (Fd) domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The sequence of the N-terminal Fd domain of the CarCDE and the Ldh-EtfAB complexes.

Kinetic analysis revealed that the FBEC/FBEB activities were abolished in both variants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), whereas the functionality of the isolated active sites is maintained. The NADH:DCPIP oxidoreductase activity of the [∆Fe/S] or [∆Fe/S-arm] variants was 7.3±0.2 and 9.7±1.5 U/mg, respectively, and the lactate:K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> oxidoreductase activity 13.9±5.4 and 14.6±4.8 U/mg, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, the CarCDE complex preserves the FBEB capability after cutting off its Fd domain. We, therefore, conclude that external Fd can be placed next to b-FAD in truncated CarCDE but not in the [∆Fe/S] or [∆Fe/S-arm] variants of Ldh-EtfAB.

Therefore, the proposed mechanism is outlined in this direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) starting from the D-state. (1) Lactate binds into a pocket in front of the isoalloxazine of d-FAD and is oxidized to pyruvate <italic>via</italic> a hydride transfer to N5 forming d-FADH<sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The active site is formed by residues conserved in FBEC and membrane-spanning Ldhs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dym et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>) suggesting a related enzymatic mechanism. (2) One electron of d-FADH<sup>−</sup> rapidly flows to a-FAD thereby generating d-FADH• (d-FAD•<sup>−</sup>) and a-FAD•<sup>−</sup> (a-FADH•) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is worth to mention that a-FAD might be already present as flavosemiquinone in the resting state of the cell and would be reduced in this case to a-FADH<sup>−</sup>. (3) NAD<sup>+</sup> binds into a pocket at the <italic>si</italic>-side of b-FAD as verified by site-directed mutagenesis experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>). In the characterized D-state Thr226 and Val228 of EtfB occupy the frontside of b-FAD and have to be pushed aside upon NAD<sup>+</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). According to reports on Bcd-EtfAB, CarCDE and FixCX-EtfAB complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Demmer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schut et al., 2019</xref>) and supported by mutational analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) NAD<sup>+</sup> binding substantially influences the conformation of the EtfB anchor and thus also the adjustment of the B- and D-states. (4) External Fd binds to the mobile Fd domain of EtfA, thereby rigidifies the latter and adjusts a productive ET geometry between their two [4Fe-4S] clusters and b-FAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). A related situation was reported for the bEtfB family member CarCDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Demmer et al., 2018</xref>). (5) Perhaps induced by NAD<sup>+</sup> and/or Fd<sub>red</sub> binding, the EtfAB shuttle domain rotates into the B-state (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>).

(7) The produced energy-rich b-FAD•<sup>−</sup> is instantaneously reduced to b-FADH<sup>−</sup> by a-FAD•<sup>−</sup> of the EtfAB shuttle domain arrested in the B-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). According to general electrochemical principles of FBEB both one-electron donation processes to b-FAD accompanied by protonation are strictly coupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baymann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nitschke and Russell, 2012</xref>). (8) The nicotinamide ring of NAD<sup>+</sup> attached parallel to the isoalloxazine ring becomes reduced by transferring a hydride from N5 of b-FADH<sup>–</sup> to C4 of NAD<sup>+</sup>. (9) Upon release of NADH and/or Fd<sub>ox</sub> the EtfAB shuttle domain swings back into the D-state and a-FAD uptakes the remaining electron of d-FADH• (d-FAD•<sup>−</sup>). In analogy to the first round b-FAD is reduced in the B-state by one-electron transfers from Fd<sub>red</sub> and a-FAD•<sup>−</sup> rotated before from the Ldh to the EtfAB surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>).

All EtfB family members share the substrates NAD<sup>+</sup> and ferredoxin, solely the high-potential substrate varies and determines the direction of the reaction. As mentioned, the redox potential E°’ of the pyruvate/lactate pair is with –190 mV substantially lower than that of the crotonyl-CoA/butyryl-CoA pair of –10 mV, which turns a bifurcation into a confurcation event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For ensuring a smooth ET the redox potentials of the electron carriers a-FAD and d-FAD between b-FAD and lactate should be also lower in Ldh-EtfAB than in Bcd-EtfAB and thus their microenvironment substantially different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). More negatively and less positively charged residues qualitatively stabilize, in general, the more electron-deficient oxidized relative to the more electron-rich reduced state and consequently decrease the redox potential. Structural inspections of Ldh-EtfAB, indeed, reveal two acidic residues, Glu37 and Glu139, in van-der-Waals contact with the isoalloxazines of a-FAD and d-FAD, which are conserved in bifurcating Ldh but not in membrane-spanning Ldh and have no equivalent in Bcd-EtfAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

At an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5–0.8 the culture was transferred into a sterile, anaerobic Müller-Krempel flask (Glasgerätebau Ochs, Bovenden-Lenglern, Germany) and supplemented with 2 mM cysteine and 20 mM fumarate. After closing the culture with a butyl stopper, the flask was further incubated at 16°C. As soon as the culture was cooled down to 16°C gene expression was induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. All steps from this point onward were executed in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, USA) with a mixed gas phase of N<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> (95:5 [v/v]). After 16–19 hr cells were anaerobically harvested, resuspended in 200 mL buffer W (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4 µM resazurin, 5 µM FAD, 2 mM DTE, pH 8) and disrupted once in a French press (SLM Aminco, SLM Instruments, USA) after addition of DNase I and 0.5 mM PMSF (setting high, 1000 psi). The lysate was centrifuged (14,000 x g, 20 min, RT) to separate undisrupted cells from the crude extract. Subsequently, the Ldh-EtfAB complex was purified by affinity chromatography on Strep-Tactin high-capacity material (IBA Lifesciences GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) using the elution buffer E (buffer W+5 mM desthiobiotin). Fractions containing Ldh-EtfAB were pooled and concentrated <italic>via</italic> ultrafiltration (Vivaspin 6, 30 kDa Cut-off, Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) to a volume of 500 µL. The concentrated sample was separated with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), previously equilibrated with buffer W. For cryo-EM studies buffer S (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) was used for the size exclusion step. Afterwards, the Ldh-EtfAB complex was stabilized with the bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS<sup>3</sup>) crosslinker (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) by incubating the sample (≈ 1 mg) with 1 mM BS<sup>3</sup> for 20 min at room temperature. The assay was stopped by addition of 50 mM Tris. To get rid of impurities, the crosslinked-sample was again separated with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), previously equilibrated with buffer S.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Assays of lactate dehydrogenase activity</title><p>Kinetic measurements were routinely performed in a N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 30°C in 1.8 mL anaerobic cuvettes (Glasgerätebau Ochs), which were sealed with rubber stoppers.

dehydrogenase-electron transferring flavoprotein complex that provides critical insight on a basic metabolic pathway of anaerobic fermentation.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Pimchai Chaiyen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrea Mattevi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper describes a high-resolution cryoEM structure of the lactate dehydrogenase-electron transferring flavoprotein complex that provides critical insight into the basic metabolic pathway of anaerobic fermentation. What is novel is that this is the first structure of a complex wherein the dehydrogenase runs as such, rather than as a reductase. The lactate produced by glycolysis is oxidized to pyruvate with concomitant reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH. Because electrons are being supplied by the dehydrogenase, the ETF executes confurcation in contrast to all of those elucidated so far, which function in the opposite direction to effect bifurcation. As electron-confurcation and electron-bifurcation have emerged as important paradigms of cellular bioenergetics, the data reported herein pave a way for future exploration of similar electron transfer systems. The findings reported here can lay the ground for understanding structural biology related to these intriguing bioenergetic systems and may possibly be mentioned in a general textbook in the future.</p><p>General clarifications:</p><p>The manuscript needs considerable improvement with an eye to the readers who are not familiar with the electron bifurcation and other known electron bifurcating complexes.</p><p>The term shuttle is used to mean one domain of the ETF. Please provide a definition at the time of first use, so that this is clear. (It is well identified in Figure 4, but figure 4 is not mentioned for several pages after this terminology's first use.)</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. It is interesting to see the impact that alphafold can have on experimental structure analysis. However, as a general comment, the authors tend to use the alphafold structures almost uncritically, as if they were experimentally determined. The manuscript should refer to the quality indicators given by alphafold and indicate how reliable the models are in particular around the regions that are mechanistically discussed in the text.</p><p>2. The last paragraph of the main text (lines 446-460) should be mostly re-written and clarified. The sentence &quot;The midpoint redox potential of the pyruvate/lactate pair is -190 mV, which is substantially lower than that of the crotonyl-CoA/butyryl-CoA pair of 10 mV, which turns a bifurcation into a confurcation event&quot; requires a better explanation as, here, we are at the heart of the functional and structural principles governing the LDH complex. Figure 7B remains thereby difficult to be fully understood. Likewise, the sentence &quot;When assuming that the redox potentials of the electron carriers between b-FAD and lactate also differ by ca. 180 mV the microenvironment of a-FAD and d-FAD should be distinguished between Bcd-EtfAB and Ldh-EtfAB (Figure 7C).&quot; remains honestly quite obscure to me. Likewise, the text should improve the discussion about the role of Gly37 and Gly139 and why the flavin of LDH should feature a lower redox potential compared to the analogous flavin of Bcd.</p><p>3. The manuscript should explain more clearly and from the beginning, the difference between confurcation and bifurcation. Likewise, the introduction should be accompanied by a scheme depicting the overall mechanism of electron bifurcation/confurcation in general and with reference to the reaction by the LDH system.</p><p>4. The abstract should be improved. Specifically, the text at lines 38-42 will be difficult to follow, at least for the casual reader.</p><p>5. Figure 2 legend, explain the meaning of CODH.</p><p>6. Line 189, the meaning of &quot;promiscuous&quot; EtfAB should be described explicitly.</p><p>7. Line 306, please describe where the residues 122-130 are located in the structure of the complex and why they define an electron-bifurcating system. Why are these residues making the difference between bifurcating and non-bifurcating enzymes?</p><p>8. The supplement figures of Table 1 should probably be moved to the main text as they are crucial for understanding the rationale of the mutagenesis experiments.</p><p>9. Line 322, for the analysis of the catalytic role of Arg205, the authors may refer to recently published work (doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.101733).</p><p>10. Line 180 and throughout, CarCDE and Fix-EtfABX should be described in more detail as the authors often refer to them for their structural and functional comparisons.</p><p>11. Line 437, can the authors comment on the proton sources that couple protonation and reduction of the flavins.</p><p>12. Figure 7, the legend states that the two-electron reduced FAD is shown in orange but the drawing shows it colored in red.</p><p>13. Figure 7 legend, what is an &quot;escapement&quot; mechanism? Explain.</p><p>14. The figure supplement 1 of Figure 4 does not show the residues listed in the figure legend (e.g. Leu195, Tyr297 etc).</p><p>15. Line 102, rephrase, for example replacing 'holded' by 'held'. (English is irrational.)</p><p>16. Line 125: Gel filtration is two words not one.</p><p>17. Figure 1C, how were the flavins visualized?</p><p>18. Line 144: Remove period after 'U/mg'.</p><p>19. Line 165: BS3 is used but not explained until the methods section. For all non-standard abbreviations please define abbreviation at time of first use. This is particularly important for this abbreviation, which appears to be the abbreviation BS with a reference to footnote number 3 (non-existent).</p><p>20. Line 182, may I suggest 'dehydrogenase coupled' or 'dehydrogenase connected' as conducting does not quite fit here.</p><p>21. Figure 3C. This figure is very attractive, but the lettering does not quite match the ribbons with respect to color. Please use the dropper tool to achieve a match. This request is made only because the figure is otherwise so attractively colored. I have not devoted the same attention to average figures. Also please say what software was used to generate the figures, especially if the software is provided for free (support the authors with generous credit).</p><p>22. Numbering of the supplemental figures and tables is very confusing. Please assemble these in a single document and use each numerical designation only once. E.g.: please only call one figure S1A. Please use the term 'figure' for all graphics and reserve the term 'table' for all numerical and otherwise tabulated information (e.g., 'Figure – Supplement 1B' is also Figure 3).</p><p>Line 281 advertises the existence of another figure, but no figure number is given, my guess is that Figure S5 is intended.</p><p>23. Line 303, please provide a literature reference for the 'single nucleotide exchange' method. Some of the amino acid substitutions described would appear to require that more than one nucleotide be changed, so I infer a clever new method.</p><p>24. Line 304 'supplementary File' please refer to a specific supplementary table or figure.</p><p>25. Line 320, the Δ205 notation is used, but I believe R205A is intended. Please reserve the Δ symbol for deletions. Similarly, on line 332, are these deletions? Substitutions are described in the supporting table.</p><p>26. Line 331, 'farer' should possibly be 'farther'?</p><p>27. Lines 340-341, Thank you for this. Please cite other examples in the literature.</p><p>28. Line 468: 'red and orange' should be 'orange and red' to agree with the oxidation states listed earlier in the line.</p><p>29. Lines 667, 671. Duplicates of the same reference.</p><p>30.

What distinguishes the lower-case nucleotides from those listed in upper-case? I could not see that the reverse primers were the reverse complements of the forward primers. Please explain.</p><p>35. Page 5, why does purification need to be done anaerobically? Was the rest of structure determination handled anaerobically as well?</p><p>36. In Figure 1B, why does the native PAGE of (Ldh-EtfAB)2 show the bands around 220 and 280 kDa instead of 253 kDa (Line 121). What are these bands? The authors should improve the quality of bands shown in the native PAGE by performing the analysis again.</p><p>37. As the complex can easily dissociate, has the Kd value been estimated?</p><p>38. Why did the authors not try to determine individual structures of EtfAB? By adding NAD+, would it be possible to obtain the X-ray determined structure in addition to ALphaFold calculations?</p><p>39. Line 147, typo &quot;its highest..&quot;</p><p>40. Line 148, I am curious about the data showing that the FBEC activity was inactive at pH 5. In real situations, what is the cellular pH of A. woodii? I think such microbes would have pH around that range. If FBEC is inactive at pH5, how can it conduct its reactions inside the cell?</p><p>41. Figure 2, explanation regarding pH-dependent activity profiles should also be given.</p><p>42. Were the assays done under the optimized conditions giving the highest activities?</p><p>43. Page 8, how can one be sure that the cross-linking by BS does not create artifacts?</p><p>44. Page 13-14, a diagram explaining assays in Table 2 should be helpful for the reader to understand.</p><p>45. Page 14, &quot;..variant consisting of the D122A, D124A, T125G, Q127G, V128A and 311 P130A substitutions shows a lower overall FAD amount of 1.7……….oxidoreductase activities were reduced to 7% and not anymore measurable, respectively. Likewise, the NADH:DCPIP oxidoreductase activity, measuring the hydride transfer from NADH to b-FAD, was also abolished. Both findings can be explained by the 316 expected strong decrease of the b-FAD content……&quot;</p><p>Was the decrease in activities mentioned proportional to the amount of FAD lost? One can calculate whether activities detected are according to the % FAD retained?</p><p>46. Page 14-15, for the abolishment of the hydride transfer activity in the NADH:DCIP assays, have the authors tried to measure direct hydride transfer to b-FAD. Can this be done by monitoring FAD reduction under anaerobic conditions?</p><p>47. Line 367, the iron in [ΔFe/S-domain] and [ΔFe/S] variants are completely lost, but why does the overall yield increase 4-fold.</p><p>48. Line 442, regarding the statement that external Fdred binding may induce conformational changes to reduce their distance to ca. 14 Å, any evidence to support this?</p><p>49. Line 464, regarding the statement that Glu37 and Glu139 are only found in the Ldh-EtfAB complex and these residues may destabilize the electron-rich reduced state of flavin, it would be better to have a reference to endorse this statement.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structure-based electron-confurcation mechanism of the Ldh-EtfAB complex&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

As result we took the pdb file with the highest quality values (new Figure 5 – supplement 2). The quality plot suggests a reliable prediction throughout the chain (except for the last 30 residues), that also includes the segment forming the interface. The rms deviation between the Alphafold EtfA model and the experimental model was 1.31 Å for the EtfA base (domain I) and 0.98 Å for EtfA shuttle domain (domain II) indicating a high agreement. A different angle between the EtfAB base and the EtfAB shuttle domain was expected in comparison to that of the experimentally analyzed D-state as EtfB and Ldh was not included in the AlphaFold calculation. The new interface between the EtfAB base and the EtfAB shuttle domain is plausible. Several hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions are formed shown in the new Figure 5 – Supplement 1C.

Therefore, the primers have also no reverse complement regions. Back-to-back primer design methods have the advantage of transforming non-nicked plasmids. In addition, because the primers do not overlap each other, deletions sizes are only limited by the plasmid and insertions are only limited by the constraints of modern primer synthesis. In the first step we amplified our genes using primers described in Table 1 – Supplement 1. The second step involves incubation with an enzyme mix containing a kinase, a ligase and DpnI. Together, these enzymes allow for rapid blunt-end circularization of the PCR product and removal of the template DNA.

In Figure 1B, why does the native PAGE of (Ldh-EtfAB)2 show the bands around 220 and 280 kDa instead of 253 kDa (Line 121). What are these bands? The authors should improve the quality of bands shown in the native PAGE by performing the analysis again.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we have to apologize using a picture of such a bad quality gel. We repeat the native PAGE experiments in the revised manuscript. The clear bands of the new gel allowed us to recalculate the sizes of the Ldh/EtfAB complex in the native page, which are approximately ≈150 kDa and ≈265 kDa. It corresponds to the sizes of a monomeric and dimeric form. Due to its fragility the Ldh-EtfAB complex is partially dissociated in the native PAGE. In addition, gel filtration profiles clearly indicate the partial dissociation of the Ldh-EtfAB complex into Ldh and EtfAB. The migration of the Ldh-EtfAB complex as two different fragments with different sizes was already shown in the first publication of the purified complex (Weghoff et al. 2014; https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.12493) and is obviously independent of the expression and purification procedure. We added Figure 1 – supplement 1 to show the disassembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>37.

Why did the authors not try to determine individual structures of EtfAB? By adding NAD+, would it be possible to obtain the X-ray determined structure in addition to ALphaFold calculations?</p></disp-quote><p>Structures of non-bifurcating and bifurcating EtfAB are already available in a physiologically incorrect B-like conformation. Previously, we did structure determination of <italic>Acidaminococcus fermentans</italic> EtfAB not only in the substrate-free form but also by soaking NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH. But we always obtained the same non-physiological conformation. Moreover, we worked several years on the Bcd-EtfAB complex of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> to characterize the B state by X-ray and EM structural analysis but without success. Even when we had determined an EtfAB structure you could still be sceptic as the two flexible linkers might still not adjust the correct orientation between the EtfAB base and the EtfAB shuttle domain due to crystal lattice effects. Because of the non-success we thought that the correct B-conformation is only short-living and when attainable at all, then in the complete (Ldh-EtfAB)<sub>2</sub> complex. Therefore, we focused on the (Ldh-EtfAB)<sub>2</sub> complex in this work. The plausible B-state obtained with AlphaFold2 later on was a big surprise for us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>39.

Page 8, how can one be sure that the cross-linking by BS does not create artifacts?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot exclude that the crosslinking experiment creates artefacts. BS<sup>3</sup> is frequently used (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2020.07.008) and, so far, realistic results were obtained (e.g. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.22.453353; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.034). The Ldh-EtfAB revealed a highly plausible architecture of the D-state and there is no doubt on its relevance. We would, however, not exclude that the cross-linker preferably stabilizes the shuttle domain in the resting D-state and therefore prevents populations of the B-state. An FBEC activity test resulted in 2.1 ± 0.1 U/mg corresponding to 20% turnover. Thus, the structure and function of the Ldh-EtfAB complex is not severely changed by cross-linking, in particular, when considering that the additional cross-linking and purification steps are stress situations for the fragile protein complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>44.

Line 442, regarding the statement that external Fdred binding may induce conformational changes to reduce their distance to ca. 14 Å, any evidence to support this?</p></disp-quote><p>No, we have no experimental evidence that supports this proposal. It is difficult to structurally characterize a FBEB enzyme in complex with an external ferredoxin as its binding is normally rather weak. It would be lucky to find a suitable model system. However, we have executed an Alphafold2 calculation with EtfA and EtfB (previously only with EtfA) and the Fd domain moved to EtfB. The distance between the [4Fe-4S] cluster and b-FAD is thereby shortened to ca. 14 Å. This result is not surprising when considering the high mobility of the Fd domain. Moreover, a related phenomenon was already observed twice in FBEB enzymes (DOI: 10.1002/1873-3468.12971; DOI: 10.1126/science.aan0425; DOI: 10.1126/science.abg5550). It appears to be useful for the FBEB/FBEC reaction that the electron transfer pathway between the external ferredoxin and the bifurcating flavin is only formed for the short period of the reaction. The interruption might also be a tool to ensure that only desired ferredoxins can properly dock to the surface and induce the conformational changes required for electron transfer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>49. Line 464, regarding the statement that Glu37 and Glu139 are only found in the Ldh-EtfAB complex and these residues may destabilize the electron-rich reduced state of flavin, it would be better to have a reference to endorse this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>For example, the following reference are relevant (Balland et al. 2009, doi.org/10.1021/ja806540j; Talfournier et al., 2001, doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M010853200 (elimination of a positive charge); Mothersole et al. 2019, doi: 10.1002/pro.3661).</p><p>There are mutagenesis data of charged residues adjacent to flavins but they will neither validate nor falsify our conclusion. These mutagenesis experiments are extremely delicate as small secondary changes at the isoalloxazine ring or its surrounding overcompensate the effect of pure mutation. A strong argument for the importance for Glu37 and Glu139 is their strict conservation in bifurcating Ldh but not in membrane-spanning Ldhs. Two acidic amino acids flanking two isoalloxazine group is a very unusual feature in biochemistry.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and read better than the previous version.</p><p>Perhaps, the authors may consider the following suggestions to make them clearer.</p><p>1.

It involves two reduction reactions (2 + 3) using the same electron donor (M) of medium redox potential and two electron acceptors (N and Fd) of high and low redox potential. Fd can be only replaced by flavodoxin (Chowdhury et al., 2016). Biochemical reactions are normally characterized by a pair-wise exchange of electrons between substrates that are protonated in their reduced state. FBEB occur when the positive difference redox potential ∆E<sub>2</sub> between the strong electron acceptor (N) and the medium electron donor (MH) has a higher absolute value than the negative ∆E<sub>3</sub> between Fd<sub>ox</sub> and MH. In other words, ∆E<sub>1</sub> has to be positive resulting in a negative Gibbs free energy (∆G = -nF∆E, n: moles of electrons exchanged, F: Faraday constant). As example, the electrochemical treatment and the thermodynamic scheme was provided for the reaction of the bifurcating Bcd-EtfAB complex, in which the b-FAD reduced by NADH endergonically donates one electron <italic>via</italic> a-FAD to d-FAD and then exergonically one electron to Fd<sub>ox</sub>. (B) The reverse FBEC reaction (1) calalyzing two oxidation reaction (2+3) with the same electron acceptor (M). Here, positive ∆E<sub>3</sub> has a higher absolute value than the negative ∆E<sub>2.</sub> In the Ldh-EtfAB reaction low-potential Fd<sub>red</sub> donates an electron to b-FAD <italic>via</italic> one [4Fe-4S] cluster in an endergonic reaction that is driven by the exergonic ET from d-FAD, <italic>via</italic> a-FAD to b-FAD•<sup>−</sup>. The generated b-FADH<sup>‒</sup> transfers a hydride to NAD<sup>+</sup>. For the FBEB/FBEC process the first uphill ET step to b-FAD is reversed except when instanteneously pulled out by the second downhill ET step termed as escapement-type mechanism (Baymann et al., 2018). This tight coupling implicates catalytic inactivity in the absence of one of the three substrates and prevention of short circuit reactions e.g. from b-FAD•<sup>−</sup> to a-FAD•<sup>−</sup> and undesirable side reaction of the highly reactive b-FAD•<sup>−</sup>”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
