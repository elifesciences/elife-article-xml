fidelity of somatic stem cells. Whether and how age-related changes in somatic stem cells impact the faithful execution of lineage decisions remains largely unknown. Here, we address this question using genome-wide chromatin accessibility and transcriptome analysis as well as single-cell RNA-seq to explore stem-cell-intrinsic changes in the aging <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine. These studies indicate that in stem cells of old flies, promoters of Polycomb (Pc) target genes become differentially accessible, resulting in the increased expression of enteroendocrine (EE) cell specification genes. Consistently, we find age-related changes in the composition of the EE progenitor cell population in aging intestines, as well as a significant increase in the proportion of EE-specified intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and progenitors in aging flies. We further confirm that Pc-mediated chromatin regulation is a critical determinant of EE cell specification in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine. Pc is required to maintain expression of stem cell genes while ensuring repression of differentiation and specification genes. Our results identify Pc group proteins as central regulators of lineage identity in the intestinal epithelium and highlight the impact of age-related decline in chromatin regulation on tissue homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>lineage fidelity</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>intestinal stem cell</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Polycomb</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 1516-2011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korzelius</surname><given-names>Jerome</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AdG 268515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edgar</surname><given-names>Bruce A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM124434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edgar</surname><given-names>Bruce A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Global, multi-angled genetic analyses identified an age-associated loss of stem cell lineage fidelity that was linked to changes in polycomb regulation in the Drosophila intestinal epithelium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Somatic stem cells (SCs) are critical for tissue regeneration and maintenance as they have the unique ability to self-renew as well as to generate all cell types of the tissue in which they reside. Maintaining homeostasis requires SCs to respond appropriately to the needs of the tissue and generate pertinent cell types when necessary. SCs must therefore uphold a state of plasticity that allows for dynamic and appropriate lineage commitment. Transcriptional and chromatin landscaping studies have suggested that an interplay of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms defines and ensures SC lineage fidelity in various SC systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adam and Fuchs, 2016</xref>). In hair follicle (HF) and hematopoietic SCs (HSCs), master transcriptional regulators dictate lineage choice by controlling chromatin state and transcriptional networks driving differentiation and lineage restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014</xref>), while in the mouse intestinal epithelium, lineage-specific transcription factors define early cell fate decisions in a relatively permissive epigenetic landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jadhav et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). While precise mechanisms of lineage specification may differ, a common problem across aging tissues is that, in addition to stem cell regenerative capabilities, lineage fidelity declines. HSCs, for example, not only lose their ability for long-term reconstitution in transplantation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kamminga et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rossi et al., 2005</xref>), but also become skewed toward the myeloid lineage in aging mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elias et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The functional decline in SCs over time is correlated with, and may be caused by, aberrant epigenetic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beerman and Rossi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ermolaeva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krauss and de Haan, 2016</xref>). The universality and mechanism of these age-related epigenetic changes in SCs, and how critical they are for age-related regenerative decline, remain largely unclear. Chromatin regulation at the nucleosome level includes post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone tails that coordinate recruitment of chromatin modifiers, affecting nucleosome spacing and DNA accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</xref>). A major class of chromatin regulators are the Polycomb Group (PcG) and Trithorax Group (TrxG) proteins, classically characterized as mediators of silent or active chromatin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geisler and Paro, 2015</xref>). Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2) is responsible for depositing methyl moieties onto H3K27, rendering it a repressive mark, and Polycomb Repressor Complex 1 (PRC1) recognizes and binds H3K27me3 and monoubiquitinates histone H2A on lysine K119 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>). TrxG complexes maintain a transcriptionally active state by promoting H3K4 methylation and H3K27 acetylation, but their exact composition is context dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geisler and Paro, 2015</xref>).</p><p>PRC1 and PRC2 are well studied in the context of development and play important roles in lineage determination and restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brand et al., 2019</xref>). Yet it is becoming clear that PcG proteins also have post-developmental cell-type-specific roles in various cells and tissues, including in adult SC regulation. PcG proteins regulate SC identity and function in the hematopoietic system as well as in the muscle, intestine, skin, and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avgustinova and Benitah, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beerman and Rossi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ezhkova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hidalgo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Iwama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jacobs et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Juan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kamminga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kinkel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Oguro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pivetti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Robson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Woodhouse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Xie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). In the mouse intestine, PRC1 ensures intestinal SC (ISC) identity by repressing non-intestinal lineage transcription factor genes, which, if activated, interfere with the transcriptional response downstream of Wnt signaling, resulting in loss of ISC self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiacchiera et al., 2016a</xref>). PRC2, in turn, was shown to be dispensable for ISC maintenance, but required for progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chiacchiera et al., 2016b</xref>). In this lineage, the PRC1 component Bmi1 further marks a reserve stem cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yan et al., 2012</xref>) that is committed to the enteroendocrine (EE) cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). These cells can de-differentiate and repopulate the basal crypt after depletion of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jadhav et al., 2017</xref>). How aging impacts the function of PcG proteins in SC regulation remains unknown, but similar de-repression of p16INK4a has been implicated in the decline of regenerative capacity of geriatric as well as Bmi1-deficient muscle SCs (MuSCs), suggesting that age-related changes in PcG protein function play critical roles in SC aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A few studies have examined global changes in histone modifications specifically in SCs during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krauss and de Haan, 2016</xref>). Broadening of H3K4me3 marks at identity and self-renewal genes and increased DNA methylation on differentiation genes was observed in old HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sun et al., 2014</xref>), and increased H3K27me3 in old MuSCs was postulated to be linked to their dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). These studies support the idea that during aging, a redistribution of epigenetic marks causes misregulation of transcriptional programs critical for SC maintenance and lineage potency. However, the extent of these changes in SCs, as well as the mechanism(s) by which these changes impact SC function remain to be fully elucidated.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine serves as a powerful model in which to investigate regulatory principles for stem cell function and the age-related decline of such mechanisms. The midgut epithelium is maintained and regenerated by resident ISCs, which give rise to both the enterocyte (EC) and the EE cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>). Lineage commitment into either the EC or EE lineage is largely controlled by Notch (N) signaling, where high N promotes the EC lineage through a transient post-mitotic progenitor called the enteroblast (EB), and low N activity is associated with EE differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Intestinal turnover in young flies is relatively slow, and ISCs thus reside largely in a quiescent state. In aging flies, however, ISCs become hyper-proliferative, due to increased stress signaling linked to commensal dysbiosis and the epithelial inflammatory response. EC differentiation further becomes misregulated, in part due to aberrant N signaling. Together, these changes result in epithelial dysplasia and barrier dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biteau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biteau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rera et al., 2012</xref>). Age-related changes in ISC activity driven by both intrinsic and environmental influences have been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jasper, 2020</xref>). It has not been examined, however, whether and how changes in ISC lineage fidelity contribute to age-related pathologies in this model.</p><p>Here, we used the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine to investigate age-related changes in ISC lineage fidelity. We find that in aging flies, ISCs exhibit transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility changes that prime them toward the EE lineage. Accordingly, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and histological analysis uncover an age-associated increase in the proportion of EE cells as well as EE-specified ISCs. We find that these changes are mediated by deregulation of Polycomb (Pc) target genes, and that aging ISCs acquire H3K27me2 marks that are reminiscent of young EEs. We further show that Pc and trithorax (trx) are central regulators of ISC identity and EE lineage commitment, maintaining a balanced antagonism critical for appropriate expression of lineage-specific and stem cell genes. Finally, we find that the Pc-mediated increase in EE cell numbers is a consequence of commensal dysbiosis-mediated JNK activation in ISCs, and that it contributes to the age-related dysplasia characteristic of the old <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine. Taken together, our results uncover PcG proteins as key regulators of lineage identity and fidelity in the ISC lineage, and identify the perturbation of PcG gene regulation as a major driver of the age-related loss in tissue homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chromatin accessibility and transcriptome analysis on aging ISCs</title><p>While a large number of studies have explored systemic changes and changes in the local microenvironment that occur with age and impact the function of ISCs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, comparably little is known about the intrinsic changes to ISC identity, function and regulation that may influence ISCs function in the aging animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jasper, 2020</xref>). To start exploring such changes, we performed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq on fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified ISCs isolated from flies across their lifespan, covering early adulthood (7 days of age), middle age (30 days of age), old age (60 days), and geriatric age (&gt;70 days).

Accordingly, chromatin accessibility around selected ISC marker genes like <italic>esg</italic> remained unchanged at all time-points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) of peak accessibility, however, revealed a separation between young samples and mid-age to geriatric samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and D</xref>), and we were able to identify a set of differentially accessible peaks between old and young samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These were primarily located in promoters, introns and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Focusing on the differentially accessible promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), we performed a motif analysis on each age comparison and noted a consistent enrichment for Trithorax-like (Trl) and Zeste (z) motifs across all time-point comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Trl and z have been reported to bind to Polycomb Repressor Elements (PREs) and recruit PcG proteins to PREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">MÃ¼ller and Kassis, 2006</xref>). The differential chromatin accessibility at Trl and z sites thus suggests a potential mis-regulation of PcG proteins in old ISCs.</p><p>To gain insight into whether the differential chromatin accessibility observed translates into differential gene expression in aging ISCs, we performed RNA-seq on ISCs that were isolated at the same time-points as the samples for ATAC-seq. When all differentially expressed genes were compared with all differentially open chromatin peaks, the correlation was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). However, a strong positive correlation was observed for genes that were significantly (p&lt;0.05) changed in both transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and promoter accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Of the genes that exhibited changes at both levels, 58% (18/31 genes) contained a Trl and z motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Pearson correlation of RNA-seq samples showed that young samples clustered separately from mid-aged to geriatric samples, suggesting that ISCs begin to exhibit distinct transcriptional differences at mid-age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Accordingly, young samples separated from mid- to geriatric samples in PCA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). Compared to young time-points, mid-age time-points exhibited significant differential expression (adjusted p-value&lt;0.05) for only a few genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), but there was a significant increase in differentially regulated genes at old and geriatric time-points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), suggesting a progressive change in gene expression of ISCs as the animal ages. Focusing on genes with a log<sub>2</sub> fold change (logFC) of +/-Â 1, we found no gene ontology (GO) or pathway enrichment for genes differentially regulated at mid and old time-points. Deregulated genes in geriatric samples were enriched for glutathione metabolic process [GO:0006749] as well as genes in the drug metabolism -cytochrome P450 pathway. We also noticed an upregulation of neuronal genes that are also markers of EE cells such as <italic>Sytalpha</italic>, <italic>nrv3</italic> and <italic>dysc</italic> in both old and geriatric samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). An upregulation of neuronal genes in old ISCs is in accordance with results from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tauc et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with gene sets of 58 or 51 previously described EE or EC-specific genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dutta et al., 2015</xref>), revealed a consistent and significant enrichment of EE genes in the genes upregulated in aging ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). EC genes were downregulated at the old time-point, and no significant trends were observed for these genes in other comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These results suggested an age-related increase in the acquisition of EE fates at the expense of EC fates. To test this hypothesis, we performed scRNA-seq and immunohistochemistry to explore lineage dynamics in the aging intestinal epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq on whole aging midguts</title><p>We performed scRNA-seq on whole midguts at young, mid-age, and old time-points and a total of 4880 young, 1440 mid-aged, and 5829 old cells were used in our final analyses.

We observed a significant correlation of differentially expressed genes when comparing young with mid-aged and young with old samples (correlation is weaker in the second comparison, potentially due to an age-related increase of transcriptional noise, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We also found that age-associated genetic changes in Clusters 1â3 showed the most significant enrichment and gene expression overlap with our bulk RNA-seq gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that transcriptional changes in our bulk RNA-seq are not unique to a particular cluster, but rather are upregulated in all ISC and progenitor clusters (Clusters #1â3). We noted that in old samples, a substantial number of genes were also upregulated in Cluster #4 (consisting of mainly old cells) and #5 (EE progenitor cells). Overall, these results show that the bulk and single cell RNA-seq analysis reveal consistent changes in the aging ISCs populations in a complementary manner.</p><p>We next sought to explore differences between and within ISC clusters more specifically. Clusters #4 and #8, which are made up almost exclusively of old cells, exhibited similar GO term enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To understand the biology contributing to the separation of these two clusters better, we used Monocle3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>) to order cells in pseudotime and performed trajectory analyses to identify gene modules driving cluster identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Cluster 4 trajectory analysis identified gene modules whose expression best represent the progressive distancing of Cluster 1 cells from Cluster 4 cells (i.e. from young to old ISCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>). GO analysis on gene module 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>) revealed enrichment of stress-associated terms such as âglutathione metabolic processâ, âchaperone-mediated protein foldingâ and âresponse to heatâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that Cluster #4 consists of stressed cells. Of note, we found that many significantly upregulated genes from the bulk RNA-seq were also upregulated in Cluster #4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), suggesting that the most pronounced expression changes observed in bulk ISCs reflect the acquisition of the âaged/stressed ISCâ state.</p><p>In contrast, Cluster #8 is disconnected from the trajectory root of young ISCs, and we used gene sets significantly enriched in the module analysis to characterize these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). Module 18 genes are upregulated in Cluster #8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4B</xref>) and show enrichment for DNA repair, DNA damage and telomere stress induced senescence pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating damaged cells. The appearance of these âstressedâ or damaged cell states in old intestines is consistent with reported elevated stress signaling as well as DNA damage in the aged epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hochmuth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Siudeja et al., 2015</xref>). During aging, loss of activity of the antioxidant response regulator, CncC/Nrf2, leads to an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in old ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hochmuth et al., 2011</xref>). High levels of ROS have been linked to increased DNA damage in these cells, an observation that is supported by our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Park et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>While the emergence of Clusters #4 and #8 were thus consistent with previous work, we were intrigued by the unexpected age-related increase in EE signatures in ISCs observed in the bulk RNA-seq analysis. To explore possible changes in lineage specification further, we performed gene expression trajectory analysis for Cluster #5 as it consists of EE progenitor cells. This revealed the progression of EE differentiation from EE-specified (Pros+/esg+) ISC progenitors to mature EEs, and included mitotic EE progenitors, which most likely represent a mitotic phase during EE specification that has recently been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">He et al., 2018</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6</xref>).

Strikingly, old EE progenitors had increased expression of <italic>deadpan</italic> (<italic>dpn</italic>) and other pro-neural genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), the upregulation of which was recently described as a hallmark of neuroendocrine tumor stem cells in the midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2020</xref>). We also noted a general upregulation of these neural stem cell (NSC) markers in our bulk RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2âfigure supplement 7</xref>). The significance of this acquisition of an NSC- like phenotype in the aging intestine is intriguing and will require further exploration. Critically, our scRNA-seq data revealed that the upregulation of EE genes in aged ISCs observed by bulk RNA-seq was driven by an increase in the number of EE-specified ISCs.

The stress-induced changes in lineage fidelity in ISCs thus likely set up a vicious cycle that causes progressive dysplasia and results in disruption of epithelial structure and function in the aging intestine.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of age-related deregulation of ISC lineage fidelity by perturbed Polycomb and Trithorax balance.</title><p>In young flies, balanced Pc and trx activity maintain appropriate specification of ISCs into the EE or EC lineage.

Notably, we observe the well-characterized age-associated increase in mitotically active ISCs, but also identify a unique âstressed ISCâ cell population that increases with age. The transcriptional signature distinguishing this cell population encompasses over 25% of significantly upregulated genes observed in our bulk RNA-seq study from purified old ISCs, supporting the robustness and complementarity of the two methods. This transcriptional signature was enriched in genes involved in glutathione metabolic processes, chaperone-mediated protein folding, response to heat, and regulation of cytoskeleton organization, consistent with a stressed or damaged cell state. The appearance of this âstressedâ stem cell population is further consistent with the previously described increase in inflammatory and oxidative stress in the aging intestinal epithelium, and may reflect the age-associated accumulation of oxidative, proteostatic and genomic damage in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hochmuth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rodriguez-Fernandez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Siudeja et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sousa-Victor et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, the majority of old ISCs reside in an activated cell state (~50%), whereas the âstressed ISCâ population makes up only a small percentage (&lt;10%). How this âstressedâ population affects tissue homeostasis requires further studies. Intriguingly, the p53 and DNA repair pathways are upregulated in this cell population, while cell cycle genes are repressed, indicating that these cells may represent a correlate to mammalian senescent cells.</p><p>The EE progenitor population within Cluster five not only increases in size with age, but also upregulates pro-neural genes that are markers for neural stem cells (NSCs). It was recently shown that in a neuroendocrine tumor model, ISCs undergo an identity switch that results in the acquisition of NSC-like features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2020</xref>). This NSC gene signature was also upregulated in old ISCs analyzed by bulk RNAseq, suggesting that a general upregulation of these genes may contribute to age-related ISC phenotypes.</p><p>Our ATAC-seq data from purified ISC populations revealed only moderate changes in chromatin organization in ISCs of increasingly older animals, suggesting that ISC gene regulation is tightly controlled throughout life. At the same time, the significant increase in H3K27 dimethylation levels in aging ISCs, the fact that H3K27me2 levels are higher in EEs than in ISCs in young guts, and the observation that E(z)-mediated methylation of H3K27 is required for EE specification, all support a role for increases in H3K27me2 in skewing ISC identity towards the EE fate. Despite the high genomic abundance of H3K27me2, which accounts for up to 70% of total histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ebert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrari et al., 2014</xref>), the functional role of H3K27me2 remains largely uncharacterized. The broad genomic distribution of H3K27me2 was shown to suppress aberrant gene activation by controlling enhancer fidelity in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrari et al., 2014</xref>), and access to transcription factors and RNA Pol II to DNA in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). If and how genomic abundance and/or distribution of H3K27me2 affects cell identity or other cellular functions has not been well explored. One study found that perturbing the ratio of H3K27me2/H3K27me3 in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) affected the acquisition and repression of specific fates of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Juan et al., 2016</xref>), indicating the importance of appropriate regulation of these marks in different cell types. The differential abundance of H3K27me2 that we observed in young ISCs and EEs further supports the importance of dynamic H3K27me2 regulation in the ISC lineage and of appropriate control of this mark to maintain lineage commitment. The loss of EE cell differentiation upon <italic>Pc</italic> or <italic>E(z)</italic> depletion in ISCs further supports a critical role for PRC in regulating H3K27 methylation status and thereby lineage fidelity. Of note, the expression of <italic>Pc</italic>, <italic>E(z)</italic> and other PcG genes, as well as the expression of <italic>trx</italic>, <italic>Trl</italic> and <italic>z</italic>, was not significantly altered in aging ISCs, suggesting that aging most likely affects their post-transcriptional regulation and/or function.</p><p>Age-related changes in H3K27 methylation have been reported in mammalian SC populations: in aging HSCs and muscle SCs, the H3K27me3 signal exhibits broader coverage and increased intensity at transcriptional start sites and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sun et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that there is an evolutionarily conserved effect of aging on PRC function in tissue stem cells. It would be intriguing to explore whether these alterations in H3K27me3 may underlie the age-related dysfunction in lineage potential observed in HSCs of old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elias et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sun et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Since loss of <italic>Pc</italic> induces the expression of EC genes, represses EE gene expression, and results in less accessible chromatin associated with ISC identity genes (<italic>esg</italic>, <italic>spdo</italic>) as well as pro-neural genes (<italic>dpn</italic>), we propose that Pc activity regulates multiple aspects of ISC specification. Despite the upregulation of EC genes after Pc depletion, ISCs did not spontaneously differentiate, ISC numbers remained normal and ISCs could still mount a proliferative response to infection. Thus, ISC function remained largely intact suggesting the primary function of Pc in ISCs is to regulate lineage commitment.</p><p>The contrasting function of trx in EE differentiation is consistent with the known antagonism between trx and Pc complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>) and exemplifies a tightly regulated interplay of these systems in lineage commitment. In addition to upregulating EE genes, loss of trx also induced cell cycle genes and ISC proliferation, suggesting additional roles in controlling ISC function. This finding is in line with a recently published study showing TrxG factors Kismet and Trr limit ISC proliferation in the fly midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gervais et al., 2019</xref>). The fact that this group did not report changes in the EE lineage most likely reflects functional differences across TrxG complexes, the composition of which varies greatly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geisler and Paro, 2015</xref>).</p><p>A similar function in stem cell specification has been described for PRC1 and PRC2 in the mouse, where both complexes are important to preserve ISC and progenitor cell identity in the gut, while regulating specification into specific daughter cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiacchiera et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chiacchiera et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Koppens et al., 2016</xref>). Loss PRC1 function in the intestinal epithelium resulted in impairment of ISC self-renewal via de-repression non-intestinal lineage genes as well as negative regulators of the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiacchiera et al., 2016a</xref>). Interestingly, the effects of PRC1 loss were independent of H3K27me3, revealing instead the role of H2AK119 mono-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiacchiera et al., 2016a</xref>). PRC2 was shown to be important in ISCs only during damage-induced regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chiacchiera et al., 2016b</xref>). In contrast, another study found significant degeneration of the SC compartment under homeostatic conditions as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Koppens et al., 2016</xref>). Reconciling these findings, a recent study revealed that in the absence of PRC2, mammalian cells shed H3K27me3 exclusively by replicational dilution of modified nucleosomes, and that the effects of PRC2 deletion are thus only observed in lineage progeny rather than in stem cells themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jadhav et al., 2020</xref>). Both previous studies are in agreement, however, that PRC2 controls cell fate decisions, as loss of PRC2 leads to an accumulation of secretory cells, evidently due to de-repression of the secretory lineage master regulator, <italic>Atoh1</italic>, resulting in ISC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chiacchiera et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Koppens et al., 2016</xref>). It remains unknown how aging affects PRC function and H3K27 methylation in the mammalian intestine.</p><p>Only a few studies have rigorously investigated age-associated changes in the mammalian intestine on a histological and cell-type-specific level. Nalapareddy et al. reported changes in crypt architecture, decreased mitotic potential of ISCs and an increase in the secretory cell lineage, most likely due to increased Atoh1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nalapareddy et al., 2017</xref>). Given the role of PRC2 in regulating the secretory lineage in both the mammalian intestine and the fly, it is tempting to speculate a conserved age-related increase in the secretory lineage that stems from deregulation of PRC. Our results support a role for increased stress signaling in driving this lineage imbalance, as overactive JNK in ISCs promotes EE differentiation. While JNK signaling has been reported to suppress Pc complex function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 2005</xref>), our data indicate that in the ISC lineage, this interaction is more complex, as both JNK activation promotes EE specification, while Pc knockdown inhibits EE specification. Further studies are needed to explore the molecular mechanisms mediating JNK/Pc interactions in the ISC lineage.</p><p>Chronic elevation of inflammatory signaling is a well-characterized hallmark of the aging fly intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biteau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2016</xref>) and a hallmark of many intestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infection and colorectal cancer. Alterations in EE cell numbers and secretory activity have been reported to play a role in many diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Worthington et al., 2018</xref>). In IBD, for example, EE cells were shown to contribute to pathogenesis by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Friedrich et al., 2015</xref>). In another study, increased numbers of EE cells were reported in human patients with chronic ulcerative colitis, potentially promoting IBD associated neoplasias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gledhill et al., 1986</xref>). Notably, we show that lowering EE numbers by long-term depletion of Pc in ISCs inhibited age-induced intestinal dysplasia, supporting a pathological role for EEs in aging.</p><p>The role of epigenetic alterations, and specifically the role of PRC, in inflammatory diseases and cancer is still under investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Comet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ventham et al., 2013</xref>). It was recently reported that suppressing EZH2 activity ameliorates experimental intestinal inflammation and delays the onset of colitis-associated cancer. However, these effects may be a consequence of EZH2 suppression in myeloid cells rather than in intestinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Disruption in PRC2 function may also underlie human cancers, where PRC2 is often hyperactive or overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Comet et al., 2016</xref>). Activating EZH2 mutations, which increase total H3K27me3 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sneeringer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yap et al., 2011</xref>), increase tumor survival and growth in pre-clinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">BÃ©guelin et al., 2013</xref>) and are found in up to 24% of diffuse large B cell lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Morin et al., 2010</xref>). Additional work will be needed to establish whether age-related changes in PRC activity contribute to the increased onset of gastrointestinal cancers during aging.</p><p>Taken together, our findings provide evidence for altered ISC cell states in old flies that affect intestinal homeostasis and contribute to tissue dysplasia. Our results exemplify the importance of maintaining appropriate lineage decisions, as overproduction of EE cells is detrimental to the epithelium, but can be rescued by re-balancing the system towards normal EE numbers. We propose age-associated deregulation of lineage fidelity of ISCs due to elevated stress and misregulation of Pc as key drivers of functional decline of the intestinal epithelium. Pc group proteins may thus represent valuable therapeutic targets for age-related morbidities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-mcherry-RNAi</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:35785; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC">BDSC</ext-link> <break/>35785</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-w-RNAi</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:25785; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC">BDSC</ext-link> <break/>25785</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Pc-RNAi</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:36070; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC">BDSC</ext-link> <break/>36070</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Pc-RNAi</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:33622; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC">BDSC</ext-link> <break/>33622</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-E(z)-RNAi</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:33659; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC">BDSC</ext-link> <break/>33659</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-E(z)-RNAi</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:36068; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC">BDSC</ext-link> <break/>36068</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>trx<sup>E2</sup>, FRT82B/Tm6C</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:24160; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC">BDSC</ext-link> <break/>24160</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>FRT82B</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:2051; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC">BDSC</ext-link> <break/>2051</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Pc<sup>1</sup>/TM1</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:1728; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC">BDSC</ext-link> <break/>1728</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-eGFP</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:6874; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC">BDSC</ext-link> <break/>6874</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>OregonR</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:5; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC">BDSC</ext-link> <break/>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-trx-RNAi</td><td>Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Center</td><td>Transformant ID: GD37715</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-puc-RNAi</td><td>Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Center</td><td>Transformant ID: GD3018</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-sc-3HA</td><td>Fly ORF</td><td>F000085</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Pros<sup>V1</sup>-Gal4</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grosjean et al., 2001</xref></td><td>N/A</td><td>J.

Transposed DNA was purified using MiniElute Reaction Cleanup kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 10 Î¼l water. Purified transposed samples were amplified using NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs) per manufacturerâs user guide. Generated libraries were quantified by qPCR to determine the cycle number at which each sample produced 25% of maximum fluorescent intensity. The fluorescent intensity was used to estimate the number of additional PCR cycles required for each sample. Libraries were purified using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter) to remove contaminating primer dimers. Library quality was assessed with dsDNA HS Assay kit (Thermo Fisher) and quantitated by Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). Pooled libraries were quantitated by Kapa Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems) and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 to generate 30 M of pair end 50 bp reads per library.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>For RNA-seq, between 62,000â210,000 ISCs were sorted directly into Buffer RLT and RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mikro Kit (Qiagen). QC of samples was done to determine RNA quantity and quality prior to the processing by low input RNA-seq method. The concentration of RNA samples was measured using DS-11 spectrophotometer (DeNovix) and the integrity of RNA was determined by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Approximately few ng of total RNA was used as an input material for the library generation using SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (Clontech). Size of the libraries was confirmed using 4200 TapeStation and High Sensitivity D1K screen tape (Agilent Technologies) and their concentration was determined by qPCR based method using Library quantification kit (KAPA). The libraries were multiplexed and then sequenced on Illumina HiSeq4000 (Illumina) to generateÂ &gt;30M of single end 50 base pair reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>RNA-seq and ATAC-seq after polycomb or trithorax knockdown</title><p>For <italic>Pc</italic>-RNAi experiments, virgins of the ISC<sup>ts</sup> fly line were crossed with m<italic>cherry</italic>-RNAi or <italic>Pc</italic>-RNAi (BL36070) males and maintained at 18Â°C. Progeny was collected and shifted to 29Â°C 4â7 days after eclosion.

In total, we had two young, one mid-age and two old samples. Whole midguts were dissected in 1xPBS,Â 1%BSA and dissociated at RT using 0.5% Trypsin-EDTA solution. Midguts were agitated by vortexing every 30 min and dissociated cells were removed from the enzyme solution and placed on ice in 1xPBS, 1%BSA and 2%FBS every 30 min. Once the tissue was completely dissociated, cells were FACS sorted to ensure single cells were obtained after which cell viability was measured using a Vi-CELL analyzer to confirmÂ &gt;80% viability. The cells were then immediately applied to the 10XGenomics chromium platform.</p><p>Sample processing for single-cell RNA-seq was done using Chromium Single Cell 3â Library and Gel bead kit v2 following manufacturerâs user guide (10x Genomics). The cell density and viability of single-cell suspension were determined by Vi-CELL XR cell counter (Beckman Coulter). All the processed samples had very high percentage of viable cells (&gt;90%). The cell density was used to impute the volume of single cell suspension needed in the reverse transcription (RT) master mix, aiming to achieveÂ ~6000 cells per sample. cDNAs and libraries were prepared following manufacturerâs user guide (10x Genomics). Libraries were profiled on 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) using High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technologies) and quantified using Kapa Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems).

Briefly, reads shorter than 18 bp were filtered out and GSNAP (version 2013-11-102) was used to map the reads to the BDGP6 reference genome. Duplicated reads have been were marked with Picard (2.21.9) and bam files belonging to the same group were merged using bamtools (2.3.0). MACS2 (2.1.0) with parameters (--<monospace>p-value 0.01</monospace>, --<monospace>shift</monospace> â100, --<monospace>extsize</monospace> 199) was used to call the peaks. Highly reproducible peaks from replicates were assigned by the Irreproducibility Discovery Rate (IDR) ENCODE framework. Reads within overlapping peaks were counted by using the summarizeOverlaps method from the GenomicAlignments (1.18.1) R package. Counts were normalized using the TMM method, and then transformed using the voom method. Differential peaks were identified by limma (version 3.38.3) R package. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg method for adjusting p-values for multiple testing. Peaks with an adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 in the differential accessibility test were considered significantly differential. PCA plot was performed on normalized counts (cpm) using PCAtools (1.2.0) R package. Volcano plots were generated using EnhancedVolcano (1.4.0) R package. Peak coverage heatmaps were generated by deepTools (2.0). Homer (4.8) was used to find enriched motifs in differentially accessible promoter peaks. Specific fly motifs were obtained from JASPAR 2020 collection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jaspar.genereg.net/">http://jaspar.genereg.net/</ext-link>) and from DMMPMM database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://autosome.ru/DMMPMM/">http://autosome.ru/DMMPMM/</ext-link>).

In order to create a coverage file (bigwig) normalized by RPGC, for each age group, deepTools bamcoverage utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">RamÃ­rez et al., 2016</xref>) was used. deepTools multiBigwigSummary utility was used to assemble all coverage info into one 'ntz' file, which then was used as an input to plot correlations and PCA graphs using deepTools plotCorrelation and plotPCA, respectively.</p><p>For the purpose of locating open genomic areas, an ENCODE recommended pipeline, developed by the Kundaje lab at Stanford University was used (available on Github at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/atac-seq-pipeline">https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/atac-seq-pipeline</ext-link>). The pipeline performs end to end quality control and analysis of ATAC-seq data. The pipeline was run three times, each time on the replicates pre-processed fastq files of one age group, young, mid, or old. The pipeline first aligned reads to the dm6 reference genome using bowtie2. Total alignment rates were 87.99%, 90.70% and 86.46% for young samples, 77.40% and 73.16% for mid age samples, and 96.55%, 82.29% and 80.00% for old age samples. The pipeline then identified a Conservative Peak Set (CPS) per age group, which consists of shared reproducible peak areas between at least two true replicates of the same age group; the CPSs include 20,004, 18,279, and 17,180 peaks for young, mid, and old samples respectively. We adjusted each genomic area in each of the peak sets to be of length 500 bp by limiting it to 250 bp around the summit of the peak, using a custom script. Then, the new peak sets of the three age groups were merged into one master âbedâ file using HOMER utility Mergepeaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>).

Midguts were dissected in 1xPBS, transferred to a tube, the PBS was removed and the midgut tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at â80Â°C until samples were shipped to Active Motif for analysis. In short, the following was performed by Active Motif: Two young and two old midgut samples, each a pool of 50, were frozen at â80Â°C upon receipt. A. Frozen samples were suspended in 250 Âµl of a sucrose based hypotonic buffer and homogenized using a battery powered plastic pestle, after which the volume of hypotonic buffer was increased to 1 ml and samples incubated for 30 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted and washed with 500 Âµl hypotonic buffer prior to acid extraction (100 ul volume for two hours at 4Â°C).

Data sets with equivalent H3 Total signals were selected for downstream analysis. Net median fluorescent Intensity (Net MFI) associated with each PTM-specific bead was expressed as a ratio relative to Histone H3 Total signals for each well. Ratio values were averaged for each sample input amount (two technical replicates) and percent change in the ratio relative to the reference samples was determined.

The authors show that ISCs exhibit transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility changes through deregulating of Polycomb target genes and activating <italic>JNK</italic>, which contributing to dysplasia in aging flies. This is an important finding which may lead to effective perturbation of PcG gene regulation of the age-related loss in tissue homeostasis. However, some results need to be presented with more details and rigorously.</p><p>1) Figure 1A. the number of flies in mid-age, old, geriatric groups only have 3 for ATAC-seq and RNA-seq. It would be nice to increase the number of flies in these groups to 6 and the same to the young group. Moreover, it's surprising to see 7 flies in the young group in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>2) The number of cells present in Figure 2A is not shown and not compared with the estimated numbers from literature, which presents the quality of the ATAC-seq and RNA-seq.</p><p>3) Figure 3B why there is no mid-age group to quantify the proportion of EEs and EE progenitors cells?</p><p>4) Figure 4A There is a mislabeling in the top of relative H3K27me27. Since H3K27me1 and H3K27me2 are also deposited in different chromatin domains to activate transcription, however, the H3K27me1 changes are missing in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1. Also, there is no statistics analysis in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1. No scale bar in Figure 4C and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>5) Did the author investigate expression changes of polycomb repressive complex 2, such as <italic>Pc</italic> or E(z) in aging flies?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors found transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility changes prime ISCs toward the EE lineage in aging flies, related with Polycomb genes. Then they confirmed the necessity of <italic>Pc</italic> for EE specification, and long-term <italic>Pc</italic> knock-down in aging also reduced dysplasia levels. Finally, they found commensal dysbiosis-mediated <italic>JNK</italic> activation causes EE increases.</p><p>This work is rigorous and well-grounded, elucidating intrinsic changes in the aging ISCs and how these changes impact ISC lineage fidelity, further, age-related pathologies. They covered Polycomb genes as key regulators of ISC lineage identity, providing a fundamental understanding of aging.</p><p>1) A numbered summary of any substantive concerns:</p><p>a) In chromatin accessibility analysis on aging ISCs, the authors performed a motif analysis on differentially accessible promoter regions, and found an enrichment for Trl and z motifs. Are there differences between up-regulated promoter regions and down-regulated ones?</p><p>b) As the majority of old ISCs reside in an activated cell state (~50%), and the &quot;stressed ISC&quot; population makes up a small percentage (&lt;10%), whether activated or stressed ISCs have relation with EE specification, further affect tissue homeostasis?</p><p>c) After knocking down <italic>Pc</italic>, there is a decrease in accessibility of ISC genes and increased accessibility included homeobox TFs, while ISC proliferation was not affected. How do the authors explain this apparent discrepancy?</p><p>And what about EE genes? Is there a decrease in accessibility of EE genes after knocking down <italic>Pc</italic> in ISCs?</p><p>d) For the comment that &quot;while the increase in EE cell numbers was repeatedly and robustly observed in animals that exhibited age-related epithelial dysplasia, we noticed that in animals that exhibited reduced dysplasia, the increase in EE cells was less pronounced&quot;, please explain it more clearly. (It seems no data shown to support the comment)</p><p>e) The increase of H3K27me3 from young to old flies is 24%, does the H3K27me3 signal exhibit broader coverage and increased intensity at transcriptional start sites, like HSC and muscle SC?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this perspective, Tauc et al. preformed genome-wide chromatin accessibility and transcriptome analysis as well as single cell RNA-seq to explore stem cell- intrinsic changes in the aging <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine. They found <italic>Pc</italic>-mediated chromatin regulation can determine the EE cell specification and ratio in the aged <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine. Given somatic stem cell is a critical model for regeneration and aging field, the incentive for such a well-compiled comparative study is obvious. However, the deliverables that this ambitious plan eventually offered are relatively weak.</p><p>First, the authors picked the cherry of Polycomb (<italic>Pc</italic>) solely used an excuse from motif analysis of ATAC-seq, which largely lower their value of key data from RNA-seq and Single-cell analyses. What are the envisions from enrichment of DNA repair and TNFalpha/NFkB signaling from Single-cell sequencing, and enrichment of glutathione metabolic process and drug metabolism from RNA-seq ? Did they regulated by <italic>Pc</italic> as well or response for increase of EE cells ? An upregulation of neuronal genes was also found by the authors and their previous study, why this has not been considered by functional assay. And, though the author presented a series of RNAi and knockdown assay to show the effects, there is no single rescue experiment was conducted in parallel.</p><p>Second, at the end of single cell section, the authors claimed that scRNA-seq data revealed that the upregulation of EE genes in aged ISCs observed by bulk RNA-seq. This will cause a further question if this particular case of EE-genes could be extrapolated to other clusters of cells and pathways, not to mentions that ATAC-seq signatures were not integrated. The author could give a clear description of how many DEGs in RNA-seq that could validated by scRNA-seq? in which clusters, the sc-RNA is most consistent with RNA, did they correlated with cell numbers? How much variation of expression of Polycomb target genes could explained by shift of promoters peaks ?</p><p>Third, the method and parameters used in the study are unclear, with only the package name was given in most case. And, it looks like the author used different methods to map and identify DEGs in Bulk RNA-seq and RNAi experiments. There is clear and huge evidence to show that different pipelines and combinations of software can get a completely different output. So, it is really weird distinct methods were used for two sets of RNA-seq analyses.</p><p>After all, the major difficulty in analyzing such a dataset lies in the well-define strategies for cross-omics data. Although there have been some international joint-ventures to systematically catalogue the signatures and changes. The amount of method generated so far are still far from comprehensive and requires huge amounts of comparisons. To enable this dataset to make meaningful predictions, novel informatic algorithms was encouraged to be designed in this study which would make full use of generated resources.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62250.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions (as detailed below in more detail):</p><p>1) Integrative analysis of omics data, e.g., ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, or RNAseq and scRNA-seq,or three of them;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that further analysis of the generated datasets will provide additional hypotheses to test. Such analysis can go into many different directions, and we anticipate it to continue by our and other groups once our data have been made public. Our original manuscript provided a first example for the power and usefulness of such analysis and of the generated data: the combined analysis of the omics dataset resulted in an unexpected hypothesis, namely that aging causes a shift towards EE cell specification in the ISC lineage, and that changes in <italic>Pc</italic> gene regulation contribute to that process. Strikingly, our genetic studies testing this hypothesis succeeded in supporting a new model for how aging impacts stem cell function in the intestine. We believe that this work thus highlights the strength of the omics analysis and of its combination with functional genetic studies. The value of additional âintegrativeâ analysis of omics data was thus not immediately obvious to us, but we have now performed the following additional analysis to address the reviewersâ concerns, which we believe add substantial support to our original findings:</p><p>1) A one-to-one comparison of the ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from aging ISCs that examines the correlation of transcriptional changes with changes in promoter chromatin accessibility between the different age groups. We have added a supplementary figure to Figure 1 that shows these comparisons (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2). Interestingly, while changes in gene expression and promoter accessibility do not strongly correlate when comparing all differentially expressed genes with all differentially open chromatin peaks (A), a strong positive correlation is observed when this analysis is performed for genes that significantly (p&lt;0.05) change in both transcription and promoter accessibility (B). Strikingly, of these differentially accessible promoters with significantly changed transcripts, 58% (18/31) contain a Trl and z motifs. We have added a table outlining these genes (Table 3, Supplementary file 3).</p><p>This analysis thus further confirms the enrichment of <italic>Pc</italic>-binding motifs in the promoters that are differentially regulated in aging ISCs. We have added and clarified this in the text [Results].</p><p>2) A âpseudo bulkâ transcriptome analysis was performed on the combined ISC Clusters 1, 3 and 4 in our scRNA-seq and compared with our bulk RNAseq from sorted ISCs. This analysis shows a significant correlation of differentially expressed genes when comparing young with mid-aged and young with old samples (correlation is weaker in the second comparison, potentially due to an age-related increase of transcriptional noise). We have added this analysis as new Figure 2âfigure supplement 2, Results.</p><p>3) To understand which clusters contribute most to the age-associated changes we observed in our bulk RNA-seq, we performed pseudo bulk analysis and GSEA on each individual cluster and compared differences between mid-aged vs. young and old vs. young cells. Genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated in our bulk RNA-seq (for either the mid vs. young and old vs. young comparisons) were used for GSEA. We compiled this analysis into new Figure 2âfigure supplement 3. This analysis shows that the differentially regulated genes found in our bulk RNA-seq at mid and old ages are also changed at corresponding timepoints in our scRNA-seq. Importantly, the analysis shows that these changes are most significant in the ISC and progenitor cell clusters (#1-4), not differentiated cell types (Clusters #5-7). These results confirm the robustness and complementarity of both our bulk and scRNA-seq datasets. We have clarified this in the main text [Results].</p><p>4) We would also like to re-iterate the findings we had already reported in the original submission, namely that the gene expression changes observed in the bulk RNA-seq likely reflect the acquisition of an âoldâ ISC state from a âyoungâ ISC state. As we originally described in the main text [Results], we performed trajectory analyses from Cluster 1 (the young ISCs) to Cluster 4 (composed almost exclusively of old ISCs, Figure 2B) to identify transcriptome trajectories that are affected by aging. A significant portion of genes upregulated in old ISCs in our bulk RNA-seq were also identified in gene modules that show higher expression in Cluster 4 (represented by modules as shown in Figure 2âfigure supplement 5). This analysis shows that a significant number of genes identified in the bulk RNA-seq are also identified in the scRNA-seq and most likely have functional relevance in driving the transition of a âyoungâ ISC into an âoldâ ISC state.</p><p>Overall, these results confirm that the bulk RNA-seq data (which provide more robust and deep quantification of the transcriptome) and the scRNA-seq data (which of course allow better resolution of cell lineages) complement each other. We have clarified this in the main text as described above and in the Discussion.</p><p>In addition to points described above, we have also added tables that better illustrate the changes we found in ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and scRNA-seq (Tables 1-6 in Supplementary files 1-6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Add rescue experiments for most of knockdown and RNAi experiment;</p></disp-quote><p>The requested ârescueâ experiments were not specified by the reviewers, and we have tried to respond to this request as best we can, by providing further technical validation of our knockdown experiments (A), and by performing genetic interaction studies to rescue phenotypes associated with specific knockdown experiments (B):</p><p>A) To validate our knockdown experiments technically, we have used standard approaches used in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: we have performed knock downs with distinct RNAi lines targeting the same gene and observed the same phenotypes, and have also confirmed phenotypes using germline loss of function alleles of the gene of interest:</p><p>â We used two different RNAi lines targeting the <italic>Pc</italic> gene and two targeting the E(z) gene (both <italic>Pc</italic> and E(z) are critical for canonical <italic>Pc</italic> complex function). All four RNAi lines produced the same phenotype supporting the conclusion that <italic>Pc</italic>/E(z) are required for EE cell differentiation.</p><p>â Knockdown or heterozygous loss of function mutants of <italic>trx</italic>, the antagonist of <italic>Pc</italic>, led to the opposite phenotype of <italic>Pc</italic> knockdown (more EEs), thus providing further support for our conclusion that <italic>Pc</italic> and <italic>trx</italic> complexes regulate EE differentiation.</p><p>In addition, the RNAi lines we used have been validated in previous studies.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>RNAI line</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>E(z)-RNAi BL36068</td><td>Abdusselamoglu et al., 2019</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Pc</italic>-RNAi BL36070; E(z)-RNAi BL33659</td><td>Kang et al., 2015</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Trx</italic>-RNAi (GD37715)</td><td>Smith et al., 2013</td></tr><tr><td>Puc-RNAi (GD3018)</td><td>Hu and Jasper, 2019</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>B) Another interpretation of the request to provide ârescueâ experiment would be a phenotypic rescue. To address this, we performed the following experiments:</p><p>â The scute gene (an EE specification factor) was downregulated in our RNA-seq after <italic>Pc</italic> knockdown. To test whether overexpression of scute could rescue the loss of EE differentiation after <italic>Pc</italic> knockdown, we overexpressed scute and simultaneously knocked down <italic>Pc</italic> in the ISC lineage. This experiment showed that scute is able to rescue the loss of EEs after <italic>Pc</italic> depletion, thus confirming that it acts downstream of <italic>Pc</italic> (now reported in Figure 5).</p><p>â We generated transheterozygotes of the <italic>trx</italic> and <italic>Pc</italic> loss of function alleles <italic>trx<sup>E2</sup></italic> and <italic>Pc<sup>1</sup></italic> to ask whether reducing the gene dose of <italic>Pc</italic> would rescue the increase in EE cells observed in <italic>trx</italic> heterozygotes. Indeed, we observed such a rescue (now reported in Figure 5), further validating the results of our RNAi knockdown experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Other additional data to support the logics between central claims and omics data.</p></disp-quote><p>We were a bit baffled by this request, as it doesnât specify what exactly is expected. Our study identifies an age-related shift in ISC specification towards the EE fate. This shift was identified by our bulk RNA-seq analysis and supported by ATAC-seq and single cell RNA-seq analyses, which at the same time linked changes in <italic>Pc</italic>-regulated gene expression to this shift in EE specification. As far as we can tell, our findings and conclusions follow logically from the analysis of the omics datasets and were then also supported by genetic studies.</p><p>Nevertheless, to provide additional support for our conclusions, we have performed the additional bioinformatics analysis described above and have also performed the genetic interaction studies described above between <italic>Pc</italic> and scute and between <italic>Pc</italic> and <italic>trx</italic>. All these studies further support our central claims and we believe that the study is now significantly stronger.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We also suggest that you try to address the additional comments in the reviews, but these are not essential.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The paper by Tauc et al. uses the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine to investigate age-related changes in ISC lineage fidelity. The authors show that ISCs exhibit transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility changes through deregulating of Polycomb target genes and activating JNK, which contributing to dysplasia in aging flies. This is an important finding which may lead to effective perturbation of PcG gene regulation of the age-related loss in tissue homeostasis. However, some results need to be presented with more details and rigorously.</p><p>1) Figure 1A. the number of flies in mid-age, old, geriatric groups only have 3 for ATAC-seq and RNA-seq. It would be nice to increase the number of flies in these groups to 6 and the same to the young group. Moreover, it's surprising to see 7 flies in the young group in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. Rather than using only 3 flies for each group, in these experiments, each n represents a group of ~120 flies that were manually dissected, and whose intestines were dissociated and FACS sorted. The number of flies used is described in the figure legends and in the Materials and methods section, and we have now clarified this in the text [Results].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The number of cells present in Figure 2A is not shown and not compared with the estimated numbers from literature, which presents the quality of the ATAC-seq and RNA-seq.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have added the number of cells analyzed to the main text [Results] as well as to the Materials and methods section. Of note, Figure 2A is a separate single-cell RNA-seq experiment and does not reflect the quality of the bulk ATAC-seq or RNA-seq experiments described in Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3B why there is no mid-age group to quantify the proportion of EEs and EE progenitors cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3B is a confirmation experiment to support the conclusions drawn from Figure 3A and as such we had refrained from including another group of labor-intensive dissections to this analysis. The question addressed in 3B is whether the age-dependent increase in Pros+ cells is observed independent of the genetic background, and analysis young and old cohorts is sufficient to answer that question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4A There is a mislabeling in the top of relative H3K27me27. Since H3K27me1 and H3K27me2 are also deposited in different chromatin domains to activate transcription, however, the H3K27me1 changes are missing in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noting this typo â we have corrected the label from H3K27me27 to H3K27me2. H3K27me1 was unfortunately not a modification included in the panel of antibodies used for this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, there is no statistics analysis in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the lack of statistics. We have added p-Values to the table. P-Values were calculated by a t-test for two biological replicates and two technical replicates per biological replicate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>No scale bar in Figure 4C and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the lack of scale bars. We have added them to both figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Did the author investigate expression changes of polycomb repressive complex 2, such as Pc or E(z) in aging flies?</p></disp-quote><p>The expression levels of <italic>Pc</italic> complex genes such as <italic>Pc</italic> and E(z) as well as <italic>trx</italic> complex genes were not significantly changed on a transcriptional level during aging. We did not investigate the binding of these complexes and speculate that aging most likely affects post-transcriptional regulation and/or function. We have now mentioned this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors found transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility changes prime ISCs toward the EE lineage in aging flies, related with Polycomb genes. Then they confirmed the necessity of Pc for EE specification, and long-term Pc knock-down in aging also reduced dysplasia levels. Finally, they found commensal dysbiosis-mediated JNK activation causes EE increases.</p><p>This work is rigorous and well-grounded, elucidating intrinsic changes in the aging ISCs and how these changes impact ISC lineage fidelity, further, age-related pathologies. They covered Polycomb genes as key regulators of ISC lineage identity, providing a fundamental understanding of aging.</p><p>1) A numbered summary of any substantive concerns:</p><p>a) In chromatin accessibility analysis on aging ISCs, the authors performed a motif analysis on differentially accessible promoter regions, and found an enrichment for Trl and z motifs. Are there differences between up-regulated promoter regions and down-regulated ones?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an interesting point. Promoters containing Trl and z motifs that were more accessible in old ISCs did not show GO term or pathway enrichment. Less accessible promoters were enriched for homeobox protein domain-containing genes. More than half the genes that were significantly regulated on both the mRNA and chromatin accessibility level (common genes in Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B and Table 3, Supplementary file 3) contained a Trl and z motif. These data support the conclusion that misregulation of <italic>Pc</italic>/<italic>trx</italic> contributes to mis-regulation of genes and potentially promoter accessibility. We did not further explore the function of the genes containing Trl/z motifs as that would be beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) As the majority of old ISCs reside in an activated cell state (~50%), and the &quot;stressed ISC&quot; population makes up a small percentage (&lt;10%), whether activated or stressed ISCs have relation with EE specification, further affect tissue homeostasis?</p></disp-quote><p>The results from our single cell studies suggests that indeed, only a small population of the ISCs becomes âstressedâ or âdamagedâ. This is a novel finding and suggests that the majority of ISCs maintain a robust transcriptional profile even during aging. We show two clusters (#4 and #8) that we defined as stressed or damaged ISCs. Cluster #8 appears to be a separate population of damaged ISCs that may indicate damage beyond repair or senescence based on pathway enrichment analysis. Cluster #4 cells are still transcriptionally closer to activated ISCs. The relationship between stressed or activated ISCs and EE differentiation remains unclear, but our scRNA-seq data suggest that stressed or activated ISCs and EE-specified ISCs can be defined as separate populations. Future studies to elucidate the relationship between these various populations will be fascinating.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) After knocking down Pc, there is a decrease in accessibility of ISC genes and increased accessibility included homeobox TFs, while ISC proliferation was not affected. How do the authors explain this apparent discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that our description was not clear enough. We do in fact not believe that there is a discrepancy between these findings. We find that <italic>Pc</italic> knockdown in ISCs does not have a significant effect on ISC proliferation and, accordingly, we did not observe a change in accessibility of promoters at proliferation genes. Rather than affecting proliferation, it is possible that the differential accessibility of promoters at the ISC genes esg and spdo as well as the homeobox genes Lim1, Abd-B, oc and CG4328, contributes to shifts in cell identity and lineage specification. Further studies will be needed to dissect the contribution of each of these genes to the aging phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And what about EE genes? Is there a decrease in accessibility of EE genes after knocking down Pc in ISCs?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe an obvious decrease in accessibility of known EE genes after knocking down <italic>Pc</italic>. But we did observe a decrease in the mRNA expression of critical EE specification genes, such as <italic>ase</italic>, <italic>sc</italic> and <italic>phyl</italic>, suggesting that critical EE specification genes are regulated on a level that is independent of their promoter chromatin accessibility. We have clarified this in the text [Results].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) For the comment that &quot;while the increase in EE cell numbers was repeatedly and robustly observed in animals that exhibited age-related epithelial dysplasia, we noticed that in animals that exhibited reduced dysplasia, the increase in EE cells was less pronounced&quot;, please explain it more clearly. (It seems no data shown to support the comment)</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity of this statement. We have changed this sentence to the following in the text:</p><p>âthe increase in EE cell numbers was robustly and consistently observed in animals that exhibited age-related epithelial dysplasia. In old animals that did not exhibit dysplasia, however, the increase in EE cells was less pronounced.â</p><p>Additionally, Figure 6âfigure supplement 1 shows data on how dysplasia levels correlate with EE numbers. Note that even in some aged intestines, low dysplasia levels correlate with low EE number.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The increase of H3K27me3 from young to old flies is 24%, does the H3K27me3 signal exhibit broader coverage and increased intensity at transcriptional start sites, like HSC and muscle SC?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question that we cannot answer yet. In this report, we only focused on overall H3K27me2/3 signal in whole midgut preparations and did not pursue ChIP-seq as the material we could obtain from ISCs is very limited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this perspective, Tauc et al. preformed genome-wide chromatin accessibility and transcriptome analysis as well as single cell RNA-seq to explore stem cell- intrinsic changes in the aging <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine. They found Pc-mediated chromatin regulation can determine the EE cell specification and ratio in the aged <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine. Given somatic stem cell is a critical model for regeneration and aging field, the incentive for such a well-compiled comparative study is obvious. However, the deliverables that this ambitious plan eventually offered are relatively weak.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for characterizing our study as well-compiled and would like to respectfully disagree that the results we present are ârelatively weakâ. We do in fact find an unexpected shift in lineage specification in the ISC lineage of aging flies, and provide evidence that changes in <italic>Pc</italic> gene regulation causes this shift. These findings are a direct consequence of the combination of RNAseq, ATACseq and scRNAseq approaches and would not have been possible without these. We have now added additional genetic interaction studies to probe this model further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First, the authors picked the cherry of Polycomb (Pc) solely used an excuse from motif analysis of ATAC-seq, which largely lower their value of key data from RNA-seq and Single-cell analyses. What are the envisions from enrichment of DNA repair and TNFalpha/NFkB signaling from Single-cell sequencing, and enrichment of glutathione metabolic process and drug metabolism from RNA-seq ?</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree that the findings that changes in <italic>Pc</italic> gene regulation contribute to the age-related shift in lineage specification are of âlow valueâ. The biological insight here is critical and novel, and strongly supported by the data: The motif analysis clearly indicates enrichment for Trl and z motifs in differentially accessible promoters in aged ISCs. Furthermore, Abd-B and Ubx (classic Polycomb targets) are among the top upregulated genes in aged ISCs, strongly suggesting a role for Polycomb during aging. We have edited the text to better highlight the importance of these findings (Results). As described above (Response to Essential revisions point 2), we have now also added additional data from genetic interaction experiments that support a role for <italic>Pc</italic> in EE lineage specification (Figure 5).</p><p>The increase in glutathione metabolic processes as well as DNA repair and TNFalpha/NFkB signaling in aged ISCs have been previously reported. The well-established inflammatory environment in old midguts contributes to elevated oxidative stress and an accumulation of reactive oxygen species in ISCs, further exacerbated by the loss of the master antioxidant response regulator, CncC/Nrf2 (Hochmuth et al., 2011). Increased oxidative stress is linked to increases in DNA damage in ISCs (Park et al., 2012). Thus, the enrichment for these processes is not novel and reflects what has already been shown in the literature. We have now better explained and discussed this in the text [Results].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did they regulated by Pc as well or response for increase of EE cells ?</p></disp-quote><p>The wording of the question is confusing, but we ascertained that it asked whether the upregulation/enrichment of DNA damage/glutathione metabolism in old ISCs is a response to the increase in EEs. We have not addressed the consequences of higher EE numbers on intestinal homeostasis, however, a previous study reported that overproduction of EEs results in higher ISC proliferation and decreased lifespan (Amcheslavsky et al., 2014). Our studies indicate that higher JNK activity promotes EE differentiation and higher EE numbers may promote ISC proliferation and tissue dysplasia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An upregulation of neuronal genes was also found by the authors and their previous study, why this has not been considered by functional assay. And, though the author presented a series of RNAi and knockdown assay to show the effects, there is no single rescue experiment was conducted in parallel.</p></disp-quote><p>The upregulation of neuronal genes most likely reflects the increase in EE cell differentiation, as many genes expressed in neurons are also expressed in EEs (Guo et al., 2019; Hartenstein, Takashima and Adams, 2010).</p><p>As to the second part of the question, we have discussed this in the common response above, and now have included the following rescue experiments:</p><p>Concomitant overexpression of wild-type <italic>sc</italic> with <italic>Pc</italic>-RNAi that showing that <italic>sc</italic> is able to rescue the loss of EE after <italic>Pc</italic> knockdown. Combining <italic>Pc</italic> and <italic>Trx</italic> loss of function alleles shows that loss of <italic>Pc</italic> can rescue the loss of <italic>Trx</italic>-mediated increase in EE specification (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, at the end of single cell section, the authors claimed that scRNA-seq data revealed that the upregulation of EE genes in aged ISCs observed by bulk RNA-seq. This will cause a further question if this particular case of EE-genes could be extrapolated to other clusters of cells and pathways, not to mentions that ATAC-seq signatures were not integrated. The author could give a clear description of how many DEGs in RNA-seq that could validated by scRNA-seq? in which clusters, the sc-RNA is most consistent with RNA, did they correlated with cell numbers?</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our answer to point 1 of the Essential revisions requested above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How much variation of expression of Polycomb target genes could explained by shift of promoters peaks ?</p></disp-quote><p>A strong positive correlation is observed for genes that significantly (p&lt;0.05) change in both transcription and promoter accessibility (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B). Strikingly, of these differentially accessible promoters with significantly changed transcripts, 58% (18/31) contain a Trl and z motifs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the method and parameters used in the study are unclear, with only the package name was given in most case. And, it looks the author used different methods to map and identify DEGs in Bulk RNA-seq and RNAi experiments. There is clear and huge evidence to show that different pipelines and combinations of software can get a completely different output. So, it is really weird distinct methods were used for two sets of RNA-seq analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have re-done the analyses using the same pipeline and have updated Figure 5 and the text to reflect the new analysis. Differentially expressed genes after <italic>Pc</italic>RNAi or <italic>Trx</italic>-RNAi were overall consistent with our previous analysis: loss of <italic>Pc</italic> resulted in upregulation of proteolytic genes and a decrease in key EE specification genes such as <italic>ase</italic>. A minor discrepancy was observed in the statistical significance for some genes, such as some proteolytic genes as well as <italic>sc</italic> and <italic>phyl</italic>. The expression of these genes, however, is consistently increased (for the proteolytic genes) and decrease (for <italic>sc</italic> and <italic>phyl</italic>) upon <italic>Pc</italic> knockdown. We now have added graphs to (Figure 5C and added Figure 5âfigure supplement 2) to illustrate the actual rpkm values and up- and down-regulation of these genes. The new analysis consistently showed that loss of <italic>trx</italic> results in an upregulation of EE genes and cell cycle genes. Furthermore, GSEA shows a positive enrichment for GO terms such as central nervous system neuron differentiation, peptide hormone secretion and insulin secretion, highly indicative of EE characteristics. The upregulation of key EE genes after <italic>trx</italic>-RNAi and a downregulation upon <italic>Pc</italic>-RNAi consistently supports the conclusion that PcG and <italic>trx</italic>G act antagonistically in the ISC decision between EE and EC fate. Ultimately, the conclusions from these experiments remain consistent with our previous conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After all, the major difficulty in analyzing such a dataset lies in the well-define strategies for cross-omics data. Although there have been some international joint-ventures to systematically catalogue the signatures and changes. The amount of method generated so far are still far from comprehensive and requires huge amounts of comparisons. To enable this dataset to make meaningful predictions, novel informatic algorithms was encouraged to be designed in this study which would make full use of generated resources.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that further analysis of the generated datasets will be very interesting. Our manuscript highlights one conclusion that we believe is biologically meaningful and we have performed experiments to test the emerging hypothesis with rigorous genetic analysis. As pointed out by the other reviewers, these findings are interesting and important, and we do not think that we would have arrived at these conclusions without the transcriptomics and epigenomic analysis presented here. Since all the raw data generated will be posted online, we look forward to additional analysis performed on these datasets with new algorithms that may provide new hypotheses to be tested in the future.</p><p>References:</p><p>Abdusselamoglu, M.
