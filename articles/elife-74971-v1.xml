This computation is greatly complicated by observer motion, which causes most objects to move across the retinal image. How the visual system detects scene-relative object motion during self-motion is poorly understood. Human behavioral studies suggest that the visual system may identify local conflicts between motion parallax and binocular disparity cues to depth and may use these signals to detect moving objects. We describe a novel mechanism for performing this computation based on neurons in macaque middle temporal (MT) area with incongruent depth tuning for binocular disparity and motion parallax cues. Neurons with incongruent tuning respond selectively to scene-relative object motion, and their responses are predictive of perceptual decisions when animals are trained to detect a moving object during self-motion. This finding establishes a novel functional role for neurons with incongruent tuning for multiple depth cues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>depth perception</kwd><kwd>binocular vision</kwd><kwd>motion perception</kwd><kwd>central visual pathways</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY013644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeAngelis</surname><given-names>Gregory C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS118246</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angelaki</surname><given-names>Dora E</given-names></name><name><surname>DeAngelis</surname><given-names>Gregory C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY001319</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeAngelis</surname><given-names>Gregory C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neural recordings from macaque area MT reveal a novel mechanism for detecting moving objects during self-motion, involving neurons with incongruent tuning for depth from motion parallax and binocular disparity cues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When an observer moves through the environment, image motion on the retina generally includes components caused by self-motion and objects that move relative to the scene, both of which depend on the depth structure of the scene. Because self-motion typically causes a complex pattern of image motion across the visual field (optic flow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson et al., 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koenderink and van Doorn, 1987</xref>), detecting the movement of objects relative to the world can be a difficult task for the brain to solve. An object that is moving in the world might appear to move faster or slower in the image than objects that are stationary in the scene, depending on the specific viewing geometry. Thus, a critical computational challenge for detecting scene-relative object motion is to identify components of image motion that are not caused by oneâs self-motion and the static depth structure of the scene. This is a form of causal inference problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shams and Beierholm, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">French and DeAngelis, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Object movement may be relatively easy to distinguish from self-motion when the objectâs temporal motion profile is clearly different from that of image motion resulting from self-motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Layton and Fajen, 2016a</xref>) or when the object moves in a direction that is incompatible with self-motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Royden and Connors, 2010</xref>). Neural mechanisms with center-surround interactions in velocity space have been proposed as potential solutions to the problem of detecting object motion under these types of conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Royden and Holloway, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Royden et al., 2015</xref>). However, the brain has a remarkable ability to detect object motion even under conditions in which the image velocity of a moving object is very similar to that of stationary background elements during self-motion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rushton et al., 2007</xref> demonstrated that object movement relative to the scene âpops outâ when 3D structure is specified by binocular disparity cues but not in the absence of disparity cues. They suggested that disparity cues help the visual system to discount the global flow field resulting from self-motion, thereby identifying object motion. How the brain might achieve this computation has remained a mystery.</p><p>We previously reported that many neurons in area MT have incongruent tuning for depth defined by binocular disparity and motion parallax cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nadler et al., 2013</xref>). We speculated that such neurons might play a role in detecting object motion during self-motion by responding selectively to local conflicts between disparity and motion parallax cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nadler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2016a</xref>). Here, we test this hypothesis directly by recording from MT neurons while monkeys perform a task that requires detecting object motion during self-motion. We show that monkeys perform this task based mainly on local differences in depth as cued by disparity and motion parallax. We demonstrate that MT neurons with incongruent tuning for depth based on disparity and motion parallax are generally more sensitive to scene-relative object motion than neurons with congruent tuning. We show that MT neurons that respond with a consistent preference for scene-relative object motion are predictive of the animalsâ perceptual decisions and that training a linear decoder to detect object motion based on MT responses largely reproduces our main empirical results. We also show that selectively decoding neurons with incongruent tuning yields better performance than decoding congruent neurons. Our findings establish a novel mechanism for detecting moving objects during self-motion, thus revealing a sensory substrate for a specific form of causal inference. Because this mechanism relies on sensitivity to local discrepancies between disparity and motion parallax cues, it allows detection of object motion without the need for more complex computations that discount the global flow field. Thus, this local mechanism may be relatively economical for the nervous system to implement and likely provides a complementary approach to mechanisms for computing scene-relative object motion based on optic flow parsing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rushton and Warren, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Warren and Rushton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Warren and Rushton, 2009b</xref>, a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Layton and Fajen, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Niehorster and Li, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Layton and Niehorster, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Layton and Fajen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peltier et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded from 123 well-isolated single neurons in area MT of two macaques that were trained to perform an object motion detection task during self-motion (53 neurons from monkey 1 [M1] and 70 from monkey 2 [M2]). We begin by describing the task and behavioral data, followed by analysis of the responses of isolated MT neurons during this task. Finally, we demonstrate that a simple linear decoder trained to perform the task based on responses of our MT population can recapitulate our main findings.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stimulus configuration and behavioral task</title><p>During neural recordings, monkeys viewed a display consisting of two square planar objects that were defined by random dot patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; see Methods for details). The animal viewed these objects while being translated (0.5 Hz modified sinusoid, see Methods) along an axis in the fronto-parallel plane which corresponded with the preferred-null motion axis of the neuron under study. In the base condition of the task with no cue conflict between depth from disparity and motion parallax, both objects were simulated to be stationary in the world, such that their image motion was determined by the self-motion trajectory and the location of the objects in depth. When the objects were stationary in the world, their depth defined by motion parallax and disparity cues was the same, hence the difference in depth between the two cues was zero (ÎDepth = d<sub>MP</sub> â d<sub>BD</sub> = 0).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Object detection task and behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the moving object detection task.

The video shows a sequence of seven stimuli, which are sorted by their ÎDepth values (ÎDepth = â1.53, â0.57, â0.21, 0, 0.21, 0.57, and 1.53 deg). The depth of the stationary object in each stimulus is labeled and was chosen randomly. In the actual experiment, the fixation target was stationary in the world, and the motion platform moved the animal and screen sinusoidally along an axis in the fronto-parallel plane (here a horizontal axis). Thus, the video shows the scene from the viewpoint of the moving observer. The stimulus sequences are equivalent to a situation in which the observer remains stationary, and the entire scene is translated in front of the observer. For each ÎDepth value, two full cycles of the stimulus are shown for display purposes; in the actual experiment, each trial consisted of just one cycle. During the second cycle of each stimulus in the video, the text label indicates whether the dynamic object was on the left or right side of the display. Red and green dots in the video denote the stereo half-images for the left and right eyes. Note that, without viewing the images stereoscopically and tracking the fixation target, it is generally not possible to determine the location of the dynamic object from the image motion on the display.</p></caption></media><p>In other conditions (ÎDepth â  0), one of the objects was stationary in the world while the second âdynamicâ object moved in space such that its depth defined by motion parallax, d<sub>MP</sub>, was not consistent with its depth defined by binocular disparity, d<sub>BD</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>; see Methods for details). As a result of this cue conflict between disparity and motion parallax, the dynamic object should appear to be moving in the world based on previous work in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rushton et al., 2007</xref>). As ÎDepth becomes greater in magnitude, it should be easier for the animal to correctly determine which object is the dynamic object. Animals indicated their decision by making a saccade to one of two targets that appeared at the locations of the two objects at the end of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Critically, due to the experimental design (see Methods for details), animals could not simply detect the dynamic object based on its retinal image velocity since the stationary object(s) in the display also moved on the retina due to self-motion combined with depth variation.</p><p>Average psychometric functions for the two animals across 104 recording sessions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. As expected, the animals perform at chance when ÎDepth = 0, and their percent correct increases with the magnitude of ÎDepth. This demonstrates that monkeys can perform the task as expected from human behavioral work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rushton et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, we found that performance was near chance levels in a control experiment without binocular disparity cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), as also expected from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rushton et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The ranges of depths of the stationary and dynamic objects were overlapping but not identical (see Methods). To determine whether the animals primarily made their decisions based on ÎDepth and not based upon the individual depths specified by disparity or motion parallax, we performed a logistic regression analysis to determine how animals perceptually weighted depth from motion parallax (|d<sub>MP</sub>|), depth from binocular disparity (|d<sub>BD</sub>|), and the magnitude of ÎDepth (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mfenced close="|" open="|" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal"> </mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> ; see Methods for details). Results show that animals primarily weighted the |ÎDepth| cue to make their decisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>), although there were small contributions from the individual depth cues. We initially trained each animal to perform the task with four objects present in the display (three stationary objects and one dynamic object), as well as three different pedestal depths, to make it more difficult for animals to rely on d<sub>MP</sub> or d<sub>BD</sub>. Indeed, we found that the logistic regression weights were also strongly biased in favor of |ÎDepth| in the four-object version of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3D, E</xref>). To increase the number of stimulus repetitions we could perform during recording experiments, we simplified the task to the two-object case.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Congruency of depth preferences and responses to dynamic objects</title><p>We measured the tuning of well-isolated MT neurons for depth defined by either binocular disparity or motion parallax cues, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nadler et al., 2013</xref>, see also Methods).

Note that, for all of the example cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâC</xref>, responses to binocular disparity are substantially greater than responses to motion parallax.

This allows the reader to determine the depth value for each cue that is associated with a dynamic object having a particular ÎDepth value.

In this case, there are a few dynamic objects for which the neuronâs response (blue) clearly exceeds the response to stationary objects of all different depth values (red). More specifically, this incongruent cell responds most strongly to dynamic objects that have large near depths defined by motion parallax and depths near the plane of fixation (0 deg) as defined by binocular disparity.

For this cell, peak responses to stationary and dynamic objects are similar, but the neuron responds more strongly to dynamic objects over most of the stimulus range. Since we applied our ÎDepth manipulation around a fixed pedestal depth of â0.45 deg (to facilitate decoding, see Methods), we do not expect dynamic objects to preferentially activate every opposite cell. However, cells that are preferentially activated by dynamic objects should tend to be neurons with mismatched depth tuning for motion parallax and binocular disparity cues.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows that this expected relationship holds across our population of MT neurons.

Neurons with R<sub>MP_BD</sub> &lt; 0 (opposite cells) tend to have peak response ratios that lie in the upper-left quadrant, indicating that opposite cells tend to be preferentially activated by dynamic objects. In contrast, neurons with R<sub>MP_BD</sub> &gt; 0 (congruent cells) tend to have peak response ratios in the lower-right quadrant, indicating that they tend to be preferentially activated by stationary objects. Across the population, peak response ratio is significantly anti-correlated with R<sub>MP_BD</sub> (n=106, Spearman rank correlation, R = â0.39, p=2.8Ã10<sup>â5</sup>), indicating that the hypothesized relationship between tuning congruency and response to scene-relative object motion is observed.</p><p>We further tested whether differences in depth tuning curves for binocular disparity and motion parallax can predict whether neurons prefer positive or negative ÎDepth values.

DP will be greater than 0.5 when responses are greater on trials in which the monkey reported that the stimulus in the RF was the dynamic object.

The corresponding DP value for this neuron was 0.77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, p=0.0015, permutation test), indicating that this neuron shows both strong selectivity for dynamic objects when ÎDepth â  0 and stronger responses when the animal reports a dynamic object in the RF when ÎDepth = 0.</p><p>Data for an example congruent cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DâF</xref>) show a very different pattern of results.

Thus, the data from these two examples neurons support the hypothesis that neurons with preferences for dynamic objects are selectively correlated with perceptual decisions.</p><p>To examine whether this hypothesis holds at the population level, we plotted the DP value for each neuron against the corresponding NP value. These two metrics, which are computed from completely different sets of trials (ÎDepth = 0 for DP; ÎDepth â  0 for NP), are strongly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <italic>R</italic>=0.47, p=3.2Ã10<sup>â6</sup>, n=92, Spearman rank correlation) such that neurons with DP values substantially greater than 0.5 tend to be neurons that are selective for dynamic objects (NP &gt;0.5).

It is also worth noting that all neurons with large DP values (&gt;0.7) also have NP values substantially greater than 0.5. Thus, the MT neurons that most strongly predict decisions to detect the dynamic object (on ambiguous trials) are those with a consistent preference for dynamic objects.</p><p>It is worth noting that the distribution of NP values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> is biased toward values &gt;0.5; indeed, the mean NP value (0.56) is significantly greater than 0.5 (one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t(105</italic>) = 4.98, and p=2.5Ã10<sup>â6</sup>). This effect likely arises due to the distribution of stimulus values involved in the dynamic object condition. Because neurons were generally tested with a pedestal depth of â0.45 deg, the depth values for both disparity and motion parallax tend to be mostly negative for the dynamic object condition (see blue and black x-axes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâF</xref>). This bias toward negative (near) depth values of dynamic objects, combined with the fact that most neurons have a near preference for depth from motion parallax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), means that many neurons (including congruent cells) tend to have mean responses to dynamic objects that are greater than the mean response to stationary objects (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This asymmetry leads to a mean NP value &gt;0.5.</p><p>How is the result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> related to neuronsâ preference for dynamic relative to stationary objects? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref> shows that NP is robustly correlated with peak response ratio (<italic>R</italic>=0.43, p=4.5Ã10<sup>â6</sup>, Spearman rank correlation). Neurons with peak response ratios substantially greater than unity almost always have NP &gt;0.5. However, some neurons with peak response ratios near unity also have high NP values (including the neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, F</xref>). In contrast, we did not find a significant correlation between DP and peak response ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>: <italic>R</italic>=0.12, p=0.25). A main reason for this appears to be that there is a cluster of neurons with large peak response ratios that have DP values near 0.5. These neurons generally have tuning properties similar to the example cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, E</xref>. While incongruent tuning creates a clear preference for dynamic objects for these neurons, that preference is limited to a narrow range of depth values, such that NP values tend to be only modestly &gt;0.5. To achieve high NP values, neurons need to have a consistent preference for dynamic objects (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Thus, what seems to be crucial for producing high DP values is that a neuron consistently prefers dynamic objects over the range tested. This explains the robust correlation between DP and NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) and the weak correlation between DP and peak response ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, incongruent tuning tends to lead to a preference for dynamic objects (high peak response ratio, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), but does not always lead to high DP values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the time course of choice-related activity and found that it appeared within a few hundred ms after the onset of self-motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This choice-related activity was largely sustained throughout the rest of the stimulus period, even when motion of the object was in the anti-preferred direction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Decoding model</title><p>The results described above suggest that perceptual detection of dynamic objects might be driven by the activity of MT neurons with depth tuning curves that make them respond preferentially to dynamic objects. To further probe this hypothesis, we trained a simple linear decoder to detect dynamic objects based on simulated responses of a population of neurons that is closely based on our data, and we examined whether performance of the decoder shows a similar relationship between DP and NP (see Methods for details).</p><p>In the simulation (as in the experiments), the dynamic object could appear in either the right or left hemi-field, and the decoder was trained to report the location of the dynamic object.

However, this is not surprising given that neurons in this simulation were assumed to have independent noise. It is well established that neurons in MT exhibit correlated noise (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zohary et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang and Lisberger, 2009</xref>) and that choice-related activity is expected to be stronger in the presence of correlated noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shadlen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haefner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pitkow et al., 2015</xref>).

Moreover, neurons with a consistent preference for dynamic objects tend to more strongly predict perceptual decisions regarding object motion relative to the scene. While it has been established that humans can detect object motion based on cue conflicts between binocular disparity and motion parallax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rushton et al., 2007</xref>), in the absence of other cues to object motion, the neural basis of this capacity has remained unknown. Our findings establish a simple neural mechanism for detecting moving objects, which can be computed locally and is complementary to flow-parsing mechanisms that involve more global computations (discussed further below). In addition, our findings establish another important function for neurons with mismatched tuning for multiple stimulus cues, building on recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goncalves and Welchman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sasaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sasaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2019a</xref>).

However, such a model would not be able to detect object motion under task conditions like ours or those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rushton et al., 2007</xref>, because our dynamic object had the same motion axis as the stationary distractors and because the speeds of our dynamic objects were well within the range of speeds of stationary objects. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Royden et al., 2015</xref> have added disparity-tuned operators to their model, which allow detection of object motion even when it is aligned with background flow lines. This model computes local differences in response of separate velocity and disparity-tuned operators. It then applies an arbitrary threshold to detect cases for which there are differences and identifies these as possible object motion. While this model shows that differences in signals related to motion and disparity can be used to identify object motion in more general cases, it does not provide a biologically plausible neural mechanism.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate a key, and apparently thus far unappreciated, neural mechanism for identifying local discrepancies between binocular disparity and motion parallax cues that accompany moving objects, even in difficult cases for which there are no local differences in the direction or timing of image motion. The activity of MT neurons with incongruent depth tuning for motion parallax and disparity provides a critical signal about these local discrepancies. Moreover, our simulations indicate that these signals can be easily read out by a linear decoder to detect object motion during self-motion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relationship to flow-parsing mechanism for computing scene-relative object motion</title><p>A more general approach to computing scene-relative object motion during self-motion is flow parsing, in which global patterns of background motion related to self-motion are discounted (i.e. subtracted off) such that the remaining signal represents object motion relative to the scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rushton and Warren, 2005</xref>). Several studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Warren and Rushton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Warren and Rushton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Warren and Rushton, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Warren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foulkes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rushton et al., 2018</xref> have provided strong behavioral support for the flow-parsing hypothesis in humans, including some which suggest strongly that it involves a global motion process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Warren and Rushton, 2009b</xref>). In addition, a recent study has demonstrated flow parsing in macaque monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peltier et al., 2020</xref>). If flow parsing completely discounts background motion due to self-motion, then the computations for detecting scene-relative object motion would be greatly simplified and would be essentially the same as when there is no self-motion. However, flow parsing alone may not be sufficient to detect scene-relative object motion. Recent evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Niehorster and Li, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peltier et al., 2020</xref>) indicates that the gain of flow parsing can be well below unity, such that background motion is only partially discounted. In this case, the output of a flow-parsing mechanism may not be sufficient to detect scene-relative object motion, and a mechanism such as we found in area MT would be valuable.</p><p>An advantage of our proposed mechanism over flow parsing is that it does not require estimation of the global flow field, nor a complicated mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Layton and Fajen, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Layton and Fajen, 2020</xref>) for implementing the flow-parsing computation at each location in the visual field. Thus, our proposed mechanism may provide a valuable complement to flow parsing. On the other hand, the mechanism that we have described clearly does not obviate the need for flow-parsing mechanisms. Unlike our local mechanism, flow parsing does not require binocular disparity signals to operate. Furthermore, flow parsing allows for the estimation of scene-relative object velocity, rather than just facilitating object motion detection. Thus, our results do not discount the contributions of center-surround or flow-parsing mechanisms to computation of object motion, nor the contributions of mechanisms that may rely on multisensory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2016b</xref>). Rather, our findings provide evidence of an additional complementary mechanism that is likely to be synergistic. Indeed, since our stimuli involved peripheral background dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), it is possible that our task also engaged flow-parsing mechanisms to some extent.</p><p>We have recently demonstrated flow parsing in macaque monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peltier et al., 2020</xref>), including the observation that optic flow in one visual hemi-field can influence perception of object direction in the opposite hemi-field, as demonstrated previously in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Warren and Rushton, 2009b</xref>). These observations imply a global contribution to flow parsing, as might be implemented through feedback from the dorsal subdivision of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Layton and Fajen, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Layton and Fajen, 2020</xref>). Indeed, in ongoing work, we have observed that flow parsing modulates responses of MT neurons (unpublished). In contrast, the mechanism described here can be computed locally within each portion of the visual field. Thus, we can speculate that the current findings and flow parsing involve distinct neural mechanisms in area MT.</p><p>Our findings establish the first direct (albeit correlational) evidence for a neural mechanism that is involved in perceptual dissociation of object and self-motion. However, the broader problem is more complex, as it is also necessary to flexibly compensate for self-motion to compute object motion in different coordinate frames, such as head-centered or world-centered reference frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fajen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sasaki et al., 2020</xref>).

In the present study, we demonstrate that such âoppositeâ neurons provide valuable signals for detecting object motion during self-motion by selectively responding to local inconsistencies between binocular disparity and motion parallax cues. Thus, our findings provide novel evidence that the functional roles of MT go well beyond representing retinal image motion; they suggest that some MT neurons play fundamental roles in helping to infer the origins, or causes, of retinal image motion.</p><p>Our findings have parallels to the potential function of neurons in area MSTd and the ventral intraparietal (VIP) area that have mismatched heading tuning for visual and vestibular cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).

The two-object version of the task (one dynamic target and one stationary distractor) was used in all neural recording experiments, whereas the four-object task (one dynamic target and three stationary distractors) was used during training and in some behavioral control experiments.</p><p>For the two-object task, one object was located in the center of the RF of the neuron under study, and the other object was presented on the opposite side of the fixation target (180 deg apart) at the same eccentricity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). For the four-object task, one object was centered on the RF, and the other three objects were distributed equally (90 deg apart) around the fixation target at equal eccentricities. To present each object at the same retinal position regardless of its depth, the positions of objects were initially determined in screen coordinates and then were ray-traced onto surfaces in the simulated environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, left).</p><p>Each object was rendered as a square-shaped âplateâ of random dots (density: 1.1 dots/deg<sup>2</sup>) and was displayed binocularly as a red-green anaglyph. The retinal size of dots was constant (0.15 deg) regardless of object depth, such that dot size was not a depth cue. The target and distractor objects were all of the same retinal size (which was tailored to the RF of the neuron under study) regardless of their location in depth, such that the image size of objects was also not a depth cue. Thus, the only reliable cues to object depth were binocular disparity and motion parallax.</p><p>Dynamic target objects had two independent depth parameters, one based on binocular disparity (d<sub>BD</sub>) and the other based on motion parallax (d<sub>MP</sub>). The left-eye and right-eye half-images of the dynamic object were rendered based on the depth defined by binocular disparity, d<sub>BD</sub>. We then computed the image motion of the dynamic object during translation of the monkey such that it had motion parallax that was consistent with a different depth, d<sub>MP</sub>. Based on the predicted trajectory of the camera on each video frame, we ray-traced the position of the dynamic object (at d<sub>MP</sub>) onto the depth plane defined by binocular disparity, d<sub>BD</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, right). This procedure ensures that the dynamic object had a particular difference in depth (ÎDepth, in equivalent disparity units) specified by (d<sub>MP</sub> â d<sub>BD</sub>), but that it was not possible to detect the dynamic object solely based on its relative motion in the scene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In other words, when viewed monocularly, the image motion of the dynamic object would be consistent with that of a stationary object at d<sub>MP</sub>. When viewed binocularly, if ÎDepth â  0, the dynamic objectâs image motion would not be consistent with its depth specified by disparity, d<sub>BD</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Experimental protocol</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Preliminary measurements</title><p>After isolating the action potential of a single neuron, the RF was explored manually using a small (typically 2â3 deg) patch of random dots. The direction, speed, position, and binocular disparity of the random-dot patch were manipulated using a computer mouse, and instantaneous firing rates were plotted on a display interface that represents the spatial location of the patch in visual space and the stimulus velocity in a direction-speed space. This procedure was used to estimate the location and size of the RF as well as to estimate the neuronâs preferences for direction, speed, and binocular disparity.</p><p>After these qualitative tests, we measured the direction, speed, binocular disparity, and size tuning of each neuron using quantitative protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeAngelis and Uka, 2003</xref>). Each of these measurements was performed in a separate block of trials, and each distinct stimulus was repeated 3â5 times. Direction tuning was measured with random dots that moved in eight different directions separated by 45 deg. Speed tuning was measured, at the preferred direction, with random dot stimuli that moved at speeds of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 deg/s. The stimuli in our main task contained speeds of motion that were &lt;7 deg/s. If a neuron gave very little response (&lt;5 spk/s) to these slow speeds, the neuron was not studied further. Next, the spatial profile of the RF was measured by presenting a patch of random dots at all locations on a 4Ã4 grid that covered the RF. The height and width of the grid were 1.5â2.5 times larger than the estimated RF size, and each small patch was approximately Â¼ the size of the RF. Responses were fitted by a 2D Gaussian function to estimate the center location and size of the RF. To measure binocular disparity tuning, a random dot stereogram was presented at binocular disparities ranging from â2 deg to +2 deg in steps of 0.5 deg. For this disparity tuning measurement, dots moved in the neuronâs preferred direction and speed. Finally, size tuning was measured with random-dot patches having diameters of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 deg.</p><p>Depth tuning from motion parallax was then measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nadler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nadler et al., 2013</xref>). Dots were presented monocularly and were rendered at one of nine simulated depths based on their motion (â2 deg to +2 deg of equivalent disparity in steps of 0.5 deg), in addition to the null condition in which only the fixation target was presented. Each distinct stimulus was repeated 6â10 times. During measurement of depth tuning from motion parallax, animals underwent passive whole-body translation which followed a modified sinusoidal trajectory along an axis in the fronto-parallel plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). To smooth the onset and offset, the 2 s sinusoidal trajectory was multiplied by a Gaussian function that was exponentiated to a large power as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where t<sub>0</sub>=1.0 s, Ï=0.92, and n=22.

On the other half, motion started toward the neuronâs null direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). During body translation, animals were required to maintain fixation on a world-fixed target, which required a compensatory smooth eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Moving object detection task</title><p>We presented one dynamic (i.e. moving) object and one (or three) stationary object(s) while the animal experienced the modified sinusoidal lateral motion as described above. The animal was trained to identify the dynamic object by making a saccadic eye movement to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At the beginning of each trial, the fixation target first appeared at the center of the screen. After the animal established fixation for 0.2 s, the dynamic object, stationary object(s), and background cloud of dots appeared and began to move as the animal was translated sinusoidally for 2.1 s (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Because the fixation target was world-fixed, translation of the animal required a counter-active smooth eye movement to maintain visual fixation. An electronic window around the fixation target was used to monitor and enforce pursuit accuracy. The initial size of the target window was 3â4 deg, and it shrank to 2.1â2.8 deg after 250 ms of translation. This allowed the animal a brief period of time to initiate pursuit and execute a catch-up saccade to arrive on target. At the end of visual stimulation, both the fixation target and the visual stimuli disappeared and a choice target (0.4 deg in diameter) appeared at the center location of each object. The animal then attempted to make a saccadic eye movement to the location of the dynamic object and received a liquid reward (0.2â0.4 ml) for correct answers.</p><p>Based on the preliminary tests described above, we set the axis of translation within the fronto-parallel plane to align with the preferred-null axis of the neuron under study. In the main detection task, we systematically varied the depth discrepancy (ÎDepth) between disparity and motion parallax cues for the dynamic object to manipulate task difficulty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). ÎDepth is defined as the difference between depths specified by motion parallax and binocular disparity cues, (d<sub>MP</sub> â d<sub>BD</sub>). Different values of ÎDepth were applied to the dynamic object around a fixed âpedestal depthâ (red line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). For the vast majority of recording sessions, the pedestal depth was fixed at â0.45 deg (103/106 sessions), although it deviated from this value slightly in a few early experiments. We elected to use a fixed pedestal depth such that all neurons were tested with the same stimulus values, thereby allowing for decoding analyses (described below). The pedestal depth was chosen as the average midpoint between the preferred depths obtained from tuning curves for disparity and motion parallax, based on data from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nadler et al., 2013</xref>). We used the following ÎDepth values: â1.53, â0.57, â0.21, 0, 0.21, 0.57, and 1.53 deg. Stationary objects were presented at one of seven possible depths (â1.6 deg to +1.6 deg in steps of 0.4 deg). The vast majority of recording sessions were conducted using these âstandardâ pedestal depth, ÎDepth, and stationary depth values (101/106 sessions). Thus, the maximum range of depths of dynamic objects (â1.215 to +0.315 deg) was well within the range of depths for stationary objects, which ensured that the animals could not perform the task solely based on depth outliers (either in binocular disparity or motion parallax). The identity of each object (dynamic/stationary) and its depth values were chosen from the above ranges randomly on each trial. Each ÎDepth value of the dynamic object was repeated at least 14 times (mean: 35 and SD: 9.6).</p><p>For three sessions, a monkey performed the object detection task without binocular disparity cues in a fraction of trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, monocular condition). In this control condition, the visual stimulus (except for the fixation point) was displayed to only one eye in 16% of trials, while the rest of the task structure remained the same. Monocular conditions were presented in a small percentage of trials in order not to frustrate the animal, given that performance was poor on these monocular trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Animal training procedure</title><p>Although the object detection task is conceptually simple, it required extensive behavioral training, involving a number of steps. Here, we outline a series of operant conditioning steps required to teach animals to perform the task. Following basic chair training and habituation to the laboratory, animals were trained to maintain visual fixation on a target during sinusoidal translation of the motion platform.</p><p>Once smooth eye movements tracked the fixation target with pursuit gains approaching 0.9, we initially trained animals to detect a moving object without any self-motion, such that any motion of an object on the display resulted from object motion relative to the scene. After fixation, four objects appeared on the display and only one of them moved sinusoidally along a horizontal trajectory for 2.1 s. In the early stages of this training, a saccade target appeared only at the location of the moving object. Subsequently, we introduced a fraction of trials in which saccade targets appeared at the locations of all four objects, and we gradually increased the proportion of these trials. During this phase of training, the depths of the objects, as defined solely by binocular disparity since there was no self-motion, were randomly drawn from a uniform distribution spanning the range from â1.6 to +1.6 deg, to help animals generalize the task.</p><p>Once animals performed the task well in the absence of self-motion, we began to introduce small amounts of sinusoidal self-motion, which induced subtle retinal image motion of all objects. During the initial stages of this training period, the dynamic object had a large motion amplitude such that it was quite salient relative to the motion of stationary objects that was due to self-motion. As the animals became accustomed to performing the task during self-motion, we gradually increased the magnitude of self-motion (up to 2.8 cm) and decreased the motion amplitude of the dynamic object. Once the retinal motion amplitude of the dynamic object became comparable to that of stationary objects, we began to introduce a depth discrepancy between disparity and motion parallax (ÎDepth). That is, the motion trajectory of the dynamic object began to follow that of an object at a different depth, d<sub>MP</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, right). We used a staircase procedure to train animals over a range of values of ÎDepth. During this phase of training, we interleaved three different pedestal depths (â0.51 deg, 0 deg, and 0.51 deg) to help animals generalize the task, and we randomly chose the depths of the three stationary objects from the range â1.6 to +1.6 deg.</p><p>Once we observed stable âv-shapedâ psychometric functions for all three pedestal depths over a span of more than 10 days (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A, B</xref>), we transitioned to the final stimulus configuration for recording experiments. To keep the number of stimulus conditions manageable for recording, this configuration included one pedestal depth and two objects (one dynamic and one stationary). Following recording experiments, we revisited the more general version of the task involving four objects and three pedestal depths to make sure that behavioral performance did not reflect any change in strategy (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analyses</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Regression analysis of behavior</title><p>We used multinomial regression to assess the relative contributions of d<sub>BD</sub>, d<sub>MP</sub>, and ÎDepth to perceptual decisions.

An ROC curve was computed from the pair of response distributions for each ÎDepth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britten et al., 1992</xref>), and performance of the ideal observer was defined as the area under the ROC curve. ROC areas were then plotted as a function of ÎDepth to construct a neurometric function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, E</xref>). To obtain a single measure of NP, we then averaged the ROC areas across non-zero values of ÎDepth to obtain a single metric for each neuron. This average ROC area will be &gt;0.5 if a neuron responds preferentially to dynamic objects overall and &lt;0.5 if it responds preferentially to stationary objects overall.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-6"><title>Detection probability</title><p>DP is a measure of the relationship between neural responses and perceptual decisions in a detection task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bosking and Maunsell, 2011</xref>) and is similar to the choice probability metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britten et al., 1996</xref>). The procedure for computing DP is analogous to the ROC analysis described above, except that responses are sorted into two groups according to the animalâs perceptual decision (dynamic vs. stationary object in the RF). To eliminate any contamination from stimulus effects, only ambiguous trials (ÎDepth = 0) were used to compute DP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A permutation test was used to determine whether each DP value was significantly different from the chance level of 0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uka and DeAngelis, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-7"><title>Decoding analyses</title><p>We constructed an optimal linear decoder to detect moving objects based on simulated responses from a population of 97 model neurons. Model neurons correspond to the dominant subset of recorded neurons for which data were collected under identical stimulus conditions, thus allowing us to construct pseudo-population responses. We randomly selected 100,000 samples of stimulus conditions from the datasets with replacement (16 unique stimulus conditions within the RF). The mean and SD of measured responses to each stimulus condition were then used to generate simulated responses according to the following equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shadlen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen and Newsome, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2014</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ5"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>Î¼</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mo>Ã</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>Ã</mml:mo><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>Âµ</italic> and <italic>Ï</italic> are vectors of means and SDs of the population across stimulus conditions, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is a vector of standard normal deviates (MATLAB ânormrndâ function with zero mean and unity standard deviation), and Q is the square root of the correlation matrix.

A linear decoder was trained to classify whether the stimulus in the RF was a dynamic or stationary object based on population responses in the training set. We used linear discriminant analysis (MATLAB âclassifyâ function) to determine the weights of the decoder. Ambiguous trials (ÎDepth = 0) were excluded from the training set.</p><p>The test set was used to validate performance of the decoder. A DP<sub>pred</sub> was computed for each neuron in the model in the same way we computed DP from the empirical data, except that the decoderâs âchoiceâ for each trial was used instead of the monkeyâs behavioral choice. Specifically, responses to ambiguous stimuli (ÎDepth = 0) in the test set were sorted according to the decoderâs output (dynamic vs. stationary object prediction).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-8"><title>Time course of choice-related responses</title><p>Spikes in the ambiguous trials (ÎDepth = 0) were aligned to stimulus onset, compiled into peri-stimulus time histograms, and then smoothed using a 150 ms boxcar window. Trials were first sorted by the phase of self-motion (phase 0 or phase 180), and then sorted by the animalâs choice (whether the animal chose an object within the RF or not). Average responses were z-scored using a session-wide mean and SD. We plotted the mean and SE of the z-scored responses, as well as the difference in z-scored responses between choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Among these, we completed the object detection task for 106 neurons (47 from M1 and 59 from M2). This set of 106 neurons constitutes the sample for the single neuron analyses of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Except for two neurons, 104 of these 106 neurons were tested using a standard set of ÎDepth values, including zero (47 from M1 and 57 from M2).</p><p>To compute detection probability, we analyzed a subset of these 104 neurons for which the monkey made at least five choices in favor of both target locations when ÎDepth = 0 (92 neurons, 39 from M1 and 53 from M2). For population decoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we required that each dataset contain responses to objects at all of the standard depth values for the stationary object. Three neurons were excluded because they were tested with slightly different stationary depth values, and four neurons were excluded because they did not have responses to stationary objects at all of the standard depth values (which can occur because the depths of stationary objects were chosen randomly from the standard values in each trial). Thus, with these exclusions, 97 neurons contributed to the population decoding analysis (45 from M1 and 52 from M2).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All surgical procedures and experimental protocols were approved by the University Committee on Animal Resources at the University of Rochester (#100682) and were performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74971-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data have been made available on Figshare: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19783624">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19783624</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>HyungGoo</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Angelaki</surname><given-names>ED</given-names></name><name><surname>DeAngelis</surname><given-names>GC</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>A neural mechanism for detecting object motion during self-motion</data-title><source>figshare</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.6084/m9.figshare.19783624</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Johnny Wen for programming assistance, as well as Swati Shimpi, Emily Murphy, and Dina Graf for assistance with training animals.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tirin Moore as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Anirvan S Nandy (Reviewer #2); Oliver W. Layton (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this was an interesting study and with careful controls. During the discussion, there were 3 consensus points that will require addressing in your revision, as you will also see in the individual reviews below.</p><p>1) There should be more discussion of the relationship between the incongruency mechanism explored here and the more general mechanism of flow parsing. How would this mechanism relate to or be combined with or substitute for flow parsing under different conditions?</p><p>2) The authors should perform neurometric analyses and modeling to more directly substantiate their claims. In particular, the population of cells included in this analysis could be more directly tied to populations of cells that include no incongruent cells, include only incongruent cells, or include some range of congruencies, to see directly how these different tunings in a population of cells affect decoding. This would go further than the current less direct analyses, and strengthen conclusions about the role of incongruent cells.</p><p>3) In Figure S2, two reviewers were a bit confused about the implications of a monkey getting the monocular presentation wrong 90-95% of the time, if we are reading that plot correctly. Reviewers expected this to be more like 50% performance. How should this be interpreted?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In this paper, starting in the abstract, the authors emphasize the role played by these incongruent MP/BD neurons. In the discussion, they say (quoting in full because there are no line numbers to reference): &quot;our findings support the idea that a sensory representation consisting of a mixture of congruent and opposite cells provides a useful sensory substrate for causal inference (Rideaux et al. 2021). To our knowledge, these findings provide the first empirical evidence for a specific contribution of opposite neurons to perceptual inference about causes of sensory signals.&quot; However, as far as I could tell, the analyses and modeling never actually pulled out the incongruent neurons in particular to analyze them in isolation or analyze the performance without them. Thus, I had a hard time feeling this claim was supported.</p><p>In particular, in Figure 5G, the authors conclude: &quot;Thus, the MT neurons that most strongly predict decisions to detect the dynamic object (on ambiguous trials) are those with incongruent tuning that makes them selective for dynamic objects.&quot; But this is a bit indirect, because the figure shows correlation between detection probability and neurometric performance, and the neurometric performance is correlated with congruency. Why not just correlate DP with a direct measure of non-congruence?</p><p>(On that same plot (Figure 5G), I'm puzzled why there are so few DP and NP values &lt;0.5, when roughly half of all neurons were congruent in their BD and MP tuning â wouldn't one expect those neurons to have NP&lt;0.5 and DP&lt;0.5?)</p><p>Most generally, I'm still unclear about how much congruent neurons can contribute to these decisions compared to the incongruent ones. Given how well the population decoding works, it would be interesting to know if it still worked this well with *only* congruent or *only* incongruent neurons included. Is there an alternative hypothesis where having a range of different MP vs. BD tunings is what allows correct identification of the moving object, and it's the tuning variability rather than the incongruent neurons per se that matters? One could test this directly by including different ranges of neuronal tunings into a predictive model. Overall, it seems like there should be more direct analyses of the incongruent neuron population to provide support for the strong claims the authors are making about their role.</p><p>2) Figure S2: I'm a little puzzled at how a monkey could get it wrong 95% of the time in the monocular +1.5 degree \Î Depth condition. What's going on there? Doesn't this mean that there *are* monocular cues for solving this task and they're just being interpreted entirely wrongly by the monkey? How should this be interpreted?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would like the authors to consider these two points:</p><p>(A) In each experimental session, the axis of translation was aligned with the preferred axis of the neuron under observation in order to elicit robust responses. What would be the role of these incongruent neurons when self-motion is not aligned to this axis? Will it be possible to show that a population code of such neurons is sufficient to detect dynamic objects in the face of an arbitrary axis of self-motion?</p><p>(B) The authors state that it is not a worthwhile exercise to find model parameters that best match the empirical data, noting that they would have to make assumptions about the structure of correlated noise. It appears that in their dataset they should have several sets of simultaneously recorded neurons (e.g. 70 neurons from 57 sessions in M2). Might these give a hint to this correlation structure?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a few questions and some suggestions that I think would improve the manuscript and better contextualize the findings.</p><p>1. The stimulus in the present study contains background dots in the periphery outside the masked region that produce retinal motion consistent with the observer's self-motion. It would be helpful if the authors clarified the extent to which this peripheral motion may activate MSTd neurons and potentially recruit a flow parsing mechanism. In other words, is it possible that the background motion engages flow parsing, perhaps interacting with the proposed mechanism to some extent?</p><p>2. In several places in the paper (e.g. bottom of p.3, p. 26, and p. 28) the authors' descriptions may be taken to mean that the proposed local mechanism circumvents the need for flow parsing. Some examples: &quot;it allows detection of object motion without the need for more complex computations that discount the global flow field&quot; (p.3); &quot;this mechanismâ¦ may be relatively economical for the nervous system to implement&quot; (p.3); &quot; An advantage of our proposed mechanism over flow parsing is that it does not require estimation of the global flow field, nor a complicated mechanism â¦&quot; (p. 28). Given that the authors acknowledge elsewhere in the manuscript that the proposed mechanism likely complements flow parsing, I think the authors would agree that the proposed mechanism is not a direct substitute in general and rather is likely synergistic (e.g. multiple solutions to the same problem enhance robustness in different contexts, the proposed mechanism may be especially useful when quick reaction time is needed, etc.). Flow parsing is a much broader process and addresses far more than moving object detection. I would suggest rephrasing some of these statements and being cautious with language like &quot;advantages over&quot; flow parsing because the proposed local mechanism is more specialized than flow parsing.</p><p>3. I think the limitations from the public review should be referenced/discussed in the paper.</p><p>4. Warren and Rushton (2009) have demonstrated that humans parse object motion from self-motion to a similar extent regardless of whether the background motion surrounding a moving object is present in a monocular display. Niehorster and Li (2017) found a similar result for stereo optic flow. Simulations by Layton and Fajen (2016; 2020) and Layton and Niehorster (2019) support the hypothesis that a global mechanism plays a primary role. Together, these findings suggest that local mechanisms may play a much smaller role, at least for flow parsing. How do these findings relate to the proposed mechanism?</p><p>5. I found Supplementary Figure 1b very helpful to develop an intuition about the displays (as was the included video). I know figure space is at a premium, but if possible, including Supplementary Figure 1b in the main manuscript would likely help readers because the stimulus design is rather complex.</p><p>6. Aspects of the paragraph related to opposite at the bottom of p. 29 sounded repetitive after reading the previous parts of the paper and I thought they could be condensed/removed.</p><p>7. I found the motion parallax light blue color difficult to see in Figure 2. I would appreciate it if the authors replaced it with a more salient color.</p><p>8 Supplementary Figure 2: Why is the proportion correct so much less than 50% on the monocular task? Given that the monocular task is very challenging and there are two possibilities, I would have expected the proportion correct to be roughly 50%.</p><p>9. p. 7. I don't think I understand the following statement and would appreciate clarification: &quot;â¦animals were translated along an axis in the fronto-parallel plane that was aligned with the preferred-null axis of the neuron under study.&quot; Does fronto-parallel plane mean rotation about the Z axis (axis toward the stimulus)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74971.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this was an interesting study and with careful controls.

Reviewers expected this to be more like 50% performance. How should this be interpreted?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed and resolved all three of these issues. Here is a brief summary of how the consensus points have been addressed, with further details described below. (1) We have added considerable discussion of the relationship between this new mechanism and flow parsing. We agree with Reviewer #3 that they are complementary mechanisms. (2) We have added new single-cell-level analyses of the relationships between incongruency and both detection probability and neurometric performance (new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). We have also now separately decoded incongruent and congruent neurons and demonstrate better performance by incongruent neurons (new Figure 7). (3) We have cleared up the issue of the behavioral control performance. Performance was less 50% because these data came from the 4-alternative version of the task (25% chance level). In addition to addressing these consensus issues, we have addressed all of the other specific points of the reviewers, as detailed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) In this paper, starting in the abstract, the authors emphasize the role played by these incongruent MP/BD neurons. In the discussion, they say (quoting in full because there are no line numbers to reference): &quot;our findings support the idea that a sensory representation consisting of a mixture of congruent and opposite cells provides a useful sensory substrate for causal inference (Rideaux et al. 2021).

Why not just correlate DP with a direct measure of non-congruence?</p></disp-quote><p>These are very reasonable criticisms, and have led us to explore the relationships between incongruency, neurometric performance, and detection probability further. First, we now show (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A) that neurometric performance is significantly correlated with peak response ratio. This result shows that neurons with peak response ratios substantially greater than unity almost always have neurometric performance &gt; 0.5. However, this result also shows that there are neurons with peak response ratios near unity (including slightly less than unity) that also have high neurometric performance (such as the example neuron in Figure 2C,F).</p><p>On the reviewerâs suggestion, we also looked at the relationship between DP and peak response ratio directly, as now shown in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B. Although there is a trend in the expected direction, it is not significant. The main reason for this appears to be that there is a cluster of neurons with large peak response ratios that have DP values near 0.5. Digging into this further, we discovered that these neurons generally have tuning properties similar to the example cell in Figure 2B,E. In cases like this, while incongruent tuning creates a clear preference for dynamic objects, it is limited to a narrow range of depth values, and some dynamic objects elicit responses that are weaker than many stationary objects. Thus, what seems to be crucial for producing high DP values is that a neuron <italic>consistently</italic> prefers dynamic objects over the range tested. Thus, the monkey may have adopted a strategy of selectively reading out neurons that consistently prefer dynamic objects across the stimulus range. In this case, neurons with high peak response ratios but strongly varying responses to dynamic objects (Figure 2 B,E) do not appear to be well correlated with decisions.</p><p>We have now expanded the Results section (pp. 11-12) to present and discuss these findings. We have also modified text throughout the manuscript to reflect our finding that correlation with decisions depends mainly on a consistent preference for dynamic objects rather than the presence of incongruency per se.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(On that same plot (Figure 5G), I'm puzzled why there are so few DP and NP values &lt;0.5, when roughly half of all neurons were congruent in their BD and MP tuning â wouldn't one expect those neurons to have NP&lt;0.5 and DP&lt;0.5?)</p></disp-quote><p>We think there are two parts of an answer to this question. First, the reviewer seems to assume that if NP &lt; 0.5 then DP should also be &lt;0.5. But this doesnât necessarily need to be the case. For neurons that prefer stationary objects, it is certainly possible that they are mainly uncorrelated with decisions rather than being anticorrelated. Second, the reviewer asks why NP values are not symmetrically distributed around 0.5 in Figure 5G. This is a good question; our analyses suggest that this arises because of the distribution of our stimulus values for the dynamic object condition. Because almost all neurons were tested with a pedestal depth of -0.45 deg, the depth values for both disparity and motion parallax tend to be mostly negative for the dynamic object conditions (this can be observed by looking at the two x-axes in Figure 2D-F). This bias toward negative (near) values of dynamic objects, combined with the fact that most neurons have a near preference for depth from motion parallax (Figure 3A), means that most neurons, including most congruent cells, tended to have mean responses to dynamic objects that were above the mean response to stationary objects (e.g., Figure 2D). And this is captured by the neurometric performance. We now discuss this asymmetry in the text on p. 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Most generally, I'm still unclear about how much congruent neurons can contribute to these decisions compared to the incongruent ones. Given how well the population decoding works, it would be interesting to know if it still worked this well with *only* congruent or *only* incongruent neurons included. Is there an alternative hypothesis where having a range of different MP vs. BD tunings is what allows correct identification of the moving object, and it's the tuning variability rather than the incongruent neurons per se that matters? One could test this directly by including different ranges of neuronal tunings into a predictive model. Overall, it seems like there should be more direct analyses of the incongruent neuron population to provide support for the strong claims the authors are making about their role.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making this suggestion. We have now performed decoding simulations after breaking up the population into three groups based on the peak response ratio measure of preference for dynamic objects. These new results show that neurons with high peak response ratios produce better decoding performance and greater predicted detection probabilities than neurons with low peak response ratios. These results are shown in a new Figure 7 and described in the associated text on p. 14. We also found similar results when dividing the population into groups based on the correlation between depth tuning for disparity and motion parallax R<sub>MP_BD</sub> (see text). We think that these new findings address the reviewerâs concern by demonstrating directly that neurons with incongruent tuning enable better performance for decoding scene-relative object motion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure S2: I'm a little puzzled at how a monkey could get it wrong 95% of the time in the monocular +1.5 degree \Î Depth condition.

How should this be interpreted?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewers #1 and #3 for questioning this. It turns out that these control data were from the version of the task with 4 objects, rather than the version with two objects. Thus, the chance level of performance (now indicated in the figure) is 25%. This accounts for most of the mystery regarding the monocular condition. The remaining variation around the chance level is presumably just somewhat random as the monkey was only exposed to the monocular condition in 16% of trials across 3 sessions. The figure and caption have been modified to clarify this issue (now Figure 1âfigure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would like the authors to consider these two points:</p><p>(A) In each experimental session, the axis of translation was aligned with the preferred axis of the neuron under observation in order to elicit robust responses.

Will it be possible to show that a population code of such neurons is sufficient to detect dynamic objects in the face of an arbitrary axis of self-motion?</p></disp-quote><p>We donât have any data to address this question directly because we did not record from neurons while we intentionally misaligned the stimulus axis with the preferred direction. That said, MT neurons are rather broadly tuned, and so we would expect their response modulations to fall off gradually with such a misalignment. In this sense, we would not expect this case to be substantially different from any analogous situation involving a population of neurons with broadly distributed preferences. As the axis of motion changes, some neurons will become less informative while others will become more informative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(B) The authors state that it is not a worthwhile exercise to find model parameters that best match the empirical data, noting that they would have to make assumptions about the structure of correlated noise.

There were not 70 neurons recorded from 57 sessions in M2 during the discrimination task. In fact, we didnât have any well-isolated cell pairs that were recorded through the main detection task. For M2, the 70 single units that were recorded during the preliminary tests came from 82 recording sessions (as now clarified in Methods, p. 34, for both animals). Thus, we donât have sufficient data to make any reasonable attempt at constraining the correlation structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have a few questions and some suggestions that I think would improve the manuscript and better contextualize the findings.</p><p>1.

However, we think it is reasonable to assume that the background motion would drive at least some MSTd neurons. Thus, it is possible that flow parsing could also be engaged to some extent in our task, as now acknowledged explicitly on p. 17. However, as the reviewer notes in a previous comment, flow parsing does not require disparity signals whereas the local mechanism demonstrated by our findings does. Hence, it seems unlikely that flow parsing plays a major role here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
