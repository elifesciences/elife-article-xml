Theoretical models suggest that polarity can arise from localized feedbacks on Fat-Ds complexes at the cell boundary. However, there is currently no direct evidence for the existence or mechanism of such feedbacks. To directly test the localized feedback model, we developed a synthetic biology platform based on mammalian cells expressing the human Fat4 and Ds1. We show that Fat4-Ds1 complexes accumulate on cell boundaries in a threshold-like manner and exhibit dramatically slower dynamics than unbound Fat4 and Ds1. This suggests a localized feedback mechanism based on enhanced stability of Fat4-Ds1 complexes. We also show that co-expression of Fat4 and Ds1 in the same cells is sufficient to induce polarization of Fat4-Ds1 complexes. Together, these results provide direct evidence that localized feedbacks on Fat4-Ds1 complexes can give rise to PCP.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd><kwd>live cell imaging</kwd><kwd>synthetic biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>545/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loza</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Gordon-Bar</surname><given-names>Nadav</given-names></name><name><surname>Amir-Zilberstein</surname><given-names>Liat</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>Yunmin</given-names></name><name><surname>Sprinzak</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Localized feedback on Fa4-Ds1 boundary complexes underlies polarized distribution of Fat4 and Ds1 and gives rise to planar cell polarity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Planar cell polarity (PCP) defines the coordinated polarization of cells in the plane of a tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewis and Davies, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lawrence et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Nathans, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>) and underlies the organization and geometry required for the proper function of many developing organs. PCP is usually manifested by orientation of external structures, such as trichomes and sensory hair cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Strutt and Strutt, 2009</xref>), and hair structures in the inner ear and skin of vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dabdoub and Kelley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saburi et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>At the molecular level, PCP is defined by asymmetric distribution of transmembrane protein complexes which belong to two families - the Frizzled/Van-Gogh pathway (termed the ‘core’ pathway) and the Fat/Dachsous (Ft/Ds) pathway. Both were discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> but are conserved in higher vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singh and Mlodzik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharma and McNeill, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The main players in the Ft/Ds pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are the large atypical cadherins Ft, Ds and the Golgi protein kinase Four-jointed (Fj). Ft and Ds take part in heterophilic interactions resulting in trans-hetero-complexes on the boundary between cells. Unlike for classical cadherins, there is no evidence of homophilic complexes of either Ft or Ds forming across cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matakatsu and Blair, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matis and Axelrod, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The mammalian homologues of Ft and Ds include Fat1-4 and Ds1-2. However, Fat4 and Ds1 have the highest homology to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ft and Ds, are the most widely expressed, and have the strongest knockout phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rock et al., 2005</xref>). Fat4 and Ds1 null mice show complex morphological abnormalities in the inner ear, kidney, brain, bone, lymph node, and more. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saburi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishiuchi et al., 2009</xref>). In humans, mutations in Fat4 and Ds1 were recently linked to various cancers and abnormal brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katoh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cappello et al., 2013</xref>). Unlike in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, polarized distributions of Fat4 and Ds1 in vertebrates have not been observed yet, probably due to lack of good reagents for staining these proteins in vivo.</p><p>It remains poorly understood how polarized distribution of Fat and Ds is established, and how it is coordinated between neighboring cells. Models for the emergence of polarity can be classified according to whether or not they include feedbacks. Models without feedback propose that observed gradients of Ds and Fj are sufficient to explain the asymmetric distribution of Fat-Ds complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lawrence et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strutt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Axelrod and Tomlin, 2011</xref>). However, these models cannot explain how relatively small differences in Ds and Fj expression between neighboring cells can lead to strongly polarized membrane distributions. This problem is solved by models that include localized feedback mechanisms, where we define ‘localized’ to mean a feedback at the level of protein complexes within the cell boundary, to distinguish it from transcriptional feedback or tissue scale feedbacks. Such models have been previously proposed to explain polarity in the core pathway, where the localized feedbacks are mediated by the cytoplasmic proteins Prickle and Dishevelled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amonlirdviman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Garrec et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2013</xref>). However, no such feedbacks were identified for the Fat-Ds pathway.</p><p>In principle, two localized feedback mechanisms can be distinguished: (1) a self-enhancing feedback that promotes the formation of additional Ft-Ds complexes in the same direction of existing Ft-Ds complexes, and (2) a mutual inhibition feedback between complexes in opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mathematical modeling predicts that models with both feedbacks can amplify small differences in expression and create strongly polarized cell boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burak and Shraiman, 2009</xref>). Intuitively, a model with a self-enhancing feedback alone would lead to roughly equal numbers of opposing complexes, whereas a model with mutual inhibition feedback alone would remove pairs of opposing complexes and leave only the small excess of the dominant complex type. The combination of both feedbacks together leads to strong accumulation of complexes in one direction. Somewhat less intuitive is the prediction of these models that polarity can emerge spontaneously once threshold levels of Ft and Ds are reached, even in the absence of external gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burak and Shraiman, 2009</xref>). We note that models for PCP based on the core pathway are equivalent to mutual inhibition feedback described above and do not require self-enhancing feedback.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24820.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fat4-Citrine and Ds1-mCherry accumulate on heterotypic boundaries.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the localized feedback hypothesis.

In this work, we develop an experimental synthetic biology platform to study the interactions of Fat4 and Ds1 in live mammalian cells. By analyzing co-cultures of cells expressing Fat4 fused to Citrine and cells expressing Ds1 fused to mCherry, we show that Fat4-Ds1 complex formation exhibits a threshold response to the levels of Fat4 and Ds1, supporting a localized self-enhancing feedback mechanism. We further show that Fat4-Ds1 complexes at the cell boundary form extremely stable clusters, suggesting that complex stabilization through clustering may serve as a mechanism for localized feedback. Finally, we show that cells expressing both Fat4 and Ds1 exhibit strong localized polarization, supporting the existence of mutual inhibition between opposing complexes. We find that the direction of polarization depends on the relative levels of Fat4 and Ds1 across the boundary between cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of an experimental system for quantitative characterization of the mammalian Fat4/Dachsous1 interactions</title><p>To study the interactions between Fat4 and Ds1 at the boundary between cells we cloned the full length human Fat4 with a C-terminal fusion of citrine (Fat4-citrine) and the human Ds1 with a C-terminal fusion to mCherry (Ds1-mCherry) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Furthermore, we generally do not see domains of opposite polarity within single boundaries suggesting that complexes on cell boundaries align in a coordinated manner. This observation is consistent with mutual inhibition feedback between complexes and suggests that direct interaction between opposing complexes is sufficient for generating polarity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The direction of polarity depends on differences in Fat4 and Ds1 expression</title><p>Interestingly, we see that the direction of polarity, i.e., the direction from green to red in the rainbow (black arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), can differ between boundaries of the same cell (see, for example, boundaries 2, 3, and 4, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). This behavior is different from the long range polarization of Ft-Ds observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing and larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lawrence et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brittle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>), but is reminiscent of polarity reversal within the same cell recently observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae denticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rovira et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that the difference between the localized polarity observed in the cell culture system and the coordinated polarity observed in vivo may be due to the variability in expression of Fat4 and Ds1 in our system and that this variability results in expression differences across the boundaries that locally bias the polarity. To check this hypothesis, we measured the differences in cytoplasmic levels of Fat4 and Ds1 across each boundary. We defined the direction of expression gradients as the directions going from low to high expression level of Fat4 and Ds1 (marked by red and green triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We then checked whether the direction of polarization, determined by the rainbow feature (red-green polarity bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), is aligned with the direction of expression gradients of Fat4 and Ds1 across the boundary. We found that when the expression gradients of Fat4 and Ds1 are opposed (such as in boundaries 1,2, and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) the polarity aligns with both the Ds1 and Fat4 gradients. Namely, that boundary accumulation of Ds1 occurs on the side of the cell with higher Ds1 expression, and conversely, boundary accumulation of Fat4 occurs on the side of the cell with higher Fat4 expression. However, in situations where both expression gradients are aligned (such as in boundary 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) we found that the direction of polarity can align either with the Fat4 gradient or with the Ds1 gradient. Repeating this analysis on 107 boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) indeed showed that if Fat4 and Ds1 expression gradients are opposed, then the polarity almost always aligned with the direction of both gradients (bottom pie chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). On the other hand, when Ds1 and Fat4 expression gradients were aligned (top pie chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) we got almost equal number of boundaries aligned with Ds1 gradient (33 out of 68) and boundaries aligned with the Fat4 gradient (27 out 68). This result is consistent with a situation where the polarity is either controlled by the Ds1 expression gradient or controlled by the Fat4 expression gradient, depending which of the two is dominant.</p><p>To check whether the final direction of polarity reflects the expression gradients that existed prior to the formation of polarized accumulation, we performed live imaging of boundary accumulation using confocal Airyscan technology. The filmstrip from such a movie (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) indeed showed that the rainbow feature emerged in the direction of the Ds1 expression gradient that existed before bundary accumulation occured (no significant Fat4 expression gradient is observed in this movie). Overall, these observations support a picture where localized polarization of Fat4-Ds1 complexes in cell culture is biased by local gradients generated by cell-to-cell variability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we have adopted a synthetic biology approach to planar cell polarity and reconstituted Fat4-Ds1 PCP in a cell culture system to elucidate the basic mechanisms underlying polarity establishment. Reducing the in vivo system to its core allows dissecting Fat4-Ds1 interactions in a controlled and quantitative manner, beyond what is possible in vivo. The in vivo relevance of the in vitro findings can then subsequently be verified in a targeted manner.</p><p>Two classes of models have been proposed to explain the emergence of asymmetric distribution of PCP proteins on cell boundaries: (i) gradient models, claiming that the asymmetric distribution of PCP proteins reflects the external gradients controlling the level and/or activity of PCP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>), and (ii) localized feedback models, where small initial biases in complex polarity are amplified by a combination of self-enhancing feedback between like complexes and mutual inhibition feedback between opposing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amonlirdviman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Garrec et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burak and Shraiman, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our results strongly support the existence of such localized feedbacks in the Fat4-Ds1 system and suggest a potential mechanism driving these feedbacks.</p><p>By analyzing co-culture of cells expressing only Fat4 or Ds1 we can analyze the existence and properties of self-enhancing localized feedbacks in the absence of mutual inhibition. Large scale snapshot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and live cell imaging of single pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) show that accumulation of complexes at the boundary exhibits a threshold response to increasing levels of Ds1 - a hallmark of positive feedback. This is the first direct observation of a positive feedback loop in a PCP system. Evidence for the second class of localized feedback, the mutual inhibition between opposing complexes, is provided by our finding that strong polarization is consistently found in cells expressing both Fat4 and Ds1, even in the absence of a strong expression gradient in either of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>What could be the mechanism behind the localized feedbacks on Fat4-Ds1 complexes? The strong polarization and inferred presence of both feedbacks in a minimal synthetic system make it plausible that no other proteins specific to this pathway are involved in the feedback, and favor simple mechanisms that rely on direct interactions between the heterotypic complexes. Such feedbacks can act either at the level of production or degradation. For example, for the self-enhancing feedback case, complexes can either catalyze production of like complexes, or prevent degradation of like complexes. Using quantitative FRAP analysis we show that unlike unbound Fat4 and Ds1, Fat4-Ds1 complexes are extremely stable, and do not recover or diffuse even after several minutes. This observation suggests that the self-enhancing feedback could at least in part rely on enhanced stability of complexes, possibly through cluster formation. Such enhanced stability of clusters was shown to occur with other cadherin such as E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Beco et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, FRAP analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ft/Ds in wing disk junctions also showed enhanced stability on boundary puncta compared to other boundary regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hale et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Enhanced stability may not be the only mechanism contributing to localized feedbacks. For example, in addition to stabilizing complexes, clusters could also catalyze their formation by acting as a ‘diffusion trap’, as has also been suggested for E-Cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has implicated directional trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matis et al., 2014</xref>) and feedbacks through cytoplasmic PCP components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amonlirdviman et al., 2005</xref>) as other potential mechanisms for localized feedbacks.</p><p>One potential difficulty with the extreme stability of Fat4-Ds1 complexes is that it may be hard for the cells to change their initial polarity, for example to respond to cell divisions or morphogenetic processes. Interestingly, the observed trans-endocytosis of Ds1 into the Fat4 cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>) may serve as a way to quickly remodel boundaries in spite of their slow turnover by removing large fragments of boundaries with otherwise stable Fat4-Ds1 complexes.</p><p>Our finding that polarity of Fat4-Ds1 accumulation at the cell boundary can be observed with optical microscopy through the gap between Fat4 and Ds1 fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is surprising. The expected lengths of the extracellular domains of Fat4 and Ds1 in an extended form are 153 nm and 121 nm, respectively (Fat4 and Ds1 have 34 and 27 cadherin repeats, respectively). Hence, the observed gaps are consistent with the length of Fat4 and Ds1 in an extended conformation. A recent study, however, suggested that Fat4 and Ds1 fold into a compact structure to fit into intercellular gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tsukasaki et al., 2014</xref>). It is unclear whether these seemingly contradictory observations are due to different methodologies or different cellular contexts. Hence, further experiments are required to determine the structural basis of the observed gaps in our experiments.</p><p>We used our synthetic system to show that cells expressing both Fat4 and Ds1 exhibit polarized distribution of these proteins on cell-cell boundaries. Hence, our in vitro setup shows that expression of Fat4 and Ds1 is sufficient to generate polarized boundaries. Unlike in vivo tissues where the direction of polarity is coordinated over extended regions, the direction of polarity of each boundary in our in vitro assay seems to be independent of the polarity of nearby boundaries. It is possible that this difference is due to the relatively large cell-to-cell variability in the expression of Fat4 and Ds1 in cell culture. This variability can lead to local effective gradients of Fat4 and Ds1 biasing the direction of polarity in each boundary. This situation is reminiscent of the disordered organization of denticles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae which was attributed to variability in Ds expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rovira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saavedra et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the direction of Fat4 and Ds1 gradients across each boundary indeed shows that for the unambiguous situation of opposing Fat4 and Ds1 gradients, the polarity (determined independently by the ‘rainbow’ feature) aligns with the local gradients. For the case where gradients are incompatible (i.e. pointing in the same direction), the polarity may be determined by either the Fat4 or the Ds1 gradients, depending which one is more dominant (e.g. which gradient is stronger).</p><p>Our results and conclusions are not limited to the understanding of Fat-Ds signaling but provide a general framework for how complex local interactions between membrane proteins can induce tissue level organization.

The mix of HEK293-Fat4-citrine and HEK293-Ds1 cells was diluted to 1.6 × 10<sup>4</sup> cell/ml and seeded onto the patterned plate. Directly prior imaging the media was replaced with a previously mentioned low fluorescence imaging media. For induction of Ds1-mCherry, 100 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the growth medium to induce expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Microscopy details</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Imaging of fixed cells for snapshot analysis</title><p>Cells were imaged using Nikon TI-E inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan) equipped CFI Plan Apo 20X objective NA = 0.7 (Nikon, Japan); and an ANDOR sCMOS camera (Andor, Belfast, Northern Ireland).

Snapshots of Fat4-Ds1 co-culture were segmented using Ilastik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sommer et al., 2011</xref>), an open source software for image classification and segmentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ilastik.org/">http://ilastik.org/</ext-link>) and custom written Matlab code. One classifier was trained on the Fat4-citrine and Ds1-mCherry signal to distinguish regions of Fat4 expressing cells, Ds1 expressing cells and background. A second classifier was trained on the co-localization signal of Fat4-citrine and Ds1-mCherry complexes to identify accumulating boundaries with the 'intensity feature' turned off to prevent inadvertently thresholding to identify boundaries and thereby creating a bias. A final classifier identified nuclei based on the Hoechst signal. Cells were then segmented by using the nuclei for a seeded watershed of the Fat4-Ds1 regions. For cells where the classifier failed to identify the cell type, raw Fat and Ds intensity was used to assign the type. Accumulating boundaries were assigned to cell interfaces based on their presence in cells of a dual lattice generated by watershedding the interfaces. Distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were generated from mean intensities in each cell shifted to have the dimmest cells have value 10, a cutoff value used for the log scale binning. Bins were spaced evenly on the log scale so the graphs show P(log I). In 2D histograms a fixed lookup table for the probabilties was used for different time points and intensity distributions for interfaces with and without accumulation were normalized by the sum of the two distributions (the total number of cells).

Fat4-citrine and Ds1-mCherry accumulation movies were analyzed using semi-automatic custom written Matlab code. Cells were first segmented be mapping Fat4-citrine cells (green) and Ds1-mCherry cells (red), then the total fluorescence in these areas was measured. The overlap between the red and green areas was mapped as accumulating boundary. Since Ds1-mCherry fluorescence levels are low at short induction time; the segmentation by the code was not complete. In these cases we manually corrected the segmentation using DIC images for proper cell recognition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>FRAP analysis of Fat4-Ds1 accumulating boundary</title><p>Boundaries were segmented and tracked using the open active contour method (snake) implemented in the ImageJ plugin JFilament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2010</xref>) on the unbleached Ds1-mCherry signal. Using custom written Matlab code the Fat4-citrine signal along the snake was obtained as the maximal intensity projection normal to the snake over a nine pixel wide strip. Given the drift and growth/shrinkage of the snakes over times, the signal along the snake at different times had to be registered by maximizing the spatial cross-correlation to produce the space time profile. For Fat4-Ds1 boundaries we bleached half the boundary. We then fit an error function to the profile at each time, adapting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goehring et al., 2010</xref>), i.e. at each time we fit:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>erf</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The diffusion constant was then obtained by fitting the linear relation with the squared width of the error function, which follows <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, while the exchange rate is the time scale obtained from fitting an exponential decay to the dynamics of A.

In brief, we defined for each movie a region of interest around the bleached area. The fluorescence profile as a function of time was extracted, corrected for background level and photobleaching and averaged along the axis parallel to the bleached stripe resulting in 1D fluorescence profile for each time point. Fitting to the recovery profiles for extracting Diffusion coefficients and exchange were done according to Khait et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khait et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-5"><title>Rainbow analysis and gradient measurements</title><p>As in the boundary FRAP analysis, boundaries for rainbow analysis were segmented using JFilament. Using custom written Matlab code intensities were interpolated on equaly spaced points along the boundary and along lines normal to the boundary to create a straightened intensity image. For each position on the boundary the intensity profile normal to the boundary was then fitted by a Gaussian. The relative position of the Fat and Ds peaks defines the direction of the polarity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, while the distribution of the distance between the peaks for each position along each boundary is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. To determine gradients for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, cytoplasmic intensities were determined by taking the summed intensity projection of 5 slices centered round the plane of the rainbow, and then measuring the total intensity in a box away from the boundary, excluding the nucleus using the DAPI image and excluding vesicles using an intensity threshold.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Helen McNeil for advice and support.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper reports an original and ambitious effort to reconstitute the Fat/Dachsous polarity system in tissue culture cells. Using fluorescent fusion constructs for these proteins, they manipulate and quantify their total levels over time and quantify their incorporation into polarized complexes at cell contacts. They use these data to quantitatively test models for polarization mechanisms. In particular, the authors address the roles of positive and negative feedback and the role of differential Dachsous expression between cells in organizing polarity of these domains. Their data suggest that 1) The Fat/Ds system spontaneously breaks symmetry at threshold concentrations, 2) heterophilic Dachsous/Fat complexes across cell contacts enhance the formation of complexes of the same polarity and discourage accumulation of oppositely oriented complexes, and 3) that the orientation of these complexes is biased by relative levels of Ds in neighboring cells.</p><p>While the reviewers were excited by the potential of this approach, several questions were raised about the data and their interpretation that would need to be addressed before the paper could be considered for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A key argument for positive feedback is based on evidence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> that Fat4-Ds1 show threshold response binding dynamics. The reviewers raised concerns regarding unexplained anomalies in the data, and think that the data supporting this point need to be strengthened. Specifically….</p><p>– How convincing is population level data for threshold effect of Fat4-Ds1 binding? Could <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> equally well fit a single exponential (expected I think for mass action binding?). The authors should better explain how they know that the Hill Coefficient with n=2 is the &quot;best&quot; fit. Also, it seems that the fit shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> represents data from only one experiment. It is important to show that a similar coefficient fits the data of the second experiment.</p><p>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, if there is a threshold response for both proteins, shouldn't there be 3 quadrants (bottom left and right, top left) containing purple dotes and one quadrant (top right) containing yellow dots, with the boundaries between the quadrants representing the thresholds? In &quot;No induction&quot; the yellow dots seem scattered evenly almost everywhere, suggesting little or no threshold response in cells where binding is actually seen. But conversely the purple dots suggest there is a second set of boundaries where there is low Fat4 on one side and a wide range of Ds1 levels on the other (which supports a threshold for Fat4 levels but not Ds1 levels?). Look at 20h induction, and now there are lots of cell pairs binding with both high Fat4 and high Ds1, but strangely no cell pairs not binding with low Ds1 and high Fat4 (even though low Ds1 cells exist) – this cell category is just missing which seems to require some explanation. Does the fact that there do not seem to be any points (purple or yellow) where Fat is high but Dachsous is low mean that Fat levels are indirectly increased (perhaps by stabilization) by the growing amounts of Dachsous in the other pool of cells. These data need to be better explained an accounted for.</p><p>– The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and 2 are meant to show using live imaging that complex formation begins at a threshold expression level. A puzzling aspect of the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is that boundary accumulation seems to begin before there is a detectable rise in Ds levels. A related experiment shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> supplement does not present the fat and ds intensity data from the start of Ds induction but only from two hours after induction so we can't see at what Ds threshold the complexes begin to accumulate.</p><p>A problem with interpreting this type of experiment is that the total fluorescence intensity in the cell likely reflects pools of ds in the secretory and endocytic pathways. So we don't really know the amount of ds that is actually at the surface and capable of interacting with fat. This is the pool that is relevant to the authors' model. A key piece of data necessary to interpret this experiment is some measurement of the surface level of ds (in the absence of fat expressing cells) at different times after induction.</p><p>The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> nicely shows that polarized fat/ds complexes tend to have the same polarity on the same cell boundaries and that the ds expression difference between neighboring cells strongly influences the orientation of polarized fat/ds complexes. The authors argue from this that the difference in ds expression can orient polarity and that there is mutual inhibition between complexes with different polarities. To strongly conclude the latter, it would be necessary to monitor the formation of these polarized domains in timelapse.</p><p>The authors suggest that transendocytosis of Fat/Ds complexes occurs based on an image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. They do not present evidence that these spots of fluorescence are within endosomes rather than outside cells. This should be shown, or the data could be removed as it is not essential for the conclusions of the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24820.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) A key argument for positive feedback is based on evidence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> that Fat4-Ds1 show threshold response binding dynamics.

It is important to show that a similar coefficient fits the data of the second experiment.</italic> </p><p>The fit is a standard fit (least square method in Matlab) with two parameters, k and n. The best fit Hill coefficient, n, is automatically determined with 95% confidence interval providing a measure of the likelihood that the &quot;real&quot; function has a Hill coefficient in this range. The 95% confidence interval for the first experiment is [1.7 2.3] meaning that the change the real value is less than 1.7 is 2.5%. As mentioned by the reviewer the expected Hill coefficient for mass action kinetics is n=1 (Michaelis Menten) so this value is very unlikely given the data. Using a different measure, running a fit with fixed n=1 results in a significantly lower ‘goodness of fit’ characterized by the sum of square errors (sse). The sse for the current fit is 0.076 and the sse for n=1 fit is 0.144.</p><p>Fitting the second data set, which exhibited lower Ds induction (due to experimental variability) resulted in a higher Hill coefficient of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>4.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). While the result is not the same, the Hill coefficient in the second set is also significantly higher than 1.</p><p>We note that population variability would smooth out any threshold, so that these Hill coefficients serve as a lower bound: the true value will almost certainly be higher.</p><p><italic>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, if there is a threshold response for both proteins, shouldn't there be 3 quadrants (bottom left and right, top left) containing purple dotes and one quadrant (top right) containing yellow dots, with the boundaries between the quadrants representing the thresholds? In &quot;No induction&quot; the yellow dots seem scattered evenly almost everywhere, suggesting little or no threshold response in cells where binding is actually seen. But conversely the purple dots suggest there is a second set of boundaries where there is low Fat4 on one side and a wide range of Ds1 levels on the other (which supports a threshold for Fat4 levels but not Ds1 levels?).

Does the fact that there do not seem to be any points (purple or yellow) where Fat is high but Dachsous is low mean that Fat levels are indirectly increased (perhaps by stabilization) by the growing amounts of Dachsous in the other pool of cells. These data need to be better explained an accounted for.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the inconsistency in our data. We have carefully checked the analysis and found a problem (bug in the code) with the 2D distribution plot of the non-accumulating boundaries (purple dots). We have also re-examined the binning and background subtraction procedures and reanalyzed the whole dataset with more well-defined procedures (now described in the Materials and methods).</p><p>The new analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that non-accumulating boundaries spread over all quadrants almost symmetrically. It also shows that the Ds distribution spreads to higher Ds levels as Ds is induced.</p><p>Analysis of the second dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) is now provided. We note that in this dataset the lower right quadrant has fewer boundaries. Although we are not certain why this is the case, we suspect that this probably due to a somewhat lower cell density in this experiment allowing cells to move around potential bind to high expressing partners. Despite the difference between the two sets, the main points are still valid: We see a non-linear response of the fraction of boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and the accumulating boundaries require both high levels of Fat4 and Ds1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Hence, both datasets support threshold response.</p><p>The reason the yellow dots were spread out in the no induction case was because there were so few accumulating boundaries it was basically showing noise, but the distribution was normalized by its own total making the noise look bright. By normalizing the yellow and purple distributions not by their own total, but their joint total, the intensity of the yellow distribution now represents its mass relative to the total number of Fat-Ds interfaces, which means the intensity now represents actual fraction of accumulating boundaries and does not amplify noise when there is no accumulation.</p><p>Finally, we checked whether there is a stabilization of Fat4 in accumulating boundaries by looking at the mean level of Fat4 as a function of time. We see only a small increase, about 10%, in total Fat4 levels as Ds1 is induced. Hence, formation of boundaries do not significantly affect the total lifetime of Fat4 in our system.</p><p><italic>– The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and 2 are meant to show using live imaging that complex formation begins at a threshold expression level. A puzzling aspect of the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is that boundary accumulation seems to begin before there is a detectable rise in Ds levels. A related experiment shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> supplement does not present the fat and ds intensity data from the start of Ds induction but only from two hours after induction so we can't see at what Ds threshold the complexes begin to accumulate.</italic> </p><p>We have now investigated carefully the turn-on point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Indeed, the Observed Ds level starts increasing above background about 100min after Dox induction (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The reason for this is probably the finite maturation time of mCherry and the time it takes for the accumulating Ds1 to reach threshold detection levels (We have checked that expression level increases linearly as Dox is induced – see qPCR results in supplement 2D).</p><p>Although in some movies it seems that accumulation on the interface occurs as Ds1 starts to increase, the real signature feature of positive feedback at the threshold is the fact that accumulation on the interface is not proportional to the total rate of increase but instead much faster.To make this point we now plot Ds1 accumulation as a function of total Ds1 level for the three movies shown in the figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We indeed see that the slope in log-log plot, is significantly higher than 1 (dashed line) for several hours after induction is observed (much longer than the observed delay in Ds1 induction). For linear mass action kinetics (without feedback) it is expected that the slope in the graph equal to 1. Having a higher slope means sharper threshold response, or higher Hill effective Hill coefficient. We now address this point in the text.</p><p>Regarding the measurement starting at a time higher than 0. The time indicates the time from adding doxycycline. The reason it does not start at 0 is that these movies were taken on free co-cultures, where it is very hard to identify and track potential interacting pairs over long times. Hence, since in the first 2 hours it is less likely to capture accumulation, we started these movies at this time. We note though that these movies do capture the accumulation from the first time it appears. We also note that the description in the captions of both the main figure (were the movie started right after addition of dox) and the supplementary figures was unclear. We have now fixed the captions to make it clear.</p><p><italic>A problem with interpreting this type of experiment is that the total fluorescence intensity in the cell likely reflects pools of ds in the secretory and endocytic pathways. So we don't really know the amount of ds that is actually at the surface and capable of interacting with fat. This is the pool that is relevant to the authors' model. A key piece of data necessary to interpret this experiment is some measurement of the surface level of ds (in the absence of fat expressing cells) at different times after induction.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the point raised here. We have now performed confocal movies of Ds1 induction at different z-planes, in the absence of Fat4 cells and analyzed the membrane Ds1 levels vs the total Ds1 levels in the cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The movies clearly show that a large fraction of Ds1 is present at the membrane. This is most clearly seen when looking at the lowest z-plane showing fluorescence from the basal membrane (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref> – see z=0 planes). Furthermore we show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>) that the mean fluorescence from the lowest z-plane (membrane Ds1 level) is proportional to the mean fluorescence from all the z-plane (Membrane + Cell Ds1 level).</p><p>As mentioned above, both the membrane and the whole cell Ds1 fluorescence start increasing at about 100min after induction. This is probably due to the maturation time of Ds1 and the time it takes to reach a levels of expression above background.</p><p><italic>The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> nicely shows that polarized fat/ds complexes tend to have the same polarity on the same cell boundaries and that the ds expression difference between neighboring cells strongly influences the orientation of polarized fat/ds complexes. The authors argue from this that the difference in ds expression can orient polarity and that there is mutual inhibition between complexes with different polarities. To strongly conclude the latter, it would be necessary to monitor the formation of these polarized domains in timelapse.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. Clearly the dynamics of rainbow formation is an exciting topic which we plan to address in the future. It is technically challenging to dynamically follow the rainbow features, as there is a tradeoff between spatial resolution and time resolution (i.e. high quality images take time). However, we have managed to get as an example a nice movie showing the turning on of the accumulation and the emergence of rainbow (This movie was taken with Airyscan technology). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, the boundary turns on and become polarized within a couple of hours. Consistent with the data in fixed samples that polarity of the rainbow aligns with the Ds1 gradient. We note that, as expected, the differences in Ds1 expression existed prior to the formation of the rainbow. We now discuss this point in the text.</p><p>In general, we agree that understanding the dynamics of polarity is interesting, but we feel that it is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>The authors suggest that transendocytosis of Fat/Ds complexes occurs based on an image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. They do not present evidence that these spots of fluorescence are within endosomes rather than outside cells. This should be shown, or the data could be removed as it is not essential for the conclusions of the paper.</italic> </p><p>Transendocytosed vesicles all appear within the cell. The image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is taken from a middle z-plane. Furthermore, co-culture movies as the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, all show that these trans-endocytosed vesicles are moving inside the cell (see yellow vesicles Fat4 expressing cell) and exhibit similar dynamics as Ds1 containing vesicles in the cells. All this supports that these are indeed real intracellular events and not artifacts.</p><p>While we agree that this is not the main focus of the current paper, we still think it is important to report this observation, as it is the first observation of transendocytosis in this system.</p></body></sub-article></article>
