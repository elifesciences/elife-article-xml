However, a direct role for TSLP in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell primary responses remains controversial and its role in memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to secondary viral infection is unknown. Here, we investigate the role of TSLP in both primary and recall responses in mice using two different viral systems. Interestingly, TSLP limited the primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response to influenza but did not affect T cell function nor significantly alter the number of memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells generated after influenza infection. However, TSLP inhibited memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to secondary viral infection with influenza or acute systemic LCMV infection. These data reveal a previously unappreciated role for TSLP on recall CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses in response to viral infection, findings with potential translational implications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TSLP</kwd><kwd>CD8</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>viral infection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Division of Intramural Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leonard</surname><given-names>Warren J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Division of Intramural Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGavern</surname><given-names>Dorian B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Immunological analysis of wild-type and <italic>Crlf2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice reveals a role for the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin on memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to viral infection, findings with potential translational implications.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza virus infection accounts for significant morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davlin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budd, 2016</xref>), and understanding factors controlling the immune response to influenza is important for developing strategies for enhancing immunity and designing new therapies and vaccines. The absence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells delays influenza clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Moskophidis and Kioussis, 1998</xref>), demonstrating the importance of these cells in the control of infection by this virus. The main cellular targets of influenza are pulmonary epithelial cells, which once infected produce multiple inflammatory mediators that can alter the immune response to influenza infection. One of these mediators is TSLP, a pleiotropic cytokine with a range of actions, affecting cellular maturation, survival, and recruitment of cells. Although TSLP was initially reported to act on T cells indirectly through dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Soumelis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ito et al., 2005</xref>), it was later shown to also act directly on both mouse and human CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rochman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Shami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shane and Klonowski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rochman and Leonard, 2008</xref>). TSLP has additional effects on B cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">West et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rochman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corren and Ziegler, 2019</xref>). TSLP signals via a receptor comprising a TSLP-specific binding protein, TSLPR, and the IL-7 receptor α chain, IL-7Rα (CD127), thereby activating JAK1, JAK2, and STAT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rochman et al., 2010</xref>). TSLP is expressed at barrier surfaces, and has been extensively studied in the context of T helper 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) type responses and shown to promote the progression of T<sub>H</sub>2-mediated diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Shami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Divekar and Kita, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yoo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>), as well as immune responses to the intestinal pathogen, <italic>Trichuris muris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>), but the role of TSLP on CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses is less-well characterized.

Some variation in the expression of CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and KLRG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) was observed, but the differences were modest, and there were similar levels of granzyme B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and percentages of WT and <italic>Crlf2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells expressing IFN-γ, TNF-α, or both cytokines after ex-vivo stimulation with cognate peptide (GP33) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Because TSLP signals via a dimer of the TSLP-specific receptor chain (TSLPR) and IL-7Rα, we considered the possibility that the absence of TSLPR leads to the compensatory induction of IL-7Rα (CD127), which might result in an IL-7-dependent increase in the number of <italic>Crlf2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, but expression of IL-7Rα was similar in WT and <italic>Crlf2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).

Although TSLP is induced by viral infection of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, there have been conflicting reports regarding its actions on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during the primary response to influenza infection. One study using <italic>Crlf2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice indicated that TSLP does not affect the control of influenza infection nor affect virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses during primary infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Plumb et al., 2012</xref>). Another report concluded that TSLP enhances CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses during primary influenza infection, but that this was not due to a direct action on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and instead was an indirect effect on CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses resulting from TSLP-induced IL-15 production by dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yadava et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, a third study used an adoptive co-transfer model of WT and <italic>Crlf2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> TCR transgenic ovalbumin-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (OT-I cells) and found that after infection with an OVA-expressing influenza virus, there were fewer <italic>Crlf2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> OT I cells during the primary infection, indicating that TSLP enhances primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shane and Klonowski, 2014</xref>). Thus, the reported roles of TSLP in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses during primary influenza infection have been somewhat variable, possibly at least in part due to variability in the experimental models/design/animal facilities. Here, we found that TSLP acts directly on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to limit their responses in most tissues during primary influenza infection, with more virus-specific <italic>Crlf2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells than virus-specific WT cells. We additionally show that after acute systemic infection with LCMV Armstrong virus, TSLP had a modest effect on primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses, with only a slight increase in <italic>Crlf2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells in the spleen at day 8 p.i. Thus, TSLP can limit CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses during primary viral infections, but the effect varied based on the tissue assessed and the type of viral infection. The apparent differences in the various studies of TSLP’s impact on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during primary influenza infection may be due at least in part to the tissues sampled (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yadava et al., 2013</xref> only assessed responses in BAL fluid). Additionally, the use of influenza viruses with differing pathogenicity in mice might affect the results, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shane and Klonowski, 2014</xref> used a strain of influenza, x31, which is less pathogenic than the PR8 strain that we used. Overall, the effect of TSLP on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during the effector phase of a primary acute infection may vary according to the viral infection and tissues analyzed, but our data support the potential for an inhibitory effect by TSLP.</p><p>Knowledge of the action of TSLP on memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses has been limited. We found that TSLP does not affect the development/maintenance of memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after primary influenza infection. In contrast, however, we observed differences after systemic acute LCMV infection, with increased <italic>Crlf2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> virus-specific cells in the blood and lymph nodes at a memory time point post-infection. Importantly, TSLP limited memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recall responses, with enhanced cellular responses in multiple tissues of <italic>Crlf2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> T cells following either secondary influenza infection or LCMV systemic infection. Interestingly, RNA-Seq data indicated that TSLP suppresses several genes that are related to cell cycle, apoptosis, or protection from virus in influenza infection, with an increased number of virus-specific <italic>Crlf2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>Thus, while TSLP appears to have variable direct effects on primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, possibly depending on the context of infection, here we reveal that TSLP differentially affects naïve and memory cell homeostasis. TSLP enhances naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell survival in vitro and homeostasis in vivo, but memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are negatively controlled by TSLP, highlighting a key difference between the two cell types. We also found that TSLP uniformly diminished the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to secondary acute viral infection in all tissues examined in both pulmonary influenza infection and acute LCMV systemic infection, underscoring a greater effect for TSLP on secondary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses than primary responses. These findings have potential implications for better controlling secondary responses to viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Six to ten week old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory.

CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responses has been extensively studied, but less is known about its' role in CD8<sup>+</sup> responses. This paper shows that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells lacking the TSLP receptor are impaired in their response to viral infection, particularly during secondary challenge responses. They also show that naïve and memory T cells show distinct transcriptional responses to TSLP, providing insight into the function of this important cytokine in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin limits primary and recall CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell anti-viral responses&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation is being overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>As you and your coauthors noted, there is a notable discrepancy between your study and the work of Shane et al., which demonstrated that TslprKO CD8 T cells were reduced at memory timepoints in the broncheoalveolar lavage and lungs using the OT-I TCR transgenic and OVA-expressing influenza virus. While the authors suggest that differences in models could explain the discrepancy between the two studies, it is surprising that these groups arrived at diametrically opposed results using the influenza model (albeit different strains). While the current results with TslprKO mice are strengthened by using the LCMV model, there is concern that there may be unexpected differences between TslprKO mouse lines used by the two groups (Ziegler lab and Leonard lab lines). Of particular concern is the possibility that passenger mutations in one of these lines could have created a confounding variable. For example, see PMCIDs PMC4364188 [Dock8 mutation in Nlrp10KO mice, Eisenbarth group], PMC3326475 [Dock2 mutation in Irf5KO mice, Bhattacharya group], and PMC3660499 [Sox13 mutation in B6.SJL congenic mice, Cyster group]. Both Shane et al. and Ebina-Shibuya, West, et al. appear to have maintained independent crosses of WT and TslprKO mice to P14, which could in theory allow a confounding mutation to be maintained in the TslprKO P14 line. Because of the relatively subtle nature of the observed numerical changes, it is also possible that the observed differences between congenically distinct donor cells arise not from TSLPR, but from background genetic differences between Thy1.1/Thy1.1 and Thy1.1/Thy1.2, which could have been addressed by using co-transfer of congenically distinct WT P14 T cells to a separate group of mice as a control. The best way to address all of these concerns would be to block TSLP signaling using the M702 antibody (see Kuan and Ziegler, Nat Immunol, 2018). This would provide independent validation of the effects of TSLP signaling loss, with the additional benefit of avoiding changes in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell development. Could the authors either singly transfer WT P14 or cotransfer WT and TslprKO P14 to recipients and treat with control Ig or anti-TSLP antibodies as an independent means to validate their findings? In the case of single transfer, donor WT P14s would be expected to increase in mice treated with anti-TSLP abs. In the case of cotransfer, donor WT P14s would be expected to expand equally to TslprKO P14s in mice treated with anti-TSLP abs. If the authors had Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> Thy1.2- TslprKO P14 mice available as a separate line, this would be another means to satisfy these points (study currently uses Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> Thy1.2<sup>+</sup> TslprKO P14 mice). I realize that such experiments are challenging in our current environment, but the reviewers consider addressing these issues critical for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61912.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As you and your coauthors noted, there is a notable discrepancy between your study and the work of Shane et al., which demonstrated that TslprKO CD8 T cells were reduced at memory timepoints in the broncheoalveolar lavage and lungs using the OT-I TCR transgenic and OVA-expressing influenza virus.

Regarding the first approach, we have concerns that the experiment could be technically challenging, as it would require multiple injections of an antibody, where one would also have to assure that a sufficient level of blocking activity was achieved. Moreover, an experiment using a TSLP blocking antibody would block the actions of TSLP on all cell types and thus would not allow one to infer the direct actions of TSLP on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Accordingly, we prefer the second approach, and in fact, we already had performed the requested experiment. We apologize for having erred in our labeling of Figure 1D and the cartoon schematic in Figure 1B; although all but one of the included experiments were as indicated, one experiment was in fact included that used Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> Thy1.2<sup>-</sup><italic>Tslpr</italic> KO P14 mice. In the appended figure, the data in Figure 1D are now divided to show the data where recipients were Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> Thy1.2<sup>+</sup><italic>Tslpr</italic> KO P14 mice in panel A and the experiment in which recipients were Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> Thy1.2<sup>-</sup><italic>Tslpr</italic> KO P14 mice in panel B. As you can see, the trend is the same, providing confirmation of the validity of our findings as requested. Figure 1D represents the composite of these data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
