to peripheral sensory neuron function is more enigmatic. Here, we identify a new role for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in mammalian proprioception. RNAscope analysis and in vitro patch-clamp recordings in genetically identified mouse proprioceptors show ubiquitous channel expression and significant contributions to intrinsic excitability. Notably, genetic deletion of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in sensory neurons caused profound and visible motor coordination deficits in conditional knockout mice of both sexes, similar to conditional Piezo2-knockout animals, suggesting that this channel is a major contributor to sensory proprioceptive transmission. Ex vivo muscle afferent recordings from conditional knockout mice found that loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 leads to inconsistent and unreliable proprioceptor firing characterized by action potential failures during static muscle stretch; conversely, afferent responses to dynamic vibrations were unaffected. This suggests that while a combination of Piezo2 and other Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms is sufficient to elicit activity in response to transient stimuli, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is required for transmission of receptor potentials generated during sustained muscle stretch. Impressively, recordings from afferents of heterozygous conditional knockout animals were similarly impaired, and heterozygous conditional knockout mice also exhibited motor behavioral deficits. Thus, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 haploinsufficiency in sensory neurons impairs both proprioceptor function and motor behaviors. Importantly, human patients harboring Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 loss-of-function mutations often present with motor delays and ataxia; therefore, our data suggest that sensory neuron dysfunction contributes to the clinical manifestations of neurological disorders in which Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 function is compromised. Collectively, we present the first evidence that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is essential for mammalian proprioceptive signaling and behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>somatosensation</kwd><kwd>voltage-gated sodium channel</kwd><kwd>proprioception</kwd><kwd>motor function</kwd><kwd>Na<sub>v</sub>1.1</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#1017423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Griffith</surname><given-names>Theanne N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32GM099608-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Espino</surname><given-names>Cyrrus M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1T32GM1144303-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Espino</surname><given-names>Cyrrus M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5SC3GM127195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>Katherine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R25GM71381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ortiz</surname><given-names>Serena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25NS063307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Kaylee M</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Neil</surname><given-names>Darik A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 is identified as an essential component of the proprioceptive transmission machinery that is required in vivo for normal motor behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>V</sub>s) are critical mediators of neuronal excitability and are responsible for action potential generation and propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahern et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bean, 2007</xref>). In the mammalian nervous system, there are nine isoforms (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1â1.9), each with unique biophysical properties, as well as distinguishing cellular expression and subcellular localization patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catterall, 2017</xref>). Of these different subtypes, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is notable for its role in brain disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escayg and Goldin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mulley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, <italic>Scn1a</italic>, the gene that encodes Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, is referred to as a âsuper culpritâ gene, with over 1000 associated mutations that lead to abnormal brain function, resulting in brain disorders such as epilepsy and migraine, as well as neurodivergent phenotypes, such as autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lossin, 2009</xref>). Homozygous <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> global knockout mice are ataxic and die by postnatal day (P) 15, while heterozygous <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> animals develop seizures and begin to die sporadically starting at P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to the central nervous system (CNS), Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is also expressed in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>); yet, the prominent role this channel plays in brain function has left its physiological roles in sensory neuron populations understudied.</p><p>Peripheral sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia (TG) are tasked with encoding somatic sensations, such as touch, temperature, pain, and proprioception, and are anatomically and functionally heterogenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kupari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oliver et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Scn1a</italic> transcript and protein have been observed primarily in myelinated mechanosensory DRG and TG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukuoka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ho and OâLeary, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osteen et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, subcutaneous injection of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 activator, Hm1a, into mouse hind paw causes noninflammatory mechanical pain and spontaneous pain behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osteen et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 does not affect mechanical thresholds in uninjured mice but does reduce mechanical pain in a spared-nerve injury model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salvatierra et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 may have a more prominent role in mechanical pain as opposed to normal touch sensing. Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in TG neurons has also been reported to mediate mechanical pain in an orbitofacial chronic constriction injury model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pineda-Farias et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to somatosensory neurons, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is found in colon-innervating vagal neurons, where it contributes to firing of colonic mechano-nociceptors and is upregulated in a mouse model of chronic visceral hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osteen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salvatierra et al., 2018</xref>). Lastly, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 contributes to action potential firing in a subset of DRG neurons that express the cold-sensitive ion channel, transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), suggesting that the channel may also contribute to thermosensory transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Griffith et al., 2019</xref>). While most data support a role for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in pain, the limited number of studies that have investigated Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 function in sensory neurons has left gaps in our knowledge regarding other potential roles this channel may play in somatosensation.</p><p>Given the relatively underexplored role of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in the PNS, we set out to determine what other somatosensory modalities rely on Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 expression in sensory neurons. Here, we show that 100% of proprioceptors express <italic>Scn1a</italic> mRNA, where it makes notable contributions to the somal whole-cell sodium current and intrinsic excitability. A functional role for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in proprioceptive signaling was also supported by ex vivo electrophysiological recordings from functionally identified muscle spindle afferents. Importantly, mice lacking Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in all sensory neurons display visible and profound motor deficits and ataxic-like behavior, which were quantified in rotarod and open-field assays. Surprisingly, we found that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is haploinsufficient for normal proprioceptor function and behavior, in ex vivo recordings and the open-field assay, respectively. Collectively, our data provide the first evidence that peripherally expressed Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is critical for sensory proprioceptive signaling and motor coordination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Most studies have localized Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 expression primarily to myelinated sensory neurons that transmit mechanical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukuoka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ho and OâLeary, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osteen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).

We first applied the selective Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 antagonist ICA 1214314 (ICA, 500 nM), followed by 9-anhydroustetrodoxin (AH-TTX, 300 nM), which is a selective Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 blocker but also partially blocks Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denomme et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Griffith et al., 2019</xref>). We reasoned that by first blocking the Na<sub>V</sub>1.1-mediated current, the effect of AH-TTX should largely be due to inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. Finally, we blocked Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels using the antagonist PF-05089771 (25 nM), followed by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 300 nM) to block any residual current, as proprioceptors do not express TTX-resistant Na<sub>V</sub>s. On average, 7.8% of the current remained unblocked following serial application of these antagonists due to incomplete block by the drugs used. We found that the ICA-sensitive component was 44.8% of I<sub>Na</sub>. Conversely, 14.5 and 32.9% of I<sub>Na</sub> was sensitive to AH-TTX and PF-05089771, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). No significant effect of the 0.1% DMSO vehicle solution on I<sub>Na</sub> amplitude was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Similar to serial pharmacological experiments, I<sub>Na</sub> density in proprioceptors was significantly reduced from ~â140 pA/pF to ~â75 pA/pF following ICA application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, p=0.0003). The proprioceptor I<sub>Na</sub> had an average tau of 0.6 ms, which was significantly slowed to 1.0 ms following application of ICA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, p=0.0007), in line with loss of a fast gating channel. Blocking Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 did not change I<sub>Na</sub> rise time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, p=0.1611). Quantification of the ICA-sensitive component found an average tau of 0.4 ms and an average current density of â96 pA/pF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Of note, there was a wide distribution of current densities for the ICA-sensitive component, ranging from ~â28 pA/pF to ~â263 pA/pF, suggesting some variability in the contribution of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 to proprioceptor excitability that may be proprioceptor subtype dependent. We next used current-clamp experiments to determine the effect of ICA on proprioceptor intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 significantly reduced the number of evoked action potentials in most genetically identified proprioceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>); however, five of the cells recorded had low firing rates that were not inhibited by ICA. This further suggests that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is important for repetitive firing in most proprioceptors, but some subtypes with lower intrinsic excitability instead rely on a combination of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7. Action potential amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, p=0.0420) and action potential threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, p=0.0186) were also significantly reduced following ICA application, and action potential full-width half-max was significantly increased following ICA application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, p=0.0068), in line with loss of the fast Na<sub>V</sub>1.1-mediated current.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 significantly contributes to the whole-cell sodium current and intrinsic excitability in genetically identified proprioceptors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: representative whole-cell voltage-clamp traces elicited before (black) and after (magenta) application of ICA 121431 (500 nM).

Consistent with in vitro data, Scn1a-cKO animals of both sexes displayed profound and visible motor abnormalities. These abnormalities include ataxic-like tremors when suspended in the air (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), abnormal limb positioning (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>), and paw clasping, which are absent in Scn1a-floxed littermate controls and heterozygous animals (<italic>Pirt</italic><sup>Cre</sup>;<italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>fl/+</sup>, Scn1a-Het, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

No genotype-dependent differences were observed in the amount of time spent moving, suggesting gross motor function was intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Additionally, the amount of time spent in the center of the open-field chamber was also independent of genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We next used the rotarod assay to investigate differences in motor coordination. Mice were assayed on three consecutive days and latency to fall and revolutions per minute (RPM) were quantified.

By day 3, on average they were only able to maintain their position on the rotarod for 41 s, falling over 50% faster Scn1a-floxed and Scn1a-Het mice.

While in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology can assess Na<sub>V</sub> function at DRG somata and provide insight as to how they contribute to intrinsic excitability, the physiological contributions of ion channels in DRG soma to somatosensory transmission in vivo are not well understood. Thus, to directly investigate how Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 shapes action potential propagation down proprioceptor axons, we used an ex vivo preparation to record muscle afferent activity during ramp-and-hold stretch and sinusoidal vibration. Afferents from both Scn1a-Het and Scn1a-cKO mice exhibited impaired static stretch sensitivity as evidenced by a decreased likelihood of firing during rest as compared to Scn1a-floxed mice, as well as an inability to maintain firing throughout the entire 4 s stretch. Almost all afferents from Scn1a-floxed mice could fire consistently throughout the entire 4 s hold phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), but loss of one or both copies of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 led to either firing only near the beginning of stretch or inconsistent firing in a high percentage of afferents lacking Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>). We quantified this inconsistent firing by determining the CV of the interspike interval (ISI) during the plateau phase of stretch (1.5â3.5 s into the hold phase) across different stretch lengths and found a significant effect of genotype, with the knockout afferents both having higher ISI CV than the Scn1a-floxed afferents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; 0.074 Â± 0.06, 0.313 Â± 0.456, 0.497 Â± 0.831, at 7.5% Lo, Scn1a-floxed, Scn1a-Het, and Scn1a-cKO afferents, respectively, two-way ANOVA, main effect of genotype, p=0.015). In contrast to the clear deficits in static sensitivity in afferents lacking Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, dynamic sensitivity was not significantly impaired.

The results presented in this study are the first to provide functional evidence that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in peripheral sensory neurons is required for normal proprioception. We found that mice lacking Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in sensory neurons exhibit visible motor deficits and ataxic-like behaviors, which we propose is largely attributed to loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in proprioceptors. Indeed, RNAscope analysis showed expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 mRNA in 100% of genetically identified proprioceptors. While Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 were also ubiquitously expressed in proprioceptors, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 displayed higher expression levels, consistent with a previous RNA-sequencing study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). There are anywhere from 5 to 8 different proprioceptor molecular subclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oliver et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2021</xref>), however, and it is possible that these distinct classes rely on different combinations of these channels for function. Nevertheless, our functional in vitro patch-clamp experiments found Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 to be the dominant subtype across recorded neurons, comprising nearly half of the proprioceptor I<sub>Na</sub>. In line with this, pharmacological inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is sufficient to significantly attenuate action potential firing in most proprioceptors; yet, it should be noted that 25% of the neurons we recorded fired action potentials that were insensitive to ICA application. This suggests that some proprioceptor subtypes rely more heavily on Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 for electrical activity. Interestingly, the proprioceptors that were insensitive to ICA application also were less intrinsic excitable, firing only 1â2 action potentials in response to current injection, as opposed to the other 75% on neurons recorded, which fired repetitively during the 100 ms injection protocol. This further supports a role for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in maintaining action potential firing in response to sustained stimulation. These results, however, should be interpreted with the caveat that in these experiments ICA may also be acting on Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels that are upregulated during DRG neuron culturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wangzhou et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, at the afferent level Scn1a-cKO and Scn1a-Het animals show clear deficits in static stretch sensitivity, but not dynamic sensitivity, and could even entrain to vibrations as fast as 100 Hz, suggesting a specific role for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in proprioceptors responses to static muscle movement. Finally, we found that loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in sensory neurons had no effect on proprioceptor development, muscle spindle morphology, or proprioceptive afferent innervation of ChAT+ motor neurons in the spinal cord. Thus, the observed motor behavioral deficits are likely due to reduced static sensitivity of proprioceptor afferents.</p><p>Our model proposes that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is tasked with maintaining consistent firing in spindle afferents during static muscle stretch for normal motor behaviors, whereby activation of the mechanotransduction channel Piezo2 initiates electrical signaling, which in turn activates a complement of TTX-sensitive Na<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carrasco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Florez-Paz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Woo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). During dynamic or vibratory stimuli, Piezo2, and likely a combination of other molecular mediators, including Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, are sufficient to elicit normal electrical activity. Conversely, during prolonged muscle stretch when Piezo2 channels presumably inactivate, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is required for regular and reliable firing. While other signaling molecules and channels, such as vesicle-released glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bewick et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Than et al., 2021</xref>), and mechanosensitive ASIC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2016</xref>) and ENaC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bewick and Banks, 2015</xref>), also contribute to mammalian proprioception, our data suggests that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is a critical for muscle spindle afferent mechanotransduction, given the overt behavioral deficits observed in Scn1a-cKO mice. Due to the ubiquitous expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in all proprioceptors and the importance of Golgi tendon organ (GTO) feedback to motor control, alterations in function in those proprioceptors likely contribute to the behavioral deficits we observed; however, we did not directly measure their function.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of the role of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in proprioception.</title><p>Upon muscle static stretch, various channels activate, including Piezo2 (red), which results in an influx of calcium and sodium ions, causing a depolarization that activates Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 (dark blue). Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 activation drives reliable repetitive firing of proprioceptors during static stretch for normal motor behavior. Loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in sensory neurons results in inconsistent static firing at the afferent level while maintaining dynamic firing, resulting in uncoordinated movements and abnormal limb positioning. It is possible that a combination of Piezo2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (yellow), Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 (pink), and/or other channels, such as glutamate receptors (dark blue), ASIC, and ENaC channels (green), mediates dynamic firing.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79917-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To date, our knowledge of the functional contributions of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in the PNS is limited. Most studies have identified roles for this channel in mechanical pain signaling in DRG, TG, and vagal sensory neurons. Intraplantar pharmacological activation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 induces spontaneous pain behaviors and mechanical pain, which are absent in mice lacking Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in small- and medium-diameter sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osteen et al., 2016</xref>). Inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 prevented the development of mechanical pain in several preclinical models, including spared nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salvatierra et al., 2018</xref>), an irritable bowel syndrome mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salvatierra et al., 2018</xref>), and infraorbital nerve chronic constriction injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pineda-Farias et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, blocking Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 channels inhibited firing in TRPM8-expressing neurons in vitro, suggesting a potential role for this channel in thermosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Griffith et al., 2019</xref>). No prior studies, however, have reported a functional role for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, or Na<sub>V</sub>s in general, in proprioception.</p><p>The loss of consistent firing we observed during static stretch in Scn1a-cKO and Scn1a-Het animals is functionally similar to deletion of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in other brain cell types. Indeed, loss of a single copy of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is sufficient to attenuate sustained action potential firing in parvalbumin-positive hippocampal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2006</xref>) and cerebellar Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 has been associated with persistent sodium current (I<sub>Na</sub>P) and resurgent sodium current (I<sub>Na</sub>R), both of which promote repetitive firing in a wide variety of cell types in the CNS and PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalume et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khaliq et al., 2003</xref>). Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 also recovers rapidly from fast inactivation compared to other channel subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herzog et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel et al., 2015</xref>) and has been shown to be refractory to entry into slow inactivation in TRPM8-expressing DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Griffith et al., 2019</xref>). We observed similar characteristics when analyzing the proprioceptor I<sub>Na</sub>. Future studies will determine whether proprioceptors rely on these features of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 for reliable and consistent encoding of static muscle stretch.</p><p>Loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 notably impacted proprioceptor afferent static sensitivity during ramp-and-hold stretch, but not dynamic sensitivity as measured by entrainment to sinusoidal vibrations using ex vivo muscle-nerve recordings. Afferents from Scn1a-cKO animals were more likely to have action potential failures and thus were largely unable to fire consistently throughout the 4 s of stretch, which was accompanied by a higher coefficient of variability in the ISI. This indicates that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 has a critical role in transmitting static stretch information to the CNS. Interestingly, however, dynamic sensitivity in these afferents was unimpaired. Both Scn1a-cKO and Scn1a-Het afferents were able to entrain throughout the entire 9 s vibration; therefore, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 does not appear to have a generalized role in maintaining high-frequency firing, but a more specific contribution to muscle-afferent static sensitivity. Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 has been localized to muscle spindle afferent endings and has been hypothesized to help amplify receptor current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carrasco et al., 2017</xref>). Our results support a model whereby current from Piezo2 and potentially other mechanically sensitive ion channels at the start of stretch produces a sufficient receptor potential to generate firing at the heminode, but that amplification of the receptor potential by Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is necessary to maintain firing during held stretch.</p><p>A similar deficit in static but not dynamic sensitivity was seen following loss of synaptic-like vesicle released glutamate from afferent endings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Than et al., 2021</xref>); however, in those afferents, firing only occurred at the beginning of stretch and patchy firing was never observed. This may indicate that glutamate plays a more general role maintaining excitability, whereas Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is required for reliable action potential generation at heminodes during static stimuli. Alternatively, or in addition, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 expressed along the axon could be essential for sustained static firing. A detailed examination of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 subcellular localization along proprioceptor afferents could shed light on how this channel contributes to signal propagation. The lack of an effect on dynamic sensitivity could suggest the upregulation of other Na<sub>V</sub> subtypes or other molecules as a compensatory mechanism to counteract the loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1. Indeed, our in vitro electrophysiological experiments found a more pronounced effect of acute Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 inhibition on proprioceptor excitability. This could be due, however, to artificially upregulated Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel activity in culturing conditions, or conversely, a higher density of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 expression in proprioceptor somata. Future studies using temporally controlled deletion of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in sensory neurons could tease this apart. Nevertheless, as static sensitivity is still very much impaired in both Scn1a-cKO and Scn1a-Het afferents, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 may play a potentially unique role in maintaining afferent firing during the sustained stretch.</p><p>Loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in sensory neurons did not impact proprioceptor development as the number of proprioceptors in DRG sections was unchanged between genotypes, and muscle spindles developed normally in our model. While we did not directly examine GTOs, we do not anticipate that abnormal end organ development would be restricted to that proprioceptor subtype. Additionally, we did not observe a general decrease in Î±-motor neuron innervation, which is consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mendelsohn et al., 2015</xref>, who reported loss of proprioceptor activity does not generally reduce proprioceptive input into the spinal cord. Interestingly, however, the authors did observe changes in heteronymous sensory-motor connectivity when proprioceptor transmission was blocked, whereby proprioceptor innervation of motor neurons that project to antagonistic muscles was increased. Whether loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in proprioceptive afferents causes them to âmis-wireâ in our model to make connections with inappropriate motor neuron pools is unclear. Future studies will determine whether this contributes to the observed behavioral deficits.</p><p>We found effects of both pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in in vitro and ex vivo electrophysiological experiments, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>); however, in our mouse model Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is deleted in all sensory neurons. Thus, we cannot rule out that loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in other mechanosenory neuron populations, such as touch receptors, contributes to the motor deficits observed. Deletion of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in small- and medium-diameter DRG neurons using a peripherin-Cre driver did not produce visible motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osteen et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that sensory neuron populations in those categories are not involved. We did observe Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 transcripts in the vast majority of myelinated DRG neurons (a combination of large- and medium-diameter DRG neurons), consistent with its presence in different subclasses of tactile sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). However, the severe motor phenotype of Scn1a-cKO mice precludes mechanical threshold analysis using von Frey or tactile sensitivity using tape test. Notably, baseline mechanical thresholds were unchanged following intraplantar injection of a selective Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salvatierra et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that while Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 mRNA is expressed in most tactile sensory neurons, functional protein may only be upregulated in these populations during pathological states.</p><p>Despite this limitation, one noteworthy and intriguing finding from our study was the haploinsufficiency of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in sensory neurons for proprioceptor function and normal motor behavior in the open-field test. At the afferent level, heterozygous and homozygous loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 produced similar deficits in static firing, suggesting that loss of less than a quarter of the proprioceptor I<sub>Na</sub> is sufficient to impair proprioceptor responsiveness to muscle stretch. Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is haploinsufficient in several brain neuron cell types for normal excitability and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting the contributions of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 to neuronal function are highly sensitive to genetic perturbations. At the behavioral level, Scn1a-Het mice had an identical phenotype to Scn1a-cKO mice, moving more slowly and less than controls, despite not having the more severe and visible motor coordination deficits. Indeed, their performance on the rotarod was identical to that of Scn1a-floxed controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). How these behavioral differences arise given the similar transmission deficits in Scn1a-cKO and Scn1a-Het afferents is unclear. One possibility is a presynaptic role for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in proprioceptive terminals that is unveiled when both copies of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 are lost. For example, loss of presynaptic Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels in the spinal cord reduced glutamate release from nociceptive afferents onto dorsal horn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MacDonald et al., 2021</xref>). If a similar mechanism is at play for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in proprioceptors, reduced neurotransmitter release from Scn1a-Het afferent terminals could be sufficient to produce quantifiable, albeit more subtle, motor deficits. Future studies are required to test this possibility.</p><p>Notably, <italic>Scn1a</italic> is a super culprit gene with over 1000 associated disease-causing mutations, most of which are linked to different forms of epilepsy. Many epilepsy patients with hemizygous Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 loss of function display ataxia and motor delays and deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujiwara et al., 2003</xref>), which has traditionally been attributed to loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 function in the brain, namely, the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalume et al., 2007</xref>). Our findings suggest that some of the clinical manifestations associated with epilepsy are not solely due to Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 loss of function in the brain, but also may manifest in part as a result of unreliable coding by peripheral proprioceptors.</p><p>Data presented in this study provide new evidence of a role for peripherally expressed Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in motor coordination. We show that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is ubiquitously and strongly expressed in proprioceptors, contributes to proprioceptor excitability in vitro and ex vivo, and is haploinsufficient in sensory neurons for normal motor behaviors. Collectively, this work identifies a new role for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in mammalian proprioception.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Key Resources

The extensor digitorum longus muscle and innervating peroneal branch of the sciatic nerve were dissected from adult (2â4-month-old) mice of both sexes. Muscles were held at optimal length (Lo), or the length of the muscle that maximal force of twitch contraction occurred. A series of nine 4 s ramp-and-hold stretches were given to three different stretch lengths repeated three times each (2.5, 5, and 7.5% Lo; ramp speed 40% Lo/s). A series of twelve 9 s sinusoidal vibrations were given (25, 50, and 100 Âµm amplitude; 10, 25, 50, and 100 Hz frequency). A 1-min rest was given between each length change. Firing rates during a 10 s baseline before stretch (resting discharge or RD) and the maximal firing rate during the rampup phase of stretch (dynamic peak or DP) were calculated for all animals. We determined whether the response to static stretch was maintained consistently throughout the 4 s stretch, as well as the coefficient of variability of the ISI during the plateau phase of stretch (CV = Std Dev/Mean of ISI over the time period of 1.5â3.5 s after end of rampup). Average firing rate during the 9 s of vibration and whether the unit could entrain in a 1:1 fashion to vibration was also determined.

Tau values were calculated from 20 ms voltage steps from â90 mV to â30 mV and analyzed with single-exponential curve fits. Voltage-clamp and current-clamp experiments were analyzed with Clampfit software v11.2 (Molecular Devices) and custom MATLAB Scripts. Ex vivo recordings were obtained using an A-M Systems Model 1800 extracellular amplifier with headstage and digitized using an ADInstruments PowerLab. Data was analyzed using ADInstruments LabChart software using the Spike Histogram function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p>Summary data are presented as mean Â± SEM, from <italic>n</italic> cells, afferents, or sections, or <italic>N</italic> animals. For quantitative analysis of in situ hybridization data, at least three biological replicates per condition were used and the investigator was blinded to genotype for analysis. Behavioral experiments and analysis were also performed genotype-blind. Statistical differences were determined using parametric tests for normally distributed data and nonparametric tests for data that did not conform to Gaussian distributions or had different variances. Statistical tests are listed in âResultsâ and/or figure legends. Statistical significance in each case is denoted as follows: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, and ****p&lt;0.0001. Statistical tests and curve fits were performed using Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software). All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the article.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Alexander Theodore Chesler as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joriene C de Nooij (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, all the reviewers agree this is a well-executed and interesting study. Each reviewer raised specific points that needed clarification (see below). While the majority can be addressed with revised text, a few key experiments are being requested that seem reasonable, would add a great deal, and therefore should be done where possible. Please provide a point-by-point response to each comment when you resubmit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 2 needs a proper drug-free control. The authors should show at least a few recordings demonstrating the effect of perfusing vehicles on the sodium currents and excitability of the proprioceptors. I don't doubt the effect of ICA is real, but this seems like a basic requirement for this kind of experiment.</p><p>2. &quot;In voltage clamp experiments, ICA application reduced the whole-cell sodium current (INa) on average by 46%, suggesting NaV1.1 is a dominant sodium channel isoform in these neurons (Figure 2A-B).&quot; This statement is misleading. In principle, the other 54% might be mediated entirely by NaV1.6 or NaV1.7. Very good selective blockers of NaV1.7 (PF-771) are commercially available, and reasonably good NaV1.6 blockers (4,9-AH-TTX), thus defining which channels carry the rest of the current in proprioceptors is a doable experiment. Given the current clamp experiments found no effects of NaV1.1. block on excitability in 25% of proprioceptors, it is likely the other A fiber enriched sodium channels are playing a major role. NaV1.6 especially appears to be critical for the function of myelinated DRG afferents.</p><p>3. It's surprising the authors generated a conditional NaV1.1. KO mouse and performed no in vitro recordings on DRGs from these mice. I understand their current cross provides no means of labelling proprioceptors for targeted patching, and brain recombination of PV-Cre precludes using this line for behavior. However, if the Parv-Cre X Nav1.1 KO mice are viable, then recording from DRGs in vitro should be possible. These neurons could be labeled with Cre-dependent AAVs for targeted recordings (e.g. flex-tdTomato). It seems important to validate that ICA-sensitive current is gone in large diameter DRGs in their conditional KO, which would nicely validate both the efficiency of the KO and the concentration of ICA they used.</p><p>4. Considering the behavior reported, it is likely that the effect of Nav1.1 might be on golgi tendon organs (GTOs) rather than spindles (see Akay et al. 2014). The fact that the vibratory muscle responses are intact, but the stretch (which would also activate the GTOs) are affected is consistent with this conclusion. Verifying the structure of the GTOs would be helpful.</p><p>5. One important consideration is that sodium channel Î± subunit deletion in DRGs has been reported to produce compensatory upregulation of other isoforms (e.g. NaV1.8 deletion produces compensatory upregulation of NaV1.7, in Akopian 1999). This is a strong argument for focusing their in vitro recording on selectively pharmacological approaches, as opposed to the conditional KO, and should be mentioned. Genetic compensation might also explain the contrast between the dramatic effects of ICA on excitability measured in vitro, versus the weaker effects of the conditional KO on excitability measured in vivo.</p><p>6. It is interesting the authors find behavioral effects of even heterozygous deletion of NaV1.1. If NaV1.6 accounts for 46% of the total sodium current in proprioceptors, then it's impressive that removal of just 23% of the total sodium current can produce behavioral and static force firing alterations (and presumably change in vitro excitability). Honestly, this result is quite surprising as most DRG sodium channels are not haploinsufficient (as shown with conditional and global deletion of NaV1.7, NaV1.8, NaV1.9, and NaV1.6, and in human null mutants for NaV1.7 and NaV1.9) and suggests that proprioceptors are unique in their non-redundant dependence on NaV1.1.</p><p>7. Staining 1a afferents with Vglut1 should be combined with Parvalbumin. The finding that motoneurons (which to be proper should be called ventrally located cholinergic neurons) have ~ 8 Vglut1 terminals in WT versus ~ 5 in cKO seems a rather small difference. To make claims about connectivity/spinal effects would require monitoring monosynaptic reflex amplitude evoked by stimulating the dorsal root.</p><p>8. This brings us to the last point, which is probably the most important in terms of the conclusions of the paper, but the experiment is probably not needed for publication, just interesting. Conditional KO of NaV1.1 produces such strong behavioral effects on motor function, and NaV1.1 block so profoundly impairs proprioceptor firing in vitro, that it's quite surprising that the effect of KO on the in vivo firing is either modest (for static) or nonexistent (for dynamic). It's thus really interesting the authors find by IHC a reduced anatomical synaptic input to motor neurons. This provokes the obvious hypothesis that the behavioral deficits result from both decreased peripheral excitability and deficits at the central terminal of the proprioceptor (as mentioned in the discussion has been shown for NaV1.7 in both nociceptors and olfactory sensory neurons). If NaV1.1. is the predominant sodium channel in proprioceptors, then it is likely it is expressed all along the proprioceptor neurons, and may contribute to both AP initiation, propagation, invasion of the presynaptic terminal, and presynaptic excitability. Expression of ChR2 in NaV1.1-deleted sensory neurons would enable a physiological study of how NaV1.1 KO affects synaptic transmission between sensory afferents and proprioceptor targets in the spinal cord. A better (and easier experiment) would be to inject an AAV-encoding ChR2 into PV-Cre mice at P0, and then record light-evoked EPSCs in proprioceptor target neurons in the spinal cord while applying ICA onto the spinal cord slice. The advantage of the pharmacological experiment is it would allow the authors to disambiguate the anatomical loss of connectivity due to conditional KO, from any intrinsic effects of NaV1.1 block on a presynaptic function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors appear extremely careful not to overstate their findings in the title and abstract â perhaps overly so in certain cases. For instance, I was surprised to find the selective requirement of Nav1.1 only in the data section of the ex vivo muscle spindle analyses. Bringing in these observations earlier (in the abstract) may make the manuscript less generic and more enticing for a number of people. In part, the careful wording may be in recognition of the limitations of some of the experiments â which in my few could be helped by adding a few additional experiments/controls (specific recommendations below). Other recommendations concern the presentation of the data in some of the Figures.</p><p>1. Three comments on the RNAscope in situ data. (A) Figure 1 nicely demonstrates the distribution of Nav1.1 across various sensory subsets and in Figure 6 it is used to demonstrate normal numbers of proprioceptors across all genotypes. As part of these analyses, it also shows the expression of B3 tubulin. The B3 tubulin is not helping in the interpretation of these data. I'd strongly suggest taking this data out and just showing the merged image with Nav1.1 and the marker gene of interest (if insisting on keeping the B3 panel does the merge without B3 tubulin). (B) In Figure 1, the summary plots for CGPR and MrgprD are a bit confusing; it would be better to place the % next to the pink segments rather than in the yellow (non-overlapping) segments. C) It is mentioned that &quot;the coefficient of variation in integrated fluorescence density in proprioceptors is 76.5&quot; (lines 253-255 and Figures 1E and F). The significance of this statement, or how one derives this number is not explained in the text or methods.</p><p>2. In probing the role of Nav1.1 in proprioceptors using in vitro recordings it may be useful for the reader to get a sense of the expression (levels) of all Nav channels in proprioceptors in order to better understand how blocking or activating Nav1.1 may affect neuronal excitability. Currently, only Nav1.3 is mentioned in the context of the Nav1.1 blocker ICA. Nav1.3 is not considered to play a role because it is not known to be expressed in proprioceptors, and because &quot;those channels are not expressed in uninjured adult DRG neurons&quot;. The latter statement is a bit odd in this context given that dissociated DRG neurons may well be considered injured. It may be useful to test the Nav1.3 transcript levels in the dissociated tdT positive neurons (after culturing) to exclude the possibility this channel interferes with the interpretation of these studies.</p><p>3. &quot;inhibition of NaV1.1 significantly reduced the number of evoked action potentials in most genetically identified proprioceptors (Figure 2H); however, of the 20 cells recorded, 5 had low firing rates that were not further inhibited by ICA, indicating in some proprioceptors subtypes other NaVs mediate (to) action potential firing.&quot; I am a bit puzzled by Figure 2H, as the average for the ICA data seems to align with the top most data point? Is this correct? From this statement, it also becomes clear that Nav1.1 may be more relevant in certain proprioceptor subtypes than in others, which is an interesting observation that could warrant more discussion.</p><p>4. The in vitro recordings suggest a role for Nav1.1 in proprioceptor repetitive firing, yet these experiments would carry so much more weight if performed with Nav1.1 mutant (or even Nav1.1. heterozygous) proprioceptors. While the behavioral studies with PVCre are understandably not informative, the PVcre-induced conditional Nav1.1 deletion (in conjunction with the tdT reporter) could have been used to solidify the in vitro studies. Given that all the genetic tools are in place, it is not clear to me why this was not attempted or discussed.</p><p>5. The behavioral analyses of Nav1.1cKO animals show a clear loss of motor coordination, and mutant animals differ significantly from wild-type (Nav1.1flx/flx) controls in open field and rotarod. While both behaviors may also rely on low threshold cutaneous afferent feedback (in particular in rotarod assays) which similarly expresses Nav1.1, it is likely that the phenotype is in part due to the loss in proprioceptors. As a control, the authors assess the expression of the Pirt:Cre driver in the spinal cord (using a tdT reporter). For completion, it would also be informative to perform similar control studies in muscle (e.g. intrafusal muscle fibers) brain stem, cerebellum, and cortex. Kim et al. demonstrated little to no expression in these tissues, yet it is not clear whether those data also apply to adult animals.</p><p>6. The ex vivo muscle spindle recordings offer a nice complement to the in vitro and behavioral studies and permit a more specific assessment of a key subset of proprioceptors, the muscle spindle afferents. These data are interesting for two reasons, the similarity in phenotype between the cHET and cKO animals (i.e. the haploinsufficiency of Nav1.1), and the apparent selective requirement of Nav1.1 for the static MS response. Yet these studies also demonstrate the variability in the data, perhaps suggesting that the number of recordings may need to be higher? As for the selective requirement of Nav1.1 in static discharge frequency, it is not clear to me why this is not more highlighted in the abstract. This is an interesting result that may help to tease apart the molecular basis of the response properties of different proprioceptor subtypes.</p><p>7. Figure 4 panels A, B, and C are a bit confusing with regard to the pie charts. The summary quantifications for static discharge patterns for wt, het, and cKO Nav1.1. mice are depicted with the amount of 'inconsistent traces' in black. This color coding is reversed for the resting discharge (absent discharge is quantified as colored; even though in wt 50% of afferents lack resting discharge, this % is higher in the mutants).</p><p>8. In a set of control studies, the Nav1.1 genotypes are compared with respect to the number of proprioceptors, spindle morphology, and synaptic connectivity between MS afferents and spinal motor neurons. Interestingly, these studies appear to reveal a significant reduction in MS afferent vGlut1 positive synaptic contacts onto ChAT positive motor neurons. This is another potentially interesting result but these data appear a bit rushed. SN-MN connectivity is best compared across the same (backfilled) motor pool (and ideally by only looking at synapses from the homonymous afferents). Another aspect that may be influencing these data is the size of the synaptic boutons on the MNs. Maybe this can be resolved using higher power images (again comparing the contacts on motor neurons that innervate the same muscle)? Ultimately, the best assessment of these connections is to perform ventral root recordings after stimulating the dorsal roots. (FWIW, the DAPI panels in Figure 7 are more distractive than useful; an orientating schematic may also help).</p><p>9. There are various other studies that have performed in vitro recordings on proprioceptor afferents with sometimes divergent observations (e.g. Woo et al., 2015; Florez Paz et al., 2016; Zheng, et al., 2019; Oliver et al., 2021). It would have been interesting to see a discussion of the current observations in the context of these other studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very thorough study on Nav1.1 function in the peripheral nervous system. The data are generally of high quality, but I have some questions about the patch-clamp data:</p><p>â Voltage-gated sodium channels are very fast gating, therefore it is crucial to have good space and voltage-clamp conditions for their measurement. Pipette resistances up to 6Mohm, as used here, are very high, and it is quite likely that the currents recorded by the authors were not well clamped. The quality of the clamp can be assessed by the shape of the current traces, thus the authors should show example IV traces, which allow judgement of the current at low voltages, where the driving force is high, but the open probability of the channels is low. This should be added to Figure 2.</p><p>â Figure 2: As stated in the first point, the quality of the presented data is hard to assess. Please show the stimulation protocols. Please show a complete IV curve. At which potential was current decay assessed? Why not over a range of potentials, which would give a better understanding of the impact during an AP. Time to peak â in your case called rise time, is very fast in Navs. Again, clamping conditions are crucial. It seems that in the ICA group there is an outlier, which most likely has a higher series resistance (how high was it in general?) and thus should be removed. If done so, it is quite likely, that there will be no significant difference anymore.</p><p>â The blocker used: ICA is also effective against Nav1.3 as mentioned in the manuscript. Please show that your cultures do not express NAv1.3 or only to a minor degree. Dissociation is quite an axotomy and may thus induce Nav1.3 expression in mice. Alternatively, use cells that are unlikely to express Nav1.1 as a control for your blocker, such as MrgprD+ neurons, which you investigated in Figure 1.</p><p>â Discussion lines 586ff: it is easy to investigate the persistent current in your recordings. Please do so, so you can substantiate your interpretation and discussion of this point. Also, using the correct protocol it is possible to investigate if the proprioceptors show resurgent currents. An in-depth investigation of the biophysics of Nav1.1 in their expressing cells (i.e. proprioceptors) would strengthen the manuscript a lot. It could also help to understand why the channel specifically is so important for proprioceptor function, while the other channels, which are expressed in these cells, cannot compensate for it. How quickly is the Nav1.1 component recovering in proprioceptors? is this really the important characteristic which is missing in the ko mice?</p><p>â Figure 1: please explain E and F better â what is plotted on the x-axis? What is the value 76.5 mentioned in the text in line 255?</p><p>â I am a bit confused by your statement in line 293 on the Vhalf of activation of Nav1.1 being -15mV. you would at least need to compare it to the Vhalf of the other Navs in order to make a statement on their involvement in the threshold. How did you determine this relatively negative threshold? In general, please provide more info on your ephys analysis (was tau obtained by single expt fitting? did you include an offset, was this changed by ICA?).</p><p>â Suppl Figure 2: which mouse is this? it is good to see the expression also in the ventral horn, please also show a 40x of the ventral horn.</p><p>â Please define Lo also in the Figure legend or in the text. Figure 4: what does the percentage during the resting state refer to? fibers â time recorded?</p><p>â Fi.5A-c: how did you test for differences in the percentage of entrainment? cKO has 64% vs fl/fl 33% â this seems to be quite a difference (in contrast to your statement in line 433 where you describe them to be similar).</p><p>â Figure 5D: what does FPS stand for?</p><p>â Figure 8: you mention Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 in your figure. Are they expressed in your RNAscope data in proprioceptors? Do you have any other data on other Nav subtypes?</p><p>â Discussion: it would be nice to mention that Nav channels are also mechanosensitive, with potential differences among sodium channel subtypes. This could contribute to their function in proprioceptors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79917.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

We have added this experiment to a new Figure 2âfigure supplement 1, in which we find no significant effect of DMSO on proprioceptor sodium currents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. &quot;In voltage clamp experiments, ICA application reduced the whole-cell sodium current (INa) on average by 46%, suggesting NaV1.1 is a dominant sodium channel isoform in these neurons (Figure 2A-B).&quot; This statement is misleading. In principle, the other 54% might be mediated entirely by NaV1.6 or NaV1.7. Very good selective blockers of NaV1.7 (PF-771) are commercially available, and reasonably good NaV1.6 blockers (4,9-AH-TTX), thus defining which channels carry the rest of the current in proprioceptors is a doable experiment. Given the current clamp experiments found no effects of NaV1.1. block on excitability in 25% of proprioceptors, it is likely the other A fiber enriched sodium channels are playing a major role. NaV1.6 especially appears to be critical for the function of myelinated DRG afferents.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewerâs suggestions to examine the function of the other Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms in proprioceptors. We agree that this analysis adds value to our study. We have now performed pharmacological experiments to identify the contributions of all Na<sub>V</sub> channels in proprioceptors to the whole-cell sodium current using in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology. The results (Figure 2E-F) show that Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 make up 14.5% and 32.9% of the somal sodium current in proprioceptors, respectively. We did find that on average our pharmacological strategy left ~7.8% of the sodium current unblocked; however, that portion was TTX sensitive, suggesting imperfect block the antagonists used, which we addressed in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It's surprising the authors generated a conditional NaV1.1. KO mouse and performed no in vitro recordings on DRGs from these mice. I understand their current cross provides no means of labelling proprioceptors for targeted patching, and brain recombination of PV-Cre precludes using this line for behavior. However, if the Parv-Cre X Nav1.1 KO mice are viable, then recording from DRGs in vitro should be possible. These neurons could be labeled with Cre-dependent AAVs for targeted recordings (e.g. flex-tdTomato). It seems important to validate that ICA-sensitive current is gone in large diameter DRGs in their conditional KO, which would nicely validate both the efficiency of the KO and the concentration of ICA they used.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewerâs suggestion. We chose to perform ex-vivo recordings from muscle-spindle afferents instead of somal recordings from Na<sub>V</sub>1.1<sup>cko</sup> mice. Unfortunately, PV<sup>Cre</sup>;Nav1.1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice die prematurely and have severe seizures (PMID: 17537961), precluding their use in this study. The concentration of ICA used is in line we our previously published data and that of others (PMIDs: 31300524, 28607094). As a control, we performed ICA recordings in our knockout animals (Figure 4 âfigure supplement 1) and surprisingly found a small but significant decrease in the current when recording from large-diameter neurons, indicative of upregulated Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels as suggested by Reviewers 2 and 3. We have addressed this in the main text and adjusted our interpretation of pharmacological data accordingly.</p><p>Results:</p><p>âIt is important to note that ICA 121431 also blocks Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, which could be upregulated in our cultured DRG neuron preparations (Wangzhou et al., 2020). Indeed, a small but significant decrease in I<sub>Na</sub> was observed in recordings from large-diameter DRG neurons harvested from Pirt<sup>Cre</sup>;Na<sub>V</sub>1.1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1<sup>cKO</sup>), which lack Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in all sensory neurons. Thus, inhibition of upregulated Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels could contribute to the effect of on ICA on the proprioceptor I<sub>Na</sub>.â</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>âThese results, however, should be interpreted with the caveat that in these experiments ICA may also be acting on Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels that are upregulated during DRG neuron culturing.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Considering the behavior reported, it is likely that the effect of Nav1.1 might be on golgi tendon organs (GTOs) rather than spindles (see Akay et al. 2014). The fact that the vibratory muscle responses are intact, but the stretch (which would also activate the GTOs) are affected is consistent with this conclusion. Verifying the structure of the GTOs would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that there are likely alterations in GTO afferent function as well. We are confident that the afferents we record from in the ex vivo system are muscle spindle afferents, since we have never seen increased firing during twitch contraction that would be typical of a Ib afferent. However, it is formally possible that we have included some Ib afferents in our sample. We think the unaltered dynamic sensitivity finding would likely hold even if that were the case, because Dynamic Peak firing during stretch was also unaltered. We also predict that GTO structure is likely to be preserved in our mice, although we donât currently have a good method to quantify that. We have added the following to our discussion to highlight the fact that we did not assay GTO function but would predict it is likely affected.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>âDue to the ubiquitous expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in all proprioceptors and the importance of Golgi Tendon Organ feedback to motor control, alterations in function in those proprioceptors likely contribute to the behavioral deficits we observed. However, we did not directly measure their function.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. One important consideration is that sodium channel Î± subunit deletion in DRGs has been reported to produce compensatory upregulation of other isoforms (e.g. NaV1.8 deletion produces compensatory upregulation of NaV1.7, in Akopian 1999). This is a strong argument for focusing their in vitro recording on selectively pharmacological approaches, as opposed to the conditional KO, and should be mentioned. Genetic compensation might also explain the contrast between the dramatic effects of ICA on excitability measured in vitro, versus the weaker effects of the conditional KO on excitability measured in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for highlighting this point. We have this information currently in the Discussion section:</p><p>âThe lack of an effect on dynamic sensitivity could suggest the upregulation of other Na<sub>V</sub> subtypes or other molecules as a compensatory mechanism to counteract the loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1.â</p><p>We have also noted that in vitro recordings are performed from the soma, whereas ex vivo recordings are done from axons. This could also explain the differential affects between recording strategies and may suggest different functional contributions of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 to somal versus afferent firing.</p><p>âIndeed, our in vitro electrophysiological experiments found a more pronounced effect of acute Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 inhibition on proprioceptor excitability. This could be due, however, to artificially upregulated Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel activity in culturing conditions, or conversely, a higher density of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 expression in proprioceptor somata. Future studies using temporally controlled deletion of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in sensory neurons could tease this apart.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It is interesting the authors find behavioral effects of even heterozygous deletion of NaV1.1. If NaV1.6 accounts for 46% of the total sodium current in proprioceptors, then it's impressive that removal of just 23% of the total sodium current can produce behavioral and static force firing alterations (and presumably change in vitro excitability). Honestly, this result is quite surprising as most DRG sodium channels are not haploinsufficient (as shown with conditional and global deletion of NaV1.7, NaV1.8, NaV1.9, and NaV1.6, and in human null mutants for NaV1.7 and NaV1.9) and suggests that proprioceptors are unique in their non-redundant dependence on NaV1.1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We also found this finding very intriguing and surprising and have included extra discussion of this point:</p><p>âDespite this limitation, one noteworthy and intriguing finding from our study was the haploinsufficiency of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in sensory neurons for proprioceptor function and normal motor behavior in the open field test. At the afferent level, heterozygous and homozygous loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 produced similar deficits in static firing, suggesting that loss of less than a quarter of the proprioceptor I<sub>Na</sub> is sufficient to impair proprioceptor responsiveness to muscle stretch. Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is haploinsufficeint in several brain neuron cell-types for normal excitability and function, suggesting the contributions of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 to neuronal function are highly sensitive to genetic perturbations.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Staining 1a afferents with Vglut1 should be combined with Parvalbumin. The finding that motoneurons (which to be proper should be called ventrally located cholinergic neurons) have ~ 8 Vglut1 terminals in WT versus ~ 5 in cKO seems a rather small difference. To make claims about connectivity/spinal effects would require monitoring monosynaptic reflex amplitude evoked by stimulating the dorsal root.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for this comment. We re-performed our spinal cord experiments and analyses. We were unable to label proprioceptive afferents with our parvalbumin antibody and only observed interneuron staining (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This appears consistent with immunohistochemical staining from other groups using adult mice (PMIDs: 12457066, 24652212). To analyze proprioceptive axon targeting to motor neurons more rigorously, we only quantified puncta on ChAT positive motor neurons that were over 400 Âµm<sup>2</sup> (ref). Using this criterion, we now find no significant differences between genotypes. It is possible that we were including Î³ motor neurons in our previously analysis and thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. These updated experiments are now in Figure 7. We have also modified our model figure and the main text.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Spinal cord of a Na<sub>V</sub>1.</title><p>1f<sup>l/fl</sup> mouse stained with an anti-parvalbumin antibody (Thomas Jessell Laboratory, Columbia University).

This brings us to the last point, which is probably the most important in terms of the conclusions of the paper, but the experiment is probably not needed for publication, just interesting. Conditional KO of NaV1.1 produces such strong behavioral effects on motor function, and NaV1.1 block so profoundly impairs proprioceptor firing in vitro, that it's quite surprising that the effect of KO on the in vivo firing is either modest (for static) or nonexistent (for dynamic). It's thus really interesting the authors find by IHC a reduced anatomical synaptic input to motor neurons. This provokes the obvious hypothesis that the behavioral deficits result from both decreased peripheral excitability and deficits at the central terminal of the proprioceptor (as mentioned in the discussion has been shown for NaV1.7 in both nociceptors and olfactory sensory neurons). If NaV1.1. is the predominant sodium channel in proprioceptors, then it is likely it is expressed all along the proprioceptor neurons, and may contribute to both AP initiation, propagation, invasion of the presynaptic terminal, and presynaptic excitability. Expression of ChR2 in NaV1.1-deleted sensory neurons would enable a physiological study of how NaV1.1 KO affects synaptic transmission between sensory afferents and proprioceptor targets in the spinal cord. A better (and easier experiment) would be to inject an AAV-encoding ChR2 into PV-Cre mice at P0, and then record light-evoked EPSCs in proprioceptor target neurons in the spinal cord while applying ICA onto the spinal cord slice. The advantage of the pharmacological experiment is it would allow the authors to disambiguate the anatomical loss of connectivity due to conditional KO, from any intrinsic effects of NaV1.1 block on a presynaptic function.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these excellent suggestions for future experiments. Indeed, we are planning to use optogenetics to tease out the contributions of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 to mechanically induced signaling versus axonal excitability. While we no longer observe significant changes in proprioceptor axon targeting of motor neurons, in future experiments, we will look more specifically at potential central deficits in our model, including homonymous vs. heteronymous sensory-motor connectivity, whose balance was previously found to be affected by loss of proprioceptor activity (PMID: 26094608). We also plan to perform circuit tracing and functional spinal cord electrophysiological experiments as we continue to build this new and exciting line of research in our lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors appear extremely careful not to overstate their findings in the title and abstract â perhaps overly so in certain cases. For instance, I was surprised to find the selective requirement of Nav1.1 only in the data section of the ex vivo muscle spindle analyses. Bringing in these observations earlier (in the abstract) may make the manuscript less generic and more enticing for a number of people. In part, the careful wording may be in recognition of the limitations of some of the experiments â which in my few could be helped by adding a few additional experiments/controls (specific recommendations below). Other recommendations concern the presentation of the data in some of the Figures.</p><p>1. Three comments on the RNAscope in situ data. (A) Figure 1 nicely demonstrates the distribution of Nav1.1 across various sensory subsets and in Figure 6 it is used to demonstrate normal numbers of proprioceptors across all genotypes. As part of these analyses, it also shows the expression of B3 tubulin. The B3 tubulin is not helping in the interpretation of these data. I'd strongly suggest taking this data out and just showing the merged image with Nav1.1 and the marker gene of interest (if insisting on keeping the B3 panel does the merge without B3 tubulin). (B) In Figure 1, the summary plots for CGPR and MrgprD are a bit confusing; it would be better to place the % next to the pink segments rather than in the yellow (non-overlapping) segments. (C) It is mentioned that &quot;the coefficient of variation in integrated fluorescence density in proprioceptors is 76.5&quot; (lines 253-255 and Figures 1E and F). The significance of this statement, or how one derives this number is not explained in the text or methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments that improve figure readability. We have made the following changes to Figure 1:</p><p>a) Thank you for this comment, we have removed the tubulin staining from these figures.</p><p>b) We have changed the location of the percentages and colored them magenta.</p><p>c) The coefficient of variation is used to describe variability in data, and we have added more information about this metric to the main text. With new RNAscope data added for Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 in proprioceptors, we now compare coefficient of variations between Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms and include this in our discussion of potential differences in Na<sub>V</sub> expression in distinct proprioceptor subtypes.</p><p>âThis was quantified using the coefficient of variation, a relative measure of the extent of variations within data. The coefficient of variation for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 expression was calculated to be 75.6, whereas this value increased to 97.3 and 88.1 for Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, respectively. This indicates that while all three isoforms are ubiquitously expressed in proprioceptors, the relative levels differ, with Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 having the most consistent level of expression across neurons analyzed. Furthermore, the average integrated density of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 signal for a given proprioceptive DRG neuron was significantly higher than both Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 (Figure 2E, p &lt; 0.0001).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In probing the role of Nav1.1 in proprioceptors using in vitro recordings it may be useful for the reader to get a sense of the expression (levels) of all Nav channels in proprioceptors in order to better understand how blocking or activating Nav1.1 may affect neuronal excitability. Currently, only Nav1.3 is mentioned in the context of the Nav1.1 blocker ICA. Nav1.3 is not considered to play a role because it is not known to be expressed in proprioceptors, and because &quot;those channels are not expressed in uninjured adult DRG neurons&quot;. The latter statement is a bit odd in this context given that dissociated DRG neurons may well be considered injured. It may be useful to test the Nav1.3 transcript levels in the dissociated tdT positive neurons (after culturing) to exclude the possibility this channel interferes with the interpretation of these studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now performed RNAscope analysis of both Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 expression in proprioceptors, as well as functional pharmacological experiments using in vitro electrophysiology (see comments to Reviewer #1). These new results are found in Figure 2. Additionally, as mentioned above, we performed ICA recordings on large-diameter neurons from Na<sub>V</sub>1.1<sup>cko</sup> animals and found a small but significant effect, suggesting either non-specific actions on native sodium channels or upregulated N<sub>aV</sub>1.3. We have discussed this caveat in the main text and adjusted interpretations in the Discussion. Nevertheless, we do not think it changes our overall conclusions given ex-vivo recordings and our behavioral data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. &quot;inhibition of NaV1.1 significantly reduced the number of evoked action potentials in most genetically identified proprioceptors (Figure 2H); however, of the 20 cells recorded, 5 had low firing rates that were not further inhibited by ICA, indicating in some proprioceptors subtypes other NaVs mediate (to) action potential firing.&quot; I am a bit puzzled by Figure 2H, as the average for the ICA data seems to align with the top most data point? Is this correct? From this statement, it also becomes clear that Nav1.1 may be more relevant in certain proprioceptor subtypes than in others, which is an interesting observation that could warrant more discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed this error in Figure 2H, which occurred during the overlay of the two graphs. We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this mistake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The in vitro recordings suggest a role for Nav1.1 in proprioceptor repetitive firing, yet these experiments would carry so much more weight if performed with Nav1.1 mutant (or even Nav1.1. heterozygous) proprioceptors. While the behavioral studies with PVCre are understandably not informative, the PVcre-induced conditional Nav1.1 deletion (in conjunction with the tdT reporter) could have been used to solidify the in vitro studies. Given that all the genetic tools are in place, it is not clear to me why this was not attempted or discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in comments to Reviewer #1, we focused our electrophysiological analysis of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1<sup>cko</sup> proprioceptors on ex vivo experiments, as these allow us to record directly from axons as opposed to the soma. in vitro recordings from DRG somata are an excellent way to determine channel functionality in genetically identified neurons, as well as understand how channels may shape sensory neuron intrinsic excitability at the biophysical level. It is unclear, however, what the contribution of channels expressed on DRG soma is to the actual transmission of somatosensory signals. We are currently establishing techniques in the lab that will allow for biophysical analyses of sodium currents in our models, which we will leverage in future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The behavioral analyses of Nav1.1cKO animals show a clear loss of motor coordination, and mutant animals differ significantly from wild-type (Nav1.1flx/flx) controls in open field and rotarod. While both behaviors may also rely on low threshold cutaneous afferent feedback (in particular in rotarod assays) which similarly expresses Nav1.1, it is likely that the phenotype is in part due to the loss in proprioceptors. As a control, the authors assess the expression of the Pirt:Cre driver in the spinal cord (using a tdT reporter). For completion, it would also be informative to perform similar control studies in muscle (e.g. intrafusal muscle fibers) brain stem, cerebellum, and cortex. Kim et al. demonstrated little to no expression in these tissues, yet it is not clear whether those data also apply to adult animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. If our Pirt<sup>Cre</sup> driver were hitting the brain regions mentioned, our mice would develop severe epilepsy and would not be viable in adulthood. Thus, we are confident that our expression is limited to the peripheral nervous system, as previously published.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The ex vivo muscle spindle recordings offer a nice complement to the in vitro and behavioral studies and permit a more specific assessment of a key subset of proprioceptors, the muscle spindle afferents. These data are interesting for two reasons, the similarity in phenotype between the cHET and cKO animals (i.e. the haploinsufficiency of Nav1.1), and the apparent selective requirement of Nav1.1 for the static MS response. Yet these studies also demonstrate the variability in the data, perhaps suggesting that the number of recordings may need to be higher? As for the selective requirement of Nav1.1 in static discharge frequency, it is not clear to me why this is not more highlighted in the abstract. This is an interesting result that may help to tease apart the molecular basis of the response properties of different proprioceptor subtypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our ex vivo data highlight two very important findings and we have revised our abstract to bring the more exciting findings in our study to the forefront. We also agree that there is variability in the response, with some afferents appearing to respond to static stretch normally and at least half of the afferents lacking one or both copies of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 showing inconsistent firing during stretch. Even in wild type animals, we do see a fair amount of variability in the relative static and dynamic response to stretch, although we almost never see the sort of inconsistent firing observed here (e.g. Wilkinson, et al., PLoS One, 2012). Since we cannot functionally identify Ia vs II responses in mice, it is possible that some of the variability is due to Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 playing a different or more important role in different subtypes of afferents. However, the relatively consistent expression of Nav1.1 in proprioceptor soma may suggest this is not the case. More likely, there could be differences in protein expression levels and/or some developmental compensation to the loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1. This is a question we hope to address in future studies using induced deletion of N<sub>aV</sub>1.1 during adulthood.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 4 panels A, B, and C are a bit confusing with regard to the pie charts. The summary quantifications for static discharge patterns for wt, het, and cKO Nav1.1. mice are depicted with the amount of 'inconsistent traces' in black. This color coding is reversed for the resting discharge (absent discharge is quantified as colored; even though in wt 50% of afferents lack resting discharge, this % is higher in the mutants).</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the color coding in this figure (now Figure 8) to improve readability. We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In a set of control studies, the Nav1.1 genotypes are compared with respect to the number of proprioceptors, spindle morphology, and synaptic connectivity between MS afferents and spinal motor neurons. Interestingly, these studies appear to reveal a significant reduction in MS afferent vGlut1 positive synaptic contacts onto ChAT positive motor neurons. This is another potentially interesting result but these data appear a bit rushed. SN-MN connectivity is best compared across the same (backfilled) motor pool (and ideally by only looking at synapses from the homonymous afferents). Another aspect that may be influencing these data is the size of the synaptic boutons on the MNs. Maybe this can be resolved using higher power images (again comparing the contacts on motor neurons that innervate the same muscle)? Ultimately, the best assessment of these connections is to perform ventral root recordings after stimulating the dorsal roots. (FWIW, the DAPI panels in Figure 7 are more distractive than useful; an orientating schematic may also help).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and have re-done our analysis. Please see our comments above to Reviewer #1. We have also adjusted the figure (now Figure 7) to make the information we are trying to convey clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. There are various other studies that have performed in vitro recordings on proprioceptor afferents with sometimes divergent observations (e.g. Woo et al., 2015; Florez Paz et al., 2016; Zheng, et al., 2019; Oliver et al., 2021). It would have been interesting to see a discussion of the current observations in the context of these other studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. The papers mentioned perform current clamp analyses where they investigate the potential contributions of voltage-gated potassium channels to proprioceptor excitability, as well as voltage-clamp recordings of mechanically gated currents. While there are differences across papers in current-clamp recordings from proprioceptors, this is due to bath temperature and is something we have directly observed as well. We have cited this work in other portions of the manuscript but find a deeper discussion of these findings to be a bit distracting from the main point of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a very thorough study on Nav1.1 function in the peripheral nervous system. The data are generally of high quality, but I have some questions about the patch-clamp data:</p><p>â Voltage-gated sodium channels are very fast gating, therefore it is crucial to have good space and voltage-clamp conditions for their measurement. Pipette resistances up to 6Mohm, as used here, are very high, and it is quite likely that the currents recorded by the authors were not well clamped. The quality of the clamp can be assessed by the shape of the current traces, thus the authors should show example IV traces, which allow judgement of the current at low voltages, where the driving force is high, but the open probability of the channels is low. This should be added to Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree regarding the challenges of recording from native Na<sub>V</sub> currents and thank the Reviewer for this comment. We have redone all voltage-clamp experiments in the current manuscript. We changed our recording solutions, lowering the concentration of extracellular sodium to 15 mM to ensure good voltage clamp, and used pipettes with tip resistances ranging from 3-5Mohm. We now include an IV curve in a new Figure 3, clearly showing the quality of our voltage clamp. We have updated this information in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Figure 2: As stated in the first point, the quality of the presented data is hard to assess. Please show the stimulation protocols. Please show a complete IV curve. At which potential was current decay assessed? Why not over a range of potentials, which would give a better understanding of the impact during an AP. Time to peak â in your case called rise time, is very fast in Navs. Again, clamping conditions are crucial. It seems that in the ICA group there is an outlier, which most likely has a higher series resistance (how high was it in general?) and thus should be removed. If done so, it is quite likely, that there will be no significant difference anymore.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the changes mentioned above, we also added stimulation protocols and have now also included information about of series resistance to the methods section, which ranged from 6-11Mohm, depending on pipette tip resistance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The blocker used: ICA is also effective against Nav1.3 as mentioned in the manuscript.

Alternatively, use cells that are unlikely to express Nav1.1 as a control for your blocker, such as MrgprD+ neurons, which you investigated in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in response to Reviewer #1, we did find a small but significant effect of ICA on large-diameter sensory neurons harvested from Na<sub>V</sub>1.1cko animals.

Please do so, so you can substantiate your interpretation and discussion of this point. Also, using the correct protocol it is possible to investigate if the proprioceptors show resurgent currents. An in-depth investigation of the biophysics of Nav1.1 in their expressing cells (i.e. proprioceptors) would strengthen the manuscript a lot. It could also help to understand why the channel specifically is so important for proprioceptor function, while the other channels, which are expressed in these cells, cannot compensate for it. How quickly is the Nav1.1 component recovering in proprioceptors? is this really the important characteristic which is missing in the ko mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We are very interested in the discrete biophysical contributions of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in proprioceptors. We have added a characterization of the whole-cell sodium current (now Figure 3) to the manuscript, including activation and inactivation curves, recovery from fast inactivation and entry into slow inactivation. Given the potential lack of specificity of ICA on native sodium channels or the upregulation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 due to culturing, we did not use ICA to determine the contribution of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 to these features. As such, we also did not specifically investigate persistent or resurgent currents in the currents study. We plan to do such experiments in the Na<sub>V</sub>1.1<sup>cko</sup> animals in future experiments as we grow this new line of investigation in the lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Figure 1: please explain E and F better â what is plotted on the x-axis?

We have removed the discussion of V<sub>1/2</sub> of activation from the manuscript and have now added additional information regarding the acquisition and analysis of our in vitro electrophysiological data to the Methods section to clarify the concerns raised here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Suppl Figure 2: which mouse is this? it is good to see the expression also in the ventral horn, please also show a 40x of the ventral horn.</p></disp-quote><p>The information about the mouse line can be found in the main text:</p><p>âWe confirmed that our mouse model selectively targeted sensory neurons by crossing a Pirt<sup>Cre</sup> driver with a fluorescent reporter line (Pirt<sup>Cre</sup>;Rosa26<sup>Ai14</sup>). We observed little-to-no neuronal expression of TdTomato in both dorsal and ventral spinal cord (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2).â</p><p>We have added a 40X ventral horn image to the figure. Thank you for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Please define Lo also in the Figure legend or in the text. Figure 4: what does the percentage during the resting state refer to? fibers â time recorded?</p></disp-quote><p>In the methods section, Lo is defined as: âMuscles were held at optimal length (Lo), or the length of the muscle that maximal force of twitch contraction occurred.â We have also added that the Lo abbreviation means optimal length in the Figure 8 legend (fomerly Figure 4).</p><p>For the resting discharge, we have quantified the percentage of afferents that had a resting discharge of &gt;1Hz measured before all of the 9 stretches. We have clarified this in the Figure 8 legend to read: The final pie charts represent the proportion of afferents that exhibited resting discharge at Lo for every stretch for each genotype</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Fi.5A-c: how did you test for differences in the percentage of entrainment? cKO has 64% vs fl/fl 33% â this seems to be quite a difference (in contrast to your statement in line 433 where you describe them to be similar).</p></disp-quote><p>This was an error on our part. For fl/fl animals 33% was the percentage of fibers did not entrain. We have adjusted this in an updated Figure 9.

We have added expression and functional data for Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 to Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Discussion: it would be nice to mention that Nav channels are also mechanosensitive, with potential differences among sodium channel subtypes. This could contribute to their function in proprioceptors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this interesting point. Currently, only Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels have been shown to be mechanosensitive. It is unclear if this is a general feature of Na<sub>V</sub>s or whether it is specific to these isoforms. Given that is in unclear whether Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is mechanosensitive, we refrained from discussing how its putative mechanosensitivity could impact proprioceptor signaling, as we found it to be too speculative.</p></body></sub-article></article>
