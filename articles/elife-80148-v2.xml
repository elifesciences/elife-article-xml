kinase that plays a central role in metabolism and cancer. Regulation of Akt’s activity involves an autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction between its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and its kinase domain that can be relieved by C-tail phosphorylation. PH domain mutant E17K Akt is a well-established oncogene. Previously, we reported that the conformation of autoinhibited Akt may be shifted by small molecule allosteric inhibitors limiting the mechanistic insights from existing X-ray structures that have relied on such compounds (Chu et al., 2020). Here, we discover unexpectedly that a single mutation R86A Akt exhibits intensified autoinhibitory features with enhanced PH domain-kinase domain affinity. Structural and biochemical analysis uncovers the importance of a key interaction network involving Arg86, Glu17, and Tyr18 that controls Akt conformation and activity. Our studies also shed light on the molecular basis for E17K Akt activation as an oncogenic driver.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>protein semisynthesis</kwd><kwd>enzymes</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA74305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cole</surname><given-names>Philip A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35CA242461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eck</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K22CA241105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Nam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Claudia Adams Barr Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arthanari</surname><given-names>Haribabu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EB002026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arthanari</surname><given-names>Haribabu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004093</institution-id><institution>Kwanjeong Educational Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bae</surname><given-names>Hwan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R50 CA221830</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Eunyoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM136859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arthanari</surname><given-names>Haribabu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and biochemical analysis of semisynthetic Akt forms and mutants has revealed the importance of a key interaction network involving Arg86, Glu17, and Tyr18 that controls Akt conformation and activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Ser/Thr protein kinase Akt1 (termed Akt in the present work) and its paralogs Akt2 and Akt3 serve as key effectors in the PI3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway to regulate cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism by phosphorylating a variety of protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning and Toker, 2017</xref>). Akt is a 480 amino acid protein comprised of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a central kinase domain, and a regulatory C-tail. Akt’s PH domain shows high affinity and selectivity for the phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) using its positively charged basic residues including Lys14, Arg23, Arg25, and perhaps to a limited extent Arg86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milburn et al., 2003</xref>). It has been suggested that PIP3 binding to Akt’s PH domain principally drives cell signaling by directly and allosterically turning on Akt’s kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ebner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lučić et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Truebestein et al., 2021</xref>), but our work and that of others do not support such a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balasuriya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane by PIP3 leads to its phosphorylation on two key sites, Thr308 in Akt’s activation loop by PDK1 and Ser473 in the regulatory C-tail by mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alessi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sarbassov et al., 2005</xref>). The Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation events (pT308 and pS473) stimulate Akt kinase activity by relieving autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning and Toker, 2017</xref>). Termination of Akt signaling is known to be mediated by the protein phosphatases, PHLPP for p473 hydrolysis, and PP2A for pT308 hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seshacharyulu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the current structural model, even for an isolated Akt kinase domain, phosphorylation of Thr308 is critical to reach its active catalytic conformation whereas pS473 effects are only apparent in the full-length enzyme and relieve inhibitory intramolecular interactions between the kinase and PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calleja et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2002b</xref>). The pS473 has been shown to stimulate Akt by phosphate-mediated concurrent interactions to the side chains of Gln218 in the N-lobe of the kinase domain and Arg144 in the PH-kinase linker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2018</xref>). Recent work suggests that non-canonical C-terminal post-translational modifications such as dual phosphorylation of Ser477 and Thr479 (pS477/pT479) in place of Ser473 may also relieve Akt autoinhibition through distinct but incompletely understood molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salguero et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>PIP3 production is governed by the action of receptor tyrosine kinases like the insulin receptor which in the presence of agonists stimulate PI3-kinase that catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to PIP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoxhaj and Manning, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). PIP3 hydrolysis is tightly controlled by the lipid phosphatase PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalhoub and Baker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dempsey et al., 2021</xref>). Akt is frequently hyperactivated in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hua et al., 2021</xref>). The hyperactivation of Akt in cancer has led to intensive therapeutic discovery efforts to identify Akt ATP site and allosteric inhibitors although none has yet progressed to FDA approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Janku et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luo et al., 2003</xref>). Hyperactivation of Akt pathway in cancer occurs most commonly through gain-of-function mutations in PI3-kinase or loss-of-function mutations in PTEN phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shariati and Meric-Bernstam, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), but oncogenic Akt mutations are also observed in 2–5% of many solid tumors. The Akt E17K variant represents approximately 90% of all mutant Akt forms in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shariati and Meric-Bernstam, 2019</xref>). The molecular basis of neoplasia associated with Akt E17K mutation is reported to derive from Akt E17K’s enhanced phospholipid affinity and membrane localization relative to WT Akt, rather than through direct kinase stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpten et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landgraf et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Recent efforts to interrogate Akt’s molecular mechanisms have relied on the technique of expressed protein ligation (EPL) to generate site-specific C-tail modified forms of Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salguero et al., 2022</xref>). This method involves the chemoselective ligation of a recombinant protein thioester with an N-Cys containing C-tail peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muir et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, EPL has also been used to generate PH-domain isotopically labeled Akt for NMR studies using a sequential three-piece ligation strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Several prior studies have attempted to elucidate the structural basis of PH domain-mediated autoinhibition of Akt, and two types of high-resolution structures of near full-length Akt in distinct ‘closed’ conformations have been obtained by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quambusch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Truebestein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). These X-ray structures have been obtained in complex with small molecule allosteric inhibitors or PH-kinase linker-bound nanobodies, showing tight interaction between the PH and kinase domains. However, each structure showed different key interacting residues at the PH-kinase domain interface depending on which ligand the structure includes. It has not yet been possible to obtain high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of full-length autoinhibited Akt in the absence of such ligands, although NMR studies have suggested that allosteric inhibitors may perturb the baseline Akt autoinhibited state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have explored the PH domain-mediated autoinhibition of Akt using an array of biochemical and structural approaches. Key to this work was the unexpected identification of an Akt PH domain mutant, R86A, which we posit sheds light not only on PH domain-mediated Akt autoinhibition but also on how the oncogenic mutant E17K activates Akt.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis of R86A Akt and autoinhibition</title><p>Non-classical Akt activation by dual C-terminal phosphorylation of Ser477 and Thr479 appears to employ a distinct molecular mechanism compared with classical Ser473 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to pS473 Akt, pS477/pT479 Akt displays a weakened affinity for PIP3, hinting that perhaps the pS477 and/or pT479 groups directly contact the PH domain as part of their Akt kinase activation effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2018</xref>). Inspection of the known crystal structure of the Akt PH domain suggested three basic surfaces on the PH domain that could potentially interact with C-terminal phosphorylation sites, Lys30/Arg48, Arg15/Lys20/Arg67, and Arg86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milburn et al., 2003</xref>). To investigate the possibility that these basic surfaces might be key for regulation, we prepared a series of semisynthetic mutant Akt forms containing pS477/pT479 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, Akt constructs named with A1–A4). To generate these Akt forms, we employed a sequential, three-piece ligation strategy akin to a previous approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Thr308 phosphorylation of these proteins was accomplished using in vitro PDK1 treatment. We then examined the catalytic activity of these mutant PH, pS477/pT479 Akt forms using GSK3 peptide as a substrate with radioactive ATP assays. These assays revealed that the K30A/R48A (A3, V/E 15 min<sup>–1</sup>) and R15A/K20A/R67A Akt (A4, V/E 11 min<sup>–1</sup>) forms showed similar kinase rates to WT Akt (A1, V/E 12 min<sup>–1</sup>) prepared under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, R86A Akt (A2, V/E 3.4 min<sup>–1</sup>) displayed an approximately fourfold reduction in enzymatic activity. This suggested that the Arg86 side chain would be a candidate for electrostatic interaction with pS477 and/or pT479 to induce Akt activation. To explore this further, we generated R86A pS473 and non-phosphorylated C-tail Akt and unexpectedly found that Arg86 mutation suppressed the catalytic activity of pS473. In this set of measurements R86A pS473 (A11, V/E 2.7 min<sup>–1</sup>) was about fourfold lower than WT pS473 (A10, V/E 9.1 min<sup>–1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Specifically the NMR samples of the R86A PH domain at concentrations of 50–100 μM were stable for greater than 3 weeks when maintained at room temperature whereas the WT PH domain in the same conditions undergoes substantial aggregation in less than 24 hours. Due to this increased stability, we were able to assign 81% of the backbone resonances of the R86A PH domain compared to 66% of the WT PH domain. The CSPs between the NMR spectrum of the isolated R86A PH domain and the WT PH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>) indicate chemical shift changes centered around the mutation site, spreading to the amino acids in the structural neighborhood. In this case a basic amino acid with a long side chain, Arg, is replaced with an Ala, so some of these CSPs are expected.

One observation from the WT PH domain <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) supports this hypothesis. A few resonances present a secondary, weaker, signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). These weak signals could be due to a minor conformation of the same residue or could correspond to an unassigned residue. We investigated these weak resonances as function of temperature and observed that they collapse into a single signal at lower temperatures, supporting the case of multiple exchanging conformations. Furthermore, the residues that display multiple conformations cluster around R86 in a disk-like arrangement reminiscent of the CSPs between WT and R86A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Taken together with its lower stability and melting temperature, this collectively suggests the possibility of multiple exchanging conformations in WT PH domain. However, the limited stability of the sample impedes further investigation by NMR, thus we cannot fully confirm the presence of multiple conformations.</p><p>It should be noted that the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of the R86A PH domain does not contain these weak, secondary, signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>), which suggest that R86A mutation removes some of the WT dynamics. The improved stability of R86A PH domain allowed us to conduct relaxation-dispersion experiments that further confirmed the absence of dynamics on the μs-ms timescale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>). We went on and measured the R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, Eta<sub>xy</sub> relaxation rates and heteronuclear Overhauser effect (hetNOE) for the R86A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). These relaxation rates show high rigidity (most hetNOE values &gt; 0.65 and calculated correlation time of 8.7 ns, expected for a globular, rigid protein of 14 kDa). Together with the observed high stability and melting temperature of R86A, this proves the absence of multiple exchanging conformations in the R86A PH domain.</p><p>Thus there is a strong possibility that the WT PH domain, in contrast to the R86A mutant, is significantly more dynamic and that this could be the reason for the significant CSPs. These results may suggest that the PH domain conformation of the isolated R86A PH domain is preorganized before binding to the kinase domain to effectively autoinhibit Akt.</p><p>We then went on to generate <sup>15</sup>N-segmentally labeled (aa 1–121) full-length R86A Akt using our semisynthetic strategy. Here, <sup>15</sup>N-labeled R86A PH domain was ligated to the Akt kinase domain harboring a pS473 in the C-terminal tail. We compared the CSPs on the R86A PH domain due to the interaction of the kinase domain and C-terminal tail with the CSPs on the WT PH domain under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A,B</xref> ). The average CSPs on the PH domain in the context of FL Akt are higher in the case of the R86A mutant, in line with the higher binding affinity. In both cases, we observe similar patterns of CSPs and peak broadening indicative of the interaction of the PH domain with the rest of the protein. Specifically, aa 14–22 show high CSPs or peak broadening in both cases and this region is expected to be in the core of the binding interface to the kinase domain and aa 81–90 similarly show indications of binding, as expected from our previous model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020</xref>). Though the comparative CSP patterns of the R86A and WT PH domains when anchored to the rest of Akt look similar, there are subtle differences around residues 67–73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C</xref>), which suggests that the R86A mutation might reorganize the interaction surface and/or affinity. It should be noted that this section of the PH domain is not thought to be part of the interaction interface, based on the structure of the allosterically inhibited Akt (PDB: 3O96). A complete comparative analysis of the CSPs is limited by the fact that we have only 66% backbone resonance assignment for the WT PH domain. Moreover, we observed that the residues that experience CSPs as a result of the R86A mutation in the isolated PH domain still experience CSPs of similar magnitudes due to the R86A mutation when the PH domain is ligated to the rest of Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, these R86A-driven CSPs have a higher magnitude compared to the CSPs due to the interaction with the kinase domain. This supports our hypothesis that the R86A PH domain is preorganized in a rigid, stable, conformation suited for tight inhibitory interaction with the kinase domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Effects of Glu17 and Tyr18 mutations on Akt PH-kinase domain interaction and catalytic activity</title><p>The structural analysis of the R86A PH domain led to the hypothesis that rotamer changes of Glu17 and Tyr18 might play important roles in mediating the enhanced autoinhibition conferred by R86A. Indeed, as discussed, the E17K Akt mutant is known to be oncogenic. To investigate this, we measured the intermolecular affinities of the Akt kinase domain for the E17K/R86A PH domain (K<sub>D</sub> 101 μM) and the Y18A/R86A PH domain (K<sub>D</sub> 210 μM), approximately threefold and approximately sixfold weaker than that of the R86A PH domain (K<sub>D</sub> 37 μM), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These results are consistent with the idea that Glu17 and Tyr18 of the PH domain play key roles in engaging the Akt kinase domain. To evaluate whether the hydroxyl or the phenyl ring of Tyr18 is most critical for binding to the kinase domain, we also measured the kinase domain’s binding affinity to the Y18F/R86A PH and the E17K/Y18F/R86A PH domains. Interestingly, the affinity of Y18F/R86A PH (K<sub>D</sub> 45 μM) was very similar to that of the R86A PH domain (K<sub>D</sub> 37 μM) and the E17K/Y18F/R86A PH (K<sub>D</sub> 21 μM) was approximately twofold tighter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref> ), indicating that the aromatic ring rather than the hydroxyl of Tyr18 is most critical for mediating kinase interaction. Moreover, the enhanced affinity of the E17K/Y18F/R86A PH for the kinase domain is consistent with the possibility that the Tyr18 hydroxyl forms a hydrogen bond with the Lys17 side chain as observed in an X-ray structure of the E17K PH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpten et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>E17K and Y18A mutations promote the catalytic activity of Akt and disrupt the interdomain interactions between the PH and kinase domains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MST (microscale thermophoresis) binding experiments using N-terminally Cy5-labeled kinase domain with pT308 as a target protein and isolated PH domain as a ligand.

A more recent crystal structure places Tyr18 near a hydrophobic pocket comprised of Leu316, Val320, and Leu321 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Truebestein et al., 2021</xref>), and L321A Akt appears to be activated, while L316A and V320A are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parikh et al., 2012</xref>). However, this crystal structure analyzes a chimeric Akt form with a shortened and mutated PH-kinase linker in a complex with a nanobody (PDB:7APJ) and lacks electron density around the activation loop and the N-lobe of the kinase domain, casting uncertainty about its relevance to the nanobody-free natural enzyme. To gain an additional perspective, we examined the AlphaFold-predicted full-length Akt structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>).

We demonstrated that F309L Akt could be phosphorylated efficiently on Thr308 by PDK1 using western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). We prepared both full-length F309L Akt as well as PH-deleted F309L Akt lacking C-tail phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>) and measured their kinase activities. The catalytic activity of the full-length F309L Akt (A14, V/E 2.33 min<sup>–1</sup>) was found to be approximately twofold greater than WT Akt (A6, V/E 1.26 min<sup>–1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

These results suggest that the F309L replacement modestly reduces the catalytic activity of the free kinase domain but confers activation in the full-length, presumably because of partial relief of autoinhibition.</p><p>To examine the potential for a direct interdomain interaction between Phe309 on the kinase domain and Tyr18 on the PH domain of Akt, we pursued an <sup>19</sup>F NMR-based approach. Application of a recently developed method to efficiently incorporate fluoro-Tyr at the aa18 position of the Akt PH domain having R86A and Phe mutations at two of its three natural Tyr, along with the three-piece EPL strategy, allowed us to prepare full-length Akt forms having single fluoro-Tyr at the desired location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boeszoermenyi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020</xref>). Using this approach, we prepared F309L and Phe309 Akt containing fluoro-Tyr18 in the presence or absence of pT308, as well as the isolated R86A PH domain with fluoro-Tyr18 as a control to determine the NMR spectrum of fluoro-Tyr18 in the absence of the kinase domain of Akt. The fluorine is ortho to the hydroxyl on the phenol side chain of Tyr.</p><p>Interestingly, the 1D <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectrum on the isolated R86A PH domain showed two prominent peaks for a single fluoro-Tyr18 and the relative peak intensities changed at different temperatures, implying that the side chain of Tyr18 in the isolated PH domain adopts multiple exchanging conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). As the <sup>19</sup>F resonance at –137 ppm was the largest, we assigned this signal to the primary conformation of Tyr18 in the isolated R86A PH domain and the second largest <sup>19</sup>F peak around –136.2 ppm to the principal secondary conformation in this context. The second conformation could also be due to a ring flip since the presence of <sup>19</sup>F makes the ring flip asymmetric.</p><p>The <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectrum of Phe309 full-length Akt with pT308 showed a single large and broad peak around –136 ppm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), suggesting that fluoro-Tyr18 on the PH domain interacts with the kinase domain of Akt and adopts one major conformation that could be similar to the secondary conformation/ring flip discussed above for the isolated PH domain. This could reflect conformational selection. It is plausible that this fluoro-Tyr –136 ppm chemical shift similarity between the secondary peak of the isolated PH domain and the corresponding signal in the full-length Akt protein is coincidental, arising from a composite of environmental effects. Regardless, the fluoro-Tyr18 peak in the full-length Akt is influenced by the intramolecular interaction of the PH domain with the kinase domain. NMR analysis of fluoro-Tyr containing Phe309 Akt lacking Thr308 phosphorylation showed an upfield shift of the fluoro-Tyr peak relative to pT308 Akt form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This more upfield chemical shift in the direction of the fluoro-Tyr peak of the isolated PH domain suggests that the fluoro-Tyr18 is less effectively locked in the restricted conformation in the absence of pT308.

Since the Y18A mutant displays reduced PIP3 binding affinity, we employed N-terminally myristoylated Akt (Myr-Akt) mutants that constitutively localize to the plasma membrane regardless of PH-mediated PIP3 binding status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kohn et al., 1996</xref>). This modification was achieved by incorporating a myristoylation signal sequence at the N-terminus of each Akt mutant that can be recognized and myristoylated by an N-myristoyltransferase in a cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kohn et al., 1996</xref>). Along with the incorporation of myristoylation for equal activation at the plasma membrane, we also introduced Ala mutation at Ser473 (S473A) for each Akt mutant to determine how the mutation on the PH domain affects the Akt activity by altering the inhibitory PH-kinase interdomain interaction while excluding the effect of pS473.</p><p>The cellular activity of Akt was determined by the phosphorylation level of Akt substrate Foxo1/3a (p-Foxo1/3a) using western blot analysis. As expected, non-Myr WT Akt showed just comparable p-Foxo1/3a level with that of non-transfected control, and the incorporation of myristoylation signal sequence on WT Akt was effective in increasing its phosphorylation level at pT308 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Despite this elevated pT308, Myr-Akt WT showed only a minor increase in p-Foxo1/3a relative to non-Myr Akt, suggesting that in the absence of pS473, Akt with pT308 is still effectively autoinhibited by the PH domain. On the other hand, we observed a sharp increase in p-Foxo1/3a induced by Myr-Akt Y18A mutant compared to that of Myr-Akt WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). These results indicate that mutation of Tyr18 to Ala relieves the PH domain-mediated autoinhibition and renders Myr-Akt hyperactive in a cellular context, even without C-tail phosphorylation at Ser473.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Capturing a detailed picture of the autoinhibited state of Akt has remained a challenge for over two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020</xref>). As discussed, the existing X-ray structures of near full-length Akt depict inhibited conformations but their physiological relevance is uncertain based on their inclusion of small molecules, nanobodies, or PH-kinase domain linker alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quambusch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Truebestein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). These structures appear to show occlusion of the PIP3 binding pocket of the PH domain, although autoinhibited Akt shows similar affinities for soluble PIP3 compared with activated Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, as even the pT308 form of Akt lacking C-terminal phosphorylation is autoinhibited by PH-kinase interactions, and the prior crystal structures lack activation loop phosphorylation, crystallography has been limited as a tool to understand these conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Intending to characterize how the non-canonical pS477/pT479 activates Akt, we stumbled on a critical hydrogen bond within the PH domain that govern its stability and affinity for the kinase domain. Paradoxically, breaking the Arg86-Glu17 hydrogen bond by R86A mutation sharply increases PH domain stability and promotes a Tyr18 rotamer which enhances the binding of the PH domain to the kinase domain. It is the phenyl ring rather than the hydroxyl that mediates its interactions with the kinase domain. Although our studies do not provide definitive information on how pS477/pT479 activates Akt, it is still possible that these phosphorylations may do so by directly engaging Arg86.</p><p>Our investigation of the role of Arg86 has also led to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with the well-known Akt E17K oncogenic mutant. At first glance, it appears paradoxical that replacing Glu17 with Lys would be activating, since, like R86A, this mutation disrupts the Glu17-Arg86 salt bridge, and as discussed R86A promotes autoinhibition. We believe the key difference relates to the structural properties of Lys17. In a previously determined X-ray crystal structure of the E17K Akt PH domain, the Lys17 side chain makes a hydrogen bond with the Tyr18 phenol and restrains the Tyr side chain from engaging the Akt kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpten et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, in our model, the E17K mutation exerts its functional impact indirectly through its effects on the lead player Tyr18. Moreover, we now identify three reasons why E17K Akt is activated in cell signaling. First, we confirm the enhanced affinity of the E17K PH domain for PIP2 which could encourage its recruitment to membranes, as posited previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landgraf et al., 2008</xref>). Second, there is an increase in E17K Akt catalytic activity when the C-tail is non-phosphorylated which would allow for Akt-mediated protein substrate phosphorylation in the absence of mTORC2 action. It should be noted that prior studies that concluded that E17K provided no direct catalytic advantage appeared to measure E17K Akt catalytic activity with C-terminally phosphorylated status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpten et al., 2007</xref>). Such C-terminal phosphorylation would mitigate the stimulatory catalytic effects of E17K, as seen in our own kinetic analysis. Third, pT308 in E17K Akt is resistant to PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation which could prolong Akt activation. We propose it is the combination of each of these three factors which likely renders E17K Akt a potent oncogene.</p><p>A combination of enzymology, mutagenesis, AlphaFold, and fluorine NMR experiments point to an unexpected model in which Tyr18 participates in a stabilizing interaction with the side chain of Phe309. The AlphaFold-predicted structure appeared unlikely initially since the activation loop containing Phe309 is commonly considered quite flexible and the prediction for the PH-kinase interdomain interface is limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, our experimental efforts to test hypothesis developed based on the AlphaFold-predicted Akt structure suggested the possibility that Phe309 on the activation loop engages in an autoinhibitory interdomain interaction between Tyr18 and the kinase domain. It is also plausible that the Tyr18-Phe309 interaction allows nearby hydrophobic residues, such as Leu321 to engage in the hydrophobic interaction between the PH and kinase domains, which would be consistent with the AlphaFold prediction and nanobody/Akt crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Truebestein et al., 2021</xref>). Given the limitations of the approaches described here, future additional work will ultimately be needed to confirm the detailed PH-kinase domain interface. Furthermore, it will be also interesting in the future to clearly elucidate how differential C-tail modification status affects the key interactions at the PH-kinase domain interface governing the PH domain-mediated autoinhibition of Akt.</p><p>Our approach to generating specific, chemically modified Akt forms has involved EPL to generate site-specific C-tail modified forms of Akt. Although it has been suggested by Truebestein et al. that EPL may result in unstable forms of Akt due to a lack of Thr450 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Truebestein et al., 2021</xref>), our recent studies have not substantiated this concern and confirmed that our semisynthetic Akt constructs contain comparable levels of T450 phosphorylation to commercial fully recombinant full-length Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salguero et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, one of our semisynthetic phospho-Akts produced using EPL shows a nearly identical X-ray structure to the fully recombinant S473D Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2018</xref>). We hypothesize that Truebestein et al.’s contradictory findings may have emanated from the use of a shortened and unnatural PH-kinase linker in their Akt construct.</p><p>In summary, through a combination of structural and biochemical approaches, we have developed a new model for how Akt is autoinhibited by its PH domain and how E17K relieves such autoinhibition. It is hoped that the mechanistic insights here may pave the way toward novel targeted inhibitors that can exploit the distinct features of E17K Akt that can be used for the treatment of cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Akt1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene<break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkh238">https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkh238</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:addgene_9021">https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:addgene_9021</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Novagen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat.

Akt structure/function studies have been ongoing for decades and the data presented in this work convincingly provide support for a new regulatory feature within Akt.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Amy Andreotti as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are a number of reviewer suggestions to further strengthen this manuscript (see specific reviewer comments below). In particular, two important issues are identified that the reviewers request be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) Questions are raised about the validity and predictive value of the AlphaFold model. Please see specific reviewer comments below and address them accordingly.</p><p>2) Further validation of protein samples is requested. Specifically, MS quantification and gel filtration profiles are requested.</p><p>In addition, the framing of this work creates some confusion. Given that this is submitted as a Research Advance, it is framed in the context of different phosphorylations of the C-tail on AKT. Since the results then focus on side chains in the PH domain the framing, as presented, creates some confusion about the goals at the outset and the eventual findings. The reviewers are confident that the authors can reframe the work in a manner that both explains the connection to earlier findings and clearly steers the reader through the present work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The following are provided to improve the quality of this manuscript:</p><p>1) Figure 3A seems to show multiple peaks for the wt protein possibly indicative of slow exchange (the mutant spectrum appears greatly simplified). The authors do not adequately comment on this or attempt to establish whether the resonances that appear to give rise to multiple peaks are structurally related. Moreover, it is unclear whether the wt sample could be subject to changes in temperature or ZZ-exchange experiments to more carefully analyze the possibility of multiple species in slow exchange. This seems relevant to the idea that the R86A mutation 'stabilizes' the PH domain and in so doing pre-organizes the PH domain for binding to the kinase domain.</p><p>2) The notion that the R86A mutation stabilizes the PH domain seems to be based on the longevity of the protein sample. Could a more direct measure of protein stability that does not require the long acquisition times of the NMR relaxation experiments (for example, melting temperature) be used to support this idea?</p><p>3) In describing the data for Figure 3—figure supplement 3, the authors state that &quot;we observe similar patterns of CSPs and peak broadening indicative of the interaction of the PH domain with the rest of the protein. Though the comparative CSP patterns of the R86A and WT PH domains when anchored to the rest of Akt look similar, there are subtle differences…&quot;. I agree with this conclusion but due to the absence of many peaks in the wt spectrum it is hard to pick out the similarities between the WT and R86A mutant as presented – in fact the histograms in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 look quite different. Perhaps the language used to compare the two datasets can be modified to make the point clearly without creating confusion. Importantly, it seems the authors need to clearly show the differences around residues 67-73.</p><p>4) With regard to residues 67-73 it is intriguing that this is where the CSPs seem to differ between wt and R86A. Inspection of the structure shows that R69 in this region is involved in very close interactions with W22 (cation π interaction?). As well, R15 sits on the opposite face of W22 and both R15 and W22 surround the important E17-Y18 segment. Moreover, R69 is surrounded by prolines – could proline isomerization be at play here?

Please see specific reviewer comments below and address them accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the general concern that the confidence level in the AlphaFold predicted model of the autoinhibited Akt state is modest. However, as we mention, the experimentally determined crystal structures also have their limitations. We by no means believe that the AlphaFold model should be accepted uncritically but we are of the opinion that it is a publicly available resource for the community to inspect and analyze. As far as what the key templates were that drove the AlphaFold model, we are of course unsure, but there appear to be elements of the active kinase domain structure in the absence of the PH domain which date back to the early 2000s. However, for the phospho-Thr308 state, the form used in our studies, we think that an active kinase domain conformation is reasonable. In any event, we used the AlphaFold structure for hypothesis generation, namely to examine a possible unexpected interaction between Tyr18 and Phe309. The experimental data suggest that this interaction is plausible, although by no means definitively proven. We now summarize these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Further validation of protein samples is requested. Specifically, MS quantification and gel filtration profiles are requested.</p><p>In addition, the framing of this work creates some confusion. Given that this is submitted as a Research Advance, it is framed in the context of different phosphorylations of the C-tail on AKT. Since the results then focus on side chains in the PH domain the framing, as presented, creates some confusion about the goals at the outset and the eventual findings. The reviewers are confident that the authors can reframe the work in a manner that both explains the connection to earlier findings and clearly steers the reader through the present work.</p></disp-quote><p>We now incorporate the requested mass spectrometry and size exclusion chromatography data in the revised manuscript. The mass spec data support that the composition of the semisynthetic Akt proteins prepared by expressed protein ligation are consistent with their proposed structures, taking into account some heterogeneity due to linker phosphorylations as reported previously (A. Salguero et al., ACS Chemical Biology 2022). The SEC profiles show that these Akt proteins appear monomeric and monodisperse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The following are provided to improve the quality of this manuscript:</p><p>1) Figure 3A seems to show multiple peaks for the wt protein possibly indicative of slow exchange (the mutant spectrum appears greatly simplified). The authors do not adequately comment on this or attempt to establish whether the resonances that appear to give rise to multiple peaks are structurally related. Moreover, it is unclear whether the wt sample could be subject to changes in temperature or ZZ-exchange experiments to more carefully analyze the possibility of multiple species in slow exchange. This seems relevant to the idea that the R86A mutation 'stabilizes' the PH domain and in so doing pre-organizes the PH domain for binding to the kinase domain.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for carefully looking at our spectra and proposing this hypothesis. The WT isolated PH domain is not stable and crashes out of solution in a few hours despite of our attempts to find conditions to stabilize the protein. This impedes the possibility of performing long NMR experiments, including relaxation dispersion, CEST and ZZ exchange experiments that report on multiple conformations. Our initial analysis based on the number of signals we observed in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC led us to the conclusion that there was a single conformation. To illustrate our thought process here, we present <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. On this figure, the unassigned peaks are indicated by red asterisks and unassigned residues highlighted in red in the primary sequence of our WT PH domain construct. Assuming that the resonances from the Glurich loop and C-terminus residues cluster in the 8.0/122 ppm region that is highly crowded on the spectrum, we count 21 unassigned peaks for 22 unassigned residues. There are four tryptophan residues and in the PH domain and we see four resonances corresponding to the tryptophan side chain atoms at the appropriate spectral region (~130 ppm N and ~10 ppm 1H). This is by no means is a definitive proof of the absence multiple conformations.</p><p>However, upon the insightful comment of the reviewer we went back to the data and analyzed the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra recorded at different temperatures. As the reviewer suggested we observed multiple resonances for certain signals at 20 °C, which collapses to a single signal at lower temperatures. When residues corresponding to these signals are plotted on the structure, they cluster in the general vicinity of the R86A site. We further investigated the potential existence of multiple conformations in the R86A mutant and saw no evidence for it from the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC. We have recorded relaxation dispersion experiments on the stable R86A sample and do not observe evidence for exchange on the µs-ms time scale.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Assigned <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of WT PH domain at 20 °C.</title><p>Red asterisks mark unassigned peaks.

One observation from the WT PH domain <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum (Figure 3A) supports this hypothesis. A few resonances present a secondary, weaker, signal (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3A). These weak signals could be due to a minor conformation of the same residue or could correspond to an unassigned residue. We investigated these weak resonances as function of temperature and observed that they collapse into a single signal at lower temperatures, supporting the case of multiple exchanging conformations. Furthermore, the residues that display multiple conformations cluster around R86 in a disk-like arrangement reminiscent of the CSPs between WT and R86A (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3B). Taken together with its lower stability and melting temperature, this collectively suggests the possibility of multiple exchanging conformations in WT PH domain. However, the limited stability of the sample impedes further investigation by NMR thus we cannot fully confirm the presense of multiple conformations.</p><p>It should be noted that the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of the R86A PH domain does not contain these weak, secondary, signals (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3D) which suggest that R86A mutation removes some of the WT dynamics. The improved stability of R86A PH domain allowed us to conduct relaxation-dispersion experiments that further confirmed the absence of dynamics on the µs-ms timescale (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3E). We went on and measured the R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, Eta<sub>xy</sub> relaxation rates and heteronuclear Overheauser effect (hetNOE) for the R86A mutant (Figure 3 —figure supplement 4). These relaxation rates show high rigidity (most hetNOE values &gt; 0.65 and calculated correlation time of 8.7 ns, expected for a globular, rigid protein of 14 kDa). Together with the observed high stability and melting temperature of R86A, this proves the absence of multiple exchanging conformations in the R86A PH domain.</p><p>Thus there is a strong possibility that the WT PH domain, in contrast to the R86A mutant, is significantly more dynamic and that this could be the reason for the significant chemical shift perturbations. These results may suggest that the PH domain conformation of the isolated R86A PH domain is preorganized before binding to the kinase domain to effectively autoinhibit Akt.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The notion that the R86A mutation stabilizes the PH domain seems to be based on the longevity of the protein sample. Could a more direct measure of protein stability that does not require the long acquisition times of the NMR relaxation experiments (for example, melting temperature) be used to support this idea?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the Reviewer for this suggestion. We have performed thermal shift differential scanning fluorimetry on WT and R86A PH domains. New Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 shows that the melting temperature of R86A is significantly higher (51°C) than that of WT (42°C).</p><p>We added the following sentence to the manuscript:</p><p>“Differential scanning fluorimetry revealed that R86A has increased melting temperature (51+/-1 °C) compared to WT PH domain (42+/-1 °C, Figure 3 —figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In describing the data for Figure 3—figure supplement 3, the authors state that &quot;we observe similar patterns of CSPs and peak broadening indicative of the interaction of the PH domain with the rest of the protein. Though the comparative CSP patterns of the R86A and WT PH domains when anchored to the rest of Akt look similar, there are subtle differences…&quot;. I agree with this conclusion but due to the absence of many peaks in the wt spectrum it is hard to pick out the similarities between the WT and R86A mutant as presented – in fact the histograms in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 look quite different. Perhaps the language used to compare the two datasets can be modified to make the point clearly without creating confusion. Importantly, it seems the authors need to clearly show the differences around residues 67-73.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the phrasing of the CSPs interpretation could create confusion. We sought to clarify this and draw three main conclusions from our data: (i) the affinity of R86A for the kinase domain is higher than WT, resulting in CSPs of higher magnitude, (ii) the R86A CSP pattern is still consistent with our interaction model between PH and kinase domains and (iii) there are however small differences in areas where we did not expect interaction.</p><p>The manuscript now reads:</p><p>“The average CSPs on the PH domain in the context of FL Akt are higher in the case of the R86A mutant in line with the higher binding affinity. In both cases, we observe similar patterns of CSPs and peak broadening indicative of a similar interaction of the PH domain with the rest of the protein. Specifically, aa 14-22 show high CSPs or peak broadening in both cases and this region is expected to be in the core of the binding interface to the kinase domain and aa81-90 similarly show indications of binding, as expected from our previous model (Chu, Viennet, et al., 2020). Though the comparative CSP patterns of the R86A and WT PH domains when anchored to the rest of Akt look similar, there are subtle differences around residues 67-73 (Figure 3 —figure supplement 5C) which indicates that the R86A mutation might reorganize the interaction surface and/or affinity.”</p><p>We made a new Figure 3 —figure supplement 5C that specifically shows the CSPs of Arg67, Arg69 and Asn71.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) With regard to residues 67-73 it is intriguing that this is where the CSPs seem to differ between wt and R86A. Inspection of the structure shows that R69 in this region is involved in very close interactions with W22 (cation π interaction?). As well, R15 sits on the opposite face of W22 and both R15 and W22 surround the important E17-Y18 segment. Moreover, R69 is surrounded by prolines – could proline isomerization be at play here? Certainly, this is an event that could induce the slow exchange that is suggested in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of wt (Figure 3A).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for suggesting this model. It is interesting that these differences in the 67-73 segment arise only in the context of full-length Akt, neither CSPs nor crystal structure show significant differences in this region in isolated PH domains. Unfortunately, the resonances corresponding to Arg15 and Trp22 are broadened beyond detection in full-length Akt spectra, which makes it difficult to assess the model further.</p><p>The Pro isomerization inducing multiple conformations in an interesting idea. In response to this question, we looked at the CB shifts of Pro68 and Pro70 in R86A which are 31.9 ppm and 32.8 ppm, respectively, suggesting trans conformations. The poor quality of HNCACB for WT did not allow CB assignments for these Prolines. We do not see clear indications of multiple conformations for the neighboring Arg67, Arg69 or Asn71 in the spectra of isolated WT or R86A PH domains. The residues in the vicinity of the two prolines are broadened beyond detection in the R86A fulllength Akt spectrum preventing further analysis. Hence, our data can neither strongly support nor negate this hypothesis. It should be noted that both these Pro residues are in trans conformations in the crystal structures of the PH domain, both for WT and R86A mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 7A-D.

Yes, we used the R86A mutant for this experiment to enhance the affinity of the interaction between the PH and kinase domains of Akt. Moreover, the inclusion of R86A mutation in these constructs was helpful for their stability while performing NMR studies. We have now clarified this in the caption for Figure 7A-D. The corresponding data for the WT PH domain would certainly be nice to have. However, the stability and expression level of the WT PH containing 19F-Tyr18 was poor rendering the semisynthesis of full-length 19F-Tyr Akt impractical. Thus, for assessing the effects of the F309L mutation and phosphorylation of T308 on the Y18 sidechain, R86A mutation was included in each of the constructs used in this set of experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The multi-pronged approach systematically investigates the interaction between PH:Kinase, stability/structure of PH domain, activity of AKT and half-life of activation loop phosphorylation.

Regarding which Akt forms were used in a particular experiment, we apologize for the confusion. We have added cartoons like in Chu et al. 2020 to clarify in the revised manuscript (Figure 1 figure supplement 1).

As they note, our prior enzymatic studies suggest that linker length and composition influence the PH-kinase intramolecular interaction. Therefore, the intermolecular (in trans) interaction experiments should be interpreted cautiously. Having said that, the intermolecular affinity interactions associated with R86A, Y18A, and E17K correlated fairly well with the full-length semisynthetic enzymatic activities of the Akt forms, suggesting that the “in trans” experiments can capture at least some aspects of the intramolecular recognition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Arguments that the PH domain of R86A retains the same fold as WT but is more stable/less dynamic are indirectly and weakly supported.

Regarding the stability of the R86A PH domain vs the WT PH domain, we have now augmented our prior NMR evidence with differential scanning fluorimetry as discussed above. The R86A has 9 °C increased thermal stability compared to WT (see new Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). We did not observe changes in chemical shifts over the course of our NMR experiments, only reduction of the intensities of the peaks corresponding to the starting conformation. If the reviewer suggests the possibility that the WT PH domain is proteolytically degraded during the course of the experiment, we can conclusively state that this is not the case. In case of proteolytic degradation, we would see additional resonances in a specific part of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC, which we did not observe. In addition, the resonances will shift as a result of the removal of residues, this was also not observed. Another possibility is that the protein aggregates over time, which we physically observe as precipitation. The aggregated and precipitated protein do not contribute signals in solution NMR. Our time course measurements show no change in peak position rather reduction in intensity, in line with protein aggregation. Therefore, we are confident of the NMR backbone assignments made for the WT and R86A PH domains although concede that the instability of the WT PH domain complicates structural comparisons by NMR. As recommended, we have softened the language in the revised manuscript on the concordance of the two structures given the limitations alluded to.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Can the authors speculate at the precise step that the PH domain is inhibiting AKT?

We will plan to do this in a future study. We believe that the importance of the PH domain’s inhibition of Akt is most clear when Thr308 is phosphorylated since the non-Thr308 phosphorylated form is intrinsically autoinhibited without the PH domain. We are uncertain about the timing of the Phe309 and Tyr18 interaction and there is insufficient data to make a confident statement about this, although our model is that this Phe309/Tyr18 interaction could occur in the presence of Thr308 phosphorylation. Future experiments can hopefully help address this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.
