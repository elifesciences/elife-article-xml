during spermatogenesis. Previous work indicated that the MEIG1/PACRG complex locates in the manchette and is involved in the transport of cargos, such as SPAG16L, to build the sperm flagellum. Here, using co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down approaches in various cell systems, we established that DNALI1, an axonemal component originally cloned from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, recruits and stabilizes PACRG and we confirm in vivo, the co-localization of DNALI1 and PACRG in the manchette by immunofluorescence of elongating murine spermatids. We next generated mice with a specific deficiency of DNALI1 in male germ cells, and observed a dramatic reduction of the sperm cells, which results in male infertility. In addition, we observed that the majority of the sperm cells exhibited abnormal morphology including misshapen heads, bent tails, enlarged midpiece, discontinuous accessory structure, emphasizing the importance of DNALI1 in sperm differentiation. Examination of testis histology confirmed impaired spermiogenesis in the mutant mice. Importantly, while testicular levels of MEIG1, PACRG, and SPAG16L proteins were unchanged in the <italic>Dnali1</italic> mutant mice, their localization within the manchette was greatly affected, indicating that DNALI1 is required for the formation of the MEIG1/PACRG complex within the manchette. Interestingly, in contrast to MEIG1 and PACRG-deficient mice, the DNALI1-deficient mice also showed impaired sperm spermiation/individualization, suggesting additional functions beyond its involvement in the manchette structure. Overall, our work identifies DNALI1 as a protein required for sperm development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNALI1</kwd><kwd>manchette</kwd><kwd>cargo transport</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wayne State University Startup fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhibing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wayne State University Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhibing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Male Contraceptive Initiative fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yap</surname><given-names>Yi Tian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Male Contraceptive Initiative pilot award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhibing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhibing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Granneman</surname><given-names>James G</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>David C</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Agence Nationale pour la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toure</surname><given-names>Aminata</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Axonemal dynein light intermediate polypeptide 1 is required for sperm formation and male fertility through association with MEIG1/PACRG complex in the manchette, involvement in a cargo transport system, intraflagellar transport, and sperm individualization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motile cilia are microtubule-based organelles with a core ‘9+2’ axonemal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dutcher, 1995</xref>). They generate fluid flow by their beating in various epithelia and also enable sperm cell progression, which overall confers vital functions in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neesen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ibañez-Tallon et al., 2002</xref>). In humans, motile cilia dysfunction results in multiple syndromes, including bronchiectasis, impaired mucociliary clearance, chronic cough, sinusitis, and male infertility, which are described as immotile cilia syndrome, as well as <italic>primary ciliary dyskinesia</italic> (PCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leigh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noone et al., 2004</xref>). Ciliary beat is driven by dynein motor protein complexes, which are subdivided into the inner and outer arms of axonemal ultrastructure. These dynein arms are anchored to the peripheral axonemal microtubules and are the motor proteins that power the sliding of adjacent microtubule doublets relative to one another through ATP hydrolysis. The heavy, medium, and light chains constitute the dynein motors, and each chain has a different molecular weight and provides an important function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibbons, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">King, 2000</xref>). Hence, in mammals the loss of dynein function leads to PCD with ciliary impairment with hydrocephalus, body axis asymmetry, and male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ibañez-Tallon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neesen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Supp et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Human axonemal dynein light intermediate polypeptide 1 (<italic>DNALI1</italic>) gene is the homolog of the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> inner dynein arm (IDA) gene <italic>p28</italic>, an important component of the ciliated dynein arm, which is mainly responsible for cilium movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">LeDizet and Piperno, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kastury et al., 1997</xref>). The molecular analysis of <italic>DNALI1</italic> (human <italic>hp28</italic>) gene was revealed by Dr. Shalender Bhasin’s laboratory more than 20 years ago. The gene was localized on chromosome 1 region p35.1, and <italic>DNALI1</italic> transcripts were detected in several ciliary structures, including sperm flagella, suggesting that this gene could be a good target for patients suffering from immotile cilia syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kastury et al., 1997</xref>). In addition to PCD, <italic>DNALI1</italic> was also related to a variety of diseases, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration, diploid breast carcinoma, osteosarcoma, allergic rhinitis, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mishra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parris et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ye et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Piras et al., 2019</xref>), although the precise mechanisms are unclear. But to date, the role of <italic>DNALI1</italic> in male germ cells and in human male reproduction was never investigated.</p><p>Recently, <italic>Dnali1</italic> was identified as a sex-related gene involved in spermatogenesis of several fishes, including the <italic>Odontobutis potamophila</italic>, the Ussuri catfish <italic>Pseudobagrus ussuriensis</italic>, and the olive flounder <italic>Paralichthys olivaceus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The expression of <italic>Dnali1</italic> showed sexual dimorphism with predominant expression in the testis. This suggested that the fish <italic>Dnali1</italic> might play an important role in the testis, especially in the period of spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Sajid et al. cloned the murine <italic>Dnali1</italic> with significant similarity to the <italic>p28</italic> gene of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinharditii</italic> and to <italic>DNALI1</italic> (<italic>hp28</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rashid et al., 2006</xref>). The murine <italic>Dnali1</italic> gene is localized on chromosome 4 and consists of six exons. It has two transcripts and is expressed in several tissues but the strongest expression was observed in testis. During the first wave of spermatogenesis, both <italic>Dnali1</italic> mRNA and protein were dramatically increased during the spermiogenesis phase, which corresponds to spermatid cell differentiation. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that DNALI1 was detected in spermatocytes and abundant in round and elongated spermatids. Moreover, the DNALI1 protein was localized in the flagella of mature sperm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rashid et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that <italic>Dnali1</italic> may play an essential role in murine sperm formation and male fertility.</p><p>Sperm production and formation is a complex process consisting of mitosis, meiosis, and finally spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hecht, 1998</xref>). During spermiogenesis, germ cells undergo dramatic changes with the formation of sperm-unique structures, including the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pleuger et al., 2020</xref>). Many genes have been described to precisely regulate these morphologic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yan, 2009</xref>). We previously discovered that mouse meiosis-expressed gene 1 (MEIG1) and Parkin co-regulated gene (PACRG) form a protein complex in the manchette, a transient microtubule structure localized in the head compartment of sperm cells during differentiation. It was demonstrated that this protein complex controls sperm flagellum formation, with PACRG being an upstream molecule of MEIG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2021</xref>). The MEIG1/PACRG complex was shown to function as part of the cargo transport system, called intramanchette transport (IMT) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kierszenbaum, 2002</xref>), which transports sperm flagellar proteins, including SPAG16, along the microtubule or F-actin-based transport system to the basal bodies, the template of cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marshall, 2008</xref>), for sperm tail assembly. However, how the MEIG1/PACRG complex associates with the axonemal motor system in the manchette for cargo transport remained unclear. From the basal bodies, cilia/flagella are formed through a conserved mechanism, the intraflagellar transport (IFT). IFT is a bidirectional process. Through antegrade transport, the cargo proteins are transported from the basal bodies to the tips of cilia/flagella and by the retrograde transport it is possible for the turn-over products to be transported back to the cell body for recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Using mouse PACRG as bait for a yeast two-hybrid screen, DNALI1 was identified as a protein binding partner. To investigate the function of DNALI1, a <italic>Dnali1</italic> conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model was generated using a conditional by inversion (COIN) strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Economides et al., 2013</xref>). This <italic>Dnali1</italic> mouse line, <italic>Dnali1<sup>COIN/COIN</sup></italic> was crossed with <italic>Stra8</italic>-iCre transgenic mice, to specifically inactivate the <italic>Dnali1</italic> gene in the male germ cells. Reported here, the male germ cell-specific knockout <italic>Dnali1</italic> (<italic>Dnali1<sup>COIN/COIN</sup>; Stra8-iCre<sup>+/-</sup></italic>; hereafter <italic>Dnali1</italic> cKO) mice have significantly reduced sperm number and are infertile. In addition, the majority of sperm exhibited abnormal morphology, strongly indicating the importance of <italic>Dnali1</italic> in the development of sperm flagella.

In addition, DNALI1 encoding clones were identified multiple times (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A direct yeast two-hybrid assay was conducted to confirm the interaction between PACRG and DNALI1. Like the positive control, the yeast co-transformed with the two plasmids expressing DNALI1 and PACRG grew on the selection medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that the two proteins interact in yeast. To further examine interaction of the two proteins, Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells were transfected with the plasmids expressing the two proteins. When the CHO cells expressed PACRG/GFP only, the protein was present in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ba</xref>) while DNALI1/FLAG was located on one side of the nucleus as a large granule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bb</xref>).

Our previous studies demonstrated that MEIG1 and PACRG form a complex in the manchette to transport protein cargo and build the sperm flagellum. We further discovered that four amino acids on the same surface of MEIG1 protein are involved in its interaction with PACRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2021</xref>). However, it was not clear how the MEIG1/PACRG complex associates with the manchette microtubules. Given that MEIG1 is a downstream binding partner of PACRG, and the fact that PACRG does not associate with microtubules directly, we hypothesized that there must be other upstream players involved in the manchette localization of the MEIG1/PACRG complex. Therefore, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a PACRG component as bait. Besides MEIG1, DNALI1 was identified to be a major binding partner. The interaction between PACRG and DNALI1 was further confirmed by several experiments described in this study, including co-expression and purification from bacteria and co-immunoprecipitation using mouse testis protein extracts. Interestingly, testicular PACRG protein level was not changed in the <italic>Dnali1<sup>Stra8KO</sup></italic> mice, which would suggest that PACRG also associates with other proteins, including MEIG1, and these proteins also stabilize PACRG even if DNALI1 is absent.</p><p>The functional assays reported here also support the observed interaction between PACRG and DNALI1. Previously, we discovered that mouse PACRG was not stable but could be stabilized by MEIG1 in both bacteria and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2016</xref>). The studies here showed that DNALI1 also stabilized PACRG, suggesting a dual association of PACRG with MEIG1 and DNALI1. Similar to the MEIG1 protein, co-expression of DNALI1 also prevented degradation of PACRG in both bacteria and mammalian cells, which is consistent with the reported regulation of PACRG by the ubiquitin-proteasomal system (UPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>). It is possible that the binding site on the PACRG recognized by the UPS is protected by DNALI1, providing PACRG protein more stability.</p><p>This association between PACRG and DNALI1 was also supported by in vivo studies. During the first wave of spermatogenesis, expression of the DNALI1 protein was dramatically increased during the spermiogenesis phase, which was similar to the PACRG protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rashid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2016</xref>) and specific to the period of spermatid elongation and formation of flagella. However, prior to spermiogenesis, in late meiotic germ cells, the DNALI1 signal was weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rashid et al., 2006</xref>). In elongating spermatids, DNALI1 was localized in the manchette, coinciding with the localization of PACRG, which strongly suggested that DNALI1 would have a function related to that of PACRG. Testing this hypothesis through the use of conditional <italic>Dnali1</italic> knockout mice revealed a co-dependence between the two proteins for structural integrity of spermatid elongation, the absence of which leads to abnormal sperm morphology, immotility, and complete male infertility.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>DNALI1 is involved in IMT</title><p>It is not surprising to see dramatically reduced sperm counts associated with impaired spermiogenesis, because DNALI1 forms a complex with MEIG1/PACRG.

The manchette is believed to play an important role in transporting cargo proteins for the formation of sperm flagella, and the transport function requires motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kierszenbaum, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lehti and Sironen, 2016</xref>).

It is highly possible that DNALI1 is the major driving force in transporting the MEIG1/PACRG complex together with the sperm flagellar proteins, including SPAG16L, along the manchette microtubules in order to assemble a functional sperm tail. It appears that DNALI1 is an upstream protein of MEIG1/PACRG complex, because DNALI1 is still in the manchette when PACRG is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Working model of DNALI1 in sperm cell differentiation and function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DNALI1 forms a complex with MEIG1/PACRG, with DNALI1 being an upstream protein that recruits downstream PACRG and MEIG1 to the manchette. DNALI1 associates with the manchette microtubules through other molecular motor protein(s), including dynein heavy chain 1. MEIG1/PACRG/DNALI1/motor complex transports cargos, including SPAG16L, along the manchette to build sperm flagella.

However, a trace amount of MEIG1 was observed in the manchette when <italic>Dnali1</italic> was inactivated in male germ cells. One possible explanation is that <italic>Dnali1</italic> was not 100% disrupted due to the efficiency using the cKO system. However, it is also possible that some of the MEIG1 does not associate with the DNALI1 complex, which is supported by the fact that slightly different phenotypes were observed in the two knockout models. For example, the manchette architecture was abnormal in the <italic>Meig1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), but not in the <italic>Dnali1</italic> cKO mice. In the manchette, there is also an F-actin-based myosin motor transport pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kierszenbaum et al., 2003</xref>), which may also be associated with some MEIG1. It remained to be known if PACRG localization is changed in the <italic>Dnali1</italic> cKO mice. Our supply was depleted of the two anti-PACRG antibodies that worked in the immunofluorescence experiments (the polyclonal antibody from Baylor College of Medicine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prevo et al., 2017</xref>) and the monoclonal antibody generated in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Two other commercial antibodies (Cat No: ARP52953_P050, Aviva Systems Biology, San Diego, CA, USA; Cat No: bs-9289R, Bioss, Woburn, MA, USA) unfortunately gave no specific signals. Therefore, further investigation should be performed once appropriate antibodies are available. We expect that PACRG could be mislocalized in the absence of DNALI1.</p><p>As a light chain protein, it is unlikely that DNALI1 binds directly to the manchette microtubules, based on its localization in the transfected mammalian cells. DNALI1 has been reported to be a binding partner of dynein heavy chain 1 protein (DYNC1H1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rashid et al., 2006</xref>) and our current study revealed evidence that the dynein heavy chain 1 protein is also present in the manchette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, it is more likely that DNALI1 associates with the manchette microtubules through dynein heavy chain 1. Another function of the manchette is to help shape the head of developing spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kierszenbaum and Tres, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manfrevola et al., 2021</xref>). Like the <italic>Meig1</italic> and <italic>Pacrg</italic> mutant mice, the <italic>Dnali1</italic> cKO mice also developed abnormal sperm heads, which further supports the claim that DNALI1 is involved in manchette function, but not necessarily in manchette construction, which appeared to have normal morphology.</p><p>Formation of the flagellum involves both the IMT and the IFT, and the abnormal sperm phenotype observed in <italic>Dnali1</italic> cKO mice appears to be due to the disruption of both pathways. The IMT mediates the transport of cargo proteins to the basal bodies, the template and the start point from which the sperm axoneme is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kierszenbaum, 2002</xref>). In <italic>Dnali1</italic> cKO mice, although some sperm were formed, none had normal morphology. Besides abnormal heads, the flagella showed multiple defects, including short tails and vesicles and gaps along the sperm tail. The partial formation of the tails indicates that the IMT may not always be disrupted, possibly due to an incomplete excision by the Cre recombinase, allowing for limited DNALI1 protein synthesis; or the cargo proteins are transported through the myosin-based transport system. It is unlikely that abnormal tail formation was caused by the defect of basal bodies. In the absence of DNALI1 in male germ cells, the basal body formation appeared to be normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Potential role of DNALI1 as a motor protein involved in transporting IFT particles</title><p>The IFT is one of the more important mechanisms involved in the formation of cilia/flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>). The IFT complex is composed of core IFT components, BBSomes, the motor proteins and cargo proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prevo et al., 2017</xref>). The morphological abnormalities observed in <italic>Dnali1</italic> cKO sperm, including the trapped particles inside sperm tails, led us to hypothesize that DNALI1 may also be involved in the IFT process, which is supported by the presence of DNALI1 in the developing sperm flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3</xref>). Defects in IFT result in failure of ciliogenesis, including formation of the sperm flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pazour and Rosenbaum, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Motor proteins have been shown to be essential for a functional IFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scholey, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scholey, 2008</xref>). Therefore, given the ultrastructural abnormalities in the sperm flagella, loss of DNALI1 might also result in IFT dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>), and be a major contributing factor to sperm immotility. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that other transport systems mediate the transport of cargo proteins in the manchette, data presented here show that the MEIG1/PACRG/DNALI1 complex does transport some cargo proteins that are essential for the formation of a normal sperm tail.</p><p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study revealed a disorganized fibrous sheath, sperm tail structure in mice. The fibrous sheath is a cytoskeletal structure of the principal piece in the flagellum, which consists of two longitudinal columns connected by semicircular ribs. The longitudinal columns are attached to outer dense fibers 3 and 8 in the anterior part of the principal piece and replace those fibers in the middle and posterior part of the principal piece and become associated with microtubule doublets 3 and 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fawcett, 1975</xref>). It is assumed that such an elaborate substructural organization of the fibrous sheath into longitudinal columns and semicircular ribs must have a function, but testable hypotheses surrounding these characteristics are lacking. In <italic>Dnali1</italic> cKO mice, the two longitudinal columns were not associated with microtubule doublets 3 and 8, and the two semi-circumferential ribs showed defective or asymmetrical alignment in the principal piece. Dysfunction in IMT and IFT may contribute to these structural defects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>DNALI1 may facilitate in the appropriate maturation and spermiation/individualization of sperm cells</title><p>Another interesting phenotype observed was an occasional failure of sperm spermiation/individualization, or disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Donnell and Stanton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hess and Vogl, 2015</xref>), at the late spermatid step in <italic>Dnali1</italic> cKO mice. This abnormality was not observed in the <italic>Meig1</italic> and <italic>Pacrg</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">West et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lockhart et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lorenzetti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>). The spermiation/individualization failure may be attributed to the dysregulation of autophagy in the absence of DNALI1, as suggested by the upregulation of ATG16L and ATG5, two markers of the autophagic pathway, in <italic>Dnali1</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s4">Figure 11—figure supplement 4</xref>). Spermiation/individualization is one of the final steps of spermiogenesis and the defects are a common cause of human male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper, 2005</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this occurs when the membrane cytoskeleton individualized complex (IC) is assembled around the nucleus of each bundle of 64 haploid elongated spermatid nuclei. Each IC is composed of 64 F-actin-based investment cones, which move the flagella downward as a coordinated ensemble. Each spermatid is individualized of a single cone. As IC progresses, the cytoplasm is removed from the flagella, and the membrane surrounding each spermatid is reshaped to form the individualized spermatozoa. In mammals, the process is thought to be driven by tubulobulbar complexes (TBC) and involves the removal of ectoplasmic specializations, and actin filament networks are also the major components of TBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hess and Vogl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O’Donnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tokuyasu et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2018</xref>). It has been reported using genetic studies that at least 70 genes are involved in the process of spermiation/individualization, with a unique cooperation between Sertoli cells and the maturing elongated spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hess and Vogl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steinhauer, 2015</xref>). Several molecular pathways contribute to this process, including actin and microtubule dynamics, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway components, apoptotic elimination of cytoplasmic contents, plasma membrane reorganization, and the formation of a disengagement complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Donnell and Stanton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hess and Vogl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steinhauer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhong and Belote, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). The microtubule cytoskeleton is important for spermiation/individualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steinhauer, 2015</xref>). Complexes of microtubules and dynein and kinesin motors form the core of cilia and flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sweeney and Holzbaur, 2018</xref>). Mutations in the components of the dynein-dynein complex, including the cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain, the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> dynein light chains DDLC1 and DLC90F, disrupt the synchronous movement of actin cones, but they also disrupt the nucleus shaping and positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2004</xref>). These consistent phenotypes suggest that DNALI1 may have a similar effect on the synchronous movement of actin cones in sperm spermiation/individualization and that DNALI1 has other functions in male germ cell development that differ from the MEIG1/PACRG complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). Consistent with this, our recent yeast two-hybrid screen using human DNALI1 as the bait, γ-actin identified to be a potential binding partner, further supports that DNALI1 is involved in spermiation/individualization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>DNALI1 is present in the dynein arm and functions in sperm motility</title><p>Another potential function of DNALI1 is its reported activity as an IDA component of the cilium and flagellum axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamiya and Okamoto, 1985</xref>). This would not be surprising in sperm, as it is present along the entire length of the sperm flagellar axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rashid et al., 2006</xref>). Dynein proteins are present in the outer dynein arms (ODAs) and IDAs of the axonemal complex, and both arms are essential for the beating of cilia and flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamiya and Okamoto, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mitchell and Rosenbaum, 1985</xref>). IDAs have seven major subspecies and four minor subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scholey, 2008</xref>), but little is known about the functional differences between these subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yagi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kamiya and Yagi, 2014</xref>). Therefore, if DNALI1 does serve this function in the sperm axoneme, its inactivation in male germ cells would likely disrupt the function of the dynein arms and contribute to the formation of immotile sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>).</p><p>In summary, DNALI1 potentially has multiple roles in sperm formation and function. We demonstrated a main function in IMT but additional roles of DNALI1 are possible in IFT and sperm individualization and disengagement, all of which being biological processes that occur during spermiogenesis. Failure of these processes causes impaired sperm formation and function and finally results in male infertility. While we show that an IMT function is clearly associated with the MEIG1/PACRG complex, the potential function of DNALI1 in IFT, sperm individualization, and spermiation will need further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Cells used in this study were a gift from Dr. Jerome Strauss.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kazuo Inaba (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Suggested essential revisions by reviewers in common are as described below. Additional details of reviews from each reviewer to improve and clarify the presentation follows in the separate evaluation section.</p><p>1) It is suggested to focus on strengthening the function of PACRG and DNALI1 in intra-manchette transport (IMT) which is particularly interesting and relatively strong. However, this will require a good introduction to IMT vs. IFT, a more generally understood process. It is critical to show PACRG and DNALI1 are in complex from native tissue as all the current data are based on in vitro interaction. To link PACRG function to microtubule-based motor function ofo DNAI1, it will be helpful to show DNAI1 interaction with other axonemal dyneins.</p><p>2) Related to 1), it is suggested to tone down other claims unless the authors can add additional experimental support suggested by the reviewers. One particular example of such a claim is sperm individualization. As pointed out by all the reviewers, it can be simply due to sprayed (disintegrated) 9+2 axoneme and the present data do not have the resolution to exclude this possibility. In line with this point, the current title and Figure 10 need a revision.</p><p>3) It is necessary to improve the basic characterization of the spermatogenesis phenotype of the conditional knockout of DNAI1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Much essential information for the figures and methods that are missing are also addressed. In the current form, unfortunately, this manuscript is not strong to support the current major conclusions. To be reconsidered, it would require a major revision. Below are the specific comments for the manuscript.</p><p>1. All the interactions between PACRG and DNALI1 are examined only in in vitro system. Have the authors examined their interaction in the native system – testis? Also, the authors should show the interaction within DNALI1 and MEIG here to show their link in detail (see also point #2 re: Figure 1C)</p><p>2. re: Figure 1. First, it is not explained why the authors used CHO cells for the co-localization study and COS1 for the co-IP experiment. In the corresponding text to Figure 1, the authors describe the PACRG localizes at vesicle together with DNALI1 in heterologous expression (Figure 1B). However, the current images do not show vesicle localization. Please show more clear images (magnified or insets, or higher resolution microscopy) to support vesicle localization. Besides, when PACRG and DNALI1 are co-localized, their localization is sided in the opposite direction.</p><p>In Figure 1B, the author mentioned &quot;DNALI1-flag was present as a vesicle&quot; in CHO cells, what is this vesicle? Please include the authors' explanation.</p><p>In Figure 1C, the same size band is seen in IgG control pull-down, thus it is not clear whether PACRG interaction with DNAI1 is positive. Please provide full details such as lane information. As the interaction is ambiguous due to a positive signal in a negative control group, the specificity of the interaction is not clear. How about testing DNAI1 interaction with MEIG1? If DNAI1 interaction with PACRG/MEIG1 is via direct binding to PACRG, then DNAI1 interaction with MEIG1 should be negative.</p><p>3. Re: Figure 2 &amp; Figure 3 – Please consider combining Figure 2 &amp; 3 together as they are complementary to each other in supporting one conclusion. In fact, placing Figure 3 before Figure 2 makes more sense as it would provide the radiational why they co-express those together and run co-purified complex in gel filtration.</p><p>For current Figure 2 gel filtration, please add the gel filtration protein profile read by A280 together with the position of markers. What is the size of the co-purified PACRG/DNALI1?</p><p>In current Figure 3, Please measure the Pacrg mRNA level in each single or combined expression to support the conclusion. Are they really have the same mRNA level but only the protein level changed? If the stability is really the problem, then please apply MG-132 to inhibit the proteasome activity to support the conclusion.</p><p>Most importantly, the authors show DNALI1 stabilizes PACRG expression using in vitro system. However, it is contradictory as PACRG protein levels in the native tissue – testis – in DNALI1 knockout mice are not affected. This discrepancy should be explained. It is unclear what's the biological meaning of PACRG stabilization in the developmental procedure?</p><p>4. Re: Figure 4, The authors show the co-localization of the DNALI1 and PACRG at the manchette region only in wild type but placed the immunostaining done in parallel from PACRG-deficient germ in Supplementary Figure 1. These two figures should be combined as Figure 1 for fair comparison and easier view for the readers. Also adding sub-figure labels will be helpful (labeling wt only one time on the top of the figure will do good).</p><p>5. Re: Figure 5, please split fertility &amp; litter size graphs as the unit of Y-axis value should be different. Also please show all the individual data points for B-E.</p><p>6. Re: Figure 6. Dnali1-knockout sperm show clear defects in sperm tail development. However, it is unclear how many sperm cells have flagellum. The authors should include quantitative information on the presence/absence of the sperm tail to understand the role of Dnali1 in sperm flagellar development.</p><p>Based on Figure 6, the authors claim that Dnali1-knockout sperm show a problem in sperm individualization. To fully support this conclusion, the authors should demonstrate that the defect in Dnali1-knockout sperm is not due to axoneme instability (i.e., sprayed 9+2 axoneme) by TEM by showing two 9+2 tails belonging to one sperm head or double head.</p><p>7. In histology results (Figure 7), it is unclear how the authors recognize phagocytosis sperm. What's the evidence the pointed germ cell in Figure 7A is undergoing phagocytosis.</p><p>8. Re: Figure 9, Please show PACRG localization as well. In Dnali1 cKO elongating spermatid cells, where PACRG is localization? Is it also no longer present in the manchette? This should be included in Figure 9. This is very important as this manuscript only has in vitro data to show PACRG/DNALI1 interaction, but no in vivo data. So far, the author only shows PACRG KO doesn't change DNALI1 manchette localization, DNALI1 cKO doesn't change PACRG protein level in testis. These do not support PACRG interaction with DNALI1. Is a-tubulin staining in Danli1 spermatocytes representative (no to very weak signals compared to other panels).</p><p>9. Discussion. In the current Discussion Before page 38, the discussion is either to provide a hypothesis (which should belong to the Introduction to provide the rationale of the study) or repetition/summary of results. From page 38, the content is relevant to Discussion but will be easy if there are subheadings for each section.</p><p>10. Re: Figure 10 – The way the author put DNALI1=Motor Complex = IMT is inappropriate, and so do the other three in B, C, and D.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors could rewrite the paper in a better way that is based on the experimental data and their possible interpretation. Intra-manchette transport (IMT) is a phenomenon relatively well recognized by reproductive biologists. However, for a broad range of readers unfamiliar with IMT, the authors would explain more on this, particularly on the difference between IMT and well-known intraflagellar transport (IFT), and on where the authors focus in this paper. Figure 10 is highly speculated and is not unrelated to the data presented in this paper. I am afraid that it gives many misunderstandings to readers, although the author might have added this figure as a working hypothesis. The title &quot;associated and non-associated function&quot; is too obscure to be easily figured out by readers. I can see several careless mistakes in the manuscript. For example, alphabetical labels were repeatedly found in Figure1B panels.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Characterisation of the basic spermatogenesis phenotype in the cKO mouse needs to be improved.</p><p>a. The authors need to include body weight and testis weight data.</p><p>b. Sperm isolation by cutting the epididymis and allowing sperm to swim out is not appropriate for motility and count analysis. It is dependent on the cuts made as to how many sperm vacate, in addition, non-motile sperm will be less likely to vacate the epididymis. Accurate sperm counts require homogenisation of the epididymis. Similarly, an accurate assessment of sperm motility requires backflushing of the epididymis to collect sperm to prevent biasing for motile sperm.</p><p>c. Histological characterisation of the testis needs to be re-done. Testes should be bouin's fixed and stained with Periodic Acid Schiff's stain and hematoxylin (not hematoxylin and eosin) to allow visualisation of the acrosome and accurate staging and proper characterisation of the seminiferous epithelium. A more thorough characterisation of the various stages of spermatogenesis or a larger overview should also then be presented for the cKO vs control testes.</p><p>d. The potential spermiation failure needs better characterisation to confirm. Testis weights and testicular daily sperm production should be assessed to determine if the reduction in epididymal sperm counts is due to less sperm being produced in spermatogenesis. If there is no reduction in testis daily sperm production or there is a much greater reduction in epididymal sperm content relative to daily sperm production then this is good evidence for spermiation failure. Stage IX seminiferous tubules should then be used to confirm spermiation failure. The stage XII shown in Figure 7 is not appropriate for confirmation of spermiation failure as by stage XII, nuclear condensation and spermatid elongation is well underway so thin heads could be abnormal step 12 spermatids.</p><p>e.

The gold standard is to present the average number of pups per plug.</p><p>2. The double axoneme phenotype is not commonly seen in KO models and the origins of this might reveal important insight into sperm tail formation.

The authors should include IF staining of epididymal sperm to show if DNALI1 is localised to the sperm axoneme, and to help clarify if DNALI1 has a direct role in axoneme motility.</p><p>4. The origin of the abnormal sperm head shape needs to be defined. The authors suggest it could be due to manchette abnormalities, but they have not actually characterised the manchette.

The TEM clearly shows abnormalities in sperm tail formation, however, I note that it is from testicular spermatid flagella. Have the authors staged the tubules to assess to ensure that these cross sections are from the end of spermiogenesis i.e. stage VII/VIII? This is important to ensure residual cytoplasm as the differences in the coiling in the mitochondrial sheath and other accessory structures are not just due to tails being at different steps of development.</p><p>6.

In the current form, unfortunately, this manuscript is not strong to support the current major conclusions. To be reconsidered, it would require a major revision. Below are the specific comments for the manuscript.</p><p>1. All the interactions between PACRG and DNALI1 are examined only in in vitro system. Have the authors examined their interaction in the native system – testis? Also, the authors should show the interaction within DNALI1 and MEIG here to show their link in detail (see also point #2 re: Figure 1C)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the interaction between DNALI1 and PACRG should be examined in the testis. We performed CO-IP using a PACRG antibody and found that DNALI1 was pulled-down together with PACRG, this figure is included in the revised manuscript (Figure 4A). However, the size of the endogenous PACRG is about 26 kDa, almost the same size of the IgG light chain (about 25 kDa). We tried multiple protocols to eliminate the IgG bands, but we were not successful. Therefore, we were not able to provide the Western result conducted using the PACRG antibody.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. re: Figure 1. First, it is not explained why the authors used CHO cells for the co-localization study and COS1 for the co-IP experiment. In the corresponding text to Figure 1, the authors describe the PACRG localizes at vesicle together with DNALI1 in heterologous expression (Figure 1B). However, the current images do not show vesicle localization. Please show more clear images (magnified or insets, or higher resolution microscopy) to support vesicle localization. Besides, when PACRG and DNALI1 are co-localized, their localization is sided in the opposite direction.</p><p>In Figure 1B, the author mentioned &quot;DNALI1-flag was present as a vesicle&quot; in CHO cells, what is this vesicle? Please include the authors' explanation.</p><p>In Figure 1C, the same size band is seen in IgG control pull-down, thus it is not clear whether PACRG interaction with DNAI1 is positive. Please provide full details such as lane information. As the interaction is ambiguous due to a positive signal in a negative control group, the specificity of the interaction is not clear. How about testing DNAI1 interaction with MEIG1? If DNAI1 interaction with PACRG/MEIG1 is via direct binding to PACRG, then DNAI1 interaction with MEIG1 should be negative.</p></disp-quote><p>CHO cells have clear morphology, and COS<sup>-1</sup> cells can express exogenous genes at a higher level, that is the reason we have been using the two different cells for different purposes. We explained this issue in the revised manuscript. We agree that “vesicle localization” may not be the most accurate term to describe the observation of DNALI1 and PACRG in the cells and have replaced it with “granule structure” in the revised manuscript. We also noticed that a band that is of similar size is also seen in the IgG control pull-down. This is a common phenomenon in IP experiment. This could be improved by extensively washing. However, too much washing sometimes also reduces the specific signals. Clearly the DNALI1/Flag signal in the MYC antibody pull down lane is stronger than the IgG pull down lane. Interaction between DNALI1 and PACRG is also supported by other experiments, indicting specific interaction between the two proteins. As suggested, we added the IP experiment to examine DNALI1 and MEIG1 showing negative interaction between DNALI1 and MEIG1 in the transfected COS<sup>-1</sup> cells (Supplemental Figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Re: Figure 2 &amp; Figure 3 – Please consider combining Figure 2 &amp; 3 together as they are complementary to each other in supporting one conclusion. In fact, placing Figure 3 before Figure 2 makes more sense as it would provide the radiational why they co-express those together and run co-purified complex in gel filtration.</p><p>For current Figure 2 gel filtration, please add the gel filtration protein profile read by A280 together with the position of markers. What is the size of the co-purified PACRG/DNALI1?</p><p>In current Figure 3, Please measure the Pacrg mRNA level in each single or combined expression to support the conclusion. Are they really have the same mRNA level but only the protein level changed? If the stability is really the problem, then please apply MG-132 to inhibit the proteasome activity to support the conclusion.</p><p>Most importantly, the authors show DNALI1 stabilizes PACRG expression using in vitro system. However, it is contradictory as PACRG protein levels in the native tissue – testis – in DNALI1 knockout mice are not affected. This discrepancy should be explained. It is unclear what's the biological meaning of PACRG stabilization in the developmental procedure?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we’ve reorganized the sequence of figures and have now placed Figure 3 before Figure 2 in the revised manuscript. We apologize for inaccurately identifying the original Figure 2 (now Figure 3) as gel filtration. We’ve updated the manuscript stating that nickel affinity chromatography was performed. The sizes of the two proteins are labeled in the revised figure. We agree that the mRNA level of <italic>Pacrg</italic> should be examined to support the conclusion and have now included the qPCR results in the new Figure 2Ab. We acknowledge that it appears contradictory for PACRG protein levels to be unaffected in the native tissue. This is possibly due to the stabilization of PACRG. In our earlier publication, we showed the result of adding MG132 to the cells, therefore we consider that it is redundant to include this experiment again in this study. PACRG associates with multiple proteins. We have shown that MEIG1 also stabilizes PACRG. in vivo, if DNALI1 is absent, PACRG can also be stabilized by MEIG1, which explains why the PACRG protein level is not changed in the <italic>Dnali1</italic> cKO mice. We discuss this possibility in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Re: Figure 4, The authors show the co-localization of the DNALI1 and PACRG at the manchette region only in wild type but placed the immunostaining done in parallel from PACRG-deficient germ in Supplementary Figure 1. These two figures should be combined as Figure 1 for fair comparison and easier view for the readers. Also adding sub-figure labels will be helpful (labeling wt only one time on the top of the figure will do good).</p></disp-quote><p>We do acknowledge that placing wild-type and PACRG-deficient germ cells in parallel would be easier for the readers. However, placing Supplementary Figure 1 (now Supplemental Figure 2) alongside Figure 4 would not be an equivalent comparison as Figure 4 is looking at isolated germ cells whereas Supplementary Figure 1 is obtained by performing immunostaining on the whole testis section. We agree that labeling wt once on the top of figure is sufficient and have removed the repetitive labels in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Re: Figure 5, please split fertility &amp; litter size graphs as the unit of Y-axis value should be different. Also please show all the individual data points for B-E.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize the inadequate presentation of Figure 5 and have now updated it to show fertility and litter size on separate figures. Individual data points for all the figures are shown in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Re: Figure 6. Dnali1-knockout sperm show clear defects in sperm tail development. However, it is unclear how many sperm cells have flagellum. The authors should include quantitative information on the presence/absence of the sperm tail to understand the role of Dnali1 in sperm flagellar development.</p><p>Based on Figure 6, the authors claim that Dnali1-knockout sperm show a problem in sperm individualization. To fully support this conclusion, the authors should demonstrate that the defect in Dnali1-knockout sperm is not due to axoneme instability (i.e., sprayed 9+2 axoneme) by TEM by showing two 9+2 tails belonging to one sperm head or double head.</p></disp-quote><p>All developed sperm had tails, just the morphology was not normal. We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to conduct more TEM to show the two 9+2 tails belonging to one sperm head or double head. Our institute does not have a TEM core facility. The samples would have to be sent to our collaborator’s lab in Paris, and the collaborator moved to another institute recently. Due to the complicated situation, and the high cost for the TEM experiment, particularly for the external users, we feel difficult to complete this experiment. However, we conducted other experiment to show abnormal autophagy process in this model. We believe that the new data (supplemental Figure 15 in the revised manuscript) support our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In histology results (Figure 7), it is unclear how the authors recognize phagocytosis sperm. What's the evidence the pointed germ cell in Figure 7A is undergoing phagocytosis.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we revised Figure 7 and provided additional information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Re: Figure 9, Please show PACRG localization as well. In Dnali1 cKO elongating spermatid cells, where PACRG is localization? Is it also no longer present in the manchette? This should be included in Figure 9. This is very important as this manuscript only has in vitro data to show PACRG/DNALI1 interaction, but no in vivo data. So far, the author only shows PACRG KO doesn't change DNALI1 manchette localization, DNALI1 cKO doesn't change PACRG protein level in testis. These do not support PACRG interaction with DNALI1. Is a-tubulin staining in Danli1 spermatocytes representative (no to very weak signals compared to other panels).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good question and we tried to answer even before we submitted the original manuscript. We have been struggling with poor PACRG antibodies. We have been working on this project for more than 13 years, and some results presented in this manuscript were generated more than 10 years ago. The original polyclonal PACRG antibody was from an investigator at Baylor College of Medicine, and the antibody worked perfectly in both Western blotting and IF. Unfortunately, we ran out of that antibody many years ago. We tried to contact the investigator to request more antibody several times (it appears that the investigator moved to Canada a while ago), but we have never had response. We decided to generated mouse monoclonal PACRG antibodies in our lab about 10 years ago (a company Abmart started new business and provided very preferential price: the company synthesized multiple peptides and made the antibodies with $1500). Several monoclonal PACRG antibodies worked for Western blotting but only one worked for both Western and IF. Given the small volume of monoclonal antibodies, we also ran out of the one that worked for IF. We purchased two commercial PACRG antibodies in preparation for this manuscript, however, these antibodies did not give any specific signal in immunofluorescence stains. We provided the information in the revised manuscript. Given the high cost of purchasing more PACRG antibodies, particularly that another lab is publishing their manuscript, we consider that we cannot wait at the moment. Studying this pathway is a long-term goal of our lab, we will absolutely continue the suggested experiment when appropriate antibody is available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Discussion. In the current Discussion Before page 38, the discussion is either to provide a hypothesis (which should belong to the Introduction to provide the rationale of the study) or repetition/summary of results. From page 38, the content is relevant to Discussion but will be easy if there are subheadings for each section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the organization of the Discussion section can be improved. Subheadings for each section of the Discussion have been added in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Re: Figure 10 – The way the author put DNALI1=Motor Complex = IMT is inappropriate, and so do the other three in B, C, and D.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the statements in Figure 10 (now Figure 11) are inaccurate.

Intra-manchette transport (IMT) is a phenomenon relatively well recognized by reproductive biologists. However, for a broad range of readers unfamiliar with IMT, the authors would explain more on this, particularly on the difference between IMT and well-known intraflagellar transport (IFT), and on where the authors focus in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions to strengthen the manuscript. As suggested, we explained more on the IMT and IFT in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 10 is highly speculated and is not unrelated to the data presented in this paper.

Sperm isolation by cutting the epididymis and allowing sperm to swim out is not appropriate for motility and count analysis. It is dependent on the cuts made as to how many sperm vacate, in addition, non-motile sperm will be less likely to vacate the epididymis. Accurate sperm counts require homogenisation of the epididymis. Similarly, an accurate assessment of sperm motility requires backflushing of the epididymis to collect sperm to prevent biasing for motile sperm.</p></disp-quote><p>We actually conducted the experiment in the same way the reviewer suggested.
