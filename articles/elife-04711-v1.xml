Neuroscientists commonly refer to such rewards and punishments as ‘reinforcement’.</p><p>Fruit flies that are given a reward of sugar when they experience an odor will move towards the odor in later tests. However, in 2011, research revealed that if the flies were given at least the same amount of sugar in the tests as they were rewarded with during the earlier training, the flies stopped moving towards the odor. This suggests that fruit flies can recall how strong a reward was in the past and compare this remembered strength to the current reward on offer; fruit flies will only continue searching if they expect to gain a larger reward by doing so.</p><p>Insects were commonly thought to only learn the amount or ‘value’ of reinforcement, but not recall what kind or ‘quality’ of reward (or punishment) they had experienced. Now Schleyer et al.—including some of the researchers involved in the 2011 work—challenge and extend this notion and show that fruit fly larvae can remember both the value and quality of rewards and punishments.</p><p>Fruit fly larvae were trained to expect a reward of sugar when exposed to one odor and nothing when exposed to a different odor. Consistent with the previous results, the larvae moved towards the first odor in the tests where no additional reward was provided. Moreover, the larvae did not move towards the odor in later tests if an equal or greater amount of sugar was provided during the testing stage.</p><p>Schleyer et al. then took larvae that had been trained to expect a sugar reward and gave them a different, but equally valuable, reward during the testing stage—in this case, the reward was an amino acid called aspartic acid.

This indicates that the larvae were able to remember the quality of the reward, namely that it was sugar rather than aspartic acid.</p><p>Schleyer et al. performed similar experiments, and observed similar results, when using two different punishments: bitter-tasting quinine and high concentrations of salt. These findings show that experiencing an odor along with taste reinforcement could set up a memory specific to the quality of reinforcement in fruit fly larvae. Given the numerical simplicity of a larva's brain—which contains only 10,000 neurons—it is likely that other animals can also recall both the value and quality of a reward or punishment. However, understanding how such specificity comes about should be easier in the larva's simple brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04711.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04711.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>punishment</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>valence</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>taste</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schleyer</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerber</surname><given-names>Bertram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bernstein Fokus Insect-inspired robotics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schleyer</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerber</surname><given-names>Bertram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MINIMAL FP7 - 618045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schleyer</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerber</surname><given-names>Bertram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004096</institution-id><institution>Kyushu University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miura</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanimura</surname><given-names>Teiichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The finding that fly maggots, equipped with only 10,000 neurons, process reinforcement not only by value but also by specific quality reveals a basic operating principle of brains and challenges current models of memory organization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>What are the fundamental capacities of insect brains? To date, little use has been made of insect memory experiments to reveal these capacities, in particular regarding reinforcement. For example, after experiencing an odor with a sugar reward, fruit flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) approach that odor in a later test. All the known circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>) of such learned search behavior suggests that this is because the odor has acquired positive value; that is, that the flies are expecting to find ‘something good’ in its vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerber and Hendel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schleyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, <italic>Drosophila</italic> can associate an odor with an electric-shock punishment. This supports their learned escape in a later test because they may expect ‘something bad’ with the odor. In other words, the only feature of reinforcement processing that insects are granted is value. We show that larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> are in a defined sense richer than this in their mnemonic capacity: they also recall of what particular quality that good or bad experience was. Given the numerical simplicity of the larval brain, this is suggested to be a more basic property of brains than hitherto assumed.</p><p>To address this question, we exploit an established assay for Pavlovian conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerber et al., 2013</xref>) that allows reinforcers of various strength and quality to be used. In this Petri dish assay, larvae are placed onto a tasteless agarose substrate. This substrate is supplemented with a fructose sugar reward—if odorant A is presented. Odorant B is presented without the reward (A+/B). For a companion group of larvae, contingencies are reversed (A/B+). In a binary choice test, the larvae then systematically approach the previously rewarded odorant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This behavior, quantified as a positive associative performance index (PI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), can best be grasped as a memory-based search for reward: if the test is performed in the presence of fructose, the learned approach is abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerber and Hendel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schleyer et al., 2011</xref>) (olfactory behavior per se is not affected: see below). This is adaptive as learned search behavior is indeed obsolete in the presence of a sought-for item. We have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schleyer et al., 2011</xref>) that regardless of the absolute concentration of fructose, such an abolishment is seen if the fructose concentration in the test substrate is equal to or higher than that used in training. This means that learned behavior is based on a relative assessment: the larvae recall how strong the training reward was and compare this remembered strength to the current testing situation. Only if that comparison promises a gain (remembered strength &gt; current strength) do they search for what they can thus expect to gain at the odor source. We note that widely applied formal learning models of the Rescorla-Wagner type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>) propose that memory acquisition will only occur if something new and unexpected happens, specifically if the experienced reward is stronger than predicted on the basis of memory (current strength &gt; remembered strength). Thus, the same two pieces of information are compared during memory acquisition on the one hand and the expression of learned search behavior on the other hand—yet in a ‘swapped’ way. This can inform the animals respectively about what is new or what there is to be gained. Here, we ask whether these processes are integrated across different qualities of reward into one common scale of appetitive value or whether separate systems exist to confer mnemonic specificity for the ‘quality’ of reward.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04711.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reward processing by quality and value.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Larvae are trained to associate one of two odors with either 2 M fructose or 10 mM aspartic acid as reward. Subsequently, they are tested for their choice between the two odors—in the absence or in the presence of either substrate. For example, in the left-most panel, a group of larvae is first (upper row) exposed to n-amyl acetate (blue cloud) together with fructose (green circle), and subsequently (middle row) to 1-octanol (gold cloud) without any tastant (white circle). After three cycles of such training, larvae are given the choice between n-amyl acetate and 1-octanol in the absence of any tastant (lower row). A second group of larvae is trained reciprocally, that is, 1-octanol is paired with fructose (second column from left, partially hidden). For the other panels, procedures are analogous. Aspartic acid is indicated by brown circles. (<bold>B</bold>) Data from (<bold>A</bold>) plotted combined for the groups tested on pure agarose (‘Mismatch’ in both value and quality), in the presence of the respectively other reward, or of the training reward. Learned search behavior towards the reward-associated odor is abolished in presence of the training reward because both reward value and reward quality in the testing situation are as sought-for (‘Match’ in both cases), yet search remains partially intact in the presence of the other quality of reward, because reward value is as sought-for (‘Match’) but reward quality is not (‘Mismatch’).

Concentrations of aspartic acid and fructose are chosen such that their reward value is equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This allows us to study the larvae under test conditions that are of equal reward value but that either match or do not match the ‘quality’ of reward that has been employed during training. If the larvae merely searched for a reward of remembered value, learned search behavior should cease in both cases—because current strength matches remembered strength in both cases. If reward quality were the sole determinant for learned search, in contrast, learned search should be abolished only when test and training substrate match in quality, but should remain intact when quality does not match. If the larvae searched for a reward specified both by its value and by its quality, scores in the mismatch case should be partially abolished: in that case, the reward's value is as sought yet its quality is not. We find that learned search is fully abolished when the training and test reward match in both value and quality but remains partially intact (by 68%) if there is a mismatch in reward quality between training and test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We conclude that after odor-fructose training the larvae approach the odor both in search of something ‘good’ (value) and in search of what is specifically fructose (quality of reward). Likewise, after odor-aspartic acid training, they search both for something ‘good’ and for aspartic acid. In other words, if during the test the larvae, for example, have sugar anyway but remember where aspartic acid can be found, they will still go for aspartic acid in addition.</p><p>Regarding the aversive domain, pairing an odor with quinine as punishment leads to aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerber and Hendel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schleyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El-Keredy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apostolopoulou et al., 2014</xref>). In this case, learned behavior can best be understood as an informed escape that is warranted in the presence but not in the absence of quinine. Accordingly, in the presence but not in the absence of quinine one observes that the larvae run away from the previously punished odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerber and Hendel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schleyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El-Keredy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apostolopoulou et al., 2014</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Niewalda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schnaitmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eschbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Russell et al., 2011</xref> for reports using other aversive reinforcers and/or adult flies). Notably and in accordance with our earlier results in the appetitive domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schleyer et al., 2011</xref>), such learned escape does not merely depend on the concentration of quinine in the test; rather, learned escape lessens as the quinine concentration in the test is reduced <italic>relative</italic> to that in training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Given that high-concentration salt can also serve as punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerber and Hendel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Niewalda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Russell et al., 2011</xref>), we ask whether an odor-quinine memory is specific in prompting escape from quinine—but not from salt. For concentrations of quinine and salt that are of equal value as punishment, this is indeed the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 2—figure Supplement 2</xref>); likewise, odor-salt memories are specific in prompting learned escape from salt but not from quinine (for a summary see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Such specificity shows that larvae have a memory specific to the quality of punishment, a memory that can specifically be applied in the appropriate situation. We stress that the present results do not provide proof of the absence of aversive ‘common currency’ value processing. Indeed, in cases of unequal punishment value, larvae may use this information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eschbach et al., 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04711.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Punishment processing by quality.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Larvae are trained to associate one of two odors with either 5 mM quinine (red circle) or 4 M sodium chloride (purple circle) as punishment and asked for their choice between the two odors—in the presence of either substrate.

We would like to stress that innate olfactory behavior per se is not affected by the presence of any of the tastant reinforcers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hendel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schleyer et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Also, the mere presence of any given tastant reinforcer during the memory test is not a critical determinant for whether learned behavior is observed: learned behavior can be observed (or not) in the presence of any of the tastant reinforcers in this study—what matters is how closely it matches the one used during training in quality and/or in value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1B and 2B</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04711.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Innate odor preference is not influenced by taste processing.</title><p>Larvae are tested for their olfactory preference regarding (<bold>A</bold>) n-amyl acetate (blue cloud), (<bold>B</bold>) 1-octanol (gold cloud), or (<bold>C</bold>) for their choice between n-amyl acetate and 1-octanol.

Odors are coded combinatorially across the olfactory sensory neurons (OSN, blue). In the antennal lobe, these sensory neurons signal towards local interneurons (not shown) and projection neurons (PN, deep blue). Projection neurons have two target areas, the lateral horn (LH, orange) mediating innate approach, and the mushroom body (MB, yellow). Reinforcement signals (green and red for appetitive and aversive reinforcement, respectively) from the gustatory system reach the mushroom body, leading to associative memory traces in simultaneously activated mushroom body neurons. In the present analysis, this sketch focuses selectively on five broad classes of chemosensory behavior, namely innate odor approach, learned odor search and escape, as well as appetitive and aversive innate gustatory behavior. The boxed region is displayed in detail in (<bold>B</bold>–<bold>C</bold>). The break in the connection between mushroom body output and behavior is intended to acknowledge that mushroom body output is probably not in itself sufficient as a (pre-) motor signal but rather exerts a modulatory effect on weighting between behavioral options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schleyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Menzel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) Reinforcement processing by value (based on e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schleyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>): a reward neuron sums input from fructose and aspartic acid pathways and thus establishes a memory allowing for learned search for ‘good’. In a functionally separate compartment, a punishment neuron summing quinine and salt signals likewise establishes a memory trace for learned escape from ‘bad’. This scenario cannot account for quality-of-reinforcement memory. (<bold>C</bold>) Reinforcement processing by both value and quality: in addition to a common, value-specific appetitive memory, fructose and aspartic acid drive discrete reward signals leading to discrete memory traces in at least functionally distinct compartments of the Kenyon cells, which can be independently turned into learned search. For aversive memory, there may be only quality-specific punishment signals. This scenario is in accordance with the present data.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04711.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04711.010</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04711-fig4-v1"/></fig></p><p>Thus, the nuanced memory of at least two qualities of appetitive and two qualities of aversive taste reinforcers as shown in the present study is unexpected. Appropriate to such nuanced memories, the mushroom bodies show a fairly complex substructure, even in larval <italic>Drosophila</italic>. At least 10 mushroom body regions are recognized, defined by the tiled innervation of input and output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pauls et al., 2010b</xref>). Our behavioral data suggest that at least five such tiles of the mushroom body would be required to accommodate learned search for fructose or aspartic acid, learned escape from quinine or from high-concentration salt and in addition a less specific appetitive value-memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Clearly the things worth remembering for a larva include many more than these five (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Niewalda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pauls et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eschbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khurana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rohwedder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diegelmann et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, the behavioral repertoire of larvae may be considerably greater than thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vogelstein et al., 2014</xref>). Using our current approach, it will now be possible to systematically determine the limits of specificity in the processing of reinforcement quality. This may reveal signals of intermediate specificity to inform the animals about, for example, edibility, caloric value, proteinogenic value, suitability for pupariation, toxicity, or even acutely and situationally modulated matters of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Simpson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We note that the distinction between fructose and aspartic acid memory implies that the sensory neurons mediating the rewarding effects of these stimuli cannot be completely overlapping and that the sensory neurons mediating the punishing effects of quinine and high-concentration salt likewise cannot (for reviews of the taste system in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cobb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerber et al., 2009</xref>). For identifying these neurons, it is significant that they may be distinct from those mediating innate choice behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apostolopoulou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">König et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the vertebrate literature, the processing of reward by value has been regarded as a matter of sophistication because an integrated, higher-order value signal can be generated from sensorially distinct qualities of reward (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lak et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, reward expectations can apparently also be processed in a quality-specific manner (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dickinson and Balleine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Watanabe, 1996</xref>). In terms of the minimally required number of cells, the processing by reinforcer quality is more demanding than value-only processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). The fact that even the humble, 10,000-neuron brain of a larva operates with both reward value and quality may suggest that they both represent fundamentally important, indispensable aspects of reward processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>General</title><p>We used third-instar feeding-stage larvae from the Canton-Special wild-type strain, aged 5 days after egg laying.

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Type-of-reinforcement memory in larval <italic>Drosophila</italic>” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>In summary, the reviewers say: “This manuscript reports a well-designed study on the role of parameters of reinforcement stimuli that are learned by the larvae of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The authors convincingly show that not only the quantity of a rewarding or punishing reinforcer is learned (reported by earlier of the same authors) but also the quality, more specifically two different qualities in the rewarding and the punishing stimuli. This is an important finding that opens up mechanistic studies on the coding of reinforcing stimuli in this very small nervous system of the larvae. The researchers' principal finding is both interesting and well-substantiated by their data.”</p><p>However, there were also a number of points raised by the reviewers that are summarized in the following. When you revise your manuscript, we would like you to address each of them and give a point-by-point response in a separate letter.</p><p>Concerning data evaluation, interpretation, and figures:</p><p>1) Why do the authors pool the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> according to whether there is a match or mismatch of the reward during training / test? The authors should perform the comparisons of components (i.e. 1st to 3rd bar and 4th to 6th as done for aversive reinforcers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and adjust their conclusions accordingly.</p><p>2) The authors claim (Results, end of paragraph 2) that “(...) learned escape ceases if the quinine concentration in the test is relatively smaller than during training.” However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2a–figure supplement 1</xref>, they show that training larvae with 5 mM quinine and testing them in the presence of 0.05 mM quinine still results in avoidance that is significantly different from 0 (4th bar). This result directly contradicts the authors' claim.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The three figures are all based on an assumption that should be mentioned, namely that the mushroom body produces labeled lines of (pre)motor commands. This assumption is in line with the tradition of “modelling” in Drosophila research but is not in agreement with other interpretations about the function of the mushroom body. The weakness of this kind of thinking degrades the interesting and important data reported here. Therefore, we suggest removing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. If, however, the authors want to keep it than they need to put it in full context about the concepts of mushroom body function (including other insect species) and into the context of what is known about the mushroom body extrinsic neurons (also including other insect species).</p><p>Concerning context and topics for discussion as well as future experiments:</p><p>1) The authors do not fully discuss similar findings in mammals. In primates, a potential neuronal correlate for reward-type specificity has been shown (e.g. Watanabe, Nature 1996). Given these findings the authors' views on larval type-of-reinforcement learning should be placed in a broader context.</p><p>2) Likewise the authors should comment on recent relevant papers in <italic>Drosophila</italic> about the distinct/common neuronal correlates for sugar/water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin, Nature Neurosci 2014</xref>), and electric shock/ DEET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Das, Curr Biol 2014</xref>)/high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galili, Curr Biol 2014</xref>).</p><p>3) What is known about taste receptors in fruit flies, and specifically, which of them are expressed in fruit fly larvae? <italic>C elegans</italic> expresses lots of different receptors for stimuli of the same valence (good/bad) on the same neuron. Therefore, if one were to do the same experiments on <italic>C elegans</italic>, that they would not be capable of encoding type of reinforcement, only the value. This would be an important prediction from the authors work.</p><p>4) Fruit flies, like other insects, have a lot of different taste receptors. They presumably need them to discriminate among many different tastants. So, in some sense, one would predict a priori that insects can discriminate value. Why would the receptors that enabled the 'type' discrimination evolve only to have them summed in a 'good' and in a 'bad' center in the brain for association? It might suggest an interesting experiment for future work that reflects on the need to discriminate type. There is a large literature on nutrition of carbohydrate, amino acids, etc., in insects. A Google search for authors Simpson or Raubenheimer and 'nutritional rails' will find relevant papers. Insects need to maintain a balance of these nutrients in their diet. If one experimentally drives insects off of their preferred nutritional balance (ratio of carbohydrate to amino acid, for example), insects will typically change their diet choices to bring them back into nutritional balance. If the authors were to deprive larvae of sugar or amino acids in their diet, then one might expect interference where there is currently none (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the 3rd and 6th experimental groups). Having shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae can encode type, which the authors conclusively did, then showing that insects can ignore the learned preferences for a deprived type would show even more complexity. But this is not an experiment that would be needed for a revision.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04711.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Concerning data evaluation, interpretation and figures</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Why do the authors pool the data of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1a</italic></xref> <italic>according to whether there is a match or mismatch of the reward during training / test?

We have experienced that not-pooling the data despite the trends apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> can come across as unfair to this default notion of value‐memory, which is as giving an iconoclastic spin to the conclusions. We hope that the way we now present the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and the way we comment on the situation is acceptable.</p><p>Please allow two more technical comments:</p><p>We agree with the comment that the comparisons indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> should be the same. Now the comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> are comparisons between the respective Match/Match case versus the Match/Mismatch case.

In other words, for revealing value‐memory in the aversive case, the test in the absence of any reinforce (corresponding to the first bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) is not needed.</p><p><italic>2) The authors claim (Results, end of paragraph 2) that “(...) learned escape ceases if the quinine concentration in the test is relatively smaller than during training.” However, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1"><italic>Figure 2a–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, they show that training larvae with 5 mM quinine and testing them in the presence of 0.05 mM quinine still results in avoidance that is significantly different from 0 (4th bar). This result directly contradicts the authors' claim</italic>.</p><p>We agree and regret that the sentence was poorly phrased. We intended to say that learned escape is lessened as the concentration of quinine during the test is reduced relative to that during training.

The weakness of this kind of thinking degrades the interesting and important data reported here. Therefore, we suggest removing</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>. If, however, the authors want to keep it than they need to put it in full context about the concepts of mushroom body function (including other insect species) and into the context of what is known about the mushroom body extrinsic neurons (also including other insect species)</italic>.</p><p>We certainly agree that the mushroom body is richer in function than our sketch suggests, and we actually also agree that mushroom body output by itself is probably not a sufficient (pre)motor command. We opt to keep the figure. We have modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, changed its title and rewritten the legend to explicate our view on what mushroom body output means to the animal.</p><p>To broaden the perspective, this includes additional review‐references that try to capture some of the literature beyond what is of most immediate relevance. Given the nature of the current paper as a short report, we wonder whether any more exhaustive discussion may be disproportionate. We hope this will be acceptable.</p><p><italic>Concerning context and topics for discussion as well as future experiments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The authors do not fully discuss similar findings in mammals. In primates, a potential neuronal correlate for reward-type specificity has been shown (e.g. Watanabe, Nature 1996). Given these findings the authors' views on larval type-of-reinforcement learning should be placed in a broader context</italic>.</p><p>We agree the account of the vertebrate literature was too selective. We have now tried to find a better balance between the needs to do justice to the status of neighboring fields of study (including balancing reference to Lak et al with the one by Watanabe, and making it explicit that both are merely examples), and to be brief in the context of the present short report.</p><p><italic>[Editors’ note: the following was sent as an optional point for the discussion, not an essential revision, after the original decision letter was sent</italic>.<italic>]</italic></p><p><italic>“US (or outcome) devaluation is a common experimental procedure to address the stimulus-specific learned outcome value (mainly using rodent and primate systems). So by definition, learned reinforcement in these studies is stimulus‐specific (reinforcement quality)</italic>.</p><p><italic>Devaluation and its underlying neural substrate have been extensively studied in experimental psychology (e.g. Dickinson and Balleine Animal Learning &amp; Behaviour 1994), but nowhere mentioned in this manuscript</italic>.</p><p><italic>Therefore, I would like to see the discussion of the authors' findings in the context of all these vertebrate behavioural studies</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p>We agree that devaluation experiments would be a good approach to studying memory for reinforce quality. Indeed, we have tried to devalue a fructose reward by pairing it with quinine. However, this kind of experiment has failed to work in larvae so far (unpublished).</p><p>Meanwhile, we have found that bitter substances inhibit sugar detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">König et al. 2014</xref>, Chemical Senses). Thus, the devaluation experiments would have to be repeated with a devaluing stimulus without such side effects. Anyway, our current approach circumvents this problem and has the advantage of also being applicable to punishments.</p><p>We have now added a reference to the devaluation literature in the context of our note regarding reward expectations specific for reward quality. We hesitate to engage in a more detailed discussion within the paper, as we feel it would be beyond the scope of a short report.</p><p><italic>2) Likewise the authors should comment on recent relevant papers in Drosophila about the distinct/common neuronal correlates for sugar/water (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19"><italic>Lin, Nature Neurosci 2014</italic></xref><italic>), and electric shock/ DEET (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"><italic>Das, Curr Biol 2014</italic></xref><italic>)/high temperature (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><italic>Galili, Curr Biol 2014</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>We have now included a fairly extensive discussion of these papers, which came out very shortly before we had finalized our manuscript. We hope you find the discussion satisfactory.</p><p><italic>3) What is known about taste receptors in fruit flies, and specifically, which of them are expressed in fruit fly larvae? C elegans expresses lots of different receptors for stimuli of the same valence (good/bad) on the same neuron. Therefore, if one were to do the same experiments on C elegans, that they would not be capable of encoding type of reinforcement, only the value. This would be an important prediction from the authors work</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this prediction should be spelled out within our paper. What appears safe to say is that our data predict that the sensory neurons mediating fructose and aspartic acid reinforcement, respectively, cannot be completely overlapping, and that the sensory neurons mediating quinine and high salt punishment likewise cannot. We also added “taste” as keyword. We would like to refrain from a more detailed discussion, however. This is chiefly because taste coding is not the central topic of the paper.</p><p>Furthermore, the situation is complicated by the fact that, at least regarding bitter, the sensory neurons mediating reinforcement on the one hand versus those mediating innate avoidance on the other hand are distinct (ablating Gr33a‐Gal4 expressing neurons abolishes innate avoidance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">König et al 2014</xref> Chem Sens, but leaves bitter punishment intact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apostolopoulou et al. 2014</xref>, Front Behav Neurosci).</p><p>Arguably, a similar situation can be expected for the other three tastants (as has recently been shown for water‐taste, too: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al. 2014</xref>). We would thus need to reckon with a total of up to 8 ascending taste processing channels. To complicate matters even further, it remains to be seen whether the sensory neurons that are responsible for mediating the information about the gustatory environment during the test are the same as those mediating reinforcement, or the same as those mediating innate choice behavior – or yet different.</p><p>Indeed, the number of gustatory sensory neurons in the larva is about three times higher than the number of olfactory sensory neurons... Lastly, despite impressive recent advances, the mapping of gustatory receptors onto the gustatory sensory neurons of the larva is as yet incomplete (in the case of amino acids, practically nothing is known) and to some extent controversial (e.g. regarding sugar sensors). We thus hope that the manuscript as it now stands is clear in the way it states the most immediate implications of the present data for sensory physiology.</p><p><italic>4) Fruit flies, like other insects, have a lot of different taste receptors. They presumably need them to discriminate among many different tastants. So, in some sense, one would predict a priori that insects can discriminate value. Why would the receptors that enabled the 'type' discrimination evolve only to have them summed in a 'good' and in a 'bad' center in the brain for association? It might suggest an interesting experiment for future work that reflects on the need to discriminate type. There is a large literature on nutrition of carbohydrate, amino acids, etc., in insects. A Google search for authors Simpson or Raubenheimer and 'nutritional rails' will find relevant papers. Insects need to maintain a balance of these nutrients in their diet.

But this is not an experiment that would be needed for a revision</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for sharing this idea! We had something like this in mind when we were referring to “situationally‐defined matters of concern”, yet we realize this was phrased too densely, and not explicitly enough. Together with now pointing out the Simpson‐Raubenheimer literature, which indeed is fascinating, the way the paper reads now is hopefully a bit clearer.</p><p>(Regarding the rationale for why nature may indeed be merging sensorially different inputs towards a common‐currency signal, we would like to point out the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lak et al 2014</xref>. Such a common‐currency signal may be useful when facing the choice between outcomes that differ in kind. Secondly, it could be the case that the distinct sensors are used ‘merely’ for the immediate, reflexive behavior towards tastants, and that these signals then are summed for their reinforcing effects.)</p></body></sub-article></article>
