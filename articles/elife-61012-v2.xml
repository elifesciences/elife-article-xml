vast amounts of water. Pumping is carried out by flagellated chambers that are connected to an inhalant and exhalant canal system. In ‘leucon’ sponges with relatively high-pressure resistance due to a complex and narrow canal system, pumping and filtering are only possible owing to the presence of a gasket-like structure (forming a canopy above the collar filters). Here, we combine numerical and experimental work and demonstrate how sponges that lack such sealing elements are able to efficiently pump and force the flagella-driven flow through their collar filter, thanks to the formation of a ‘hydrodynamic gasket’ above the collar. Our findings link the architecture of flagellated chambers to that of the canal system, and lend support to the current view that the sponge aquiferous system evolved from an open-type filtration system, and that the first metazoans were filter feeders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>filter feeding</kwd><kwd>sponges</kwd><kwd>computational fluid dynamics</kwd><kwd>low Reynolds number</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008398</institution-id><institution>Villum Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9278</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Asadzadeh</surname><given-names>Seyed Saeed</given-names></name><name><surname>Larsen</surname><given-names>Poul Scheel</given-names></name><name><surname>Walther</surname><given-names>Jens H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>NSERC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-05446</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leys</surname><given-names>Sally P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008398</institution-id><institution>Villum Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Asadzadeh</surname><given-names>Seyed Saeed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008394</institution-id><institution>Danish Council for Independent Research Natural Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>7014-00033B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kiørboe</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The architecture of flagellated chambers in sponge pumps is linked to that of body plan, supporting the current view that the sponge aquiferous system evolved from an open-type filtration system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many aquatic suspension feeders use cilia and flagella to generate feeding flows from which they capture prey particles. Unlike ciliary arrays that drive fluid tangential to their attachment surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks and Wallingford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Narematsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilpin et al., 2020</xref>), flagellated collar-cells (choanocytes) in sponges must pump water perpendicular to and through a perforated surface, working against a pressure resistance. Several choanocytes are closely packed inside chambers that are connected to inhalant and exhalant canal systems. The canal architecture and its associated pressure resistance impacts the operating condition of choanocyte chambers, and dictates morphological adaptation in such pumping units. Most sponges possess an elaborate aquiferous system (leucon) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reiswig, 1975a</xref>), but some Calcarea, a small class of the Porifera, have a less elaborate aquiferous system (ascon and syconoid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manuel, 2006</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of sponge body types in ascon (A), sycon (S), and leucon (L) with evolutionary view of grades of morphological complexity in calcareous sponges (black arrows).</title><p>Insets show zoom-in water path (blue arrows) into the chambers in sycons and leucons, where in the latter, water is forced to go through collar filters (black) of choanocytes (red, cc) due to the presence of a physical gasket (g).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61012-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Asconoid forms are organized as a single tube in which the choanocytes form a single layer on the inner surface of the tube wall. Syconoid forms, in turn, possess many ascon-shaped cylindrical chambers branching off a central cavity (atrium). Water enters through short canals or directly through openings (ostia) into the chambers and leaves through a single outlet (apopyle) to the atrium and from there out of the osculum. In leuconoid forms, the holes in the surface of the body are connected to a complex canal system with a multitude of small chamber pump units.</p><p>Although these are often depicted as a progressive gain in complexity in the evolution of leuconoid from ascon and sycon forms, phylogenetic analyses indicate that in Calcarea both leucon and sycon type sponges most likely arose independently from ascon forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manuel, 2006</xref>), and some evidence points to the opposite process in which ascon and sycon forms may have derived from a rigid leucon body architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dohrmann et al., 2006</xref>). It is unknown what gave rise to the leuconoid forms of the other three sponge classes. One of the greatest modern puzzles is whether Porifera or Ctenophora branched first in the evolution of multicellular animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Whelan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Telford et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feuda et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, understanding how the sponge filtration system came about would go a long way to helping resolve whether sponges evolved from a colonial unicellular ancestor (Porifera first hypothesis) or from a tissue-grade metazoan (as in some interpretations of the Ctenophora first hypothesis).</p><p>Both choanocytes and choanoflagellates, a group of free-living unicellular and colonial flagellates, share ancestory to animals, and possess similar collar-flagellated cells, to generate adequate feeding currents. In both cells, presence of a flagellar vane, a sheet-like structure along the length of the flagellum, has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afzelius, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fjerdingstad, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mehl and Reiswig, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weissenfels, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leadbeater, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mah et al., 2014</xref>). Vanes differ from mastigonemes, which are extracellular nanometer-thick fibers that protrude perpendicular to the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouck, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenchel, 1982</xref>), both morphologically and functionally. Mastigonemes appear to exist and remain in the beat plane and are thought to reverse the thrust generation by the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holwill and Peters, 1974</xref>). Vanes, however, are horizontal fibers of glycocalyx that extend perpendicularly from the flagellar axis and appear to augment the thrust generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nielsen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Choanocytes in sponges, in addition to driving the flow through the collar, must also overcome the pressure resistance arising from the canal system. The narrow canals in leuconoid body plans add significant pressure resistance to the pump, between 2 and 50 Pa for different sponge species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larsen and Riisgåd, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leys et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ludeman et al., 2017</xref>). Our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asadzadeh et al., 2019a</xref>) demonstrated that directional flow and efficient filtration at such hydrodynamic conditions is only possible because the pumping unit is sealed against back flow, by three extracellular elements, namely, a tight mesh on the distal part of the collar, a vane on the flagellum, and finally a gasket-like structure called Sollas’ membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dendy, 1888</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sollas, 1889</xref>), that connects the microvilli (collar elements) at their tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These features divide the chamber into two regions of low and high pressure, and force the inflow through the collar slits at its base. In contrast, calcareous sponges have fewer canals and thus have less pressure resistance, and appear to lack the gasket and tight mesh that covers the collar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dendy, 1888</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eerkes-Medrano and Leys, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we ask how sponges with apparent absence of a gasket, and therefore an open aquiferous system, can nevertheless effectively pump and filter water for prey, and what the trade-offs and limitations in such pumping systems are. We combine modeling with experiments to study the pumping and feeding in calcareous sponges using <italic>Sycon coactum</italic> as a model organism. Because of the geometric complexity, rather than attempting to use singularities to model the low Reynolds flow, as done for example for flows near a hole in a plane wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 1981</xref>), or flagella-driven flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roper et al., 2013</xref>), we use computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations to investigate the functionality of the pumping elements in the absence of a gasket. Specifically, we study the role of each pumping element in pumping sufficient water through the ostia and into the chamber and examine the mechanism that forces the inhalant flow to pass through the collar filter. The modeled pumping rates are compared to measured exhalant flow rates and the predicted retention efficiency of calcareous sponges is contrasted with actual retention efficiencies measured for different prey types. The limitations and trade-offs between the pumping rate and retention efficiency shed light on what may have been the first poriferan filtration system.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Morphology of the flagellated chamber</title><p>Each flagellated chamber in <italic>Sycon coactum</italic> contains thousands of choanocytes that pump water through hundreds of ostia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leys and Eerkes-Medrano, 2006</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>. To reduce the computational costs, we consider a cylindrical axisymmetric and axially periodic chamber. The computational domain is thereby reduced to a wedge section into the cylindrical chamber that includes a central ostium surrounded by 24 choanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The boundary conditions (BCs) are periodic along the long axis of the chamber (due to the periodic occurrence of ostia) and laterally symmetric on the left and right sides of the section modeled (if one is facing the long axis), due to cylindrical symmetry of the tubular chamber. Once fluid leaves the computational domain vertically into the inner cylindrical core of the choanocyte chamber, it is directed axially toward the open end of the chamber (apopyle). Pressure variation inside the core of the chamber is negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>), hence a uniform pressure boundary is applied on the top surface of the computational domain.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Morphology of the modeled flagellated chamber in calcareous sponges.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The computational domain is a wedged section into the cylindrical, ascon-like flagellated chamber (85 µm in diameter).

This flow meets the inhalant flow from the ostium nearly at the same height as that of the collar, resulting in a stagnation zone that acts as a ‘hydrodynamic gasket’ that forces the inhalant flow toward the collars. <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref> demonstrate how formation of the hydrodynamic gasket ensures an efficient encounter of particles with the collar and prevents particles from bypassing the collars in the absence of a physical gasket.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Simulated flow field inside the chamber.</title><p>The averaged velocity field is plotted along the <italic>xy</italic>-plane (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>yz</italic>-plane (<bold>B</bold>).

Increasing the vane width increases both the pumping and filtration rate, but the vane width has a larger effect on the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), likely due to the confinement and hydrodynamic interaction between the individual flagellum and its associated collar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nielsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asadzadeh et al., 2019b</xref>).

In contrast, short flagella that are confined inside the collars are almost as efficient as complete flagella in driving water through the collars but are not able to pump new water through the ostium into the chamber. These results demonstrate two separate contributions from the confined and unconfined part of the flagellum of calcareous sponges. This pumping mechanism is distinctly different from that of demosponges and glass sponges, both of which possess a tissue or mucus gasket, in which the confined part of the flagellum with vanes that span the full diameter of the fine-meshed collars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mah et al., 2014</xref>) is the pumping unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asadzadeh et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Averaged velocity field for two hypothetical cases: (<bold>A</bold>) only the unconfined part of the flagella exists, and (<bold>B</bold>) only the confined part of the flagella exists.</title><p>A comparison of the pumping and filtration rates provided in (<bold>C</bold>) demonstrate that unconfined flagella contribute substantially to the pumping rate into the chamber, but not through the collars.

In so doing, one should differentiate the basic pumping unit (pressure-generating unit) from the pressure-resistive parts of the system (the canal system). The basic pumping units are the simplest subdivision of the choanocyte chamber exposed to the same pressure difference resulting from the canal system. Hence, these units all work in parallel. For sponges lacking a physical gasket, the unit is one hole (ostium of zero length) with several neighboring choanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Therefore, there could well be sponges characterized as leuconoid types yet missing a physical gasket, or as syconoid types but with a physical gasket. The appearance, structure, and nature of the gasket would also depend on the hydrodynamics dictated by the canal system. Therefore, further research, using better preservation and imaging techniques, is required to elucidate the exact nature of the sealant element, and to investigate the role that hydrodynamics is playing in forming the seal in different sponges.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Hydrodynamic trade offs in the morphology of sponges</title><p>The open architecture of the syconoid pump dictates a delicate trade-off between the pumping rate and the retention efficiency. Although a wider and shorter ostium provides less resistance to flow hence higher pumping rate, the reduced pressure loss comes with a cost of a weaker backflow in the core of the region and thus a weaker hydrodynamic gasket located further into the chamber and above the collar tips. Under such circumstances, a larger fraction of the flow bypasses the collars and the retention efficiency drops. Lower retention efficiency of the calcareous sponge <italic>Pericharax heteroraphis</italic> as compared to different species of demposponges has been previously ascribed to its wider ostia and large chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilkinson, 1978</xref>). In contrast, a narrow and long ostium with higher resistance to flow results in a reduced pumping rate but an increased retention efficiency as the hydrodynamic gasket is located below the tip of the collars and the stronger backflow is more efficient in preventing flow from bypassing the collar filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The dependency of the pumping rate into the chamber on the length of the collar suggests another trade-off: choanocytes with shorter collars and a longer unconfined part of the flagellum can pump more water into the chamber, but this comes at the cost of more flow bypassing the collar, and vice versa. As a result, regions of the chamber having shorter collars will be less efficient in filtering the inhalant flow. This effect may explain the presence of pseudopodial extensions extending from the cell surface in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leys and Eerkes-Medrano, 2006</xref>). The pseudopodia, which are on average twice as long as the collars, have been observed to reach beyond the collar and seem to be involved in particle capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leys and Eerkes-Medrano, 2006</xref>), potentially compensating for the decreased filtration efficiency of the collars.</p><p>On individual collars, the spacing between adjacent microvilli appears wider at the base but becomes smaller toward the tip of the collar where the microvilli tips are occasionally fused together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leys and Eerkes-Medrano, 2006</xref>). To study the effect of non-uniform porosity along the collars on the performance of the sponge pump, we consider cases where the spacing between microvilli decreases from the base to the tip of the collar. We find that more widely spaced (higher porosity) microvilli on collars enhance the filtration rate with a minimal effect on the pumping rate into the chamber (compare the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>).

Although the presence of sealing elements is crucial for the functionality of the high-pressure leucon sponge pump, the open architecture of the ascon and sycon type pumps is as efficient at particle capture without these structures. Taken in this light, our findings have implications for interpreting the first poriferan body plans. Neoproterozoic oceans were food and oxygen poor, with smaller bodied animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sperling and Stockey, 2018</xref>). In a Neoproterozoic ocean, competition with colonial flagellates could have favored a filter-feeder that captured larger particles without clogging, as is the case in ascon and sycon forms. With the Cambrian explosion came additional food sources providing the energy to enable specialization of the pump and filter to capture food in a range of habitats. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of sealing elements around the sponge collar is directly related to the hydrodynamics of operating conditions associated with the body architecture, and comes with delicate trade-offs between the sponge pumping rate and retention of particles. These analyses support the view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manuel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavalier-Smith, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nielsen, 2019</xref>) that the sponge aquiferous system evolved from an open-type ascon-like filtration system, and the idea that the first metazoans were filter feeders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Numerical simulations</title><p>We use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to solve the governing Navier-Stokes equations of the flow inside the computational domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

When the cilia beating is completely out of phase, the tangential forces of neighboring cilia cancel each other and no flow is created. In contrast, the array of flagella that lines the inner walls of sponge chambers produces a flow that is moving perpendicular to the attachment surface (and through it). In addition, some flagella are located in proximity to the water sources (ostium) while others are more distanced. To investigate the relationships between flagella location, their synchronization, and the mechanical power produced we compare the base case in which all flagella are beating in phase to two cases where the beat of the flagella next to the ostium (eight proximal flagella) is not synchronized to that of the 16 distal flagella.

The improved pumping rate in the first case is ascribed to higher capability of the proximal flagella in pumping due to their proximity to the ostium (for the case of synchronized flagella beat they contribute 64% of the total pumping, despite being only a third of the flagella in the array).

Without the presence of the distal flagella, the system continues to pump, but the operation of the hydrodynamic gasket is impaired and water flow through the collars is dramatically reduced. The vacant space created by the absence of distal flagella, shifts the location of the back flow from above ostium toward the vacant space. Consequently, a significant part of the inflow bypasses the collars and leaves the domain without being filtered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7C</xref>). Considering the minor effect of synchronous flagella beat in reducing the power expenditure, the required imparted momentum of the distal flagella can potentially also be achieved with flagella having a different waveform, for example different wavelength, as long as the averaged upward flow velocity due the presence of the flagella is able to maintain the hydrodynamic gasket in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7D</xref>).

The feeding is performed by choanocytes, which comprise a pumping flagellum and a feeding collar that protrude from the wall of the feeding chambers, which has periodically arranged holes through which unfiltered fluid can enter when pulled by the flagellar action.</p><p>In this study, the mechanism is examined for the case of sponges that do not possess a &quot;gasket&quot; (canopy-structure) over these feeding collars. The key question that the authors examine is, then, &quot;how is the flow forced through the collars (allowing particle capture), when there is no gasket to stop it simply going straight to the centre of the chamber&quot;?</p><p>The answer given is that just as flow is pulled through the holes, a reverse flow (which arises from the condition that flow in the chamber is, at least locally, divergence free), forms above the hole, which creates a stagnation point that pushes the incoming fluid laterally out through the feeding collars.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) On the whole we found this to be a solid paper that addresses an important question by means of computational studies. Having said that, we are disappointed at the lack of physical interpretation given to the setup of the system and the results. In essence, the papers reads like an experimental study of the system with essentially no interpretation of the magnitudes of any of the physical quantities calculated, particularly in light of the fact that sponge hydrodynamics is not a commonly studied subject for the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors need to do a serious job of re-presentation of the results to establish the physical significance of various pressures (are these arising from Bernoulli-like pressure differences across the sponge body due to the external flow?), flow rates (say, by comparing them to Poiseuille flow), powers (comparing to the flagellar input power), etc. There is very little in the way of dimensional analysis to make the results intuitively clear. As such, the very many numerical values of physical quantities have no context.</p><p>2) From a fluid dynamics perspective, the fundamental result is fairly easy to see, and is simply a manifestation of local mass conservation (though of course retrodiction is of course much easier than prediction). The presentation would be greatly aided by a very simple schematic of the streamlines from two forces above a wall, either side of a hole, below a no-penetration (not no slip) boundary. We would have liked to have seen a reduced model of this kind involving stokeslets over a wall with a gap, which the authors should consider looking at, but this is not is a necessity for publication.</p><p>3) The description of the &quot;flagellar vane&quot; is a bit arcane. We are familiar with standard flagellae, and flagellae with mastigonemes, but have not come across this sort of ultrastructure before (is this a uniquely choanoflagellate/sponge structure). Reading other papers helped, but the manuscript needs a clearer description of these 3 types of flagellae, particularly when the image in Appendix 1—figure 1C seems to have ordinary flagellae.</p><p>4) An image of gasket-type vs. non gasket type would have helped our understanding of the motivation for the study earlier on. In general, we found that it was only possible to understand what was actually going on by the end of the paper, so it would be good to go through the Introduction once more to make sure it is as clear as possible to the more general reader.</p><p>5) The flagellum model (Equation 1) is not arclength preserving. Reading a previous paper it seems that the total change in arclength is only a few percent over a beat, however the velocities on the flagellum will also be subtly wrong, as material points will not be exhibiting the characteristic figure of eight motion. We have convinced ourselves that this doesn't affect the results too significantly (any error would be smaller than the error associated with taking very difficult experimental measurements), so we will not insist on a rerunning of the results, but it would not have been hard to make the waveform arclength preserving.</p><p>6) We are confused by the wedge geometry of Figure 2. If fluid leaves the computational domain &quot;vertically&quot; then how is there any net transport of fluid along the long axis of the ascon? Would not the flagella be strongly perturbed by the lateral flow?</p><p>7) No detail is given at all as to how the flagella beating is modelled in the CFD code. Are there regularized Stokeslets? Is slender body hydrodynamics used? Please clarify.</p><p>8) We strongly suggest the authors avoid the rainbow colourmap wherever possible, as it is not perceptually uniform (see https://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/) and is also generally bad for people who are colour blind.</p><p>9) The authors end up documenting a large number of individual differences between ascon and leucon sponges, but only study them in isolation – and only a subset of them. Compared to leucons, ascons have: (1) no physical gasket (2) shorter collars and (3) one large incurrent pore for 24 choanocytes (per choanocyte chamber), instead of many small pores (one per choanocyte.) Only the third difference is usually considered part of the definition of leuconoid vs. asconoid type, but the paper focuses almost entirely on the first and second differences. We recommend that the authors comment on the third parameter as well – if only by drawing a comparison with their earlier, published model.</p><p>10) Regarding the total difference of overall efficiency between the leuconoid and asconoid organizations, the discussion is a bit unclear. The authors state that &quot;Our results indicate that reduced resistance in the ascon and sycon-type aquiferous systems comes with reduced volume filtered for high retention efficiency.&quot; But the paper performs no explicit comparison of filtered volumes between sycon and leucons until the very end, and even then it concludes that these are actually not really different: &quot;Furthermore, both experimental and CFD estimates of flow rate per choanocyte [in sycons] are comparable to published estimates for leucon sponges that range from 17 to 236 <italic>µ</italic>m3 s<sup>-1</sup> for different species of demosponges and glass sponges (Larsen and Riisgård, 1994; Leys et al., 2011; Ludeman et al., 2017), suggesting similar pumping capacity despite different pumping mechanism.&quot; This contradicts the statement of the Introduction – even though the highest pumping capacity reported for a leuconoid sponge (236 <italic>µ</italic>m3 s<sup>-1</sup> per choanocyte) is higher than the one reported for syconoid sponges (48 <italic>µ</italic>m3 s<sup>-1</sup> per choanocyte) suggesting that the leucon organization has at least higher potential.</p><p>We think the authors should settle on one of their two interpretations, or alternatively state that both are valid alternatives. In particular, if leucons do not have higher filtration capacity, what advantage do they have over ascons and sycons (which additionally do not risk clogging, as the authors mention)? What is the specific niche of leuconoid sponges?</p><p>11) Figure 2 shows that all flagella within the chamber beat in the same plane (with all vanes parallel to each other), parallel to the long axis. Are there reasons to think this reflects biological reality or is it a simplification of the model?</p><p>12) Subsection “Pumping mechanism”: the vane width considered is in the 0.3-0.7 <italic>µ</italic>m range. How was this range of values decided? Is it close to real vanes of calcareous sponges? Why does it stay so far below the collar diameter (2.5 <italic>µ</italic>m)?</p><p>13) Some calcareous sponges have a leuconoid organization, yet lack a physical gasket. Can the authors comment on how they think these sponges work?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61012.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) On the whole we found this to be a solid paper that addresses an important question by means of computational studies.

We would have liked to have seen a reduced model of this kind involving stokeslets over a wall with a gap, which the authors should consider looking at, but this is not is a necessity for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewers that simple models would greatly aid the presentation, and we tried our best to make the CFD model as simple as possible, to the point that the key flow structures, both qualitatively and quantitatively, are preserved. However, as now explained in the new subsection “Pump characteristic curve”, we believe the CFD unit in Figure 2 is an integrated basic pumping unit of the asconoid and syconoid sponges, and further simplification would not explain the phenomena. For example, as suggested, we considered and modeled two stokeslets above a wall (at the height of <italic>h<sub>s</sub> </italic>= 4.7<italic>µ</italic>m, corresponding to the length of collar filters), either side of a hole (at horizontal distances of <italic>x<sub>i</sub> </italic>= ±<italic>iµ</italic>m), below a no-penetration boundary (at the height of <italic>h<sub>np</sub> </italic>= 42.5<italic>µ</italic>m, corresponding to the radius of the choanocyte chamber). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows the streamlines for two cases (<italic>x</italic><sub>5</sub> and <italic>x</italic><sub>10</sub>, corresponding to the horizontal location of flagella with respect to the hole). In the first case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), there will be no recirculation created above the hole. A weak circulation region is formed above the hole once the stokeslets are positioned far away from the hole (case <italic>x</italic><sub>10</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>); this recirculation shows elements of the hydrodynamic gasket: with downflow to a stagnation point (about 1-2<italic>µ</italic>m above the inlet) and radially directed outflow (the remaining flow may be ignored). It is noted that the pumping through the hole drops dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>) as the stokeslets are positioned away from the hole.</p><p>The real problem is more complex due to many forces distributed along the beating flagella (Figure 2); As shown, e.g., in Appendix 1—figure 7C, the presence of both proximal and distal flagella, and their collective imparted upward momentum is essential for efficient pumping of the inflow through the collars. Additionally, the flow field is markedly dependent on the presence of porous structure (collar filter) around force generating flagella (e.g. Figure 4).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Streamlines and pumping rate of two stokeslet above a wall (at the height of <italic>h<sub>s</sub> </italic>= 4.7<italic>µ</italic>m), either side of a hole, below a no-penetration boundary.</title><p>Note that due to the symmetry, the results are shown only in half of the plane.

We are familiar with standard flagellae, and flagellae with mastigonemes, but have not come across this sort of ultrastructure before (is this a uniquely choanoflagellate/sponge structure). Reading other papers helped, but the manuscript needs a clearer description of these 3 types of flagellae, particularly when the image in Appendix 1—figure 1C seems to have ordinary flagellae.</p></disp-quote><p>Flagella vanes are believed to be present in all sponges, and have been well illustrated in both demosponges and Hexactinellids.</p><p>A new paragraph has been added in the Introduction clarifying the differences between mastigonemes and vanes. Also a recently taken image is now been added in the appendix (Appendix 1—figure 2) visualizing the vane in calcareous sponge <italic>S. coactum</italic> for the first time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) An image of gasket-type vs. non gasket type would have helped our understanding of the motivation for the study earlier on. In general, we found that it was only possible to understand what was actually going on by the end of the paper, so it would be good to go through the Introduction once more to make sure it is as clear as possible to the more general reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and now explain the concept of gasket in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The flagellum model (Equation 1) is not arclength preserving. Reading a previous paper it seems that the total change in arclength is only a few percent over a beat, however the velocities on the flagellum will also be subtly wrong, as material points will not be exhibiting the characteristic figure of eight motion.</p><p>We have convinced ourselves that this doesn't affect the results too significantly (any error would be smaller than the error associated with taking very difficult experimental measurements), so we will not insist on a rerunning of the results, but it would not have been hard to make the waveform arclength preserving.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, indeed, in our model, the flagellum would be extensible and its length varies slightly during the beat cycle (ca. 2%), resulting in marginally wrong velocities on the flagellum. However, implementing Equation 1 in the numerical scheme is computationally cheaper than preserving the arclength. This is because the latter requires importing a table of motion data and interpolating the velocities of each point on the flagellum at each time step. To exemplify the insignificant error involved, we reran the simulation results for the base case with an inextensible flagellum that preserves the arc length. Appendix 1—figure 3 shows two snapshots of velocity field for an extensible vs. inextensible flagellum. Although the velocity of the flagellum slightly differ, the flow field in the domain is insignificantly affected with less than 4% difference in the pumping rate.</p><p>It has also been argued [3] that the extensible and inextensible sheets have the same swimming velocity (hence the same generated force) to leading order in <italic>ak</italic>, where <italic>a</italic> is the amplitude of the beat, and <italic>k</italic> the wavenumber.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) We are confused by the wedge geometry of Figure 2. If fluid leaves the computational domain &quot;vertically&quot; then how is there any net transport of fluid along the long axis of the ascon? Would not the flagella be strongly perturbed by the lateral flow?</p></disp-quote><p>Once fluid leaves the computational domain vertically into the core of the choanocyte chamber, it is directed axially toward one open end of the chamber (apopyle). To illustrate this, we model the flow in the cylindrical core of the chamber, closed at the right end and open through the apopyle at the other end. The flow enters the cylinder from the lateral surface and one end (velocity inlet boundary of 1<italic>µ</italic>ms<sup>−1</sup>, which is in the range of the mean velocity of flow leaving the wedge geometry of Figure 2), and exit from the other end (uniform pressure boundary). Appendix 2—figure 2 shows the velocity and pressure fields in a cross section oriented axially in the center of the domain. Lateral flow and shear close to sides (hence right above flagella tip) is relatively weak, and we assume that the flagella action is not strongly affected.</p><p>Furthermore, considering an extended computational domain including 5 pumping units (Appendix 2—figure 3), we illustrate that the boundary conditions applied on the wedge geometry is independent of the global boundary conditions of the entire chamber, hence from the directional axial flow in the core region (Appendix 2—figure 4 and Appendix 2—figure 2B).</p><p>Appendix 2—figure 2 is referred to in the subsection “Morphology of the flagellated chamber”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) No detail is given at all as to how the flagella beating is modelled in the CFD code. Are there regularized Stokeslets? Is slender body hydrodynamics used? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The numerical method is the finite volume discretization and solution of the Navier-Stokes equations does not involve singularities, as described in the Materials and methods. But we agree that more clarification is needed, specifically on how the flagella and corresponding computational cell motion is modeled.</p><p>More explanation has been added in the subsection “Morphology of the flagellated chamber” and in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) We strongly suggest the authors avoid the rainbow colourmap wherever possible, as it is not perceptually uniform (see https://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/) and is also generally bad for people who are colour blind.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important comment. We have changed all the colour maps from the rainbow to the Kelvin temperature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors end up documenting a large number of individual differences between ascon and leucon sponges, but only study them in isolation – and only a subset of them. Compared to leucons, ascons have: (1) no physical gasket (2) shorter collars and (3) one large incurrent pore for 24 choanocytes (per choanocyte chamber), instead of many small pores (one per choanocyte.) Only the third difference is usually considered part of the definition of leuconoid vs. asconoid type, but the paper focuses almost entirely on the first and second differences. We recommend that the authors comment on the third parameter as well – if only by drawing a comparison with their earlier, published model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that more clarification is needed regarding the difference between the two basic pumping units. To the best of our knowledge, even in leucons there are several (less than 10) choancytes per incurrent pore. The difference, though, is that, in leucons, the basic pumping units differ from those of ascons or sycons. The basic pumping units, are the simplest subdivision of choanocyte chamber exposed to the same pressure difference resulting from the canal system. Hence, these units all work in parallel. For sponges lacking a physical gasket, the unit is one ostium with several neighbouring choanocytes (Figure 2B). Presence of a physical gasket (leucons), however, leads to two zones of high and low pressure inside the chambers [5, 2], effectively exposing each individual choanocyte to the same pressure difference. Therefore, in leucons, the basic pumping unit is a further reduced subdivision of chamber including only one choanocyte, irrespective of the location of the choanocyte with respect to the ostium [2].</p><p>These differences are now clarified and highlighted in the new added subsection “Pump characteristic curve”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Regarding the total difference of overall efficiency between the leuconoid and asconoid organizations, the discussion is a bit unclear. The authors state that &quot;Our results indicate that reduced resistance in the ascon and sycon-type aquiferous systems comes with reduced volume filtered for high retention efficiency.&quot; But the paper performs no explicit comparison of filtered volumes between sycon and leucons until the very end, and even then it concludes that these are actually not really different: &quot;Furthermore, both experimental and CFD estimates of flow rate per choanocyte [in sycons] are comparable to published estimates for leucon sponges that range from 17 to 236 µm3 s<sup>-1</sup> for different species of demosponges and glass sponges (Larsen and Riisgård, 1994; Leys et al., 2011; Ludeman et al., 2017), suggesting similar pumping capacity despite different pumping mechanism.&quot; This contradicts the statement of the Introduction – even though the highest pumping capacity reported for a leuconoid sponge (236 µm3 s<sup>-1</sup> per choanocyte) is higher than the one reported for syconoid sponges (48 µm3 s<sup>-1</sup> per choanocyte) suggesting that the leucon organization has at least higher potential.</p><p>We think the authors should settle on one of their two interpretations, or alternatively state that both are valid alternatives. In particular, if leucons do not have higher filtration capacity, what advantage do they have over ascons and sycons (which additionally do not risk clogging, as the authors mention)? What is the specific niche of leuconoid sponges?</p></disp-quote><p>The latter statement referred to the pumping capacity of the choanocyte, but the first statement in the Introduction, to the pumping capacity of the whole sponge in ascons and sycons, which has fewer choanocytes (compared to leucons) due to the architecture of the chambers. Still, we agree that our comments on the filtration capacity do not seem coherent. The statement in the Introduction was removed to avoid any inconsistency in the interpretation.</p><p>The architecture of leuconid sponges allows the sponge to grow larger and have greater surface area. However, we think that the large surface area does take a lot of energy to maintain and so generally leucons thrive in food rich environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 2 shows that all flagella within the chamber beat in the same plane (with all vanes parallel to each other), parallel to the long axis. Are there reasons to think this reflects biological reality or is it a simplification of the model?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this is a simplification of the model. In the manuscript, we have illustrated that asynchronization among flagella does not matter, but this was done only for cases where all flagella beat in the same plane. Following the reviewers comments, we have also examined whether the pumping and average flow structure would be significantly affected, even if some flagella beat in a different plane. We considered the same computational domain as in Figure 2, where now every 2nd column of flagella beat in a perpendicular plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). The results show less than 3% difference in the pumping rate into the chamber as a result of not all flagella beating in the same plane.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Computational geometry where some flagella beat in a perpendicular plane.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61012-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The results for the new simulation case have been added to the subsection “Asynchronization among flagella”, and referred to in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Subsection “Pumping mechanism”: the vane width considered is in the 0.3-0.7 µm range. How was this range of values decided? Is it close to real vanes of calcareous sponges? Why does it stay so far below the collar diameter (2.5 µm)?</p></disp-quote><p>A base width of 0.7 <italic>µ</italic>m has been chosen based on an image showing the remnant of vane in calcareous ascon <italic>Leucosolenia eleanor</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, at the time of conducting the simulations, there was no data on the actual dimension of vane in calcareous sponges, despite their presence being reported [1, 4]. We initially present the result for a range of different vane width 0.3-0.7 <italic>µ</italic>m. However, we also consider cases where the vane width is 1.4 <italic>µ</italic>m on the unconfined part of flagellum, but 0.7 <italic>µ</italic>m on the confined part. Width of 0.7 <italic>µ</italic>m is technically the maximum width (on the confined part of the flagellum) which allows the flagellum motion without becoming in contact with the collar. Although some leucons have vanes that span the collar which leads to a high pressure ’positive displacement pump’ thanks to their physical gasket, vanes spanning the collar in sycons would not be important because of the different pumping mechanism (Figure 4).</p><p>Furthermore, a recently taken image has now been added as Appendix 1—figure 2 visualizing the vane in <italic>S. coactum</italic> indicating a vane width of ∼ 1<italic>µ</italic>m.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>SEM image of calcareous ascon <italic>Leucosolenia eleanor</italic> showing flagellum with remnants of about ∼ 0.7<italic>µ</italic>m wide vanes extending over the full flagellum length.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61012-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The range has been increased to 0.3-1.4 <italic>µ</italic>m, and Figure 3 has been updated, and as mentioned above, a new image visualising the vane has been added in Appendix 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Some calcareous sponges have a leuconoid organization, yet lack a physical gasket. Can the authors comment on how they think these sponges work?</p></disp-quote><p>Although sponges with a complex canal system appear to have a ’gasket-present’ pumping unit, a ’gasket-absent’ unit can still function efficiently if connected to a complex, yet open and less resistive canal system, or inefficiently if connected to an open canal system, but with highly resistive ostia. Therefore, there could well be sponges characterized as leuconoid types yet missing a physical gasket, or as syconoid types but with a physical gasket. The appearance, structure and nature of the gasket would also depend on the hydrodynamics dictated by the canal system. Therefore, further research, using better preservation and imaging techniques, is required to elucidate the exact nature of the sealant element, and to investigate the role that hydrodynamics is playing in forming the seal in different sponges. Recent observations of <italic>sycon coactum</italic> (Appendix 1—figure 2) have shown some mesh structures that could have a similar (gasket) effect of guiding flow to filters.</p><p>The above explanation has been added at the end of the subsection “Pump curve characteristic”.</p><p><bold>References:</bold></p><p>1) Bjorn A.
