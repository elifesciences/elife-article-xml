Cortical axons serve as communication cables between various types of neurons that are synaptically connected and, accordingly, arranged in multiple layers to receive, process, and convey neural information between different regions in the brain. Motor neurons located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord project their axons outside the central nervous system (CNS) and are responsible for the contraction of effector muscles in the periphery. Spinal axons are specialized to innervate and precisely control different types of muscle fibers, thus ensuring refined coordination of complex body movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stifani, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Mainly due to difficulties to experimentally access axonal conduction, axonal information processing has been neglected, and axons are classically seen as conductive cables that do nothing more than faithfully transmit APs in an all-or-none, ‘binary’ fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>). Later studies have challenged this view and suggested that axons have much more complex roles than traditionally thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcami and El Hady, 2019</xref>). Contrary to classical concepts, reports show that, besides conducting binary APs, hippocampal and cortical axons can also transmit analog currents in a passive fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alle and Geiger, 2008</xref>). It has been shown that analog currents integrate with ongoing axonal APs, changing their waveforms and, consequently, affecting synaptic transmission in a graded, ‘analog’ manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alle and Geiger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zbili and Debanne, 2019</xref>). Additionally, it was found that axons modulate the waveforms of APs contingent on neuronal activity and, accordingly, adjust the synaptic release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geiger and Jonas, 2000</xref>). Moreover, during high-frequency regimes of neuronal activity, axons are able to reduce their conduction velocities by more than 20% and, thereby, tune the timing of AP arrival at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that axons passively and actively process APs to tune the amount of information transmitted by synapses, but also imply that axons play a crucial role in the temporal coding of the neural information.</p><p>Morphological complexity of mammalian axons generally depends on their downstream targets’ spatial disposition. Thus, for example, cortical neurons form extensively branched axons to convey APs to numerous postsynaptic neurons located in different cortical layers and regions in the brain. Due to their small diameter of 0.08–0.4 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debanne, 2004</xref>) and absence of surrounding myelin sheaths, cortical axons provide relatively low conduction velocities of 0.1–2 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>), which are, nevertheless, sufficient to ensure rapid communication between closely spaced neurons. As opposed to cortical neurons, motor neurons transmit signals to distant targets outside the CNS and, for that purpose, develop considerably longer (up to 1 m), thicker (0.5–10 μm), and myelinated axons that provide considerably higher conduction velocities of up to 100 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saliani et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite being acknowledged as reliable conduction cables, axons can in certain cases fail to propagate APs faithfully. Such cases are referred to as conduction failures and are attributed to particular axonal morphology. For instance, experimental and theoretical studies suggest that conduction failures are likely to occur at axonal branching points and local swellings due to abruptly increased axon diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debanne, 2004</xref>). In addition, the AP propagation fidelity and temporal precision depend on axon diameter, biophysical properties of various types of ion channels, and thermodynamic noise inherent to their gating dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faisal and Laughlin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faisal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">White et al., 2000</xref>). According to theoretical studies, thin distal axons (diameter &lt;1 μm) are prone to ‘channel noise’, which can introduce variability in axonal AP waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neishabouri and Faisal, 2014</xref>), increase the jitter of AP propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faisal and Laughlin, 2007</xref>), and compromise the reliability of the conduction itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faisal and Laughlin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Skaugen and Walløe, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schneidman et al., 1998</xref>). Besides geometrical factors, neuronal activity can also affect AP conduction, which is consistent with our previous finding that high-frequency neuronal activity increases the jitter of AP propagation in cortical axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Ultrastructural aberrations and malfunctioning conduction in human axons are often early hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), abnormal protein aggregates cause local swellings in axons which have been shown to reduce conduction velocity and even block AP propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blazquez-Llorca et al., 2017</xref>). Human post-mortem studies suggest that axonal degeneration may be the earliest feature of Parkinson’s disease and, therefore, an appropriate target for early therapeutic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke and O’Malley, 2013</xref>). Motor neuron degeneration is the hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where axonal dysfunction begins long before symptom onset and motor neuron death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suzuki et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Comprehension of axon neurobiology in health and disease is generally limited by the technologies available to study axonal function and structure integrally. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique, complemented with fluorescence microscopy, is commonly used to correlate electrophysiological data with the morphological properties of the neuron. Namely, a patch-clamp pipette can inject fluorescent dyes directly into the neuron and, therefore, allow visualization of the axonal arbor during the electrophysiological experiment. However, patch-clamp is typically limited to recording APs from a single axonal site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alle and Geiger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forsythe, 1994</xref>) and does not allow for tracking AP propagation across axons. Moreover, the technique is invasive and destructive, which constrains the duration of a recording session to about an hour. Alternatively, fluorescent indicators sensitive to voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peterka et al., 2011</xref>) or calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grienberger and Konnerth, 2012</xref>) can be used to observe axonal AP propagation and, at the same time, to visualize axonal morphology. However, fluorescent indicators exhibit photobleaching and phototoxicity and may perturb the physiology of the cell to the point of affecting AP conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peterka et al., 2011</xref>). Complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-based high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs) have been designed to record extracellular APs from neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Müller et al., 2015</xref>) and allow tracking axonal signals across hundreds of microelectrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>). Thanks to a low-noise CMOS design, HD-MEAs enable detection of APs across entire arbors of cortical axons, including tiny axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>). HD-MEAs provide noninvasive access to axonal APs and impose no constraints on the duration of the recording sessions. Nevertheless, HD-MEA technology does not provide direct insights into axonal morphology. It has to be complemented with auxiliary optical techniques to allow correlation between axonal function and structure. Live-cell imaging techniques can be used to optically visualize axonal morphologies directly on HD-MEA surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullmann et al., 2019</xref>). These techniques, however, entail introduction of fluorescent reporters into the cell, which induces chemotoxicity, phototoxicity, and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Icha et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our objective was to enable the reconstruction of axonal morphologies based solely on extracellular APs recorded from in vitro mammalian neurons using the CMOS-based HD-MEA system. The present study reports a method for tracking AP propagation across tens-of-millimeter-long nonmyelinated axonal arbors of primary cortical and motor neurons cultured on HD-MEAs. The method allows for label-free electrical visualization of axonal conduction trajectories and, at the same time, provides noninvasive access to axonal APs waveforms recorded across hundreds of microelectrodes. Using the developed method, we investigated (I) morphological features of cortical and spinal axons, (II) fluctuations in AP amplitudes across axonal arbors, and (III) temporal dynamics of the axonal conduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We developed a method for the automatic reconstruction of axonal morphology based on extracellular APs recorded from cortical and motor neurons using the HD-MEA system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The cultures were grown in monolayers with estimated thicknesses of ~5–40 and ~5–50 μm for cortical and motor neuron cultures, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Both cortical and motor neuron cultures yielded cell densities of ~500–2000 neurons per mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The cultures matured in controlled conditions (see Methods), and their extracellular electrical activity was recorded between 12 and 24 days in vitro (DIV). Mature neurons grew their axonal arbors efficiently across sensing areas of the HD-MEA chips and provided a tight interface between axons and microelectrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). The relative proximity of axons to the sensing area varied across axonal arbors within ranges of ~1–13 and ~1–18 μm for cortical and motor neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The CMOS-based HD-MEA system enabled us to map extracellular APs across entire cultures and to electrically identify individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). Spontaneous neuronal activities were recorded across all microelectrodes for 2 min, and average amplitudes of the recorded voltage traces were used to produce network-wide activity maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Because extracellular APs with the largest amplitudes arise from the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakkum et al., 2019</xref>), local maxima found within these maps indicated the location of individual neurons in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We used spike-sorting algorithms to discern signals among individual neurons in the culture (see Methods).

Spike-sorting procedures enabled us to discern APs among individual neurons reliably and extract relative times of their activities (‘spike times’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jäckel et al., 2012</xref>).

Axonal electrical images were obtained by averaging 200 voltage traces per electrode. Time derivatives of averaged traces (μV/μs) were computed for each of the electrodes, and the resulting data were divided into 400 consecutive timeframes (with 50 μs inter-frame intervals). Adaptive thresholds were next applied at each timeframe to detect AP peaks at different time points during axonal propagation.</p><p>Our thresholding technique generally utilized a ‘greedy algorithm’ principle (see Discussion). The algorithm allowed for recurrent adaptations of the threshold based on parameters updated along the detection process. High-amplitude APs were mapped first, and parameters obtained from the mapped locations were used to tailor the detection of low-amplitude signals in the later steps. The thresholds were initially determined based on electrical noise observed from the HD-MEA chip. Electrical noise was estimated from voltage traces sampled across an entire array during periods when the observed neuron was inactive, and the noise was estimated for each neuron separately.</p><p>Adaptive thresholding involves three steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1 fig3video2 fig3video3">Figure 3—videos 1–3</xref>). In the first step, a simple planar threshold, set to 9 STD of the estimated noise, was used to detect high-amplitude signal peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). A high threshold level allowed us to detect AP peaks far above the background noise. However, axonal APs with lower amplitudes remained undetected, leaving gaps along axonal conduction trajectories. In the second step, confined thresholds, set to 2 STD of the estimated noise, were applied locally to detect low-amplitude AP peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>). The confined thresholds were positioned on spatial and temporal coordinates of previously mapped peaks. The thresholds were confined spatially to 50 μm radii and temporally to periods encompassing three consecutive timeframes (t<sub>previous</sub>, t<sub>current</sub>, t<sub>next</sub>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The spatiotemporal confinement enabled us to detect low-amplitude signals in close proximity to previously mapped peaks and to fill local gaps along the conduction trajectories. The third step utilized the same detection strategy but with differently tuned parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>). Namely, the threshold level was further lowered to 1 STD of the estimated noise, and the spatial confinement was broadened to a 100 μm radius. These parameters enabled the detection of low-amplitude APs near axon terminals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A moving object tracking technique enables reconstruction of axonal conduction trajectories</title><p>We developed an algorithm for tracking mapped axonal signals across consecutive timeframes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Direct interconnection revealed fragments of axonal conduction trajectories but failed to reconstruct axonal branching forks in most cases. Reconstructed fragments were used to calculate axonal conduction velocities. Obtained velocities served as criteria to tailor the tracking procedure in the next two steps. (II) Skeletonization-assisted interconnection – consecutive signal peaks that could not be interconnected directly, but were found within a 200 μm Euclidean range, were interconnected via skeletonized remnants of the axonal signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>). Signal amplitudes extracted from the corresponding electrical images were averaged over two consecutive timeframes (Δt=100 μs) and mapped over interconnection areas. Obtained maps were next skeletonized to infer propagation trajectory between the consecutive signal peaks. Conduction velocities estimated in the previous step were used as criteria for the selection of optimal propagation trajectories. Trajectories whose velocities deviated from previously estimated values by more than 50% were discarded. Skeletonization-assisted interconnection enabled reconstruction of some, but not all, axonal branching forks. It was designed to predict axonal trajectories over consecutive (continuous) signal peaks but could not predict trajectories between discontinuous signal peaks. Axonal conduction velocities estimated from the reconstructed trajectories served as criteria to tailor the tracking procedure in the next step.

The method yields an axonal ‘functional morphology’, comprising multidimensional data derived from extracellular APs recorded during axonal conduction. Functional morphology contains information about axonal conduction trajectories mapped at high spatial and temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1 fig3video2 fig3video3">Figure 3—videos 1–3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1 fig4video2 fig4video3">Figure 4—videos 1–3</xref>).

The cultures matured within 2 weeks and exhibited spontaneous electrical activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). They efficiently adhered to HD-MEA surfaces and formed monolayers that varied in local thicknesses and cell densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Neurons developed complex axonal arbors and provided a tight interface between axons and microelectrodes. Because axons grew in a 3D manner, their distances from the HD-MEA surfaces varied locally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), but remained within the sensing range of the microelectrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Obien et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Spontaneous electrical activity enabled us to map individual neurons in the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) and expose the spatiotemporal distribution of APs recorded across their axonal arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">Figure 2—video 3</xref>). Mapping individual neurons was possible, thanks to high-amplitude APs recorded at their AISes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakkum et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). The AIS signals broadly surpass the background noise and hence could be easily detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>). Because they colocalized with the AIS, local maxima found within activity maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>) indicate proximal regions of individual neurons in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakkum et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). Owing to the high-density arrangement of recording microelectrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballini et al., 2014</xref>), spike-sorting enabled discerning mixed signals recorded from neighboring neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6B</xref>) and thereby extracting APs arising from individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6C</xref>). Averaging of extracted signals over all electrodes revealed the spatiotemporal distribution of a single neuron’s activity. Such signal representation was referred to as an ‘axonal electrical image’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">Figure 2—video 3</xref>) and it carries information about neuronal subcellular elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakkum et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the largest and the earliest signals in the footprint arise from the AIS, much smaller and fast propagating signals arise from axons, and slow back-propagating signals arise from the soma and proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakkum et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). Thanks to the low-noise CMOS design, the HD-MEA chip allows detection of AP propagation across large portions of entire axonal arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>). The soma and proximal dendrites provide minor contributions to the electrical image, typically masked by larger AIS signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakkum et al., 2019</xref>). Owing to their low-amplitude extracellular signals, distal dendrites do not seem to be detectable with the HD-MEA system used here.</p><p>Adaptive thresholding applied to axonal electrical images enabled us to map extracellular APs propagating across axonal arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1 fig3video2 fig3video3">Figure 3—videos 1–3</xref>). Signal peaks were traced at high spatial and temporal resolution, thanks to the dense arrangement of the electrodes and high-frequency sampling rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballini et al., 2014</xref>). The thresholding scheme was constructed to detect signals with various amplitudes while minimizing detection errors. Simple planar thresholds, set to 9 STD of the background noise, were used to detect high-amplitude signal peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). Since these thresholds provided detection high above the level of the background noise, they could be applied across an entire array while yielding no detection errors. They, however, failed to detect low-amplitude signal peaks and only provided fragmentary detection. Instead, spatiotemporal confinement of low-level thresholds, contingent on coordinates of high-amplitude peaks, enabled the mapping of low-amplitude signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>). This was possible, thanks to the very nature of axonal conduction, which can be represented using a simplified Markov chain model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gagniuc, 2017</xref>). Namely, because signal propagation in unmyelinated axons is continuous, it represents a cascade of successive events in which the probability of each event depends solely on the state attained in the preceding event. Therefore, there was a high probability of detecting signal peaks in the immediate spatiotemporal proximity of previously mapped peaks. While confining the reach of the thresholds to local areas minimized the influence of the background noise, temporal confinement to preceding and following timeframes excluded signals that occurred much earlier and later than the reference peak.</p><p>Further relaxation of the threshold confinements enhanced the detection of low-amplitude signals but inevitably increased the risk of detection errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>). In principle, our adaptive thresholding scheme followed a greedy algorithm paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cormen et al., 2022</xref>), and as such, it is vulnerable to detection errors. Generally, a greedy algorithm builds up a global solution stepwise by making the locally optimal choice at each step. However, erroneous solutions made at earlier steps can proliferate and thereby compromise the global solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gutin et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, carefully tuned thresholding parameters are key to the optimal detection of signal peaks.</p><p>The approach of multiple-moving object tracking enabled us to reconstruct axonal conduction trajectories through iterative associations of the mapped signal peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1 fig4video2 fig4video3">Figure 4—videos 1–3</xref>). The tracking algorithm was designed to estimate inter-frame correspondences between the mapped peaks in a data-driven fashion. It operates within predefined spatiotemporal boundaries, but also directly learns data association criteria from sequences reconstructed along the tracking process. Thanks to strict boundaries, the algorithm discarded trajectories yielding conduction velocities that are unlikely for mammalian axons. While such boundaries ensure the exclusion of slow-propagating dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakkum et al., 2019</xref>), they could also omit super-fast saltatory conduction inherent to myelinated axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debanne, 2004</xref>), which were most likely not present in our preparations. Owing to the data-driven refinement of the association criteria, the algorithm allowed customization of the tracking process for a specific neuron. Such customization provides applicability of the algorithm to axons with different conduction velocities, allowing observation of variations between neurons of the same or different types.</p><p>Considering the Markov model of axonal conduction, AP peaks mapped in immediate spatiotemporal proximities can be associated directly using a greedy nearest neighbor matching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). Due to the limited reach of the matching caliper, direct interconnection enabled only reconstruction of short fragments of the axonal conduction trajectory. Reconstructed fragments, in return, enabled estimation of the conduction velocity and thereby refining the association criteria. Because conduction velocities vary across a single axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>), greedy matching was limited to peaks mapped closely over sections of the trajectory with relatively constant conduction velocities. Relaxation of the association criteria could potentially extend the reach of the matching. However, it would inevitably introduce erroneous interconnections between spatially segregated peaks stretched over notably faster sections of the trajectory.</p><p>Skeletonization of an axonal electrical image enabled reproduction of conduction paths between distant peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>). Because skeletal remnants reflect the spatiotemporal landscape of the axonal signals, they can optimize the association of mapped peaks graphically, thus sidestepping complex heuristic techniques needed for maintaining computational tractability. In general, topology and structural complexity of skeletal remnants depend on spatiotemporal boundaries within which the axonal signals were skeletonized. Narrow boundaries encompassing two consecutive timeframes captured brief sequences of the axonal conduction and yielded skeletal remnants with fairly simple structure. Simple remnants enabled interconnection of the peaks across consecutive timeframes, however, discontinuous peaks remained beyond their reach.</p><p>Skeletonization within wider spatiotemporal boundaries allowed interconnecting peaks across discontinuous timeframes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>), but yielded more complex remnants, especially in regions where axons branched or intertwined. Complex remnants provided multiple possible solutions for the peak associations, thus aggravating the selection of an optimal conduction path between corresponding peaks. By restricting the skeletonization to three consecutive timeframes and using the refined association criteria, we could select the optimal path in most cases. However, further widening of the skeletonization boundaries increased the number of possible solutions exponentially and inevitably led to a deterioration of tracking performance.</p><p>The Bayes optimal template-matching technique was used to validate the algorithm for signal peak detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We chose this technique because it has previously been demonstrated to provide reliable detection of extracellular APs recorded using the HD-MEA system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>). It enables the detection of axonal APs within single recording trials and microsecond differences in axonal propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franke et al., 2015</xref>). Bayes optimal template-matching is sensitive enough to discriminate low-amplitude APs from the background noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>), and thus can be used to validate our algorithm.</p><p>Stimulation-triggered axonal activities allowed us to trace axonal conduction trajectories accurately and thus provided the ground truth for validation of our tracking algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1 fig6video2">Figure 6—videos 1 and 2</xref>). We have previously shown that both spontaneous and stimulation-triggered neuronal activities recorded by HD-MEAs can be used to outline axonal conduction trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, we demonstrated a congruence between the reconstructed trajectories and actual axonal morphology revealed optically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previous research on HD-MEA systems provided methods for the electrical imaging of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>) but did not provide algorithms for the reconstruction of axonal morphology. Therefore, optical imaging of axonal morphology or manual tracking of AP propagation was necessary to assign the recorded signals to their respective axonal locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). Recent studies have proposed algorithms for deducing axonal arbors and propagation velocity based on extracellular APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buccino et al., 2022</xref>). However, these algorithms have solely been validated on simulated morphologies, and no experimental validation has been done to assess their performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buccino et al., 2022</xref>). The present algorithm enables precise reconstruction of axonal electrical morphology and has been validated on experimental data obtained from cortical and motor neurons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The algorithm’s performances were investigated, and optimal parameters for accurate reconstruction were identified. The algorithm’s adaptive functionality enables it to adjust and optimize its parameters in a data-driven fashion, which allows for customizing the tracking process for a specific neuron.</p><p>We investigated functional morphologies of cortical and spinal axons and found significant differences between their structures, AP amplitudes, and conduction dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>), which potentially reflect biological hallmarks of different neuronal subtypes. Although comparable in overall length, cortical and spinal axons exhibited substantially different functional morphologies. Cortical axons had a more complex branching pattern than spinal axons, but spinal axons projected their terminals to much longer distances than cortical axons. The amplitude of APs recorded from spinal axons was higher than those recorded from cortical axons. However, when comparing signals recorded from the AIS, cortical neurons displayed significantly higher amplitude than motor neurons. Cortical neurons had shorter active timespans and more synchronized arrival times than motor neurons, while cortical axons had slower and more uniform conduction velocities than spinal axons.</p><p>The structural complexity of cortical axons was reflected in their extensive branching, followed by the abundance of the axon terminals that were projected locally and distally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>). Such morphological features of cortical axons can be attributed to their role in providing synaptic connectivity within local neuronal assemblies as well as across large neuronal networks, thus enabling higher-order operations performed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>). Spinal motor neurons, however, have evolved much simpler morphology to provide fundamentally different biological roles. Motor neurons innervate and precisely control muscles in the periphery outside the CNS and are, for that purpose, equipped with the longest known axons in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stifani, 2014</xref>). Our results obtained in in vitro conditions are consistent with such a notion. They indicate that spinal axons indeed have much simpler morphologies when compared to cortical axons, yet still retain relatively long total lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>). We found that spinal axons had moderately branched arbors, but projected their axon terminals at great distances, thus resembling morphological adaptations observed in vivo. Thanks to their extensively branched axons, cortical neurons enabled the delivery of APs to numerous axon terminals, surprisingly synchronously and within short timespans. On the contrary, spinal axons with less branches at their disposal required considerably more time to forward their APs to axon terminals in a less synchronized fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In this study, the assessment of the structural complexity of cortical and spinal axons relies entirely on their functional morphologies. It would be valuable for future studies to compare the morphological features obtained through electrical and optical imaging.</p><p>We found that extracellular APs recorded from proximal axons near the putative AIS exposed disproportionately larger amplitudes than signals obtained from other axonal parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8—video 1</xref>). It has been previously shown that the AIS is the dominant contributor to the neuron’s extracellular electrical landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakkum et al., 2019</xref>), which can be attributed to the high densities of voltage-gated ion channels expressed in the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kole et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lorincz and Nusser, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we found that APs obtained from proximal axons had significantly higher amplitudes in cortical than in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>). The relatively low AP amplitudes at the AIS in motor neurons could result from the potentially disrupted organization of the AIS in unmyelinated motor neurons. Such disruption pertains to altered distribution and combination of voltage-gated ion channels as well as incomplete segregation of the AIS, para-AIS, and juxtapara-AIS compartments inherent to myelinated spinal axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duflocq et al., 2011</xref>). The diameter, length, and positioning of the AIS in relation to recording electrodes may also substantially impact shaping the extracellular AP profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakkum et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumar et al., 2022</xref>), which in turn can influence the AP amplitude. We found that signals obtained from distal axons and axonal trees had significantly lower amplitudes in cortical than motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>). This difference could be explained by the fact that spinal axons have a considerably larger diameter than cortical axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saliani et al., 2017</xref>). As such, they engage a greater number of voltage-gated ion channels and create stronger transmembrane currents during an AP electrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stein and Pearson, 1971</xref>). However, a comprehensive modeling study that incorporates biophysical, structural, and spatial parameters is necessary to explain the observed differences in AP amplitudes between cortical and spinal axons. Large diameters of spinal axons could also explain their significantly faster conduction velocities compared to cortical axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). In general, axonal diameter and the presence of myelin sheaths are crucial factors that control conduction velocity in mammalian axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Waxman, 1980</xref>). On the one hand, conduction velocity of unmyelinated axons is proportional to the square root of the axon diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>). On the other hand, myelination provides a fundamentally different mechanism of AP propagation known as ‘saltatory’ conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huxley and Stämpeli, 1949</xref>). In this case, myelin sheaths spatially restrict the distribution of voltage-gated ion channels to nodes of Ranvier and thus impose discontinuous AP propagation up to 100-fold faster than propagation in unmyelinated axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saliani et al., 2017</xref>). The culture protocols used in this study do not support the formation of myelin sheaths around axons. Therefore, it is unlikely that complete myelination occurred in our cultures. Namely, the myelination of primary neurons in vitro requires either supplement that supports well-balanced development of both neurons and myelin-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pang et al., 2012</xref>) or, in the case of motor neurons, co-culture with a feeder layer of Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hyung et al., 2015</xref>). In both cases, the timely addition of specific neurotrophic factors is required to initiate the myelination program. The culture media used in this study were not specifically designed to support the growth of myelin-producing cells, and no myelination-promoting factors were included in the media. The protocols did not involve co-culturing motor neurons with Schwann cells that would provide myelination. Moreover, motor neurons were grown in a culture medium containing NT3, a neurotrophic factor known to significantly inhibit myelination in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, we did not detect any saltatory high-speed signal conduction in any recorded neurons, suggesting that myelin sheaths were not formed around the axons. We, however, cannot exclude potential cases where axons were partially myelinated. Moreover, incomplete myelinization or discontinuous distribution of voltage-gated ion channels could explain relatively large variances of conduction velocities in spinal axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).</p><p>Generally, standard deviations of the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> could result from morphological and biophysical differences between various neuronal subtypes that may have existed in our cultures. Thus, for example, developed cortical cultures comprise excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons which are known to differ in size and morphological complexities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Björklund et al., 2010</xref>). Even greater diversity of neuronal subtypes can be found among motor neurons, including alpha, beta, and gamma motor neurons that are structurally specialized to innervate different muscle fiber types in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stifani, 2014</xref>). However, another question is to what extent such specializations can be recapitulated in vitro and whether electrophysiological parameters observed in cultures allow for discriminating between neuronal subtypes.</p><p>The presented method for functional imaging of cortical and spinal axons provides direct insights into the biophysical properties of axonal conduction. It allows investigation of interdependences between axonal function and structure, noninvasively and over extended periods. Functional morphologies contain data obtained from large portions of axonal arbors and, as such, allow studying the fidelity of signal conduction in different axonal elements, including conduction failures at branching points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debanne, 2004</xref>) and signal attenuation in tiny axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faisal and Laughlin, 2007</xref>). They also allow the inspection of activity-dependent modulation of extracellular AP waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewandowska et al., 2016</xref>) and analysis of consequent changes in times at which modulated signals arrive at axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>). Owing to its noninvasive nature, the method enables the study of structural and functional changes in axons over long periods. Thus, for example, comparative analysis of functional morphologies obtained at different timepoints allows investigation of biophysical changes during axonal outgrowth and pathfinding – developmental processes that guide axons toward specific targets and enable wiring within neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Myers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uesaka et al., 2005</xref>). Complemented with techniques for electrical microstimulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), the method can be used to study activity-dependent axonal plasticity, including structural alteration such as the positional shift of the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumar et al., 2022</xref>) as well as functional adaptations that involve changes in axonal conduction velocities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>). Because the HD-MEA system allows observing electrical activities across entire neuronal networks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>), the method can serve as a complementary tool for studying the functional interplay between network dynamics and plastic adaptations in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuba et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the presented method is designed for specific tissue-on-a-chip platforms and may serve as an attractive tool for pharmacological and preclinical studies of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ronchi et al., 2021</xref>). The key potential of the method lies in its ability to gain multilevel knowledge of neuronal functionality, which may serve as a valuable asset in drug discovery and safety pharmacology. The method holds great potential for developing disease-specific bioassays, especially considering the advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell technology that allows for utilizing patient-derived neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sprague Dawley rat</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain Code: 400</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (Rattus <italic>norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cortical; Spinal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> –</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Primary</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Map2<break/>(Chicken Polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab5392</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-β-III tubulin<break/>(Rabbit Polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab18207</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-mCherry<break/>(Mouse Monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab125096</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Alexa Fluor 488<break/>(Goat Anti-Chicken Polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab150173</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Alexa Fluor 488<break/>(Donkey Anti-Rabbit Polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab150073</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Alexa Fluor 594<break/>(Goat Anti-Mouse Polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab150116</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1 IHC (:200)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAAV-hSyn-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasmid # 114472</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Human recombinant laminin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BioLamina</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LN211</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Spyking Circus</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yger et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Spyking Circus</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 1.0.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal use</title><p>All experimental protocols were approved by the Uppsala Animal Ethical Committee under animal license C97/15 and follow the guidelines of the Swedish Legislation on Animal Experimentation (Animal Welfare Act SFS 2009:303) and the European Communities Council Directive (2010/63/EU).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>HD-MEA and signal processing</title><p>A CMOS-based HD-MEA system (MaxWell Biosystems AG) was used for extracellular neuronal recording and stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Panayiota Poirazi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The editors and the reviewers find this to be a very interesting and compelling paper reporting a method for analyzing the features of action potential conduction in cortical and spinal neurons in vitro using high-density CMOS micro-electrode arrays. The authors provide compelling evidence of fine resolution in mapping functional connections between neurons via very fine axons. The advantage of the approach is that it provides a label-free electrical visualization of axon conduction trajectories as well as the ability to access the AP waveforms. The work may have broad use in neurobiology, bioengineering, stem cell biology as well as tissue engineering in functional characterization.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Incorporating the analysis of axonal morphologies obtained optically would be a valuable addition to our paper, providing a complementary perspective to our findings derived from electrical recordings. However, obtaining morphological features and metrics corresponding to those provided by functional morphology requires considerably more effort than expanding the repertoire of standard imaging modalities. Unfortunately, it is unfeasible for this study.</p><p>Specifically, functional morphologies reconstructed from electrophysiological signals provide metrics for total axonal length, lengths of inter-branching segments, and number and axial distances of axonal branching points and terminals. Extracting these features from optically obtained data requires labeling individual neurons in the culture and accurate reconstruction of their axonal arbors. Because standard immunostaining labels all axons in a culture, it does not allow for distinguishing between the axonal arbors of individual neurons. While transfecting cultures with plasmids encoding fluorescent reporters can provide sparse labeling of individual neurons (see Figure 2 —figure supplement 5 – left), the axons of labeled neurons still intersect extensively, presenting a challenge for accurate reconstruction of their axonal arbors. Reconstructed axonal morphologies shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 5 – right can be used to estimate the axonal distance from the HD-MEA surface accurately. However, these reconstructions are only partial, capturing fragments of axonal arbors, and are not precise enough to extract morphological features yielded by functional morphologies. Optical data from high-resolution epifluorescence or immunogold SEM imaging, capturing entire axonal arbors, could enable accurate reconstruction of axonal morphologies. However, it is unfeasible to gain access to the necessary specialized equipment and obtain this data within a reasonable timeframe. Finally, conducting comparative analyses between morphological features obtained through electrical and optical imaging is better done in an independent follow-up study.</p><p>In response to this comment, we edited the Discussion section on page 17 / lines 427-429 to clarify our standpoint.</p><p>“In this study, the assessment of the structural complexity of cortical and spinal axons relies entirely on their functional morphologies. It would be valuable for future studies to compare the morphological features obtained through electrical and optical imaging.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Summary: please conclude on the differences found in cortical and spinal axons.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we edited the Discussion section on page 16 / lines 406-412.</p><p>“Although comparable in overall length, cortical and spinal axons exhibited substantially different functional morphologies. Cortical axons had a more complex branching pattern than spinal axons, but spinal axons projected their terminals to much longer distances than cortical axons. The amplitude of APs recorded from spinal axons was higher than those recorded from cortical axons. However, when comparing signals recorded from the AIS, cortical neurons displayed significantly higher amplitude than motor neurons. Cortical neurons had shorter active timespans and more synchronized arrival times than motor neurons, while cortical axons had slower and more uniform conduction velocities than spinal axons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Highlight the performances of the present algorithm compared to previous studies by the Hierlemann lab (i.e., Bakkum et al., 2013, etc…).</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we edited the Discussion section on pages 15 and 16 / lines 394-403 and added citations 38 and 39 to contextualize the performances of the present algorithm with respect to previous relevant studies.</p><p>“Previous research on HD MEA systems provided methods for the electrical imaging of axons but did not provide algorithms for the reconstruction of axonal morphology. Therefore, optical imaging of axonal morphology or manual tracking of AP propagation was necessary to assign the recorded signals to their respective axonal locations. Recent studies have proposed algorithms for deducing axonal arbors and propagation velocity based on extracellular APs. However, these algorithms have solely been validated on simulated morphologies, and no experimental validation has been done to assess their performances. The present algorithm enables precise reconstruction of axonal electrical morphology and has been validated on experimental data obtained from cortical and motor neurons (see Figures 5 and 6). The algorithm's performances were investigated, and optimal parameters for accurate reconstruction were identified. The algorithm's adaptive functionality enables it to adjust and optimize its parameters in a data-driven fashion, which allows for customizing the tracking process for a specific neuron.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. What is the evidence for the lack of myelination in the cultured neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>The culture protocols used in this study do not support the growth of oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells needed for the formation of myelin sheaths. Additionally, we did not detect any saltatory high-speed signal conduction in any recorded neurons, suggesting that myelin sheaths were not formed around the axons. We, however, cannot exclude potential cases where axons were partially myelinated. As we have no further evidence to support or exclude this possibility, we cannot make any exclusive claims.</p><p>In response to this question, we edited the Discussion section on pages 17 and 18 / lines 452-463 and added citations 49-51 to clarify this point.</p><p>“The culture protocols used in this study do not support the formation of myelin sheaths around axons. Therefore, it is unlikely that complete myelination occurred in our cultures. Namely, the myelination of primary neurons in vitro requires supplements that support the well-balanced development of neurons and myelin-producing cells or, in the case of motor neurons, co-culture with a feeder layer of Schwann cells. In both cases, the timely addition of specific neurotrophic factors is required to initiate the myelination program. The culture media used in this study were not specifically designed to support the growth of myelin-producing cells, and no myelination-promoting factors were included in the media. The protocols did not involve co-culturing motor neurons with Schwann cells that would provide myelination. Moreover, motor neurons were grown in a culture medium containing NT3, a neurotrophic factor known to significantly inhibit myelination in vitro. Finally, we did not detect any saltatory high-speed signal conduction in any recorded neurons, suggesting that myelin sheaths were not formed around the axons. We, however, cannot exclude potential cases where axons were partially myelinated.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 8: what could be the explanation for the marked increase in spike amplitude in segment X of the spinal axon? A higher density of sodium channels? If this is the case, perhaps the authors could provide immunostaining of Nav channels or AnkB/G.</p></disp-quote><p>The lower AP amplitudes observed at the AIS in motor neurons may be attributed to the potential disruption in the organization of the AIS in unmyelinated motor neurons. This disruption could involve alterations in the distribution and combination of voltage-gated ion channels and incomplete segregation of the AIS, para-AIS, and juxtapara-AIS compartments typically found in myelinated spinal axons. The diameter, length, and positioning of the AIS in relation to recording electrodes may also substantially impact shaping the extracellular AP profile, which in turn can influence the AP amplitude. Therefore, not solely the local densities of voltage-gated ion channels can explain the lower AP amplitudes observed at the AIS in motor neurons. To accurately address this question, it would be necessary to conduct comprehensive modeling studies that consider all of these parameters, which was not possible within the scope of this study.</p><p>In response to this comment, we edited the Discussion section on page 17 / lines 438-440 and 444-445, and added citation 45 to clarify this point.</p><p>“The diameter, length, and positioning of the AIS in relation to recording electrodes may also have a substantial impact on shaping the extracellular AP profile, which in turn can influence the AP amplitude.”</p><p>“However, a comprehensive modeling study incorporating biophysical, structural, and spatial parameters is necessary to explain the observed differences in AP amplitudes between cortical and spinal axons.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
