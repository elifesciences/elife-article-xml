<italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic>. BU is commonly reported across rural regions of Central and West Africa but has been increasing dramatically in temperate southeast Australia around the major metropolitan city of Melbourne, with most disease transmission occurring in the summer months. Previous research has shown that Australian native possums are reservoirs of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> and that they shed the bacteria in their fecal material (excreta). Field surveys show that locales where possums harbor <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> overlap with human cases of BU, raising the possibility of using possum excreta surveys to predict the risk of disease occurrence in humans.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We thus established a highly structured 12 month possum excreta surveillance program across an area of 350 km<sup>2</sup> in the Mornington Peninsula area 70 km south of Melbourne, Australia. The primary objective of our study was to assess using statistical modeling if <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> surveillance of possum excreta provided useful information for predicting future human BU case locations.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Over two sampling campaigns in summer and winter, we collected 2,282 possum excreta specimens of which 11% were PCR positive for <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>-specific DNA. Using the spatial scanning statistical tool <italic>SaTScan</italic>, we observed non-random, co-correlated clustering of both <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> positive possum excreta and human BU cases. We next trained a statistical model with the Mornington Peninsula excreta survey data to predict the future likelihood of human BU cases occurring in the region. By observing where human BU cases subsequently occurred, we show that the excreta model performance was superior to a null model trained using the previous year’s human BU case incidence data (AUC 0.66 vs 0.55). We then used data unseen by the excreta-informed model from a new survey of 661 possum excreta specimens in Geelong, a geographically separate BU endemic area to the southwest of Melbourne, to prospectively predict the location of human BU cases in that region. As for the Mornington Peninsula, the excreta-based BU prediction model outperformed the null model (AUC 0.75 vs 0.50) and pinpointed specific locations in Geelong where interventions could be deployed to interrupt disease spread.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study highlights the <italic>One Health</italic> nature of BU by confirming a quantitative relationship between possum excreta shedding of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> and humans developing BU. The excreta survey-informed modeling we have described will be a powerful tool for the efficient targeting of public health responses to stop BU.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This research was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and the Victorian Government Department of Health (GNT1152807 and GNT1196396).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic></kwd><kwd>Buruli ulcer</kwd><kwd>One Health</kwd><kwd>infectious diseases</kwd><kwd>disease transmission</kwd><kwd>zoonosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1152807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stinear</surname><given-names>Timothy P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1196396</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stinear</surname><given-names>Timothy P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The systematic field testing of excreta from Australian native possums for the bacterial pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> can be used to build statistical models that predict the regions in southeast Australia where humans will subsequently get Buruli ulcer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>BU is an infection of subcutaneous tissues that can leave patients with disability and life-long deformity. The causative agent, <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> is a slow-growing environmental bacterium that can infect humans after introduction through skin micro-trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Portaels et al., 2009</xref>). While the exact environmental reservoir(s) and mode(s) of transmission of BU are unresolved, they do continue to be the subject of intense research. The disease has a highly focal geographical distribution and typically occurs around low-lying marshlands and riverine areas. BU occurs mostly in tropical and subtropical areas of West and Central Africa however smaller foci are recognized in South America, Southeast Asia, and Australasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Röltgen and Pluschke, 2019</xref>). In Australia, although small disease foci have been described in coastal regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory, the majority of the disease burden is found in the temperate state of Victoria, where several outbreaks have been recorded over the past three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In Victoria, it has been established that the median incubation period is 4.8 months with peak <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> transmission in humans occurring in late summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loftus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trubiano et al., 2013</xref>). Several cases of BU infections have also been reported in native wildlife and domestic mammal species including common ringtail (<italic>Pseudocheirus peregrinus</italic>), common brushtail (<italic>Trichosurus vulpecula</italic>), mountain brushtail possums (<italic>Trichosurus cunninghami</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O’Brien et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Portaels et al., 2001</xref>), koalas (<italic>Phascolarctos cinereus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Portaels et al., 2001</xref>), long footed potoroos (<italic>Potorous longipes</italic>), dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">O’Brien et al., 2011</xref>), cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elsner et al., 2008</xref>), horses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Zyl et al., 2010</xref>), and alpacas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Portaels et al., 2001</xref>). These naturally acquired BU infections in animals have occurred across the same geographical regions of Victoria where BU is known to be endemic for humans.</p><p>Several studies from Victoria suggest that BU is a zoonosis that first causes epizootic disease in the local native possum populations and then spills over to humans. Focused field surveys have revealed that possums excrete <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> DNA in their feces (excreta) in regions known to be endemic for humans while similar surveys outside endemic areas yielded negative results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carson et al., 2014</xref>). While <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> DNA could be detected at low levels in a variety of other environmental samples in these studies, by far the highest concentrations of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> were found in possum excreta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>). Subsequent capture and clinical assessment of free-ranging possums validated the findings of these excreta surveys by showing that subclinical <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> gut carriage in possums was common while a number of animals had laboratory-confirmed BU skin lesions and in some cases, advanced systemic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O’Brien et al., 2014</xref>). Notwithstanding the technical issues with culturing slow-growing <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> from complex microbial samples, a recent environmental survey identified 65% of IS<italic>2404</italic>-positive possum excreta were also positive by a 16S rRNA bacterial viability assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blasdell et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis have shown that <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> strains isolated from human and possum lesions are part of the same transmission cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>). These findings suggest that in Australia, BU is a One Health issue, with arboreal marsupial mammals representing an important environmental reservoir for <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>.</p><p>The present outbreak on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria is the largest on record in Australia, with over 2,200 laboratory-confirmed cases diagnosed since 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Department of Health. Victoria A, 2022a</xref>). Concurrent with the Mornington Peninsula outbreak, has been the emergence in 2019 of a significant cluster of BU in a suburb of the major regional city of Geelong near the Bellarine Peninsula. Regions of the Bellarine Peninsula became a BU focus beginning in the late 1990s. The unprecedented increase in human BU cases since 2010 and the rapid expansion of BU endemic areas in Victoria, including incursions to within 5 km of the Melbourne city centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Department of Health. Victoria A, 2022b</xref>) have highlighted how new strategies to control transmission are urgently required. An effective BU prevention and control program requires up-to-date information on the distribution of the disease and its incidence. However, the use of traditional epidemiological surveillance methods to track the emergence and movement of BU disease foci is severely limited by the long 5 month incubation period of the disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loftus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trubiano et al., 2013</xref>), which complicates attributing disease acquisition to a particular event or location. Surveillance programs for a number of zoonotic pathogens like <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, West Nile virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamer et al., 2012</xref>), and Rabies virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Childs et al., 2007</xref>) are increasingly exploring the use of wildlife sentinels to monitor disease emergence and spread. Thus here, we explore the use of systematic screening surveys of possum excreta as an early warning surveillance system to monitor BU emergence in the Mornington Peninsula and Geelong region of Victoria. We show how the detection of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> DNA in possum excreta was associated with the outbreak of BU disease in humans and we use statistical modeling to explore the potential of this approach as a public health tool to predict future BU emergence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study site</title><p>The Mornington Peninsula is located 70 km south of Melbourne’s city center and occupies a 750 km<sup>2</sup> area that separates Port Phillip Bay from Western Port Bay. The peninsula was one of the first areas in Victoria to be explored and settled by Europeans in the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century. Since then, much of the native vegetation of the peninsula was cleared under pressure from urban development although fragmented pockets of remnant wild habitat have been preserved in the Mornington Peninsula National Park and are located southwest of the peninsula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The study site overlaps with the western tip of the Mornington Peninsula and is characterized by calcareous sandy soils that support a dense coastal scrubland. As the western tip of the peninsula is primarily a local tourist hotspot known for its affluent coastal resorts, a large proportion of the houses in the region serve as temporary tourist accommodations. Many of the residential properties in the study area are spacious holiday homes, set in fenced gardens planted with shrubs and trees, which represent ideal possum habitats.</p><p>To the west of the Mornington Peninsula, and on the opposite side of the Port Phillip Bay, lies Geelong at the eastern end of Corio Bay and the left bank of the Barwon River, approximately 65 km southwest of Melbourne. Geelong has an estimated urban population of 201,924 (as of June 2018) and is the second-largest city in Victoria after Melbourne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2019b</xref>). Since 2019, BU has been considered endemic in the Geelong suburb of Belmont and surrounding areas, with local transmission suspected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Electronic data collection</title><p>Large-scale electronic data collection was organized using the ‘Build,’ ‘Collect,’ and ‘Aggregate’ tools of ‘Open Data Kit (ODK),’ an open-source suite of tools that were designed to build data collection platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartung et al., 2010</xref>). We used ODK Build to convert paper survey forms into an ODK-compatible ‘electronic form.’ The ODK Collect Android app was installed from the Google Play store onto five Android budget smartphones (hereafter referred to as survey phones). ODK Collect was then configured with the custom electronic form that contained all survey questions. During sampling, surveyors worked their way through the prompts of the form and answered a wide range of question-and-answer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The survey phones automatically sent finalized submissions over mobile data to an <italic>ODK Aggregate</italic> instance that was running in the cloud. Our instance of <italic>ODK Aggregate</italic> was hosted on the ‘Google Cloud Platform’ cloud provider. All data collected by the survey phones were stored and managed on this platform. <italic>ODK Aggregate</italic> also automatically published all new database entries to <italic>Google Sheets</italic>. We used a custom script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nenadic, 2021</xref>) to generate dynamic maps from collected data in this Google spreadsheet using the Google Maps API.

Samples were collected from the ground level along the fence line of residences on grassy strips and driveways along the road. To prevent re-sampling excreta from the same possum between adjacent points a sampling spacing interval of 200 m was chosen which reflects the typical home range (radius &lt;100 m) of these highly territorial animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carson et al., 2014</xref>). A 200 m grid pattern was laid out with the help of a custom-built battery-operated distance tracker that incorporated an Arduino microcontroller, and a GPS module, with an audio beep. When moving from sampling point A to sampling point B, the distance tracker would be reset at point A after which the device would measure 200 m as the crow flies and report decreasing distance to point B by increasing the beeper’s intermittent beeping rate. ODK Collect was used to capture the location of the new sampling point using the survey phone’s GPS (accuracy &lt;8 m) after which the surveyor’s name was recorded. Surveyors then used the app to log a time point when they started looking for possum excreta. The search was restricted to a 50 m radius around the sampling point and was terminated in case no excreta could be found after a pre-allotted time of 5 min. Surveyors logged another time point when they discovered the first fecal pellet. Fecal material (excreta) from each sampling location was stored in separate sterile re-sealable plastic zipper bags that had been pre-labeled with a barcode. If possible, up to three excreta samples were sampled and, in case more were available, the freshest most intact excreta were selected. ODK Collect was then used to take a picture of the sampling site and scan the barcode on the zipper bag, both using the survey phone’s camera. Following this, the collected excreta were used to distinguish and record the presumed species of possum based on distinctive morphological characteristics of the excreta from each species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Subsequently, completed forms were marked as finalized and uploaded to the cloud. In case no excreta material was found on a particular sampling location after 5 min, ODK Collect forked to the end of the survey where the form likewise was marked as finalized and submitted. A video was produced and uploaded to YouTube to illustrate the steps described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">ODK, 2022</xref>). Samples were transported at 4 °C to the laboratory where they were stored at –20 °C prior to further processing.</p><p>Several sampling missions were organized from December 19, 2018 to March 14, 2019 and are hereafter referred to as the ‘summer survey.’ Later, between May 28 and September 19, 2019, we attempted to revisit most of the locations we sampled during summer, a period that is hereafter referred to as the ‘winter survey.’ To facilitate the sampling effort during winter, the above-mentioned electronic distance trackers were reprogrammed with a predetermined grid of sampling points from the summer survey. Consequently, the trackers now helped surveyors relocate to the nearest sampling point using the same auditory cue system. During the winter survey, we also tried to determine the usefulness of surveying at a higher resolution by sampling along a 50 m grid pattern in three small regions. Apart from this, standardized ODK Collect-based roadside collection was performed identically. Another survey mission centered on the Geelong area was conducted in the early half of 2020 (January 16 through to the April 28, 2020) using the above mentioned surveying methodology with a 200 m grid.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DNA extraction, <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> IS<italic>2404</italic> real-time PCR</title><p>For samples collected from the Mornington Peninsula, microbial genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from possum excreta using the DNeasy PowerSoil HTP 96 Kit (Qiagen Cat# 12955–4) following the manufacturer’s protocols just prior to the addition of solution C4, whereupon DNA was subsequently purified from 200 μl of the lysate using the QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen extraction kit (Qiagen Cat# 937036) on the QIAsymphony automated platform.

Mesh blocks are relatively homogeneous statistical units and represent the smallest geographical unit for which publicly available census data are tabulated by the ABS.

The state-wide geometric dataset was then down sampled to a more manageable size (3,238 mesh blocks) for subsequent spatial statistical analysis by reducing it to the ABS level 2 Statistical Areas (SA2) that encompasses the Mornington Peninsula (Point Nepean and Rosebud – McCrae). A second geographical dataset was prepared for the Geelong area by selecting the SA2 areas for that region (Belmont, Corio - Norlane, Geelong, Geelong West - Hamlyn Heights, Grovedale, Highton, Newcomb - Moolap, Newtown, and North Geelong - Bell Park).

DH extracted the data used in this study from this database and then geocoded and de-identified it at an aggregated mesh block level.

We limited the maximum cluster size to 10% of the total population at risk (corresponding to 14,481 inhabitants) so that defined areas of risk would remain within a manageable size for targeted BU prevention campaigns with limited resources. Under the null hypothesis, BU cases are homogeneously distributed over the Peninsula.

Specifically, cases were included if the exposure interval overlapped with the date that excreta were collected. As was stated for the abovementioned analyses, an exposure interval based upon the IQR which covered the central 50% of observations (101–171 days) was used. This approach is expected to provide a reliable estimate of the typical incubation period. To assess the full spectrum of incubation periods observed in Victoria, including outliers and extreme values, we also conducted the same analysis using the range of observed incubation periods (61–277 days). This allowed us to examine the potential impact of atypical cases on our results. Here the model was fitted separately for the summer and winter seasons with the objective to predict if a given mesh block will contain one or more human BU cases. The metric used to evaluate predictive performance was the area-under-the-curve (AUC) which is the degree of separability that describes how capable a model is at classifying mesh blocks where cases occur and those where cases don’t occur. AUC values range from 0 to 1, with an AUC of 1 indicating a perfect record of classification while a value of 0.5 depicts a model that has no classification capacity.

That is, the probability of observing a BU case in each location is greater if nearby excreta are MU-positive. One approach to modeling the risk to humans would be to construct a geostatistical model of the prevalence of MU in excreta, i.e., a spatially continuous estimate of excreta positivity for all areas using e.g., model-based geostatistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diggle and Ribeiro, 2007</xref>). However, to use such a complex model for the prediction of human cases to guide interventions would require a re-estimation of the model and its many location-specific random-effect parameters after every trapping round. This would be burdensome and limit the application of the model in a public health setting. Instead, we construct a simpler model with two parameters that calculates the local prevalence around a focal location (e.g. the centroid of a small district) as the weighted mean of the excreta positivity in all samples, with those weights decaying with increasing distance from the focal location.

Targeting of the top 20% of total mesh blocks for these two regions represents a substantial reduction in the overall number of mesh blocks at 368/1,840 and 365/1,827 for the Mornington Peninsula and Geelong models, respectively. Given the tradeoff between narrowing the geographic search area and maintaining sufficient sensitivity to detect mesh blocks where cases might occur, we found that the selection of the top 20% of excreta-informed model probability-ranked mesh blocks was a good compromise. The geographical distribution of the top 20% of probability-ranked mesh blocks obtained with the excreta-informed models also had obvious spatial clustering compared with the null models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). The non-random mesh block probability density of the excreta-informed models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>) suggests these data can be used to inform rational, targeted, and thus more cost-effective deployment of any interventions compared with reliance on human case data alone.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Geographical distribution of the top 20% of probability-ranked mesh blocks for all excreta-informed and null models.</title><p>Black indicates mesh blocks in the top 20% of probability-ranked results while grey indicates mesh blocks in the bottom 80%.

However, this approach had an overall lower predictive capacity compared to the model based on the IQR of incubation periods (101–171 days). We observed a decrease in model AUC and the proportion of case-containing mesh blocks using the wider exposure period, indicating that the IQR is likely a more accurate estimation of the incubation period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The rapid expansion of BU endemic areas in southeastern Australia has highlighted the need for new strategies to understand and control disease spread. The long and variable incubation period of BU in humans has challenged traditional epidemiological surveillance approaches in tracking the emergence and movement of BU disease foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loftus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trubiano et al., 2013</xref>). Building on the findings of other zoonotic pathogen surveillance programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Childs et al., 2007</xref>), here, we continued to explore the potential role of arboreal marsupial mammals as wildlife sentinels to monitor BU emergence and spread and to help understand the role of these animals in the transmission of BU. Our primary goal was to determine whether <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> surveillance of possum excreta could act as an early warning system capable of predicting future human BU case locations. As a first task, we established a possum excreta surveillance program that monitored <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> in the environment of the Mornington Peninsula. This allowed us to determine the extent of epizootic activity during consecutive summer and winter seasons.</p><p>We identified a significant spatial correlation between clusters of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> positive possum excreta and clusters of confirmed human BU cases likely infected with <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> in the same region during an exposure interval that aligned with the excreta possum surveys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). While the overlap between the two cluster types was not perfect, it is important to highlight that the <italic>SaTScan</italic> clusters detected represent the general area of a cluster and the circles are only approximate boundaries. Importantly however, the patterns and overlap we observed aligned with previous assessments of the positive association between <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> in possums and human BU cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blasdell et al., 2022</xref>) and thus very strongly implicate Australian native possums as key environmental reservoirs of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, involved in a transmission cycle with humans. Of note too, the frequency of excreta positivity for <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> we observed (13.6% for common ringtail possums) was similar to an earlier, smaller survey from the Mornington Peninsula (9.3%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>). The difference in the seasonal distribution of IS<italic>2404</italic>-positive possum excreta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) point to the importance of conducting these excreta surveys during the warmer summer months when <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> transmission risk is highest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loftus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trubiano et al., 2013</xref>). This association between possums, humans, and BU flags this disease as a One Health issue. It also suggests that a surveillance program that monitors <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> DNA in possum excreta could alert public health authorities to increased human BU risks, which would allow prevention and control programs to be implemented before human BU cases occur.</p><p>To further explore the potential of possum excreta surveys to predict the risk of BU cases occurring in humans in particular areas, we built a custom statistical model and compared its performance to null models built from the previous year’s human BU case incidence. From a public health perspective, the null models can be considered as a conventional approach to determine where cases might appear in the future. The development of an excreta-informed model for the Mornington Peninsula data revealed that it had greater predictive capacity than the Mornington Peninsula null model, in that it could more accurately predict areas (mesh blocks) with cases than the null model. We extended the Mornington Peninsula excreta-informed model to make predictions upon a previously unseen excreta survey dataset in the Geelong region. As for predictions made on the Mornington Peninsula, the predictions made with the Geelong excreta data had a greater ability to correctly predict human BU case-containing mesh blocks than was observed with a null model that used the previous year’s BU incidence.</p><p>This increased performance of the excreta-informed models might be explained by several factors. First, the long incubation period makes it difficult to establish both when and where a person may have been infected with <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, so the spatial information used by the null models will likely contain more ‘noise’ than the excreta-informed models. Possums, however, have a limited range, usually less than 100 m, and so their excreta is a spatially trustworthy analyte, providing a more accurate picture of pathogen distribution in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buultjens et al., 2017</xref>). Second, human BU cases are not detected in areas where possums do not harbor <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blasdell et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, possums are playing a substantially more contributive role than humans to <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> transmission cycles, helping to explain why the excreta-informed model outperforms human BU case, incidence-based models. The ability of the excreta-informed model trained with data from the Mornington Peninsula to predict human case occurrence in a distinct area (Geelong) strongly reinforces the link between possums harboring <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> and human BU cases across different geographic areas in southeast Australia.</p><p>The ranking evaluation of the predictive models is another strength of the modeling approach, as it reports the number of mesh blocks where cases potentially could have been prevented (or better managed) if these top-ranking mesh blocks were targeted by an effective public health intervention. We envisage a scenario in which such geographical risk assessments could form the basis of public health messaging programs that target areas where disease transmission is predicted as most likely to occur. In this way, for instance, frontline general practice clinicians could be advised of the elevated local <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> transmission risk, potentially leading to earlier patient diagnosis and improved clinical outcomes for the cases that do emerge. In addition, targeted messaging based on predictive modeling may also encourage preventative behaviors among local communities that could lessen the chances of transmission and reduce the number of emerging cases. For example, targeted messaging promoting behaviors that mitigate known BU risk factors (e.g. mosquito bites) or promote known protective behaviors (use of insect repellent) could reduce disease incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blasdell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Quek et al., 2007</xref>). Other interventions could reduce the abundance of potential vectors that might be transmitting <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> from possums to people, or perhaps seek to control the infection in possums with novel therapeutic interventions.</p><p>In addition to using the IQR of observed incubation periods to define the exposure period, we also investigated the effect on our model of the use of a wider window using the absolute range of observed incubation periods. While the absolute range of observed incubation periods provides a comprehensive understanding of the spread of incubation periods, we found that modeling based on the incubation period IQR provided better predictive capacity. This suggests that the IQR better captures the central tendency of the true incubation period, allowing for the building of better predictive models. Therefore, we recommend using the IQR as a summary measure of the incubation period when conducting future studies or developing models to predict the spatial distribution of BU cases. Other opportunities to refine and improve the model might be possible by improving the diagnostic yield from the possum excreta. It may be that only reporting excreta that has viable <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> would best inform our predictive risk models. The challenges of bacteriological culture for <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> from microbially complex specimens make this viability test impractical and the IS<italic>2404</italic> real-time PCR test gives no indication of bacterial viability. However, a recently described RNA-based <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> PCR test used for possum excreta might be an alternative assay for inferring <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blasdell et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Possum excreta fecal surveys are practical and cost-effective because excreta from Australian native possums in urban and semi-urban areas is highly abundant, easily recognized, and easily accessed. It is an ideal environmental analyte. Roadside collection of possum excreta and subsequent molecular screening is also relatively straightforward and processing epizootiological data does not require informed consent or access to medical records. Furthermore, as multiple years may elapse between the occurrences of BU in a particular region, continuous excreta surveillance might detect trends in the distribution and epidemiology of BU in a region and allow the effectiveness of any BU control measures; measures such as identifying and treating <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>-infected possum populations.</p><p>We explored the impact of sampling at a higher density (50 m intervals instead of 200 m) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The higher density sampling provided by 50 m intervals increased resolution for the fecal mapping, but it didn’t materially change the pattern of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> positive fecal samples detected at 200 m sampling grids. We propose that 200 m sampling grids provide a pragmatic balance between survey sensitivity and survey time/costs.</p><p>The streamlined workflow, the custom-built distance trackers, and the use of Android mobile phones equipped with an electronic data collection solution simplified the fieldwork to such an extent that new field workers could be trained within a day. Moreover, incorporating ODK in our workflow allowed us to organize our mobile excreta surveys in a cost-effective manner as the open-source software suite was hosted free of charge by a cloud provider. Furthermore, ODK Collect proved a powerful tool for ensuring high-quality data collection as it only uploaded completed submissions, as the app automatically validated survey responses at the point of data collection by using entry constraints, error checks, and form logic. This significantly reduced data errors and data loss which would be much more common in paper surveys at this scale.</p><p>In this study, we provide further evidence that BU in southeast Australia is a zoonotic infection involving Australian native possums in a transmission cycle. The means by which the pathogen is spread between possums and humans is under active investigation, but mosquitoes are likely vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lavender et al., 2011</xref>). We are also investigating the natural history of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> infection in possums, to better understand the apparent susceptibility of these animals to mycobacteria. The detection of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> DNA in possum excreta is associated with the occurrence of BU disease in humans and we have explored how these surveillance data can be used to predict future BU case emergence. A future surveillance program should collect, analyze, and interpret epidemiological, clinical, and epizootiological data on BU. Questions/issues to address about such a program include the breadth of areas to survey, frequency of specimen collection, and availability of the resources/trained personnel required to establish and maintain a program. Environmental surveillance should identify epizootics as quickly as possible so that steps can be taken to control disease spread. We have found possum excreta surveillance of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> DNA can identify the spread of BU epizootics and provide public health authorities with sufficient warning to implement control measures before human cases occur. Finally, whilst this environmental surveillance system will assist BU control in southwest Australia, it will not directly translate to other BU endemic areas of the world, particularly the high-burden regions of West Africa, where there are no possums, and an equivalent animal reservoir is yet to be found.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1. In this study, the detection of M. ulcerans DNA in environmental samples was performed by targeting IS2404 by qPCR, and a sample was considered positive if Ct&lt;40. However, it is usual to confirm the presence of M. ulcerans in the environment by the detection of 2 sequences (IS2404 and KR) and to consider a positive sample with an adequate deltaCt between the two sequences and Ct&lt;35 cycles. Furthermore, since the authors found a correlation between bacterial estimated load in faeces and human UB focus, it would be all the more judicious to fix an adequate threshold of environmental positivity in their model. It would have been even stronger. Can the authors comment?</p><p>2. line 592-593: authors can not claim this confirmation unless they have genotyped and compared human strains and environmental DNA.</p><p>3. In their model, the authors have used an assumed &quot;exposure window&quot; for when patients were infected with M. ulcerans in the Mornington Peninsula. Correctly defining, and assigning, this is absolutely critical to the accuracy of the statistical model, as is &quot;blinding&quot; of researchers assigning mesh boxes to patients to the results of surveillance data (and vice versa). These aspects are not fully clear in the current version. Furthermore, the effects on the model of changing these assumptions are not discussed.</p><p>4. Comparing the summer and winter surveys at the Mornington Peninsula, the distribution of M. ulcerans positive excreta appears to have changed quite substantially, especially given that the possums are reported to be highly territorial with a range of only 100m. This version of the manuscript does not formally compare these spatial distributions, only the averages. Such an analysis would help understand if it is the possums that are moving, whether the possums undergo 'waves' of carriage (or indeed any other explanation), or if these apparent differences are down to chance.</p><p>5. Line 75. &quot;Gut carriage&quot; of Mu by possums is assumed but has never been strictly proven. Successful culture of M. ulcerans from a possum or its excreta has yet to be achieved. While this is likely a technical limitation due to the bacteria's extremely slow doubling time, it should be transparently discussed for the benefit of the wider readership audience of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>6. Line 216. More information about how the clinical information was geocoded is required, especially where cases were non-resident. Does the clinical information include information on dates and locations of visits to the area? This isn't clear. Please also provide additional information about how the researchers were blinded to the clinical and surveillance data and at what point they were unblinded to each other's findings.</p><p>7. Line 221: Inferring from Figures S4 and S6, it appears that the exposure window is defined as the quoted IQR from ref [4] of 101-171 days. If this is correct, please state it clearly, and expand more on how these values were arrived at. Is it possible to test the effect on the statistical model if this window is adjusted? A window that increases the model's predictive power might be informative with regard to the (still open) question of the BU incubation period.</p><p>8. Line 226. Please confirm that for all patients, it is recorded/known that patients had visited the mesh box assigned to them in the geocode within the exposure period defined in Figure S4, and clearly explain how any instances of patients vising more than one mesh box (if this occurred) was handled in the model.</p><p>Editorial/presentation of data:</p><p><italic>eLife</italic> recommends a particular colour palette to be fully accessible (Colour Universal Design https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/). Several of the figures are quite hard to see even for a non-colourblind person, given the amount of information packed into them. Giving some thought to the best colour scheme would enhance the overall readability of the manuscript.Including some subheadings in the results would also enhance the overall readability.</p><p>Figure S1. Please indicate Belmont in panel E.</p><p>Figure S3. This legend is inadequate. It should be possible to understand what the figure shows without referring to the text. Presumably, it is the incidence of BU, but more details are needed, and this should be clearly described.</p><p>Line 354. Comment on how the positivity rate for Mu compares to other prior possum excreta surveys in the area.</p><p>Figure 1. Rather a lot of samples have a Ct above 37. Have the authors tested in the model how changes in the PCR cut-off impact the prediction ability? This legend is also inadequate, as it appears to be solely a title. Ct value is not DNA concentration. The statistical test is not mentioned, please include this and confirm that it can apply to log2 data. Genocopies per sample might be a better metric here.</p><p>Figures 2 and 3. Very hard to visualise the mesh blocks in this figure due to the similar colour of the background to the BU case scale (see my general comment above).</p><p>Figure S4 and S6 would sit better with the methodology, as it is highly relevant to the section lines 221-228.</p><p>Figure 5.

This would be a good place to briefly acknowledge the limitations of the PCR approach used.</p><p>Line 530. Good point to comment on differences in the spatial distribution in the summer and winter surveys.</p><p>Discussion point: Since the mosquito seems to be an important mechanical vector for transporting the Mu from possum excreta into humans, their role in this seems currently under-discussed. In particular, what is the range of a mosquito? Is this known? Could this influence the findings?</p><p>Discussion point: It is important to include a qualifying statement that the model developed is only applicable to Australia, since no link is currently known between animal excreta or mosquitos in other countries, particularly West Africa where the number of BU cases is highest.</p><p>Replace BU transmission with M. ulcerans transmission in the manuscript.

Can the authors comment?</p></disp-quote><p>Our threshold of Ct &lt;40 is based on the high performance of the IS<italic>2404</italic> Taqman assay: approx. 200 copies of IS<italic>2404</italic> are present in the <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> genome. As a result, the test is highly sensitive and can reliably detect 0.1 – 1 <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> genome equivalents (Ct range 39-40) (manuscript ref. 33). If the concern of reviewers is that the IS<italic>2404</italic> positivity of possum excreta may not reflect the presence of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, then we point to our previous research showing that DNA from IS<italic>2404</italic> positive possum excreta can be used for subsequent <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> PCR amplicon SNP typing (DOI: 10.1128/AEM.02612-17). We also highlight our use of randomly interspersed blank DNA extraction controls and no-template PCR controls in every batch of samples tested to guard against PCR contamination (lines 220-232). Regarding the use of IS<italic>2606</italic> and KR-B as confirmatory PCR targets, they are of limited value when <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> abundance is low, as they have reduced sensitivity compared to IS<italic>2404</italic>, so we did not routinely perform these additional tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. line 592-593: authors can not claim this confirmation unless they have genotyped and compared human strains and environmental DNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously shown using genomics that <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> infecting possums and humans share the same genotype, as we mention in the introduction (lines 99-100). Our current study further confirms that Buruli ulcer is a zoonosis, by showing a quantitative link between possums shedding <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> and the risk of humans developing Buruli ulcer. Nevertheless, we have qualified the sentence as follows:</p><p>“In this study, we provide further evidence that Buruli ulcer in southeast Australia is a zoonotic infection involving Australian native possums in a transmission cycle” (line 768).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

These aspects are not fully clear in the current version. Furthermore, the effects on the model of changing these assumptions are not discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The exposure window we use is based on very sound and comprehensive epidemiological data from two studies arriving at the same estimate of the incubation period (manuscript refs. 4,5). To address the reviewer concerns regarding impact of changing this window on model performance we re-ran the model using the absolute range of observed incubation periods (61-277 days). Model performance was slightly worse using the extended range compared to the IQR (101-171 days). We have included this additional analysis in the results. Refer Supplementary File 1 (results: line 649 onwards and discussion: line 730 onwards).</p><p>Regarding the important issue of blinding, the mesh block data was loaded into an R script as a numeric ID string and there was no researcher recognition of where the cases had occurred, as the mesh block IDs need a dedicated index to relate back to the geography. In this way, the mesh block data of where BuruIi ulcer cases occurred was only obvious once the results of the script were evaluated in the form of AUC metrics and subsequently plotted using QGIS software.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Taking the reviewer’s suggestion, we have explored this observation further in an additional supplemental figure (line 510, Figure S7). While this is an interesting observation, an in-depth assessment of seasonal carriage differences is beyond the scope and objectives of this current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

If this is correct, please state it clearly, and expand more on how these values were arrived at. Is it possible to test the effect on the statistical model if this window is adjusted? A window that increases the model's predictive power might be informative with regard to the (still open) question of the BU incubation period.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our reply to query 3 above.

Line 226. Please confirm that for all patients, it is recorded/known that patients had visited the mesh box assigned to them in the geocode within the exposure period defined in Figure S4, and clearly explain how any instances of patients vising more than one mesh box (if this occurred) was handled in the model.</p></disp-quote><p>The Health Protection Branch of the Victorian State Government Department of Health conducts telephone interviews with confirmed BU patients to investigate likely origin of acquisition as described previously (DOI: 10.33321/cdi.2020.44.93, DOI: 10.3201/eid2411.171593). This information is recorded in a central database. Using this data source, patients who were non-residents and with exposure to multiple Buruli ulcer endemic areas were excluded from this current study. However, there always remain some underlying uncertainties, as patient recollections of travel history can be varied, and we can usually never know exactly where someone acquired their infection, as we mention in the discussion (line 705 onwards).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Editorial/presentation of data:</p><p>eLife recommends a particular colour palette to be fully accessible (Colour Universal Design https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/).
