Growth in tissue sites involves the formation of distinct foci of replication, which can develop into either abscesses, granulomas, or poorly defined clusters of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pagán and Ramakrishnan, 2018</xref>). Extracellular bacterial pathogens, in particular, can establish a tissue niche and replicate to high numbers. These clusters of bacteria in tissues are often clonal, result in distinct microcolonies, and are surrounded by host innate immune cells.</p><p><italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb)</italic> is an enteric pathogen that replicates in the intestinal lumen and regional lymph nodes, with the potential for disseminating via a poorly characterized route into deep tissue sites such as the liver or spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes et al., 2006</xref>). Once colonized, <italic>Yptb</italic> establishes extracellular foci of replication, resulting in the formation of microcolonies that develop into lesions that are densely populated by immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Simonet et al., 1990</xref>). Within the murine spleen, the bacterium sets up a beachhead in which distinct microcolonies are derived from a single seeding bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2015</xref>). Surrounding the bacterial microcolony, which contains between 50–5000 bacteria, are strata of immune cells. In direct contact with the population center are neutrophils, which have cytoskeletal elements that are paralyzed by the abutting bacteria that translocate Type III Secretion System (TTSS) effectors. As a consequence, phagocytosis of the pathogen by surrounding neutrophils is severely disrupted and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Songsungthong et al., 2010</xref>). The resulting neutrophil–bacterium interface appears to result in a stable relationship, in which frustrated phagocytes bind, but do not internalize the nearby bacteria. Surrounding this sphere of neutrophils are macrophages, monocytes, and other immune cells, which appear to be recruited as a response to failure to clear the focus of infection.</p><p>The recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages around a cluster of <italic>Yptb</italic> exposes the bacterial population to different microenvironments, depending on the locale within the microcolony occupied by individual bacteria. This drives the phenotypic specialization of different microbial regulatory subpopulations that counter the host attack. Peripheral bacteria that are in direct contact with neutrophils upregulate their T3SS to facilitate disruption of neutrophil function and allow a ring of ineffective immune cells to surround the infection site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2015</xref>). These bacteria are also part of a larger peripheral subpopulation of bacteria that neutralize nitric oxide (NO) gas being produced by the surrounding macrophages, resulting in upregulation of the NO-detoxifying protein, Hmp. The majority of the bacterial peripheral subpopulation that responds to NO is not in direct contact with any host cells, meaning that there is a specialized subpopulation that does not directly interface with host cells, but which responds to humoral anti-microbial factors. Importantly, this peripheral subpopulation participates in social behavior, as its ability to inactivate NO via the Hmp protein protects bacteria in the core of the microcolony from NO stress. In the absence of Hmp protein, the entire microcolony is exposed to NO attack, with the consequence that the microcolony eventually disintegrates and the bacteria are killed in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although live animal models provide valuable insight into the spatial organization of bacterial subpopulations and immune cells in tissue, analysis is currently limited to microscopy of fixed tissue, with little opportunity to study the dynamics of the infection process or perform genetic analysis. Tissue culture models rely on infection of cells within a monolayer, which fail to reproduce the architecture of bacterial microcolonies surrounded by immune cells in host tissue sites. There has been limited analysis of the dynamics of bacterial growth in tissue, investigation of the spatial relationship between immune cells and the bacteria, or identification of inter-bacterial communication within the growing microbial populations in tissues. To bridge the gap between animal infection models and tissue culture models, we developed a chemical strategy to incorporate the architecture of inflammatory sites in a tissue culture system.</p><p>In this report, we develop an in vitro system that uses droplet-based microfluidics to generate matrix-embedded <italic>Yptb</italic> microcolonies encompassed by host innate immune cells. Social behavior of <italic>Yptb</italic> could be reproduced in the presence of a chemical NO generator, indicating that production of RNI by host innate immune cells does not require directional targeting of the bacteria by these cells, but rather is a consequence of multi-cell collaboration to generate toxic amounts of RNI. We observed similar results using activated macrophages that express iNOS, mimicking social behavior in tissue. The strength of this approach is that this type of topological analysis of <italic>Yptb-</italic>host cell interaction is unattainable in murine and tissue culture models of infection, allowing for development of high throughput screens not accessible using current culture systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Droplet gels support clonal growth of <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> microcolonies</title><p><italic>Yptb</italic> microcolonies in the murine spleen are derived from single isolated bacteria that replicate as extracellular clusters and become surrounded by innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Simonet et al., 1990</xref>). In order to accurately model the growth of <italic>Yptb</italic> in deep tissue sites, a single bacterium needs to be isolated and grown into a microcolony in a matrix that supports this 3-dimensional (3D) topology. To encase single bacterial cells in matrix, we utilized droplet-based microfluidics, which is commonly used for isolating single mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Köster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mazutis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>Yptb</italic> was added to a matrix consisting of molten 1% ultra-low melt agarose containing 25% HyStem-C Hydrogel. HyStem-C Hydrogel has thiol-modified hyaluronan and gelatin, allowing on-demand polymerization of these two components controlled by the addition of a thiol-reactive crosslinker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The biomatrix was included in the droplet mixture to add components that allow multivalent adhesion sites for attachment of mammalian immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giancotti and Ruoslahti, 1999</xref>). The mixture was then placed in a syringe pump and under constant flow injected into a fabricated two-inlet microfluidics device, with oil introduced into the other inlet, allowing encapsulation of the bacteria in a droplet matrix surrounded by oil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; Materials and methods). At a final concentration of 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria/ml, the majority of droplets contained a single bacterium, as predicted by the Poisson distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mazutis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thibault et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, there were two groups of droplets that were collected in the output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The large droplets contained bacteria and were approximately 65 μm in diameter (~144 pl), while the small, satellite droplets were about 8 μm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). After droplet generation, HyStem-C Hydrogel was crosslinked within the agarose using Extralink, a thiol-reactive crosslinker, at room temperature and oil was removed from the droplets (Materials and methods). During oil removal, the population of small droplets was lost, and only the larger droplets remained.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Droplet gels support clonal growth of <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> was added to molten agarose/HyStem-C Hydrogel and introduced into a microfluidics device, allowing encapsulation within oil-coated droplets (Materials and methods).

NO has antimicrobial properties and can react with ROS to produce additional toxic reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI). The bacterial protein, Hmp, detoxifies NO by converting it to nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>) which is innocuous and can be used as an electron acceptor by the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Poole et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Poole and Hughes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robinson and Brynildsen, 2013</xref>).

The growth of the WT and <italic>∆hmp</italic> microcolonies was similar in the droplets in the absence of DETA-NONOate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>).

These pathogen-immune cell aggregates are intricate structures in which the pathogen interfaces with host cells, but also result in significant self and social interactions, making it difficult to reproduce in culture the entire set of events present in tissue. Although there is considerable research on infectious lesions caused by these pathogens, there are few informative culture models that reconstruct the pathogen-immune cell architecture occurring in tissues that preserve inter-microbial interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elkington et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fitzgerald et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fonseca et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guggenberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guirado et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We have addressed this gap in the field by reconstructing <italic>Yptb</italic> inflammatory sites using microfluidic technology to generate a 3D model that allows interbacterial interactions to be studied as well as action-at-a-distance by immune cells, with topology mimicking a tissue infection. <italic>Yptb</italic> is an intestinal pathogen that can establish extracellular foci in deep tissue sites after translocation across the intestine into either the bloodstream or regional lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes et al., 2006</xref>). In the course of establishing an infectious niche within the murine spleen, <italic>Yptb</italic> forms microcolonies tightly associated with recruitment of neutrophils that directly contact the cluster of bacteria, which are, in turn, encased by layers of more neutrophils followed by macrophages and monocytes that largely do not contact bacteria directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2015</xref>). The model system developed here closely mimics this topology. Droplets support the growth of <italic>Yptb</italic> microcolonies, and activated BMDMs localized at a similar distance to that observed in tissues drive a bacterial transcriptional response that recapitulates interactions observed in tissue.</p><p>Associated with the recruitment of immune cells to infection is the presence of iNOS<sup>+</sup> cells that are clearly activated to express iNOS and release NO. These cells do not directly contact the growing colony, so their ability to modulate microbial growth would appear to be linked to the production of soluble anti-microbial mediators. In concert with attack-from-a-distance, there is an outer shell of bacteria protecting the microcolony from RNI attack by producing the detoxifying Hmp protein that clearly responds to this stress without directly contacting iNOS<sup>+</sup> cells. To mimic clonal growth in the spleen and action at distance, our tissue culture system used microfluidics-generated droplets, which allowed us to maximize the capture of single bacteria within 65 μm agarose/HyStem-C Hydrogel droplets and allow adhesion of macrophages on the droplet surface. The bacteria appeared to tolerate being encompassed in this environment as evident by <italic>Yptb</italic> replication, allowing a reasonable facsimile of spleen-resident microcolonies. In addition to the cells analyzed here, neutrophils are present surrounding the cluster of <italic>Yptb</italic>, but only a few peripheral bacteria are in direct contact with these cells, with the consequence that they are largely inhibited by translocated TTSS effector proteins. Future work will involve modifying the system to allow the incorporation of neutrophils, so that the response of bacteria on the extreme periphery of the colony can be analyzed during this process. This will involve either embedding cells in the droplet matrix, or forcing controlled degradation of the matrix to allow close contact with the microcolony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guggenberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sakai et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>One of the surprising results from this study was that we could totally reproduce topologically driven regulation of the <italic>hmp</italic> promoter by incubating droplet-encased microcolonies in the presence of the NO generator DETA-NONOate. This indicates that production of RNI by iNOS<sup>+</sup> cells does not require directional targeting of the bacteria by these cells, but rather is a consequence of multi-cell collaboration to generate toxic amounts of RNI, with the concentrations determined by the total number of recruited iNOS<sup>+</sup> cells. By encompassing the infection site, the sum of the RNI produced by individual cells generates a sufficient amount of chemical to induce transcription of the reporter construct and kill bacterial mutants unable to produce Hmp.</p><p>To demonstrate that the addition of this chemical could reconstruct RNI signaling within the bacterial colony, we developed a script that could be used to quantify the accumulation of a fluorescence signal around the periphery of microcolonies relative to the constitutive GFP control. This strategy demonstrated that the use of DETA-NONOate was sufficient to generate a robust response on the periphery relative to a region internal to the colony that defined the area of lowest fluorescence intensity. While variation in copy number of the reporter plasmids could influence heterogeneity of fluorescence induction, previous work has shown that the <italic>hmp</italic> mutant strain rescued with <italic>hmp-mcherry</italic> integrated on the chromosome also results in spatial regulation of <italic>mcherry</italic> within the murine spleen indicating that copy number does not seem to play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2015</xref>). It also demonstrated that the gradient of <italic>Phmp</italic> expression depends on both iNOS<sup>+</sup> activity and overall activation of macrophages by LPS and IFNγ. Based on quantification of this ratio, we would argue that addition of BMDMs to the droplets generated somewhat lower amount of RNI than resulted from 1 mM DETA-NONOate (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8G</xref>). It would be difficult to directly compare these results to mouse tissue, as the nature of the samples and preservation technique differs greatly from the droplet analysis. It does argue that the amount of RNI generated by 1 mM DETA-NONOate is more than sufficient to explain the images generated from the mouse spleen.</p><p>One of the strengths of the synthetic droplet system is that we were able to disrupt the droplets to free the bacteria and analyze bacterial populations in bulk, a task that is often difficult to perform when isolating colonies from mammalian tissues. Once the colonies were disrupted, we demonstrated that individual cells can be subjected to flow cytometry analysis, allowing the response of spatially distinct population of bacteria to be analyzed. This approach should facilitate identifying additional macrophage secreted products that can penetrate microcolonies and control bacterial gene expression. There are a variety of small secretory molecule products of macrophages that have been identified, but the roles of these products in controlling bacterial growth or modulating gene expression of microorganisms is greatly understudied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nathan, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sugimoto et al., 2012</xref>). Presumably, transcriptional analysis of bacterial subpopulations will facilitate dissection of previously unappreciated bacterial responses to the host and potentially identify new host strategies for restricting microbial growth.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>All experiments used derivatives of the <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> strain IP2666 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balada-Llasat and Mecsas, 2006</xref>).

Periphery to point of lowest intensity (PLI) ratios were calculated by generating a mask representing the periphery of a defined width of the microcolony, and a mask representing the PLI of a defined radius. The periphery mask was generated by first thresholding the green channel using Otsu’s method and converting the resulting matrix into a binary matrix. The binary matrix was morphologically opened with a disk-shaped structuring element of radius two and then morphologically closed with a disk-shaped structuring element of radius four. Morphologic opening and closing eliminate dim artifacts and fuse the microcolony mask into a single region of interest (ROI). Any remaining holes within contiguous ROIs are filled. ROIs touching the edge of the field are removed, as are all but the largest ROI in the field. This ROI, covering the entire microcolony, is eroded with a disk-shaped structuring element of radius 12 and complemented. The initial mask and complemented eroded mask are combined to achieve a binary mask of the periphery of the object. The number of pixels and the total intensity in the resulting mask was recorded. The mask was applied to the raw image data in the red channel, and the total intensity was recorded. Total intensity of the red was normalized to the number of pixels to achieve an average intensity for the entire periphery. The average intensity of the red channel was normalized to the average intensity of the green channel. To calculate the PLI, the determined eroded mask was applied to the red channel to isolate the pixels belonging to the microcolony while excluding those that are part of the periphery. A Gaussian blur of sd = 2.0 was applied to reduce the effects of low-intensity noise introduced by the imaging process. The coordinates of the minimum value of this image were calculated, generating a binary matrix with value = 1 at the coordinates of the PLI and zero at all other points. This matrix was morphologically dilated with a structuring element of radius five to sample a region of lowest intensity rather than a single pixel. The number of pixels in this resulting mask are then recorded and the total intensity of the green channel was recorded. The mask was applied to the raw image data in the red channel, and the total intensity recorded. Total intensity was normalized to number of pixels to achieve an average intensity for the entire PLI region in the red and this value was normalized to the average intensity of the green channel.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work in this study was supported by NIAID grants R01 AI110684 and R21 151593 to RRI and U01AI124302 and R01 AI110724 to TvO.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Neeraj Dhar (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers only have a few minor suggestions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this report, Clark et al. present the creation of a microdroplet-based microfluidics model recapitulating the bacteria-bacteria as well as host-bacteria interactions occurring usually in deep tissues of the infected host. In the host, bacteria often form clonal microcolonies that display heterogeneous behaviour in response to spatial organisation with respect to host immune attacks. Authors show that in such a model, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis can grow in microcolonies, which, similarly to what the group had observed in other experimental set ups, rely on expression of Hmp mostly by peripheral bacterial cells for resilience of the entire population to added NO. Importantly, such model is also shown to be amenable to addition of bone marrow derived macrophages to the droplets, mimicking thus the situation in tissues.</p><p>This is a great report, easy to read and well presented. The model has been extensively tested by the authors who provide the community here with an interesting alternative in between pure tissue culture models and animal models which are in themselves often limiting in being either too simple for the former and too complex for the latter. Importantly, many features of the bacterial cells are accessible in such model and it is going to be very useful to many research groups.</p><p>I have no essential revisions to request, the manuscript is an excellent piece of work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors have attempted to build a system that allows them to capture microbial behavior and its interactions with host immune cells. Yersinia bacteria typically replicates in intestinal lumen and lymph nodes forming microcolonies surrounded by neutrophils, macrophages and other immune cells. Previous in vivo studies have shown that there is a topological induction of detoxifying proteins (<italic>hmp</italic>) in the bacterial microcolonies with the bacteria in the periphery of the microcolony showing the highest induction. To better study these processes and with the aim of developing a system amenable for development of high-throughput screens, the authors employ droplet-based microfluidics to facilitate the growth of bacteria in gel-based matrix. Initially they characterize these droplets and demonstrate exponential growth of the bacteria in these droplets, where they form microcolonies. These microcolonies were then exposed to different concentrations of NO and the important role of <italic>hmp</italic> in resisting this stress was confirmed. Using a fluorescent reporter for <italic>hmp</italic> expression, the heterogeneous and spatially organized expression is demonstrated in wild-type strains using FACS and microscopy, which is lost in strains deleted for <italic>hmp</italic>. Similar pattern of expression is seen when the droplets containing bacteria are coated with macrophages activated to express NOS and is similar to the expression seen in sections of spleens from infected mice. This peripheral induction of <italic>hmp</italic> is lost when the NOS response is inhibited using chemical inhibitors of NO.</p><p>While there are no new observations on the pathogenesis or host-microbe interactions aspect, this study presents the development of a novel in vitro system that facilitates future studies on spatial relationships between immune cells and bacteria in a more amenable manner. It might be a good fit for the Tools section. Overall this is a nice and elegant study and the manuscript and data has been presented well.</p><p>I do not have any major issues with the manuscript. I do have a few suggestions that might improve the presentation.</p><p>– If I understood correctly, the reporter carries the fluorescent marker on a episomal plasmid. Variation in copy number potentially could influence their readouts for heterogeneity in gene induction. The authors could comment on this briefly in the Discussion.</p><p>– Figure 5 could be moved to the supplementary data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study by Isberg and colleagues, the authors provide to the community a very interesting experimental platform. The study appears motivated by the years-long interest of the Isberg lab in the pathogenesis of Yersinia. These bacteria create microcolonies in several tissues of an infected animal, the significance of which has only been explored in theory. The major question related to these microcolonies is that of the social behavior of individual bacteria.</p><p>Herein, the authors present a microfluidics system to create droplet-encased bacteria, which form clusters that resemble those identified in vivo. The major advance provided here is the demonstration that these synthetic clusters recapitulate behaviors observed in vivo, as they relate to NO responsiveness. The source of the NO could be chemical or macrophage derived, and the NO induces the expression of NO-responsive genes in bacteria that are present in the periphery of the cluster.</p><p>The potential for using this platform to ask &quot;sufficiency questions&quot; related to immune signals that influence intra-cluster bacterial behavior is powerful and should be embraced by the community.</p><p>While there are several experimental questions that I would like answered, they all would require an extension of this work that is already of sufficient quality to attract attention from the community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58106.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] While there are no new observations on the pathogenesis or host-microbe interactions aspect, this study presents the development of a novel in vitro system that facilitates future studies on spatial relationships between immune cells and bacteria in a more amenable manner.
