MG mediates the glycation of proteins to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). We have recently demonstrated that MG-induced AGEs are a common feature of breast cancer. Little is known regarding the impact of MG-mediated carbonyl stress on tumor progression. Breast tumors with MG stress presented with high nuclear YAP, a key transcriptional co-activator regulating tumor growth and invasion. Elevated MG levels resulted in sustained YAP nuclear localization/activity that could be reverted using Carnosine, a scavenger for MG. MG treatment affected Hsp90 chaperone activity and decreased its binding to LATS1, a key kinase of the Hippo pathway. Cancer cells with high MG stress showed enhanced growth and metastatic potential in vivo. These findings reinforce the cumulative evidence pointing to hyperglycemia as a risk factor for cancer incidence and bring renewed interest in MG scavengers for cancer treatment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19375.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19375.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>carbonyl stress</kwd><kwd>glyoxalase 1</kwd><kwd>LATS1</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>methylglyoxal</kwd><kwd>YAP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005627</institution-id><institution>Université de Liège</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bellahcène</surname><given-names>Akeila</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>MJN, FD and BCo are Télévie Fellows, BCh, ABl and AT are Télévie Post-Doctoral Fellows, PDT and ABe are Senior Research Associates, all from the National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS, Belgium).

This process referred to aerobic glycolysis or the 'Warburg effect' is considered as a hallmark of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ward and Thompson, 2012</xref>). Although aerobic glycolysis is less efficient than respiration to generate ATP, we know now that it effectively supports the anabolic requirements associated with cancer cell growth and proliferation. One underestimated consequence of increased glucose uptake and glycolytic flux is the accumulation of potent toxic metabolites such as reactive carbonyl species. Among those, methylglyoxal (MG) is a highly reactive α-oxoaldehyde that is primarily formed in cells by the spontaneous degradation of triose phosphate intermediates of glycolysis, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richard, 1993</xref>). Alpha-oxoaldehydes are up to 20,000-fold more reactive than glucose in glycation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turk, 2010</xref>), and it is expected that 1% to 5% of proteins in cells are modified by MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rabbani and Thornalley, 2014</xref>). MG leads to chemical modification of proteins, lipids and nucleotides that result in cellular dysfunction and mutagenicity. MG interaction with amino groups of proteins notably leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) called hydroimidazolones (MG-H) and argpyrimidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thornalley, 1996</xref>). All mammalian cells possess a detoxifying system constituted of glyoxalases 1 and 2 (Glo1 and Glo2, respectively), which catalyze the conversion of MG to D-lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thornalley, 2005</xref>). The disturbance in the balance between endogenous reactive carbonyl species generation and the ability to counteract their harmful effects is defined as the carbonyl stress.</p><p>At the molecular level, carbonyl stress is a common feature of the metabolic dysfunction associated with diabetes and cancer. MG-related AGEs have been found to be increased two- to fivefold and have been mainly identified in the context of diabetes. For example, MG post-translational modification of vascular basement membrane type IV collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobler et al., 2006</xref>) and of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bierhaus et al., 2012</xref>) have been associated with long-term diabetic complications.</p><p>Although the link between oxidative stress, cancer development, progression and response to therapy is clearly established, carbonyl stress and cancer connection remains largely unexplored and has never been envisaged as potentially interconnected. To the best of our knowledge, only one study has reported MG-derived AGEs detection in malignant tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Heijst et al., 2005</xref>). Using immunohistochemistry, we have recently reported the accumulation of argpyrimidine MG adducts in breast cancer tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiavarina et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, MG-mediated glycation of specific target proteins happens to be beneficial to cancer progression. For example, the formation of argpyrimidine on heat-shock protein 27 (Hsp27) prevented cancer cell apoptosis in lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Heijst et al., 2006</xref>) and gastrointestinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oya-Ito et al., 2011</xref>) cancers. Moreover, inhibition of MG modification on Hsp27 caused sensitization of cancer cells to antitumoral drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sakamoto et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>MG has been shown to down regulate Hsp90 and Hsc70 expression levels in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bento et al., 2010</xref>). Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that gained great interest over the last 20 years as a druggable target for cancer treatment. Hsp90 stabilizes and activates more than 400 proteins, referred to as Hsp90 ‘clients’, many of which are oncoproteins including transcription factors and kinases that are essential for cellular signal transduction pathways and adaptive responses to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Trepel et al., 2010</xref>). One such client protein is the large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huntoon et al., 2010</xref>), a key kinase that relays anti-proliferative signals in the Hippo pathway through Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) phosphorylation and inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan, 2010</xref>). Consistent with its fundamental role in the control of organ growth and size in vertebrates, the dysfunction of the Hippo signalization triggers tumorigenesis in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>). As a co-activator of TEAD family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>), YAP has been notably shown to enhance cancer progression through transcriptional activation of proliferation promoting genes such as c-myc and CTGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moroishi et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies established a link between glucose deprivation stress, aerobic glycolysis and YAP activation in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeRan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enzo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mulvihill et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, reinforcing the increasing evidence indicating that metabolic pathways play causative roles in conferring an aggressive phenotype upon cancer cells. Because spontaneous MG accumulation results from the glycolytic flux, we hypothesized that MG stress might couple glycolysis to YAP activity. In this study, we show that MG induces YAP nuclear persistence and activity in breast cancer cells and we validate a molecular mechanism implicating MG-mediated Hsp90 inactivation and subsequent LATS1 kinase decrease. Our study establishes for the first time the functional significance of endogenous MG stress and reveals its unexpected connection with cancer cells propensity to grow and metastasize.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Methylglyoxal adducts and nuclear YAP are positively correlated in human breast cancer</title><p>At the molecular level, a predictable consequence of the glycolytic switch in cancer cells is the induction of carbonyl stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We have previously reported MG-mediated carbonyl stress, assessed by argpyrimidine adducts detection, in a series of breast cancer lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiavarina et al., 2014</xref>). Recent reports highlighted the importance of glucose metabolism for the regulation of YAP activity in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeRan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enzo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mulvihill et al., 2014</xref>). To explore possible links between YAP activity and carbonyl stress, we performed immunohistochemistry staining of YAP on a series of 87 breast tumors categorized as high and low-to-intermediate carbonyl stress tumors based on their endogenous argpyrimidine level. Remarkably, breast cancer lesions with high carbonyl stress also showed high YAP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). YAP was scored for nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between nuclear YAP staining in low/intermediate and high carbonyl stress tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We demonstrated a positive correlation (R<sub>spearman</sub> = 0.3975, p=0.0001) between carbonyl stress intensity and nuclear YAP detection.

In order to explore further the potential connection existing between MG-induced carbonyl stress and YAP, we first examined cell-density-dependent YAP subcellular localization in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. YAP was mainly localized in the nucleus of low-density cultured cancer cells as detected by immunofluorescence. When breast cancer cells reached confluence, YAP was not detectable in the nucleus and became generally less visible suggesting that it underwent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>). Upon MG treatment, MDA-MB-231 cells showed a concentration dependent persistence of YAP in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus despite the cells reached confluence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As a transcriptional co-activator, YAP’s function is strictly constrained by its subcellular localization, thus we will essentially focus on YAP nuclear localization thereafter. Quantification supported that nuclear YAP immunodetection was dose dependently higher in MG treated cells when compared to untreated cells in high-density cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Nuclear YAP accumulation was also found to be significant in MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 breast cancer cells upon 300 and 500 μM MG treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B,D, and E</xref>). We obtained similar results in all three cell lines using a second antibody specifically directed against YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B and C</xref>). We next showed that TAZ, the YAP paralog in mammalian cells, was modulated in the same way in breast cancer cells under MG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Lactate measurement using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR showed that MDA-MB-231 cells significantly increased their glycolytic activity when cultured in high glucose compared to low glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In these cells, high-glucose culture induced elevated endogenous MG level that was assessed using both FACS detection of MBo fluorescent probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and LC-MS/MS quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similar results were observed in the other highly glycolytic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). As expected, low glycolytic MCF7 cells used for comparison did not react to high-glucose culture condition and kept stable lactate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). More importantly, MCF7 cells showed stable MG levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>) thus pointing for the first time to MG increase as a specific response of glycolytic cancer cells to glucose stimulus. After having validated the response of breast cancer cells to high glucose, we next asked whether YAP and TAZ nuclear persistence occurred under glucose-induced elevated endogenous MG levels. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells cultured to confluence in high glucose demonstrated positive nuclear YAP and TAZ staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) when compared with cells cultured in low glucose. Next, we reasoned that the inhibition of the glycolytic flux using the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) would reverse this effect. We first validated the decrease of lactate and MG production upon 2-DG treatment using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and FACS detection of MBo fluorescent probe, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). As expected, YAP accumulation was not detectable in high-glucose MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells treated with 2-DG just like in low-glucose cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>).</p><p>As expected from their stable glycolytic rate and unaffected MG level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D and E</xref>), we did not observe any significant persistence of YAP and TAZ in MCF7 breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is noteworthy that MCF7 cells are able to induce YAP accumulation in response to an exogenous MG supply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggesting that low glycolytic cells could be stimulated in a high MG environment created by neighboring cells for example and this, independently of their own glycolytic flux.</p><p>Finally, the observed effects of endogenous high MG levels on YAP were significantly reversed using 2 MG scavengers, carnosine and aminoguanidine in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that the glycolytic switch in cancer cells is accompanied by high MG levels and YAP nuclear persistence thus establishing a new link between glucose utilization, MG stress and YAP regulation in cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MG induces YAP co-transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells</title><p>We next explored the functional relevance of MG-mediated nuclear accumulation of YAP in breast cancer cells. For this purpose, we used two shRNAs specifically directed against <italic>GLO1</italic> to stably induce high endogenous MG stress in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Efficient <italic>GLO1</italic> silencing (shRNAs #1 and #2) at the mRNA and protein levels and decreased Glo1 activity were validated in stably depleted clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B and C</xref>, respectively). As expected, <italic>GLO1</italic>-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells showed YAP and TAZ accumulation in high-cell-density cultures when compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistently, this effect was significantly reversed using carnosine and aminoguanidine MG scavengers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Stably depleted <italic>GLO1</italic> MDA-MB-231 cells were used to assess YAP target genes expression based on a previously established gene signature denoting YAP/TAZ activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cordenonsi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Among the 14 targets tested and known to be regulated positively by YAP, we found that 8 genes, including CTGF gene, showed a significant increase at the mRNA level in <italic>GLO1</italic> depleted cells when compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Importantly, knock-down of YAP using siRNA transfection reversed, at least in part, the expression of all the evaluated genes thus establishing the link between YAP target genes expression and <italic>GLO1</italic> status in cancer cells. Efficient YAP silencing in <italic>GLO1</italic>-depleted MDA-MB-231 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>.

However, global YAP expression did not show any significant correlation with <italic>GLO1</italic>. We reasoned that YAP activity, rather than its total expression level, would better reflect YAP nuclear accumulation related to MG stress. Indeed, we found that the expression of YAP target genes and <italic>GLO1</italic> showed a significant inverse correlation in breast cancer patients. Top 12 genes that displayed the highest Rp Pearson correlation coefficient are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>.

In order to assess more concretely the impact of MG stress on breast cancer cells through YAP activation, we next focused on CTGF gene expression, a well-described YAP transcriptional target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>) that has been linked to YAP pro-growth and tumorigenic functions. We performed chromatin IP assays to assess the presence of YAP at CTGF promoter in both sparse and confluent MDA-MB-231 cells. In low-density cultured cells, YAP was bound to CTGF promoter, whereas in confluent cells, YAP was not detectable which is consistent with YAP absence in the nucleus of high-density cells. In contrast, YAP was found at CTGF promoter in MG-treated confluent cells at a comparable level to that in sparse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Immunoblot of YAP IP loading is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref> CTGF mRNA level was not significantly affected by MG treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

MDA-MB-231 cells cultured in presence of MG and treated with TGF-β (2.5 ng/ml) responded by a two-fold increase of CTGF mRNA level compared to TGF-β alone confirming the requirement of TGF-β pathway activation for MG-mediated induction of CTGF expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation following TGF-β treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells was not affected by MG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>) indicating that CTGF up-regulation was linked to YAP accumulation in presence of active TGF-β pathway effectors. In agreement with this deduction, we showed that YAP silencing prevented MG-mediated CTGF mRNA induction in presence of TGF-β in confluent MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Efficient YAP silencing was shown at the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>) levels.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19375.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>MG induces YAP co-transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stable knockdown of <italic>GLO1</italic> (sh<italic>GLO1</italic>#2) in MDA-MB-231 results in upregulation of several YAP target genes (ANKFN1, RIMS3, KCNK1, EMP2, OSBP2, IRAK3, WTN5A and CTGF) at the mRNA level as assessed by qRT-PCR.

To test whether MG-induced YAP activation launched EMT in breast cancer cells, immunoblotting was performed to examine the expression of well-characterized EMT markers. We observed an increase of vimentin and a decrease of E-cadherin expression, attesting of an EMT process in MDA-MB-468 cells treated with MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Next, we observed by immunofluorescence that E-cadherin network was disrupted in MG-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Consistent with EMT induction, MG-treated MDA-MB-468 cells showed an enhanced migration potential that was efficiently reversed to basal level upon YAP silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>MG favors LATS1 kinase degradation through the proteasome in breast cancer cells</title><p>To gain insight into possible mechanisms by which MG regulates YAP activity, we first considered that YAP could be a direct target of MG glycation. However, MG-adducts immunoprecipitation in MDA-MB-231 treated with MG did not allow western blot detection of YAP (data not shown). LATS1/2 are the main upstream Hippo pathway kinases that phosphorylate YAP, thus preventing its nuclear translocation and oncogenic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We hypothesized that MG-mediated sustained YAP nuclear localization could be related to a relaxed LATS1/2 control notably due to its decreased expression. We demonstrated by Western blotting that LATS1, and not LATS2, was significantly decreased upon MG treatment (300 and 500 μM) in both glycolytic MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 and non-glycolytic MCF7 breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). LATS1 mRNA levels were not affected by MG in the three breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A previous study has shown that LATS1 kinase degradation occurs through polyubiquitination and the proteasome pathway in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2016</xref>). In good accordance, the treatment of breast cancer cells with MG132 proteasome inhibitor induced LATS1 increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Next, we verified whether MG favored LATS1 decrease through proteasome degradation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, the use of MG132 proteasome inhibitor reverted MG-induced LATS1 decrease. Next, we explored whether LATS1 decrease could explain, at least in part, the sustained YAP nuclear localization induced by MG. Accordingly, when we overexpressed LATS1, we were able to revert MG effects on YAP accumulation as assessed by immunofluorescence using two anti-YAP antibodies in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and in the other breast cancer cell lines analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).

Then, we got interested in LATS1 as a client of Hsp90 chaperone protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huntoon et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, LATS1 kinase expression level and activity are dependent on its stabilization by Hsp90. 17-AAG, a potent Hsp90 inhibitor, disrupts LATS1 tumor suppressor activity in human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huntoon et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>HSP90</italic> mRNA level was not modulated by MG treatment in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, we sought to explore whether MG could modify Hsp90, thus indirectly impacting on LATS1 stability and degradation. The incubation of human recombinant Hsp90 with MG followed by MS analysis revealed the modification of several lysine and arginine residues notably yielding to the formation of carboxyethyllysine (CEL) and argpyrimidine/hydroimidazolone adducts, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Next, we examined whether endogenous MG-modified Hsp90 could be detected in MG-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Immunoprecipitation of MG-treated MDA-MB-231 extracts using anti-argpyrimidine MG adducts and followed by Hsp90 immunoblot analysis allowed us to detect a basal level of glycated Hsp90 in MDA-MB-231 glycolytic cells that was further enhanced upon MG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Hsp27, which is recognized as a major MG target in cancer cells, was also efficiently detected in argpyrimidine immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Consistently, the reverse IP experiment using an anti-Hsp90 antibody allowed the detection of both argpyrimidine and hydroimidazolone MG-adducts of the expected molecular weight in MG treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Argpyrimidine immunoprecipitates subjected to MS analysis revealed the presence of modified Hsp90 on several residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>). Glycation hot spots observed on exogenous and/or endogenous Hsp90 are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and detailed amino acid sequence is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> The mapping of MG modifications on Hsp90 amino-acid sequence indicated that functionally important domains involved in both substrate/co-chaperone and ATP binding showed several glycated residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) suggesting that Hsp90 activity could be affected. Recombinant human Hsp90 (rhHsp90) was effectively modified by MG and was protected by carnosine MG-scavenger as assessed using both anti-argpyrimidine and anti-hydroimidazolone antibodies in Western blot experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Using an in vitro enzymatic assay, MG decreased rhHsp90 activity to an extent that was comparable to that seen using 17-AAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Incubation of rhHsp90 with MG in presence of carnosine efficiently reversed this effect indicating for the first time that direct MG glycation of Hsp90 affects its ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Furthermore, both MG and 17-AAG decreased LATS1 expression in the three breast cancer cell lines under study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we further documented LATS1 binding to Hsp90 in the context of MG treatment. LATS1 immunoprecipitates contained detectable Hsp90 however this interaction was disrupted in presence of MG in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

After 6 weeks post-tumor removal, metastasized tumors were observed in the lungs of <italic>GLO1</italic>-depleted mice (68%) when compared to control (20%).

This overactive metabolism switch leads unavoidably to the formation of potent glycating agents such as MG. However, the concept of a causal relationship between non-enzymatic glycation and cancer progression is still in its early days. Here, we demonstrate that MG-mediated carbonyl stress interferes with LATS1 kinase, without affecting LATS2 and Mst1/2 kinases, to induce sustained YAP and TAZ nuclear localization. The hypermethylation of the promoter region of LATS1 gene (50% of breast tumors) is associated with an aggressive breast cancer phenotype and poor survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takahashi et al., 2005</xref>). We show in this study that LATS1 proteasomal degradation is favored in presence of MG thus bringing to light a new concept according to which MG stress could directly and/or indirectly participate to the control of tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells without affecting their transcriptional rate.</p><p>YAP is regulated by diverse mechanisms including microenvironmental factors (cell crowding and ECM stiffness) and extracellular signaling (G-coupled receptors) (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moroishi et al., 2015</xref>]). Our study meets a new trend of thoughts proposing that energy metabolism is an additional upstream signal that regulates YAP oncogenic activity. Three independent studies recently established a link between the Hippo-YAP pathway and cellular energy stress using a glucose deprivation strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeRan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). These studies are in agreement that under low-glucose condition an AMPK-LATS1 axis inhibits YAP activity. Enzo and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enzo et al., 2015</xref>) have recently demonstrated that aerobic glycolysis impacts on YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity through a mechanism involving phosphofructokinase 1 binding to TEAD transcription factors. A recent metabolic profiling study using breast cancer progression cellular models reported the induction of several glycolytic enzymes upon constitutive activation of YAP/TAZ factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mulvihill et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that MG could regulate key glycolytic enzymes expression in a YAP-dependent manner thus creating a mutual regulatory loop where glycolysis-induced MG stress favors YAP activity, which in turn activates glycolysis. Considering that glucose metabolism inevitably leads to MG formation, one might speculate that any signaling pathway favoring the Warburg effect, e.g the Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pate et al., 2014</xref>), will ultimately feed MG carbonyl stress in cancer cells.</p><p>We show for the first time that Hsp90 is post-translationally glycated by MG. Although several post-translational modifications have been previously reported to affect Hsp90 stability and chaperone function, our study importantly uncovers that a natural metabolite derived from glycolysis is involved in regulating Hsp90 in cancer cells. Quantitative glycation studies will help to determine the proportion of Hsp90 molecules that are glycated by MG, the degree of glycation of specific residues per molecule and to what extent Hsp90 activity is likely to be inhibited in cancer cells. Decreasing Hsp90 client binding has been considered as an attractive anti-cancer therapy because of its role in stabilizing the active form of a wide range of client oncoproteins and several synthetic Hsp90 inhibitors are now in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neckers and Workman, 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, cumulative evidence tends to prove that Hsp90-directed therapy also induces pro-cancer effects. For example, Hsp90 inhibition promotes prostate cancer growth through Src kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yano et al., 2008</xref>) and favors breast cancer bone metastases formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Price et al., 2005</xref>). It is generally estimated that over sixty percent of all cancers are glycolytic. This study showing that a glycolysis metabolite interferes with Hsp90 activity even more crucially raises significant concerns about the use of Hsp90 inhibitors as cancer treatment. The above-mentioned tumor-promoting effects related to Hsp90 inhibition could be potentially recapitulated under MG-mediated carbonyl stress condition in cancer cells. Consistent with this hypothesis and our data, LATS1 signalization in the Hippo pathway is rendered ineffective in ovarian cancer xenograft tumors from mice treated with an Hsp90 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huntoon et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>MG is a potent cytotoxic compound and was first viewed as a potential therapeutic agent in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 1996</xref>). However, the recent identification of MG-modified proteins with pro-tumorigenic potential indicated that MG could also support tumor progression. Three independent groups have shown that Hsp27 heat-shock protein is switched from a pro-apoptotic to an anti-apoptotic factor upon MG glycation and facilitates cancer cell evasion from caspase-dependent cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Heijst et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oya-Ito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sakamoto et al., 2002</xref>). These data and ours point to an important regulatory role of MG stress on Hsps which have been particularly shown to be overexpressed in a wide range of tumors and are associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calderwood et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p><italic>GLO1</italic> appears to be a dual mediator for growth regulation in cancer as it has been described both as an oncogene and a tumor suppressor. On one hand, the search for copy number changes on a large set of cancer cell lines revealed that <italic>GLO1</italic> is amplified in many types of human cancer with breast tumors (22%) and sarcomas (17%) showing the highest rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Santarius et al., 2010</xref>). Most of the recent studies aimed at the inhibition of <italic>GLO1</italic> to induce a toxic MG accumulation effectively showed a decreased tumor growth. These studies generally depicted <italic>GLO1</italic> as an amplified and/or overexpressed oncogene and as a bad prognosis marker in different types of malignant tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hosoda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antognelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fonseca-Sánchez et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, a study aimed at functionally identifying tumor suppressor genes in liver cancer identified and validated <italic>GLO1</italic> as a tumor suppressor gene which knockdown using shRNAs increased tumor growth in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zender et al., 2008</xref>). Using stably depleted <italic>GLO1</italic> xenografts in vivo, we have also demonstrated the pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic role of endogenous MG accumulation in breast cancer cells. These results are consistent with (a) enhanced nuclear YAP and increased Ki67-positive proliferating cells in vivo, (b) increased YAP oncogenic activity including the induction of growth factors expression such as CTGF and the initiation of EMT process observed in vitro and (c) the positive correlation between high MG-adducts detection and nuclear YAP in human primary mammary tumors, thus supporting the clinical relevance of our findings.</p><p>Therefore, it can be expected that different cancer types, with different backgrounds and for instance different MG detoxification rates would react differently to MG stress. Remarkably, cell lines with <italic>GLO1</italic> amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Santarius et al., 2010</xref>) or high Glo1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sakamoto et al., 2001</xref>) are reported to be much more sensitive to Glo1 inhibitors such as BBGC than those without. Thus, suggesting that a high Glo1 activity, putatively associated with high MG production, is necessary for their survival. In our hands, <italic>GLO1</italic> knockdown or inhibition using BBGC did not induce any significant cell apoptosis and hence conferred pro-growth and pro-metastatic advantages to breast cancer cells. These apparently controversial results could be potentially ascribed to differences in the cell lines and animal models used. No doubt that the validation of <italic>GLO1</italic> as a target for cancer therapy will need a better characterization of those breast tumors that are more likely to be sensitive.</p><p>Many chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat cancer have been shown to exert their biologic activity through induction of oxidative stress. However, compelling experimental and clinical evidence indicates that this latter is diverted by cancer cells to promote their growth and resistance to apoptosis. Such promoting effect of carbonyl stress in cancer is inferred for the first time from our data and certainly awaits more comprehensive studies before confirmation. In a non-tumoral context, MG dual effect has been shown recently for neurons where MG is favorable to neurons development and activity while high MG levels are toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Radu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Elevated blood concentrations of MG have been reported in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakayama et al., 2008</xref>) and plasma MG-derived hydroimidazolone was higher in type 1 diabetics as compared with non diabetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2009</xref>). Future studies will have to assess the potential use of circulating MG and/or specific MG adducts as cancer biomarkers. Recent studies indicated that cancer in diabetic patients presents with a higher incidence and a poorer prognosis than in non-diabetic persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ryu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Our study hereby provides with a potential molecular mechanism for cancer-diabetes connection. A better understanding of MG pro-cancer effects could lead to the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies based on the scavenging of MG. Interestingly, both MG scavengers metformin and carnosine have been shown to exert anti-tumoral effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giovannucci et al., 2010</xref>) and metformin proved efficient to reduce systemic MG levels in diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beisswenger et al., 1999</xref>). DeRan and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeRan et al., 2014</xref>) reported that metformin, and its more potent analog phenformin, inhibited YAP activity through AMPK signaling. Metformin is better known as a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor and a potent AMPK inducer, and it is somehow overlooked for its MG scavenging capacities. Accordingly, it is not excluded that metformin could have also exerted, at least in part, its inhibitory activity on YAP function through its MG scavenging properties. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that high MG stress-tumor xenografts showed a significantly lower propensity to metastasize in animals supplemented with carnosine in their drinking water. The crucial role of glucose metabolism in aggressive tumors has logically directed cancer therapy research towards the use of anti-diabetic drugs as effective anti-cancer agents and metformin is actually tested in several anti-cancer clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quinn et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Studies using mass spectrometry and antibodies directed against MG specific AGEs are currently underway in our laboratory in order to identify other targets of MG that will hopefully contribute to bring to light the critical position of MG-mediated carbonyl stress in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). Human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 was kindly provided by Dr. C. Gilles (Laboratory of Tumor and Development Biology, University of Liège, Belgium). All cell lines were authenticated by STR profiling at the Leibniz-Institute DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) and were regularly checked for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). Cells were either cultured in high-glucose DMEM (standard glucose concentration of 4.5 g/L, Lonza) or in DMEM medium with a glucose concentration of 1 g/l (low-glucose medium) both containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Lonza). One g/l glucose level is physiological and reflects the in vivo concentrations in human serum. Conversely, the routine culture media concentration of 4.5 g/l (high-glucose medium) corresponds to a diabetic condition.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ralph DeBerardinis (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another one is Jason W Locasale (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript studies the role of methylglyoxal-mediated protein modification – a form of carbonyl stress associated with glycolysis – in oncogenic signaling. It demonstrates that methylglyoxal (MG) post-translationally modifies Hsp90, resulting in enhanced degradation of the tumor suppressor kinase LATS1. This enables persistent nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of YAP, leading to enhanced cell proliferation and migration. Increasing access to glucose was sufficient to increase MG modifications and YAP nuclear localization in breast cancer cells, and increasing MG levels by silencing glyoxylase-1 (Glo-1) had similar effects. In xenografts, chronic Glo1 silencing enhanced tumor growth and Ki67 content.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While it is clear from fluorescent images and western blots that MG induces an overall increase in YAP expression, it is not as clear from the ImageJ analysis that YAP is accumulating in the nucleus. As the paper stands, the data do not readily distinguish whether increased YAP is due to defective Hippo signaling per se, or a Hippo-independent mechanism(s) that leads to YAP stabilization. The authors should consider the following experiments to address this issue:</p><p>A) Examine TAZ in parallel with YAP, since a block in Hippo signaling should stabilize both YAP and TAZ.</p><p>B) Examine YAP S381 phosphorylation in parallel with S127 phosphorylation, with and without MG treatment, since a block in Hippo signaling should decrease both phosphorylation events.</p><p>2) MG levels are either measured indirectly with a fluorescent sensor (MBo) or directly using LC/MS. Absolute quantitation by LC/MS is helpful because it allows the reader to gauge the relevance of MG supplementation experiments, which are used throughout the paper. However, in high/low glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and Glo1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) experiments, the authors only present data for extracellular MG levels, whereas the intracellular levels are more relevant to carbonyl stress. Intracellular MG levels should be quantified, and the authors should compare levels achieved by addition of exogenous MG addition to those achieved by high-glucose culture and Glo1 silencing. Otherwise this could represent a phenomenon related to supraphysiological MG levels with little physiological relevance.</p><p>3) The carnosine experiments to scavenge MG are helpful, but a better loss of function experiment would be to treat cells with an inhibitor of glycolysis (e.g. 2-deoxyglucose) that reduces the levels of glycolytic intermediates and MG. That would provide a better complement to the high/low glucose experiments than using extremely high levels of carnosine.</p><p>4) What happens to LATS2 under high-glucose conditions? Hsp90 is known to bind both LATS1 and LATS2, and these two kinases are redundant in Hippo signaling. Most likely LATS2 is also destabilized under hyperglycemia. The authors should examine this possibility along with a control kinase in the Hippo pathway such as MST1/MST2 under similar conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19375.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) While it is clear from fluorescent images and western blots that MG induces an overall increase in YAP expression, it is not as clear from the ImageJ analysis that YAP is accumulating in the nucleus.

To address this request, we have performed an immunoblot for TAZ in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines treated with MG 300µM as shown now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and F</xref>. We also performed immunofluorescence experiments for TAZ in the three breast cancer cell lines analyzed treated with MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and cultured in low and high glucose containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and in stably Glo1-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Altogether the results demonstrated an accumulation of TAZ in breast cancer cells under all three carbonyl stress conditions under which we have previously demonstrated a YAP accumulation. This new information is now mentioned in the Results and Discussion.</p><p><italic>B) Examine YAP S381 phosphorylation in parallel with S127 phosphorylation, with and without MG treatment, since a block in Hippo signaling should decrease both phosphorylation events.</italic></p><p>We agree with this sound suggestion and have, accordingly, analyzed the phosphorylation of YAP on S381 in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 cells treated with MG using western blotting. In good accordance with a block in Hippo signaling, we observed a decrease of S381 phosphorylation as shown now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and F</xref>.

Otherwise this could represent a phenomenon related to supraphysiological MG levels with little physiological relevance.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. As proposed, we have undertaken the LC/MS/MS measure of intracellular MG levels on MDA-MB-231 cell pellets cultured under high/low glucose, Glo1 silencing as well as upon exogenous MG addition. For this purpose, we have asked for the contribution of external collaborators (J.S and C.S, now added as co-authors) who had the expertise for MG dosage on cell pellets using UPLC/MS/MS. To homogenize the techniques used, extracellular MG levels were measured in parallel on matched supernatant samples. Therefore, new extracellular MG concentrations expressed as nanomoles/L normalized to the number of cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>. Intracellular MG concentrations measured on cell pellet lysates are shown below in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>. Several conclusions can be drawn from these measurements: (1) Intracellular MG concentrations are more elevated than extracellular ones. This observation is in good accordance with previous studies (Rabbani and Thornalley, Nature Protocols, 2014) and has been notably attributed to the fact that intracellular concentrations account for both free MG and reversibly bound MG to cellular targets (proteins, nucleic acids and lipids) (Chaplen et al., Analytical Biochemistry, 1996). (2) As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1A</xref>, intracellular MG concentrations levels were found to be very similar in all conditions indicating that MG quantification in cells is not relevant to assess the extent of carbonyl stress. In fact, such measurement of MG has never been reported before in cancer cells and several questions await further detailed analytical studies. Is free MG gradient the factor that equilibrates its concentration between extracellular and intracellular compartments? The data shown tend to indicate that it is not the case as 6-fold more MG is found in the extracellular medium than in cells upon exogenous MG treatment (300μm 48h). According to its high reactivity, is it conceivable that free MG could be measured inside the cells? No doubt that Glo1 activity level will also control final free MG concentrations. (3)It is particularly striking that under exogenous MG stimulation, MG concentration inside the cells remains stable while it is significantly increased in the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1A and B</xref>). An effect that could be attributed to the presence of cellular Glo1 activity that maintains MG levels under a certain sub-cytotoxic threshold. In good accordance with this hypothesis, we have previously demonstrated that MDA-MB-231 cells increase their Glo1 activity in response to exogenous MG addition (Chiavarina et al., Oncotarget, 2014). Based on these new experiments, we conclude that extracellular concentrations of MG are the most relevant to assess carbonyl stress in all 3 experimental conditions. When it comes to intracellular MG evaluation, we strongly believe that the quantification of MG-adducts using western blotting is a better reflection of carbonyl stress under all 3 experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1C and D</xref>). MG level in MDA-MB-231 cells was approximately 6μM which is slightly higher than the previous range of concentrations reported for normal mammalian cells (1 to 4 μM) which may be attributable to the glycolytic phenotype of these cancer cells. The role of MG-mediated carbonyl stress has been understudied in cancer but it is gaining much of interest nowadays (Sullivan LB, et al., Nature reviews Cancer, Sept. 2016). To the best of our knowledge MG concentrations have not yet been established in cancer patients in comparison with healthy subjects. Moreover, the local concentrations of MG achieved in highly glycolytic tumors are not known and must be a balance between the amount produced (glycolytic flux), amount carried away by vasculature and how it is catabolized by tumor and/or stromal cells. Our in vitro studies indicate that MDA-MB-231 cells can tolerate high amounts of MG (IC50 = 938μM). Until more studies are undertaken in this direction it is difficult to assess what should be considered as supraphysiological levels of MG and pending a better understanding of how and what proportion of exogenous MG enters the cells, the detection of MG adducts accumulation and/or extracellular MG concentrations in tumor cells represents the best indication of MG-mediated carbonyl stress upon both exogenous and endogenous MG supply in our in vivo and in vitro experiments.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19375.030</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Intracellular (<bold>A</bold>) and extracellular (<bold>B</bold>) MG concentrations in MDA-MB-231 cells.</title><p>MG adducts western blotting detection using anti-argpyrimidine antibody in MDA-MB-231 cells cultured in high and low glucose and upon exogenous MG treatment (<bold>C</bold>) and in Glo1-silenced cells (<bold>D</bold>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19375.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19375.030</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19375-resp-fig1-v4"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) The carnosine experiments to scavenge MG are helpful, but a better loss of function experiment would be to treat cells with an inhibitor of glycolysis (e.g. 2-deoxyglucose) that reduces the levels of glycolytic intermediates and MG. That would provide a better complement to the high/low glucose experiments than using extremely high levels of carnosine.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. Therefore, we performed new experiments where MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells cultured in high-glucose medium were treated with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) 5mM during 48h. We observed a significant decrease of lactate and MG production compared to control in glycolytic MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells as shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>. As expected, we found a decreased YAP nuclear immunodetection in glycolytic breast cancer cells treated with 2-DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) What happens to LATS2 under high-glucose conditions? Hsp90 is known to bind both LATS1 and LATS2, and these two kinases are redundant in Hippo signaling. Most likely LATS2 is also destabilized under hyperglycemia. The authors should examine this possibility along with a control kinase in the Hippo pathway such as MST1/MST2 under similar conditions.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this pertinent comment which prompted us to evaluate LATS2, Mst1 and Mst2 expression levels in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 cells under the same condition that induced a decrease of LATS1 expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, we observed no change in LATS2 expression in the 3 breast cancer cell lines indicating that LATS2 expression did not obey to the same regulation as LATS1 upon MG treatment.</p><p>When we checked for MST1 and MST2 expression in the 3 cell lines under the same treatment, we observed a stable (MDA-MB-468 and MCF7) and even an increased (MDA-MB-231) expression of these kinases indicating that MG stress did not affect negatively the Hippo pathway upstream of LATS1 kinase level. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> in the new version of the manuscript and mentioned in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
