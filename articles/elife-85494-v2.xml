homeostasis. Most of what we know about mitochondrial transfer stems from bulk cell studies and have led to the paradigm that functional transferred mitochondria restore bioenergetics and revitalize cellular functions to recipient cells with damaged or non-functional mitochondrial networks. However, we show that mitochondrial transfer also occurs between cells with functioning endogenous mitochondrial networks, but the mechanisms underlying how transferred mitochondria can promote such sustained behavioral reprogramming remain unclear. We report that unexpectedly, transferred macrophage mitochondria are dysfunctional and accumulate reactive oxygen species in recipient cancer cells. We further discovered that reactive oxygen species accumulation activates ERK signaling, promoting cancer cell proliferation. Pro-tumorigenic macrophages exhibit fragmented mitochondrial networks, leading to higher rates of mitochondrial transfer to cancer cells. Finally, we observe that macrophage mitochondrial transfer promotes tumor cell proliferation in vivo. Collectively these results indicate that transferred macrophage mitochondria activate downstream signaling pathways in a ROS-dependent manner in cancer cells, and provide a model of how sustained behavioral reprogramming can be mediated by a relatively small amount of transferred mitochondria in vitro and in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell-cell

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, known to provide energy for the cell, but more recently shown to have a variety of additional essential cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zong et al., 2016</xref>). In animal models, a series of seminal studies revealed that cancer cells void of mitochondrial DNA still form tumors by obtaining mitochondria from stromal cells, thereby restoring cancer cell mitochondrial function, cellular respiration, and tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2017</xref>). Other experiments suggest that mitochondrial transfer not only restores bioenergetics, but can alter the metabolic state of recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brestoff et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Phinney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saha et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crewe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korpershoek et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van der Vlist et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), allowing recipient cells to adapt to stressors or changes in the environment, prompting the development of methods targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patel et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caicedo et al., 2015</xref>). Although these studies elegantly demonstrate that mitochondrial transfer alters recipient cellular behavior, many aspects of this process remain unclear. For instance, the rescue of cellular function is commonly attributed to enhanced mitochondrial energetic or metabolic profiles; however, the fate and function of transferred mitochondria in recipient cells are under-explored. Furthermore, it is unclear how cells respond to laterally transferred mitochondria if the recipient cells already have a fully functioning mitochondrial network, and in particular, if the transferred mitochondria only comprise a small subset of the overall mitochondrial network in the recipient cell.</p><p>Given that metastasis is a low-frequency event and is the consequence of changes in cellular behavior on the single-cell level, we aimed to examine the function and behavior of transferred mitochondria within individual recipient cells that have functioning endogenous mitochondrial networks. Using a combination of in vitro high-resolution microscopy, optogenetics, imaging flow cytometry, and in vivo tumor models, we demonstrate a previously undescribed mechanism of mitochondrial transfer-associated cellular reprogramming. Collectively, our data explain how a relatively small amount of transferred mitochondria can impact cellular behavior in the recipient cell with fully functioning endogenous mitochondria – Transferred macrophage mitochondria in cancer cells are <italic>dysfunctional</italic>, ROS accumulates at the site of transferred mitochondria, promoting ERK-mediated cancer cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cancer cells with macrophage mitochondria exhibit increased proliferation</title><p>We previously reported that macrophages transfer cytoplasmic contents to cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roh-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>), and hypothesized that a macrophage/cancer cell system would be ideal for probing mitochondrial transfer in cells with functioning mitochondrial networks. Our studies employed blood-derived human macrophages and a human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 (231 cells), stably expressing a mitochondrially localized mEmerald or red fluorescent protein (mito-mEm or mito-RFP, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We observed mitochondrial transfer from macrophages to 231 cells using live cell confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, arrowheads) and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>; flow cytometry scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Control gates were set to 0.2%, based on confirmation of mitochondrial transfer by FACS-isolation of distinct mEmerald+ populations (see methods for more information). With these methods, a range of transfer efficiencies were observed, which we attribute to donor-to-donor variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), yet mitochondrial transfer was consistently observed in 231 cells, as well as to another breast cancer line, MDA-MB-468, and a melanoma cell line, A375 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). To determine whether macrophage mitochondrial transfer was unique to cancer cells, we tested a non-malignant breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A. We observed reduced mitochondrial transfer efficiencies to MCF10A cells, with no significant differences compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>), suggesting that macrophages exhibit higher mitochondrial transfer efficiencies to malignant cells. Transferred mitochondria contain a key outer mitochondrial membrane protein, TOMM20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>, arrowhead) and mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>, arrowhead), suggesting that intact organelles are transferred to 231 cells. To better define the requirements for transfer, we performed trans-well experiments in which we cultured 231 cells either physically separated from macrophages by a 0.4 μm trans-well insert or in contact with macrophages (scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>), or with conditioned media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g, h</xref>). These data showed that mitochondrial transfer increased dramatically under conditions where 231 cells could contact macrophages directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g and h</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that macrophage mitochondrial transfer to cancer cells likely requires cell-to-cell contact. Furthermore, while mitochondrial transfer may not be unique to cancer cells, macrophages transfer mitochondria to cancer cells at higher frequencies. Thus, due to the low rates of mitochondrial transfer across macrophage donors (0.84%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), we subsequently took advantage of single-cell, high-resolution approaches – rather than bulk approaches – to follow the fate and functional status of transferred mitochondria.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell-contact-mediated transfer of macrophage mitochondria leads to increased cancer cell proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) CD14+ monocytes harvested from human blood are transduced and differentiated for 6 days.

These data revealed that mitochondrial transfer induced significant changes in canonical cell proliferation-related pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). To follow up on the RNA-sequencing results, we used flow cytometry to evaluate proliferation changes, and found significant increases in the percent of cells within the G2 and Mitotic (M) phases of the cell cycle in recipient cells, as compared to their co-cultured counterparts that did not receive mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b-d</xref>). These cells were not undergoing cell cycle arrest, as we found that recipient cells completed cytokinesis at rates equivalent to their co-cultured non-recipient counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e</xref>). For further confirmation of this proliferative phenotype, we used quantitative phase imaging (QPI) to detect changes in dry mass of co-cultured 231 cells over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zangle and Teitell, 2014</xref>). With this approach, we could obtain growth rate information of a large number of cancer cells over time (n=60 control cells; n=115 recipient cancer cells). Consistent with the flow cytometry-based cell cycle analysis, the specific growth rates increased significantly in 231 cells with macrophage mitochondria compared to 231 cells that did not receive mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). To examine whether the effects of mitochondrial transfer was sustained in recipient cells, we also measured the growth rates of daughter cells born from recipient 231 cells containing macrophage mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zangle et al., 2014</xref>). We identified five ‘parent’ cancer cells with macrophage mitochondria, for which we were able to reliably follow both daughter cells upon division. Daughter cells that inherited the ‘parent’s’ macrophage mitochondria exhibited an increase in their rate of change of dry mass over time versus sister cells that did not inherit macrophage mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a-c</xref>). These experiments indicate that the proliferation phenotype in recipient cancer cells is sustained.</p><p>Our results so far suggest that either macrophage mitochondrial transfer increases cancer cell proliferation, or that more proliferative cells are simply more capable of receiving macrophage mitochondria. Thus, to test between these hypotheses, we first blocked cells in the G1-phase of the cell cycle by treating co-cultures with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, Palbociclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3d</xref>), and we observed no changes in mitochondrial transfer rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3e</xref>). These data indicate that the enhanced proliferation observed in recipient cells is not due to proliferative cells more readily receiving transfer.</p><p>We then performed experiments to rigorously test whether transferred macrophage mitochondria causes cancer cell proliferation, rather than mitochondrial receipt and proliferation being correlative events in cancer cells. We also wanted to determine whether the observed proliferative phenotype is due to macrophage mitochondria, and not other molecules that are passed along with the macrophage mitochondria. Thus, we biochemically purified mitochondria from a macrophage cell line, THP-1, and directly applied these macrophage mitochondria to cancer cells for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). We then FACS-isolated cancer cell populations that contained purified macrophage mitochondria, and allowed this population to undergo additional rounds of cell division, and then reanalyzed the proliferative capacity of cancer cells that had retained the macrophage mitochondria versus cancer cells that had lost the macrophage mitochondria over this time. We first confirmed that cancer cells retained the macrophage mitochondria by imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). We also found that cancer cells that had retained the macrophage mitochondria exhibited an increased percentage of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle compared to cancer cells that had lost the macrophage mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i-j</xref>). Together with the QPI results, these results support the model that macrophage mitochondrial transfer promotes a sustained pro-growth and proliferative effect in both recipient and subsequent daughter cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Transferred mitochondria are dysfunctional and accumulate ROS</title><p>We next sought to understand how donated mitochondria can stimulate a proliferative response in recipient cells. We performed time-lapse confocal microscopy on co-cultures and found that in cancer cells with macrophage mitochondria, macrophage-derived mito-mEm+ mitochondria remained distinct from the recipient host mitochondrial network. Cancer cells were cocultured with macrophages for 12 hr and subjected to an additional 15 hr of timelapse microscopy, and we observed no detectable loss of the fluorescent signal at transferred mitochondria throughout the course of imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, arrowhead; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Thus, transferred macrophage mitochondria did not appear to fuse with the existing endogenous mitochondrial network in recipient cells. To probe the functional state of the donated mitochondria, we performed live imaging with MitoTracker Deep Red (MTDR), a cell-permeable dye that is actively taken up by mitochondria with a membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poot et al., 1996</xref>). To our surprise, all of the transferred mitochondria were MTDR-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, top left). This was also confirmed using a different mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive dye, Tetramethylrhodamine Methyl Ester (TMRM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). These results suggested that the transferred mitochondria lacked membrane potential. To determine whether these membrane potential-deficient transferred mitochondria were subjected to lysosomal degradation, we labeled lysosomes and acidic vesicles with a dye, LysoTracker, and found that the majority of transferred mitochondria (57%) did not co-localize with the LysoTracker signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, top right). The status of transferred mitochondria was unexpected because mitochondria typically maintain strong membrane potentials, and dysfunctional mitochondria that lack membrane potential are normally degraded or repaired by fusion with healthy mitochondrial networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Phinney et al., 2015</xref>). Next, we utilized another dye which stains cellular membranes, MemBrite, and observed that 91% of transferred mitochondria were not encapsulated by a membranous structure, thus also excluding sequestration as a mechanism for explaining the lack of degradation or interaction with the endogenous mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). These data, taken together with the long-lived observation of the transferred mitochondria in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, suggest that transferred macrophage mitochondria lack membrane potential, yet remain as a distinct population in recipient cancer cells, not fusing with the endogenous host mitochondrial network nor subjected to degradation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Transferred macrophage mitochondria are long-lived, depolarized, and accumulate reactive oxygen species, promoting cancer cell proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Stills from time-lapse imaging depicting the longevity of the transferred mitochondria (green, arrowhead) within a 231 cell (magenta, cell outline in white).

This hypothesis could offer insight into how this rare event, in which a relatively small amount of mitochondria is transferred, could mediate sustained changes in the proliferative capacity of recipient cancer cells. One signaling molecule associated with mitochondria is reactive oxygen species (ROS), which occur normally as byproducts of mitochondrial respiration, and can be produced at high levels during organellar dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schieber and Chandel, 2014</xref>). Using a genetically encoded biosensor, mito-Grx1-roGFP2, as a live readout of the mitochondrial glutathione redox state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gutscher et al., 2008</xref>), we found that after 24 and 48 hr, significantly higher ratios of oxidized:reduced protein were associated with the transferred mitochondria versus the host network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). These data indicate that transferred macrophage mitochondria in recipient cells are associated with higher levels of oxidized glutathione, suggesting that they are accumulating higher amounts of ROS. Consistent with these results, a second biosensor that is specific for the reactive oxygen species H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, mito-roGFP2-Orp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gutscher et al., 2009</xref>), also reported more oxidation at the transferred mitochondria compared to the host network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c–d</xref>) after 48 hr of co-culture. At 24 hr, we observed a similar trend, but no statistically significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). These results indicate that ROS accumulate at the site of transferred mitochondria in recipient cancer cells. It is unclear whether the observed ROS accumulation is generated by the transferred mitochondria themselves, or generated elsewhere in the recipient cancer cell and accumulating locally at transferred mitochondria. Regardless of the source, we observed robust ROS accumulation specifically at the site of transferred mitochondria and with this unexpected finding, we next tested whether this ROS accumulation could serve as a molecular signal, regulating cell proliferation.</p><p>To rigorously test the model that transferred macrophage mitochondria accumulate ROS, promoting cancer cell proliferation, we turned toward purified macrophage mitochondria approaches as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> and sought approaches to reduce ROS levels. First, to better model the macrophage mitochondrial transfer to cancer cells that occurs in coculture conditions, we determined conditions for cancer cells to internalize exogenous macrophage mitochondria at rates similar to in vitro mitochondrial transfer conditions at 24 hr – 0.68% ± 0.36% internalization rate, n=3 biological replicates (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We next determined that purified mitochondria taken up by cancer cells remain distinct, are not encapsulated by membranes after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>), and do not exhibit membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Similar to our previous proliferation results with purified macrophage mitochondrial uptake at longer time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>), we found that cancer cells with internalized purified macrophage mitochondria (which, under these conditions, comprise ~1% of the total population) exhibited a significant increase in proliferative cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, compared to sister cells that did not internalize mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, comparing black bars in lanes 1&amp;2), and that this increase was ameliorated when ROS is quenched with a mitochondrially localized superoxide scavenger, mitoTEMPO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>; comparing black bars in lanes 2&amp;4). Importantly, cancer cells that did not internalize mitochondria were not affected by ROS quenching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>; comparing black bars in lanes 1&amp;3). These results indicate that transferred mitochondria promote proliferation in a ROS-dependent manner.</p><p>To test whether ROS accumulation can induce cancer cell proliferation directly, we stably expressed a mitochondrially localized photosensitizer, mito-KillerRed, which generates ROS when photobleached with 547 nm light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulina et al., 2006</xref>). As expected, photobleaching mito-KillerRed+ regions of interest induced ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bass et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We then drew mito-KillerRed+ regions of interest that mimicked the size of macrophage mitochondrial transfer to induce local ROS in cancer cells, and analyzed the rate of cell division by imaging these cells over 18 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). We found that cells with induced ROS (by photobleaching mito-KillerRed+ regions) exhibited an increased percentage of dividing cells compared to negative control photobleached cells (mito vs. cyto bleach; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b–c</xref>). These results indicate that induction of mitochondrially localized ROS can directly promote cancer cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ROS accumulation leads to ERK-dependent proliferation</title><p>We next aimed to determine how ROS induction may regulate cell proliferation.

After co-culturing 231-ERK-KTR cells with macrophages, we used the imaging flow cytometer, Amnis ImageStream, to compare relative ERK-KTR translocation values in hundreds of cells that had or had not received macrophage mitochondria (ERK-KTR quantification and ERK signaling validation described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). These data show that cancer cells with macrophage mitochondria have significantly higher cytoplasmic to nuclear (C/N) ERK-KTR ratios compared to cells that did not receive mitochondrial transfer, indicating increased ERK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a–b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Recipient cancer cells exhibit ERK-dependent proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) ImageStream was used to measure the MFI of an ERK-Kinase Translocation Reporter (ERK-KTR, orange) in the nucleus (DAPI, blue) or cytoplasm of co-cultured 231 cells that did (right) or did not (left) receive mitochondria (green, arrowhead).

By expressing both mito-KillerRed and ERK-KTR in 231 cells, we induced ROS by photobleaching mito-KillerRed+ regions and found that ROS induction increased ERK-KTR translocation, indicating that ROS induction is sufficient to increase ERK activity in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c</xref>). We next tested whether ERK signaling is required for the mitochondrial transfer-induced cancer cell proliferation. We first determined an effective concentration of SCH772984, an ERK inhibitor (ERKi), that still inhibits ERK activity, but does not dramatically affect 231 proliferation, as we sought to determine whether inhibiting ERK affects mitochondrial transfer-induced proliferation, not proliferation more generally. We first confirmed that treatment with this effective concentration of ERKi led to decreased ERK activity, as determined by the ERK-KTR translocation reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a–b</xref>). We then found that treatment with ERKi significantly decreased proliferation of recipient 231 cells when compared to vehicle control-treated recipient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4c</xref>). We further noted that the decrease in proliferation with this concentration of ERK inhibitor was observed only in cancer cells that received macrophage mitochondria, and not in cancer cells that did not receive macrophage mitochondria (bars 2&amp;4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, compared to bars 1&amp;3), suggesting that the ERK-dependent cell proliferation specifically occurs in cancer cells that received mitochondrial transfer. As a control, we also confirmed that ERKi treatment did not alter mitochondrial transfer efficiencies, showing that ERK signaling does not influence mitochondrial transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4d</xref>). Finally, similarly to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, we bath applied purified macrophage mitochondria to cancer cells in the presence of vehicle or ERKi and compared the proliferative capacity of cells that had internalized macrophage mitochondria versus cells that did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). We found that, as before, uptake of purified macrophage mitochondria increased the percentage of cancer cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, bars 1&amp;2), but that this process is ameliorated by the inhibition of ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, bars 2&amp;4). We also found that ERK inhibition did not affect the cell cycle state of cancer cells that had not taken up purified macrophage mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, bars 1&amp;3). Thus, these results indicate that mitochondrial transfer promotes cancer cells proliferation through a ROS/ERK-dependent mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>M2-like macrophages exhibits enhanced mitochondrial transfer rates</title><p>In many solid tumors, it has long been appreciated that macrophage density is associated with disease progression and poor patient prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pollard, 2004</xref>). Macrophages are highly plastic, altering their phenotypes, expression profiles and function, depending on environmental stimuli and conditional requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, macrophages exist in a spectrum of activation states but are canonically simplified by the two ends of spectrum: pro-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic M1-like macrophages; or anti-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic M2-like macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Since the ways in which M2-like macrophages promote tumor progression continue to be elucidated and given that there remains a dearth of understanding of how donor cell biology affects mitochondrial transfer, we aimed to determine how macrophage activation status affects intracellular mitochondrial dynamics and transfer efficiencies to cancer cells.</p><p>Activated macrophages were co-cultured with 231 cells, and we first quantified mitochondrial networks using Mitochondrial Network Analyses (MiNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Valente et al., 2017</xref>).

We then co-cultured 231 cells with either M0, M1-like, or M2-like macrophages and using flow cytometry, we found that mitochondrial transfer efficiencies were significantly increased from M2-like macrophages when compared to M1-like or non-activated M0 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Given that M2-like macrophages exhibited fragmented mitochondrial networks and enhanced mitochondrial transfer rates, we hypothesized that smaller mitochondrial fragments might be transferred more readily than larger networks. To test this hypothesis, we directly manipulated mitochondrial morphology by modulating a key regulator of mitochondrial fission, DRP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fonseca et al., 2019</xref>). Macrophages transduced with <italic>DRP1</italic>-shRNA containing lentivirus exhibited hyper-fused mitochondrial networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>) and exhibited decreased mitochondrial transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Together these findings reveal that macrophage activation alters mitochondrial dynamics, and that altering mitochondrial dynamics directly affects mitochondrial transfer rates. Finally, to determine whether the functionality of transferred mitochondria differ between macrophage subtypes, we evaluated the membrane potential of transferred mitochondria, and found that transferred mitochondria from M1-like and M2-like macrophages were similarly depolarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>), as to what we observed with M0 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

Previously literature had shown that healthy mitochondria are transferred, enhancing recipient cell viability by increasing ATP production and stimulating metabolic processes. Our observations, however, suggest that transferred mitochondria promote tumor cell proliferation as a byproduct of their potential dysfunctionality. This model raises several fascinating questions, including when and how transferred mitochondria become depolarized and accumulate ROS, where the ROS is generated in the recipient cell, and why depolarized mitochondria are not repaired or degraded in the recipient cell, given that 231 cells are capable of performing mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biel and Rao, 2018</xref>). Impaired mitophagy and enhanced mitochondrial dysfunction are hallmarks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), yet little is known about how age-related mitochondrial dysfunction influences mitochondrial transfer. Interestingly, instead of degrading dysfunctional mitochondria through mitophagy, neurons in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model have been shown to transfer dysfunctional mitochondria to neighboring astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lampinen et al., 2022</xref>), which contributes to neuronal mitochondrial homeostasis. Given that age is the greatest known risk factor of Alzheimer’s disease, and most cancers are also age-related, these data collectively warrant broader investigations into how age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to mitochondrial transfer and how this form of communication may have specific influences on distinct diseased states.</p><p>Cellular stress occurs throughout biological systems, and cells have evolved a myriad of mechanisms to cope with disadvantageous cellular conditions, including mitochondrial stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). Our results suggest that transferred mitochondria are a source for downstream signal activation through a ROS-ERK-mediated mechanism. The origin of ROS generation in recipient cells is still unclear, and how ROS locally accumulate at macrophage mitochondria is an open question. It is possible that ROS are generated by the transferred mitochondria themselves, as previous reports have shown that mitochondria with reduced membrane potential can generate ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franco-Iborra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakai et al., 2003</xref>). However, there are multiple mechanisms for ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), and it is possible that the ROS are generated elsewhere in the cell and accumulating at transferred mitochondria. A previous report showed that the endoplasmic reticulum can produce ROS in the presence of dysfunctional mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leadsham et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting another possible explanation. The questions of how ROS is generated, and how ROS can be spatially restricted to a specific subcompartment of the cell are exciting avenues of investigation and much further study. Although high levels of ROS are cytotoxic to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stadtman and Levine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fruhwirth and Hermetter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auten et al., 2002</xref>), physiological levels of ROS are known second messenger molecules stimulating various pro-survival signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schieber and Chandel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brillo et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, a modest increase of mitochondrial-derived ROS has been shown to exhibit protective mechanisms through mitohormesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crewe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ristow and Schmeisser, 2014</xref>), a process in which cellular defense mechanisms are stimulated by sub-lethal stress levels, protecting cells to withstand a secondary exposure. Mitochondrial transfer has been shown to promote resistance to subsequent chemotherapeutic treatments in healthy neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al., 2020</xref>) and tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boukelmoune et al., 2018</xref>), however the mechanism of this resistance is unclear. It is possible that mitochondrial transfer mediates this protective response through mitohormesis, promoting longevity and proliferation of the recipient cancer cells. More studies are required to connect mitochondrial transfer, sub-lethal cellular stress, and resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments in disease progression and tissue homeostasis.</p><p>The role of mitochondrial transfer has been largely studied in recipient cells. There remains a dearth of information describing how donor cells regulate mitochondrial transfer. Although intercellular mitochondrial transport has been implicated in the process of mitochondrial transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boukelmoune et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2014</xref>), we show that macrophage differentiation directly affects mitochondrial transfer through changes in their mitochondrial morphology. The relationship between macrophage differentiation and metabolism has been partially defined, with anti-tumor-like (M1-like) macrophages exhibiting more glycolytic metabolism, and pro-tumor-like (M2-like) macrophages upregulating oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Van den Bossche et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mortezaee and Majidpoor, 2022</xref>). But how mitochondrial morphology regulates metabolism is less understood. Studies have indicated that mitochondrial fusion supports increases oxidative phosphorylation in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao et al., 2019</xref>), however other studies have shown that increasing mitochondrial fission upregulates oxidative phosphorylation in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the correlation between mitochondrial morphology and cellular metabolic status is unclear, and these differences are likely due to different cell types and environmental conditions. While how the metabolic status of donor cells influences mitochondria is still unknown, our results support the hypothesis that pro-tumorigenic M2-like macrophage activation promotes mitochondrial fragmentation, and that mitochondrial fragmentation directly promotes mitochondrial transfer.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with several studies describing a metastatic advantage in cancer cells that receive exogenous mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zampieri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Merwe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying this behavior is unexpected. Studies examining mitochondrial transfer have typically used recipient cells with damaged or non-functional mitochondria, and the fate and function of donated mitochondria are rarely followed in recipient cells. Furthermore, it was largely unclear how transferred mitochondria can affect the behavior of recipient cells with functioning endogenous mitochondrial networks, particularly if the donated mitochondria only account for a small fraction of the total mitochondrial network in the recipient cell. Our work detailing how transferred mitochondria can activate downstream signaling pathways in response to ROS provides an explanation for how a relatively small amount of transferred mitochondria can generate a sustained behavioral response in recipient cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture of cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)</title><p>Human cell lines MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26), MDA-MB-468 (HTB-132), A375 (CRL-1619), THP-1 (TIB-202), MCF10A (CRL-10317), and the murine cell lines E0771 (CRL-3461) were directly purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured according to their recommendations.

Using a Leica Yokogawa CSU-W1 spinning disc confocal microscope equipped with a 2D-VisiFRAP Galvo System Multi-Point FRAP/Photoactivation module, MDA-MB-231 cells expressing mito-KillerRed and ERK-KTR-mClover were imaged every 1 minute with 561 nm (for mito-KillerRed) and 488 nm (for ERK-KTR-mClover) and 405 nm (for nuclei) lasers.

Using FIJI software, a ROI was drawn in the nucleus guided by the Hoescht staining, and the MFI of ERK-KTR-mClover was quantified in this region. The same ROI was moved outside of the nucleus to a cytoplasmic region devoid of mitochondria, and the MFI of ERK-KTR-mClover was quantified. This analysis was performed for each timepoint after photobleaching. The values were then used to calculate a cytoplasmic:nuclear ratio at each time point, and normalized to 1 at time point zero.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Quantification of ERK-KTR using the Amnis ImageStream</title><p>To quantify translocation of the ERK-KTR-mRuby we used the Amnis Imagestream mk II with ISX software (version 201.1.0.725). Mito-mEm macrophages were co-cultured with ERK-KTR-mRuby+MDA MB-231 cells for 24 hr. Samples were prepared as indicated in ‘quantification of Ki67 and DNA content’ section with the exception that we did not stain for intracellular markers. Images were captured with the 40 x objective and sample collect flow was set to low, as this allows for higher image resolution. Using Image Data Exploration and Analyses Software (IDEAS; version 6), we quantified translocation using two metrics: (1) the IDEAS translocation Wizard and (2) custom-generated program to detect cytoplasmic (cyto) and nuclear (nuc) ERK-KTR mean fluorescent intensities (MFI) to calculate a cyto:nuc ratio as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>. The translocation wizard is a pre-built program made to detect the nuclear translocation of a probe. It does this by making a pixel-by-pixel correlation between the probe of interest (ERK-KTR) and the nuclear image (DAPI). The program gives each cell a score indicating how similar the two fluorescent images are. A high score suggests the images are similar (more nuclear translocation) and a low score suggests that the images are less similar (less nuclear translocation). We also quantified ERK-KTR translocation by generating a custom masking strategy to quantify the mRuby MFI in the cytoplasm and nucleus using IDEAS software. To identify nuclear mRuby, we manually set a threshold of DAPI signal and reported the mRuby MFI of pixels within that threshold range. To quantify the cytoplasmic mRuby fraction we reported the mRuby MFI from outside the threshold. These values are then used to calculate a cyto:nuc ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>Drug treatments: ERKi, PMA and MitoTEMPO</title><p>SCH772984 (ERKi; 7101, SelleckChem) and Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; S7791, Selleckchem) was dissolved in 100% DMSO to make 10 mM stock solutions and stored at –80 °C. No individual aliquot went through more than 2 freeze-thaw cycles. The stock solution was thawed and then diluted directly into complete media for a final concentration of 1 μM for ERKi and 100 nM (cancer cell treatment) or 162 nM (THP-1 differentiation) for PMA. For all ERKi experiments, co-cultures were treated at the time of plating and for a duration of 24 hr. For PMA treatment of cancer cells the cells were plated the day prior and were treated for 1 hr prior to harvest and analysis. THP-1 cells were differentiated for 24 hr in PMA prior to harvest. To quench mitochondrial ROS, MitoTEMPO (Cayman Chemical, 16621) was formulated at 200 mM in 100% DMSO and diluted directly into warm complete media for a final concentration of 100 μM. MDA-MB-468 cells were treated for the duration of 24 hours as described in 'Mitochondrial isolation and bath application', and cells were harvested for proliferative capacity analyses as previously in ‘Quantification of Ki67 and DNA content’.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Benoît Kornmann as the Senior Editor.</p><p>As you will see below, the reviewers found the work to be of potential interest but raised significant concerns that would require additional experimentation prior to consideration of a revised version. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>All three reviewers found the paper to have interesting implications for many fields-- from mitochondrial biology to cancer biology and beyond-- and to employ multiple convincing methods to demonstrate transfer of mitochondria with potential to alter recipient cell function. At the same time, all reviewers raised similar concerns about the strength and validity of the proposed model. A key question raised by all 3 reviewers is how the transferred mitochondria produce ROS in the absence of a membrane potential. A related concern is that mitoTEMPO, the antioxidant used to show that quenching ROS dissipates the pro-mitogenic signal of transferred mitochondria, relies on membrane potential to accumulate within mitochondria. Therefore, whether the ROS are made specifically by transferred mitochondria to control cell signaling is not fully demonstrated at this time. Revisions to address these central questions are discussed below. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers each shared several major concerns. For completeness, I am including the entire reviewer remarks below to provide full context for all requested revision. Here, I summarize the three key essential revision requirements alongside other major/minor points that should be addressed. Reviewer points where data would be welcome, but not required, are specifically noted at the end.</p><p>Essential questions:</p><p>1. How can defective mitochondria produce ROS? If they do not have membrane potential, are they respiring? If not, do they have functional electron transfer reactions that can generate ROS? As mitoTEMPO accumulates in mitochondria as a result of membrane potential, the relevance of these experiments are not clear. (Please see full comments below for more reviewer context.)</p><p>2. A related questions is whether ROS is generated specifically by the transferred mitochondria? Use of mitoTEMPO in quenching ROS may illustrate that the ROS is not coming from transferred mitochondria, or the transferred mitochondria regain membrane potential, as this antioxidant like other triphenylphosphonium-based antioxidants accumulate based on membrane potential. The authors partially address this with barcoded biosensors, but this hampers the ROS-arguments in the paper, and the authors should readdress interpretations. Related, ROS quenching and ERK inhibition only affect proliferation when it is done in transferred mitochondria. Why don't ROS and ERK affect proliferation in control cells? (See comments by Reviewer #1 and #2, below.)</p><p>3. How much of the transferred mitochondria and/or mitochondrial ROS is beneficial? (See full comment from Reviewer #3 below.)</p><p>Other essential reviewer comments to address:</p><p>– Figure 1c.

Why does the recipient cell need to be cancerous (referring to the MCF10A experiment). Is there sufficient experimental evidence for this claim. Can the authors speculate on the regulation of mitochondrial uptake by cancer cells, specifically, in vitro?</p><p>Figure 1g. The authors aim to isolate mitochondria from macrophages and test the ability of isolated mitochondria in promoting proliferation in cancer cell lines. The authors performed a crude mitochondrial isolation protocol here, without sucrose or percoll gradient ultracentrifugation to purify mitochondria from associated endoplasmic reticulum. The authors do not illustrate the extent of purification of the isolated mitochondria. This makes the data difficult to interpret, and the effects of ER contamination on proliferation are not controlled for. We suggest the authors perform this experiment with an ultracentrifuge-purified sample. Alternatively, mito-tag approaches can be used to IP intact mitochondria from cells.</p><p>Figure 1 – Supplement 2a. The authors perform single-cell RNAseq in MDA-MB-231 +/- macrophage mitochondria. Can the authors comment on the duration of mitochondrial uptake in these cells prior to RNAseq? Is it an acute proliferative response (gene expression program) to the uptake of mitochondria (short-term), or a robust adaptation (long-term). The authors indicate that the daughter cells exhibit sustained increases in growth rates – can the authors then indicate the time of RNAseq? Also, in line with ROS signaling in the following experiments – were the proliferative program observed in Figure 1 – Sup 2a ROS dependent?</p><p>Figure 2. General comment regarding transferred mitochondria without membrane potential. Are these mitochondria respiring? Where is the source of ROS coming from, and how is the membrane potential dissipated if these mitochondria are in fact respiring? Is this through reverse ATP synthase activity as it occurs in mitochondrial deleted cells? Can the authors illustrate the capacity at which these macrophage-mitochondria are respiring? Can the authors show that the ROS is specific to the transferred mitochondria and not an off-target ROS generation? Use of mitoTEMPO in quenching ROS may illustrate that the ROS is not coming from your transferred mitochondria, or the transferred mitochondria regain membrane potential. This antioxidant, and other triphenylphosphonium-based antioxidants accumulate based on membrane potential. The authors partially address this with barcoded biosensors, but this hampers the ROS-arguments in the paper, and the authors should readdress interpretations.</p><p>Figure 3. Similar as figure 2. The authors illustrate activation of ERK by photobleaching induced ROS. Although this illustrates that ROS activates ERK in this system, the authors do not illustrate that this ROS originates from macrophage mitochondria. As the authors mention, it is known that ROS induces ERK signaling. This section appears to further validate known mechanisms of ERK activation without connecting to the transferred mitochondria.</p><p>Figure 4. The authors illustrate that M2-macrophages exhibit enhanced mitochondrial transfer efficiency than M1. This supports the notion that M2 macrophages are pro-tumorigenic, here by a novel mechanism. Further data illustrating mitochondrial fission as an important regulator of the transfer process, as DRP1 knockdown with shRNA attenuates transfer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the paper is convincing of its primary points, but expounding on some aspects is warranted to contextualize these findings with respect to the dose response of the effects and to address other studies on mitochondrial transfer in the literature:</p><p>1) How much transferred mitochondria and/or mitochondrial ROS is beneficial?</p><p>While the benefits of ROS in some contexts have been increasingly appreciated, ROS are also well known to cause deleterious effects at higher doses. The authors conclude that transferred mitochondria promote proliferation through mitochondrial ROS activation of ERK, but some understanding of the boundaries of this effect would help with interpretation. Some potential approaches to address this issue could include: Are there dose responsive effects with respect to proliferation or ERK signaling amongst cells with different numbers or volumes of transferred mitochondria? Is there a dose response to the cell cycle changes from macrophage mitochondria bath dosages corresponding to the number of mitochondria transferred? What range of mito-KillerRed activation is beneficial, and at what point is it deleterious?</p><p>2) How do we reconcile the finding that transferred macrophage mitochondria are persistently dysfunctional?</p><p>As the authors noted, the literature has focused on situations where mitochondrial transfer can repopulate functional mitochondria in cancer cells with endogenously dysfunctional mitochondria, but here the authors conclude that transferred mitochondria are persistently dysfunctional in recipient cells. While this discrepancy is not likely to be entirely solved here, some simple experiments could help put context on the salient differences between studies by addressing how their biological system might influence the results: Can transfer of macrophage mitochondria reconstitute mitochondrial function of rho zero cells? Does transfer of mitochondria amongst 231 cell populations (e.g.. transfer of 231 cell mitochondria expressing mito-RFP to 231 cells expressing mito-mEmerald) also result in persistently dysfunctional mitochondria in recipient cells? Do mEmerald expressing macrophages have functional mitochondria prior to mitochondrial transfer?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85494.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Essential questions:</p><p>1.

However, our rationale for the mito-KillerRed experiments is to experimentally test whether inducing small amounts of ROS is sufficient to promote cell division, regardless of the source. We used mitochondrially localized KillerRed as we wanted to control for the photobleaching procedure itself – ie. if KillerRed were spatially localized, then we can photobleach a KillerRed-negative region as a control. It is not possible to quantify the exact amount of ROS in cancer cells with macrophage mitochondria, but our experiments show that cancer cells with macrophage mitochondria have increased intracellular ROS, the biosensor experiments suggest that ROS is in a localized region at transferred mitochondria (Figure 2c,d), and that quenching ROS specifically inhibits proliferation of cancer cells with macrophage mitochondria, without affecting cancer cell proliferation more broadly (Figure 2f). From these results, we aimed to produce small amounts of ROS by photobleaching small 2µm x 2µm regions of interest, and determining whether this small amount of ROS production is sufficient to cause cell division, regardless of where the ROS is generated. If we performed similar experiments with cytoplasmic KillerRed (not mitochondrially-localized), we would expect the same response, although the negative control photobleaching would be much harder to perform, which is why we opted to use the mitochondrially-localized KillerRed. The outcome of this experiment is that inducing small amounts of ROS is sufficient to induce proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, it appears that the mito-Grx1-roGFP2 sensors are encoded in the recipient cells; how do these sensors then become localized to the transferred mitochondria?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question, and one that we have thought about as well. Yes, the mito-Grx1-roGFP2 sensor is encoded in the recipient cells. The construct contains an MTS from an ATP synthase that targets it to the mitochondria. Due to the reduced membrane potential, we do not know whether the sensor is imported into the mitochondria, although it is possible that some of the mitoGrx1-roGFP2 sensor is inserted into the transferred mitochondria, if the transferred mitochondria retain very low levels of membrane potential (low enough to not be detected by the membrane potential-sensitive dyes). Regardless of whether the sensor is imported into the mitochondria, we interpret our findings to suggest that the Grx1-roGFP2 sensor is targeted to the transferred mitochondria, and the sensor is reading out the oxidized versus reduced forms of Grx1 at that site, even if it is not imported into the mitochondria. Our understanding from the literature and from discussions with our metabolism colleagues is that the sensor does not need to be inserted into the transferred mitochondria to show the redox state of Grx1 in the vicinity of the transferred mitochondria, and that the strength of protein insertion is dependent on the specific MTS and the protein it is fused to (Schafer, Bozkurt et al. 2022). For example, PINK contains an MTS, and can still localize and be processed by mitochondria in the absence of membrane potential (Becker, Richter et al. 2012). PINK1 can also be retained at the outer mitochondrial membrane in the absence of an MTS altogether, thereby suggesting that mitochondrial insertion is not required for maintained mitochondrial localization (Zhou, Huang et al. 2008, Liu, Vives-Bauza et al. 2009, Weihofen, Thomas et al. 2009). Our work shows that reactive oxygen species accumulate at the site of transferred mitochondria using two different biosensors. We think that the biosensor is constantly in flux, with a constant flow of Grx1-roGFP2 targeted to mitochondria, and becoming oxidized at the transferred mitochondria. We tried to test this hypothesis by performing FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) experiments of the biosensor at transferred mitochondria and quantifying fluorescence recovery over time. We observed recovery of the biosensor at transferred mitochondria, with the biosensor primarily showing the oxidized version of Grx1 at this site, but due to the dynamic nature of the mitochondria, the transferred mitochondria were hard to track without overlapping with endogenous mitochondria, which distorted the quantification. As a result, we could not reliably quantify the FRAP. However, we have included representative images at time points from these experiments before and after photobleaching. The cancer cell is expressing mito-Grx1-roGFP2. Macrophage mitochondria are red, and an arrowhead marks the macrophage mitochondria that we followed after photobleaching. The zoom panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> highlights the macrophage mitochondria targeted for photobleaching as a merged image (showing red transferred mitochondria outlined in gray; yellow oxidized-Grx1; and green reduced-Grx1), and then an oxidized-Grx1 only panel to better visualize this state. Before photobleaching the sensor, we can visualize the oxidized form of mito-Grx-roGFP2 at the site of transferred mitochondria in “A”. We then photobleached the sensor at transferred mitochondria in “B”. We know that we photobleached the sensor at this site, as we visualized decreased levels of oxidized Grx1-roGFP2 in the right-most panel of “B”. 40 seconds after photobleaching, the sensor returns to the site of transferred mitochondria in “C”. To ensure that the oxidized form of mito-Grx1-roGFP2 is tracking with the transferred macrophage mitochondria, we also looked another 5 seconds later, and can still visualize enriched oxidized Grx1 at that site in “D”. We interpret these preliminary results to suggest that the sensor is in flux and can continually target to transferred mitochondria.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85494-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Thus, while we cannot comment on whether or how much of the sensor is inserted into the transferred mitochondria, nor can we perform experiments to quantify the extent of Grx1-roGFP2 processing by these mitochondria due to the lack of protein input for biochemical assays, we interpret these data as ROS accumulates at the site of transferred mitochondria, which in itself was an unexpected and exciting discovery, and a central finding of the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We performed these critical experiments to specifically test whether ROS/ERK inhibition affects the proliferative capacity of cancer cells <italic>with macrophage mitochondria</italic>, as opposed to proliferation generally. We show representative ERKi data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> – We tested 5 different ERKi concentrations, and evaluated both inhibition of ERK activity (as measured by flow cytometry quantifying the activated phosphorylated ERK, p-ERK, in “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>”), as well as changes to the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (black bar in graph in “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>”). These preliminary results showed that both 0.3µM and 1µM ERKi inhibited ERK activity, but did not affect the G2/M phase of the cell cycle in cultured 231 cancer cells alone (n=1 biological replicate; n=3 technical replicates). Thus, we used the 1 µM ERKi for subsequent coculture assays in the manuscript (Figure 3e,f; each with n=3 biological replicates). We have made modifications to the text to better articulate this important point.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85494-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How much of the transferred mitochondria and/or mitochondrial ROS is beneficial? (See full comment from Reviewer #3 below.)</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. We have addressed this question by performing some of the experiments suggested by this reviewer. To determine whether there are dose responsive effects with respect to proliferation or ERK signaling amongst cells with different amounts of transferred mitochondria, we analyzed populations of cancer cells with either “high” or “low” amounts of transferred macrophage mitochondria. These “high” and “low” designations were determined by taking into the account the median FITC fluorescence intensity for cancer cells with transferred mitochondria, while maintaining equal numbers of cancer cells in both the “high” and “low” population to avoid calculating percentages on small numbers of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3A</xref> for representative gating). We then analyzed the percentages of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3B</xref>, statistics shown specifically for the proliferative G2/M phase of the cell cycle). Both the “high” and “low” populations showed an increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle compared to the “no transfer” population, consistent with what we report in the manuscript, but we found no difference <italic>between</italic> the “high” and “low” populations suggesting that the amount of macrophage mitochondrial transfer to cancer cells observed in our system did not affect cell cycle stages in a dose-dependent manner.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>A.</title><p>Representative gating strategy for “low” vs “high” macrophage mitochondrial transfer in macrophage/cancer cell cocultures.

Similar to our proliferation results, we did not observe differences in ERK activity between the “high” and “low” mitochondrial transfer populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3C</xref>). With the ERK-KTR biosensor, we are also able to quantify ERK activity on a cell-by-cell basis, thus we analyzed each cell and graphed ERK activity (y-axis) with respect the fluorescence intensity of mitochondrial transfer in the same cell (x-axis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3D</xref>). We did not observe a positive correlation between the amount of mitochondrial transfer and ERK activity (R<sup>2</sup> value: 3.261e-005).</p><p>Finally, we determined whether there was a dose response to cell cycle changes with macrophage mitochondrial bath applications. Similar to our analysis with cocultures in Figure A, we divided the cancer cell population into “high” vs “low” mitochondrial uptake (Figure E), and analyzed cell cycle stages (Figure F). We did not observe dose-dependent cell cycle changes in response to macrophage mitochondrial uptake.</p><p>Together, these results suggest that cancer cells with macrophage mitochondria exhibit increased ERK activity and increased proliferation, and that the increased ERK activity and proliferation does not show a dose-dependent response to mitochondrial transfer. We hypothesize that the mitochondrial transfer, and the subsequent ROS accumulation, that we observe within this system show beneficial (proliferation-promoting) effects, and is not within the boundaries of inducing deleterious effects.</p><p>Consistent with this hypothesis, previous reports using KillerRed either induce cell death or generate phototoxic damage (Bulina, Chudakov et al. 2006, Li, Fang et al. 2019). These approaches typically use high laser settings, irradiate the whole cell, and use long and continuous illumination times in the order of several minutes (Bulina, Chudakov et al. 2006, Williams, Bejjani et al. 2013, Kuznetsova, Shirmanova et al. 2015, Li, Fang et al. 2019). Our approaches with mito-KillerRed use small, 2 m x 2 m, regions of interest and illumination on the 5-10 seconds time scale, and thus suggest that we are likely generating low levels of ROS (as indicated by Figure 3 – Figure S5), and not near the ROS levels that induce cell death.</p><p>We did not include these data into the manuscript as we were not clear what additional insights the findings added to the work given that we did not observe a dose-dependent effect, however we would be happy to do so, if the reviewers prefer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other essential reviewer comments to address:</p><p>– Figure 1c. Why does the recipient cell need to be cancerous (referring to the MCF10A experiment). Is there sufficient experimental evidence for this claim?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have evidence that the recipient cell needs to be cancerous to receive macrophage mitochondria. The MCF10A result shows that macrophages exhibit decreased transfer efficiencies to MCF10A than the other three malignant cell lines we tested. We do think that macrophage mitochondrial transfer can occur to non-malignant cell lines as illustrated in other published work (Nicolas-Avila, Lechuga-Vieco et al. 2020, Brestoff, Wilen et al. 2021, Liu, Wu et al. 2022, van der Vlist, Raoof et al. 2022, Yang, Yokomori et al. 2022), but it is not clear whether the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS accumulation occurs in these systems. We have adjusted the language in the text to reflect this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1 – Supplement 2a. In line with ROS signaling in the following experiments – were the proliferative program observed in Figure 1 – Sup 2a ROS dependent?</p></disp-quote><p>The single cell RNA sequencing results were unfortunately not performed in the presence of mitoTEMPO. While we are unable to answer this specific question with the scRNA sequencing results, we were able to show complementary experiments that the proliferative response observed in cancer cells with macrophage mitochondria can be ameliorated with the addition of mitoTEMPO with a cell-based assay (Figure 2f).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors show in Figure 2 that it takes 48 h for mitochondria to become oxidized. In Figure 1 it appears that the proliferation benefit occurs as early as 24 h of coculture. How do the authors reconcile these timescales?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if it wasn’t clear. The result in Figure 2D with the mito-Grx1-roGRP2 was within 24 hours, which is the same time frame as the proliferation phenotype (also at 24 hours). We have made the time point clearer in the figure legend.</p><p>References:</p><p>Akhter, W., J. Nakhle, L. Vaillant, G. Garcin, C. Le Saout, M. Simon, C. Crozet, F. Djouad, C. Jorgensen, M. L.
