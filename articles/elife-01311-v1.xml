While this predicts an accumulation of genes, the gene number has remained remarkably constant through evolution. This paradox has not yet been resolved. Because orphan genes have been mainly analyzed over long evolutionary time scales, orphan loss has remained unexplored. Here we study the patterns of orphan turnover among close relatives in the <italic>Drosophila obscura</italic> group. We show that orphans are not only emerging at a high rate, but that they are also rapidly lost. Interestingly, recently emerged orphans are more likely to be lost than older ones. Furthermore, highly expressed orphans with a strong male-bias are more likely to be retained. Since both lost and retained orphans show similar evolutionary signatures of functional conservation, we propose that orphan loss is not driven by high rates of sequence evolution, but reflects lineage-specific functional requirements.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01311.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01311.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01311.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>New genes are added to most genomes on a steady basis. A new gene can either begin as a copy of an existing gene from elsewhere in the genome, or is created entirely ‘from scratch’ from a DNA sequence that had not previously encoded for a protein. New genes that are not found in other related species are called orphan genes—and these genes can account for up to 30% of all the genes in the well-studied genomes. However, for reasons that are not fully understood, the total number of genes in most genomes remains fairly constant despite these regular additions. Now, Palmieri et al. have investigated this paradox by following the evolutionary fate of orphan genes in a small group of related species of fruit fly.</p><p>Palmieri et al. discovered that most orphan genes are very short-lived, even though they showed clear signals of carrying out important functions. Most orphan genes died out quickly due to mutations that made them unable to be expressed as functional proteins, and a small number were deleted entirely from the genome. Unexpectedly, new orphan genes were more likely to die out than those that had been around for a while.</p><p>Palmieri et al. also found that the expression levels of orphan genes determined their probability of dying with those genes that were expressed to the highest levels being most likely to persist longer. Furthermore, genes that were expressed more in males than in females were also less likely to die. The next challenge will be to identify the mechanisms that determine which orphan genes survive and which do not.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01311.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01311.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>gene gain</kwd><kwd>gene loss</kwd><kwd>sex-biased expression</kwd><kwd>evolutionary rate</kwd><kwd>D. pseudoobscura</kwd><kwd>pseudogenes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Austrian Science Funds (FWF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P22834</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlötterer</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The short lifetime of orphan genes is a major factor explaining the stability of gene number in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Orphans are genes with limited phylogenetic distribution and represent a considerable fraction (up to 30%) of the gene catalog in all sequenced genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khalturin et al., 2009</xref>).

While gene duplication and exaptation from transposable elements often result in orphan genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Toll-Riera et al., 2009</xref>), they also originate frequently de novo from non-coding DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heinen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knowles and McLysaght, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang and Huang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neme and Tautz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu and Zhang, 2013</xref>), probably through intermediate proto-genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>). Compared to evolutionary conserved genes, orphans are overall shorter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lipman et al., 2002</xref>), fast evolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2003</xref>), have lower and more tissue-restricted expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lemos et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, they often show testis-biased expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begun et al., 2007</xref>), probably due to frequent origination in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaessmann, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the rate of orphan emergence is particulary high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Domazet-Loso et al., 2007</xref>) and many orphans become quickly essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Although the function of only a few orphan genes has been studied, it has been proposed that orphans might serve an important role in speciation and adaptation to different environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khalturin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khalturin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colbourne et al., 2011</xref>). The high rate of orphan origination would predict an increase in gene content over time. However, gene content in eukaryotes is remarkably stable compared to genome size, as highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tautz and Domazet-Loso (2011)</xref>. To solve this paradox Tautz and Domazet-Loso proposed that orphans have only a short lifetime (‘rapid-turnover’ hypothesis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tautz and Domazet-Loso, 2011</xref>). Thus, although orphans are continuously created, most of them might be lost in a relatively short evolutionary time. Relaxed selective costraints in orphans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai and Petrov, 2010</xref>) might also contribute to the high rate of orphan loss.</p><p>Moreover, since orphans are typically identifed by the comparison of distantly related species, their evolutionary stability has been so far neglected. This contrasts the comprehensive analysis of evolutionary patterns of gains and losses of non-orphan genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hahn et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, several partially interrelated factors affect gene loss, including gene expression levels, number of protein–protein interactions, gene dispensability, and rate of sequence evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krylov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai and Petrov, 2010</xref>).</p><p>This study focuses for the first time on the evolutionary stability of orphan genes. We investigate the factors contributing to orphan loss and find that orphan age, male-biased gene expression, and microsatellite content are correlated with orphan stability. Surprisingly, differences in evolutionary rates cannot explain orphan loss and we propose that orphan loss is driven by lineage-specific evolutionary constraints. Overall, orphan genes are lost at a significantly higher rate than non-orphan genes, supporting the ‘rapid-turnover’ hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Orphans are commonly detected by BLASTing the genes of a given organism against a set of outgroup species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Toll-Riera et al., 2009</xref>). A BLASTP cutoff of 10<sup>−3</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> was found to be optimal to maximize sensitivity and specificity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2003</xref>). To identify orphans we used a BLASTP cutoff of 10<sup>−4</sup> combined with a TBLASTN cutoff of 10<sup>−4</sup>, to exclude genes with unannotated orthologs in other species. Following these criteria, we searched in <italic>Drosophila pseudoobscura</italic> for genes with no sequence conservation in 10 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species outside the <italic>Drosophila obscura</italic> group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In total, we identified 1152 orphans, corresponding to 7% of all the <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> genes. Our estimate is slightly lower than a previous one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), due to our different filtering procedure, but still consistent with a high rate of orphan gain in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Domazet-Loso et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wissler et al., 2013</xref>). Our data clearly indicate that orphan genes are subject to purifying selection, as they show several hallmarks of functional protein-coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1, 2</xref>). A comparison of orphan genes preserved between <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> and <italic>D. affinis</italic> resulted in a distribution of <italic>dN/dS</italic> significantly lower than 1 with a median of 0.44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p&lt;1.0 × 10<sup>−15</sup>), as expected for protein-coding sequences. Moreover, <italic>dN/dS</italic> for orphans is significantly lower (Mann–Whitney test, p=2.7 × 10<sup>−14</sup>) than <italic>dN/dS</italic> calculated on a random set of intergenic regions with the same length distribution of orphans (see ‘Materials and methods’, section ‘Evolutionary rates’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with this, we also found orphans to be more conserved than intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The codon usage bias of orphans is intermediate to that of old genes and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01311.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Orphans are subject to purifying selection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>dN/dS</italic> of <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> and <italic>D. affinis</italic> orthologs. <italic>dN/dS</italic> is lowest for old genes, but also orphan genes have <italic>dN/dS</italic> smaller than one.

If orphan genes emerge at a higher rate on the X-chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levine et al., 2006</xref>), the shorter history of X-linkage on the neo-X could explain the paucity of orphans on the neo-X compared to old-X. In this case, the difference in orphan number between old-X and neo-X chromosomes should date back to the time before the origin of the neo-X, with a similar number of orphans originating after the creation of the neo-X. We therefore used the genomic sequences of five members of the <italic>D. obscura</italic> group (<italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richards et al., 2005</xref>], <italic>D. miranda</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou and Bachtrog, 2012</xref>], and the de novo assembled <italic>D. persimilis</italic>, <italic>D. lowei</italic>, and <italic>D. affinis</italic>) to date the origin of the orphan genes to different ancestral nodes in the phylogenetic tree of these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beckenbach et al., 1993</xref>).

Surprisingly, we observed a consistent paucity of orphans on XR relative to XL across all age classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This persistent difference in orphan number between XL and XR in all age classes suggests that X-linkage is not sufficient to explain the enrichment of orphans on XL.

The oldest orphans in our dataset (age class 4) show a pronounced excess of pseudogenized orphans on XR in <italic>D. affinis</italic> and <italic>D. miranda</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This trend was not observed for orphans that emerged on XR after the XL–XR fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>), nor for old genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) and is not due to an increased rate of orphan gain on XR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Since the oldest orphans (age class 4) on XR are a mixture of autosomal (i.e., before the fusion) and sex-chromosomal (i.e., after the fusion) orphans, we speculate that the high rate of pseudogenization of orphans on the XR may reflect the new X-linkage of previously autosomal orphans. A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meisel et al., 2009</xref>) found that the XR chromosome has experienced a burst of gene duplications to autosomes after its creation. It is plausible that after the conversion of the XR from autosome to sex-chromosome, orphans might have been duplicated to autosomes, whereas the XR ancestral copy would have become pseudogenized. To test this hypothesis, we looked for evidence of gene duplications for the orphans lost on the XR at node 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We aligned the sequences of these genes in <italic>D. lowei</italic> and <italic>D. miranda</italic> to the respective genomes using BLASTN (cutoff 10<sup>−5</sup>). Upon manual inspection of the alignments, we found that only 1 out of 21 genes in <italic>D. miranda</italic> (gene ID: GA23486) and 1 out of 14 genes in <italic>D. lowei</italic> (gene ID: GA23807) had a second hit on an autosome covering at least 50% of the length of the query gene. Other genes either produced a single best hit on the XR chromosome or spurious short hits on other chromosomes (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that duplication of orphans cannot explain the excess of pseudogenized orphans on XR. Nevertheless, our analysis clearly indicates that the emergence of the neo-X chromosome influenced the orphan dynamics on XR, affecting rates of both gain and loss, thus we excluded this chromosome arm for our analyses of the rate of orphan turnover.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01311.013</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Orphans predating the XL-XR fusion are preferentially lost on the neo-X.</title><p>For three terminal branches (<italic>D. lowei</italic>, <italic>D. miranda</italic>, and <italic>D. persimilis</italic>) the fraction of lost genes for each age class is shown.

In the <italic>D. persimilis</italic> lineage, orphan pseudogenization can be studied for three different age classes. If orphans of all age classes were functionally equivalent, no difference in the rate of orphan pseudogenization would be expected. We observe, however, that the fraction of orphan pseudogenes decreases with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The <italic>D. miranda</italic> lineage also shows a higher loss of young orphan genes. The relatively small number of observations, however, precludes statistical testing of this trend. Overall, orphan genes are lost significantly more often than old genes (Fisher’s exact test, p=3.3 × 10<sup>−8</sup>), consistent with the rapid turnover hypothesis. The unequal conservation of orphans of different age classes is also apparent after normalizing by coding sequence length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), to account for the fact that longer coding sequences (CDS) have a greater chance of acquiring ORF-disrupting mutations. When looking at the distribution of premature termination codons (PTC) along the open reading frame (ORF) of all genes, we observed that PTCs are enriched at the beginning and at the end of the ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>), consistent with previous results in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Reinhardt, 2012</xref>) and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoehn et al., 2012</xref>). Since ORF-disrupting mutations occuring at the end of the ORF might have little impact on gene function, we redefined pseudogenes by considering only ORF-disrupting mutations localized in the first half of the ORF and confirmed that orphans of age class 3 are lost more often than those of age class 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). Age class 2 was intermediate, most likely not reflecting a biological phenomenon, but due to a high sampling variance associated with the small number of observations (9 orphans). Finally, the pattern is also robust to a more conservative criterion for ortholog assignment (see ‘Annotation of the <italic>obscura</italic> species’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01311.015</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Young orphan genes are more likely to be lost.</title><p>The barplot shows the fraction of orphans that has acquired a frameshift or premature stop codon (i.e., lost function).

This pattern could be generated by pervasive gene expression in testis, which facilitates the functional recruitment of non-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaessmann, 2010</xref>). Another explanation is that expression in testis does not require a complex architecture of regulatory modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sassone-Corsi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kleene, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaessmann, 2010</xref>), so that fewer substitutions are required to obtain a functional regulatory module for expressing a novel gene in testis compared to other tissues. We scrutinized these explanations by comparing the fraction of male-biased genes among orphan genes from different age classes. Unexpectedly, the fraction of male-biased genes increases with the age of the orphan genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>). This increase of male-biased orphans among the older age classes is the result of a preferential loss of orphans with an unbiased gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18</xref>).

Previous studies showed a high rate of orphan gain, which is not reflected in an increase in gene number. To resolve this apparent paradox, it has been postulated that orphans must be lost at a high rate as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tautz and Domazet-Loso, 2011</xref>). In this study, we used the framework of closely related species in the <italic>obscura</italic> group to study the patterns of orphan gain and losses. We show that orphans not only emerge at high rates, but that they are also rapidly lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Interestingly, most losses (∼76%) were due to disabling mutations rather than deletions of the orphan gene. Although under equilibrium conditions the number of losses balances the number of orphan gains, here, we observed a surplus of orphan gains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We caution that this discrepancy probably does not imply an increase of gene number, but rather reflects the limited evolutionary time to acquire mutations. Using a rather conservative criterion for disabling mutations, either premature stop codons or frameshift indels, we have probably not identified all orphans that have lost their function. Furthermore, we do not account for the possibility of loss of function due to changes in gene regulation.</p><p>Importantly, codon usage bias, <italic>dN/dS</italic> values and sequence conservation clearly suggest that orphan genes are functionally constrained and these constraints do not differ among orphans that are conserved in the <italic>obscura</italic> group and those that lost function in at least one species of the group. Hence, it may be possible that orphan loss is stochastic and reflects weak purifying selection. Nevertheless, lost orphans differ in some aspects from conserved ones. Orphans that are lost contain more microsatellite stretches and have a lower, less sex-biased gene expression than retained ones. Furthermore, we also found that the rate of orphan loss decreases with orphan age, a result consistent with orphans serving a functional role only temporarily. Previous work suggested that orphans are important for adaptation to novel environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khalturin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colbourne et al., 2011</xref>), but it is also possible that orphans contribute to stabilize new connections in gene networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Warnefors and Eyre-Walker, 2011</xref>) and become obsolete once such new connections have been optimized. Our data suggest that orphans become quickly functional, which is reflected in their codon usage bias, <italic>dN/dS</italic> ratio and sequence conservation.</p><p>The chromosomal translocation resulting in the neo-X chromosome provides another interesting perspective on the evolution of orphan genes. Despite the fact that the neo-X is now fully dosage compensated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Lucchesi, 1974</xref>), and has obtained a similar base composition as the XL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallach et al., 2007</xref>), we noted that the translocation resulted in a preferential loss of orphan genes on the neo-X. Since this pattern is restricted to orphans that most likely originated before the chromosomal fusion, we argue that the change in chromosomal environment has affected the function of orphan genes, most likely via expression differences. We speculate that the selective advantage conferred by these orphans has diminished, which resulted in a higher loss rate. Interestingly, the elevated rate of orphan loss after the neo-X formation seems to be still ongoing. This differential loss of orphan genes point in a similar direction as the observation that the gene composition of the neo-X has been altered by gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meisel et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, both (orphan) gene loss and duplication contribute to fast gene content remodeling on a newly formed sex chromosome in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Species data collection</title><p>An individual species sample of <italic>D. affinis</italic> (stock number 140120141.02) was ordered from the Drosophila Species Stock Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://stockcenter.ucsd.edu/info/welcome.php">https://stockcenter.ucsd.edu/info/welcome.php</ext-link>) and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx following the paired-end library preparation protocol (version Illumina 1.7) in two runs (run 1: read length = 101 bp, insert size = 230 bp; run 2: read length = 101 bp, insert size = 550 bp).

For each gene, the best unambiguous hit was retained. To remove non-informative hits, we also required a minimum fraction of the gene to be recovered. Since the sequence conservation of orthologs decreases with divergence time, the expected length of the ortholog depends strongly on the phylogenetic distance between query and subject sequence. To apply consistent criteria for all species, we empirically determined the expected fraction of a gene with sequence homology. Based on genes that are conserved between <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> and the 10 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species outside the <italic>obscura</italic> clade (old genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), we determined the distribution of the fraction of the genes that could be aligned. As cutoff the value we used the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of the distribution of aligned protein length of old genes. This resulted in a threshold of 47% for <italic>D. affinis</italic>, 52% for <italic>D. lowei</italic>, 59% for <italic>D. miranda</italic> and 53% for <italic>D. persimilis</italic>. Hence, only orphan orthologs that showed a fraction of aligned coding sequence higher than the empirically determined cutoffs were retained. In addition to this ortholog set, we generated an alternative, more conservative ortholog set.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors discuss an interesting topic on life cycle of <italic>Drosophila</italic> orphan genes. They investigated the features of orphan genes in the <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> group based on an extensive new genomic dataset and by further analyses on substitution rate, gain/loss, and expression pattern of them they found that the orphan genes experienced purifying selection, and highly expressed orphan genes with strong male-bias are more likely to be retained. They proposed that orphan gene loss reflects lineage specific functional requirements.</p><p>The dataset consists of one newly sequenced genome as well as new assemblies of other genomes from read archives. The analysis is mostly solid and convincing. Overall, the paper represents a significant step forward in the field, but it requires further clarification of technical issues before it can be considered for acceptance in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The following comments are condensed from the comments of the three referees.</p><p><italic>Referee 1</italic>:</p><p>My major comment concerning the methodology concerns the procedure to classify a “loss”. They say in the Methods section: “ Based on a set of orthologs in the obscura group, pseudogenes were identified by the presence of an intact ORF”, but Figure 9–figure supplement 2 shows that a large number of such disruptions occur in the last 10% of the reading frame (this is actually an interesting result that should not be relegated to the supplements). These might not be function-disabling mutations. I suggest to check relative conservation levels along the ORFs to assess this question or treat these genes differently in the overall comparisons.</p><p>My major comment concerning data analysis is towards the exclusive use of <italic>D. miranda</italic> for calculating divergence levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Why is this not done for all species in the tree? And why <italic>D. miranda</italic>, rather than the newly sequenced <italic>D. affinis</italic> that is at the base of the comparisons?</p><p>All figures that support relevant data discussed in the text should be in the paper – supplementary figures should only be used for further clarifications.</p><p><italic>Referee 2</italic>:</p><p>1) Loss of orphan genes is a key point of this study. To make the results convincing, calculation on gene gains and loses should be described in detail.</p><p>2) How exactly was the “intergenic” dataset constructed?</p><p><italic>Referee 3</italic>:</p><p>1) When the average or median values are compared between gene classes, this comparison hides the potential fact that the distribution might include genes far from the mean. For example, even if Ka/Ks is on average &lt;1 some orphan genes might be fast evolving and actually not easy to recognize in other species. These orphans are not “real” orphans but evolving to quick for the threshold of similarity to catch them. Authors should plot and compare the distributions not only means or medians.</p><p>In this sense, I do not think the authors have a conservative definition of orphans because they do not ask for Ka/Ks to be significantly smaller than 1. This would be conservative. Some might evolve as non-coding regions. Their definition is annotated genes of <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> that are expressed but show not similarity in other species at a particular threshold. However, whenever possible functionality should be supported with a Ka/Ks significantly &lt;1 or Ka/Ks significantly &gt;1 for the particular orphans to provide additional evidence of functionality. They should add a significance value in the supplementary table and comment on it in the text.</p><p>Is there any polymorphism data available for <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> to perform M-K test to test the functionality of the 225 new orphan genes in that genome?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> should contain divergence times in the nodes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> should be discussed in the light of the quality of every genome considered to make sure that losses or gains depend on the specific rates of orphan gene evolution per lineage and not on the quality of sequencing and assembly.</p><p>3) In the Results section I would like the authors to describe whether the loss of XR orphans is pseudogenization or actually a relocation. Can they comment if the gene has moved whenever possible to perform these analyses? They comment about the Meisel et al. work (2009). In that work some male-specific duplicates were found to relocate to autosomes. Is this the case for these orphans.</p><p>4) How were GAPs in the assembly treated? Can it be that some losses are actually GAPs in the assembly?</p><p>5) Can the high rate of orphans on the X chromosome be explained by the X being sequenced at a lower coverage if males and females were sequenced and this affecting the presence of genes in different assemblies? Please mention what individuals (males, females or 50%/50%) were sequenced for every genome.</p><p>6) In the Materials and methods section, an orphan is considered to be disabled if a single disrupting mutations is present. What is the probability that this single disabling mutation is actually a sequencing error? Please comment.</p><p>7) Intron turnover should be analyzed in more detail.

They say in the Methods section: “ Based on a set of orthologs in the obscura group, pseudogenes were identified by the presence of an intact ORF”, but Figure 9–figure supplement 2 shows that a large number of such disruptions occur in the last 10% of the reading frame (this is actually an interesting result that should not be relegated to the supplements). These might not be function-disabling mutations. I suggest to check relative conservation levels along the ORFs to assess this question or treat these genes differently in the overall comparisons</italic>.</p><p>We agree that disruptions present at the end of the ORFs might not be considered as real pseudogenizations events. To account for this, we looked at the correlation between gene age and loss by considering only the disrupting mutations occurring in the first half of the ORF. We obtained qualitatively similar results, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>.</p><p><italic>My major comment concerning data analysis is towards the exclusive use of</italic> D. miranda <italic>for calculating divergence levels in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>. Why is this not done for all species in the tree? And why</italic> D. miranda<italic>, rather than the newly sequenced</italic> D. affinis <italic>that is at the base of the comparisons</italic>?</p><p>We calculated now the divergence levels for all the species in the tree and obtained qualitatively similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>All figures that support relevant data discussed in the text should be in the paper - supplementary figures should only be used for further clarifications</italic>.</p><p>We moved all the figure supplements from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) to the main figures.</p><p>Referee 2:</p><p><italic>1) Loss of orphan genes is a key point of this study. To make the results convincing, calculation on gene gains and loses should be described in detail</italic>.</p><p>We rewrote the methods section “Calculation of orphan gain and losses” providing a more detailed description.</p><p><italic>2) How exactly was the “intergenic” dataset constructed</italic>?</p><p>We added the details in the method section “Evolutionary rates”.</p><p>Referee 3:</p><p><italic>1) When the average or median values are compared between gene classes, this comparison hides the potential fact that the distribution might include genes far from the mean. For example, even if Ka/Ks is on average &lt;1 some orphan genes might be fast evolving and actually not easy to recognize in other species. These orphans are not “real” orphans but evolving to quick for the threshold of similarity to catch them. Authors should plot and compare the distributions not only means or medians</italic>.</p><p>We plotted the distribution of dN/dS for orphans in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> and showed that most of the orphans have a dN/dS lower than 1.</p><p><italic>In this sense, I do not think the authors have a conservative definition of orphans because they do not ask for Ka/Ks to be significantly smaller than 1. This would be conservative. Some might evolve as non-coding regions. Their definition is annotated genes of</italic> D. pseudoobscura <italic>that are expressed but show not similarity in other species at a particular threshold. However, whenever possible functionality should be supported with a Ka/Ks significantly &lt;1 or Ka/Ks significantly &gt;1 for the particular orphans to provide additional evidence of functionality. They should add a significance value in the supplementary table and comment on it in the text</italic>.</p><p>The reason why we called our orphan identification procedure conservative is that we included an additional filtering step that has not been used in previous publications. The procedure suggested by the reviewer is certainly a truly conservative one, but given the short evolutionary time scale of our study, too few mutations have occurred to identify genes with a statistically significant difference of Ka/Ks from one. We tested all orphans and none was found to have a Ka/Ks significantly different from 1. Hence, we did not further pursue the suggested strategy.</p><p>Since the reviewer feels that the wording “conservative” is a problem, we have removed it from the manuscript since we do not think that it is of major importance.</p><p><italic>Is there any polymorphism data available for</italic> D. pseudoobscura <italic>to perform M-K test to test the functionality of the 225 new orphan genes in that genome</italic>?</p><p>We agree that the inclusion of polymorphism data could be interesting and we analyzed a set of polymorphism dataset for <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> from 45 individuals. Since the MK test is designed to identify genes with different patterns of evolution for divergence and polymorphism data, it is not well-suited for the identification of purifying selection. Hence, we used the polymorphism data set to calculate pN/pS for orphans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and compared them to conserved genes and intergenic regions. In support of our other data, also the polymorphism data supports the hypothesis of purifying selection acting on orphan genes.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>should contain divergence times in the nodes.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>should be discussed in the light of the quality of every genome considered to make sure that losses or gains depend on the specific rates of orphan gene evolution per lineage and not on the quality of sequencing and assembly</italic>.</p><p>We added a new figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>), which includes the other Drosophila species and this figure includes scale with divergence times.</p><p>We understand the concern of the reviewer that the rates of gains and losses may also influenced by assembly quality, but we feel that this is difficult to put into this figure. Rather, we would like to refer the reviewer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, which shows the percentage of lost non-orphan genes (age class 5). We caution, however, that it is not clear to what extent premature stops or frameshift mutations are segregating in these species or are the outcome of sequencing errors. We think that the high coverage of the genomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) will result only in a small fraction of sequencing errors.</p><p><italic>3) In the Results</italic> <italic>section I</italic> <italic>would like the authors to describe whether the loss of XR orphans is pseudogenization or actually a relocation. Can they comment if the gene has moved whenever possible to perform these analyses? They comment about the Meisel et al. work (2009). In that work some male-specific duplicates were found to relocate to autosomes. Is this the case for these orphans</italic>.</p><p>We performed this analysis by extracting the orphans pseudogenized on the XR in <italic>D. miranda</italic> and <italic>D. lowei</italic> and by aligning them to the respective genomes to find evidence for gene duplication. We found no support for this hypothesis, as described at in the Results section.</p><p><italic>4) How were GAPs in the assembly treated? Can it be that some losses are actually GAPs in the assembly</italic>?</p><p>We understand the issue that GAPs in the assembly might confound the detection of genuine gene losses if the definition of loss is merely based on the presence/absence of the gene sequence in a given species. To avoid this problem we considered only pseudogenization events (i.e., premature stops or frameshift mutations), as specified in the methods. Thus GAPs in the assembly do not affect our definition of gene loss. At the same time, we also recognize that our definition of gene loss is an underestimate of the true number of losses.</p><p><italic>5) Can the high rate of orphans on the X chromosome be explained by the X being sequenced at a lower coverage if males and females were sequenced and this affecting the presence of genes in different assemblies? Please mention what individuals (males, females or 50%/50%) were sequenced for every genome</italic>.</p><p>All the genome assemblies used in our study come from female individuals. This ensures similar coverage between autosomes and X chromosome. Thus, the high rate of orphans on the X cannot be explained by the X being sequenced at lower coverage. The strain details / accession numbers are given in the Methods. Nevertheless, we would point out that the coverage of the genome assemblies was high enough (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), such that even a 50% lower coverage of males would not have resulted in a substantial increase in sequencing errors due to low coverage.</p><p><italic>6) In the Materials and methods section, an orphan is considered to be disabled if a single disrupting mutations is present. What is the probability that this single disabling mutation is actually a sequencing error? Please comment</italic>.</p><p>Overall, our assemblies were not based on low coverage genomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), thus sequencing errors are not very likely to contribute significantly to disrupting mutations, since this is expected for a coverage of 3 reads or less. However, we also think that a fraction of the disrupting mutations may still be segregating. We did a more careful analysis of disrupting mutations in <italic>D. mauritiana</italic> (a species for which we had assembled the genome ourselves and had also high quality polymorphism data available) and found consistent with other results in the literature that several of the interrupting mutations were not fixed in the population.</p><p><italic>7) Intron turnover should be analyzed in more detail. How are those introns gained or lost? Are they part of the initially annotated coding region? This could reveal disablements. Some annotation software will put an intron in regions with disablements and still annotate a coding region</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer brings up a very important aspect. This made us recognize that intron turnover was not explored in sufficient detail in our study. Since we feel that this is not the main focus of our work and it would require in depth analyses, we removed the section about intron turnover.</p><p><italic>8) In the Results section the authors mention that their definition of orphan is more conservative than in previous work. Please explain in detail in what sense the definition is conservative in this work</italic>.</p><p>Our definition of orphan is more conservative, since we used an additional filtering using TBLASTN. We explained how orphans were detected in previous studies at the beginning of the result section and how our filtering makes our definition more conservative. In any case, we do not consider this an essential aspect of the manuscript and have removed the statement that our definition of orphans is conservative.</p><p><italic>9) Are orphans related (similar in sequence) to other orphans</italic>?</p><p>We clustered the protein sequences of orphan genes using the CD-hit software, widely used for gene family analyses. Generally, we find that only about 7% of the orphans show similarity to other orphans. We summarized the results of the orphan gene family analysis in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
