In this large prospective study, we collected swabs intraoperatively from the FT and other surgical sites as controls to profile the microbiota in the FT and to assess its relationship with OC. Eighty-one OC and 106 non-cancer patients were enrolled and 1001 swabs were processed for 16S rRNA gene PCR and sequencing. We identified 84 bacterial species that may represent the FT microbiota and found a clear shift in the microbiota of the OC patients when compared to the non-cancer patients. Of the top 20 species that were most prevalent in the FT of OC patients, 60% were bacteria that predominantly reside in the gastrointestinal tract, while 30% normally reside in the mouth. Serous carcinoma had higher prevalence of almost all 84 FT bacterial species compared to the other OC subtypes. The clear shift in the FT microbiota in OC patients establishes the scientific foundation for future investigation into the role of these bacteria in the pathogenesis of OC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fallopian tube</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>16S rRNA gene sequencing</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>prospective</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08CA222835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015521</institution-id><institution>Stanford Maternal and Child Health Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Akiko Yamazaki and Jerry Yang Faculty Scholar Fund in Pediatric Translational Medicine</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020696</institution-id><institution>Seattle Translational Tumor Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swisher</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI139189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name><name><surname>Fredricks</surname><given-names>David N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014549</institution-id><institution>Stanford Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCI Women's Cancer Center Innovation Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A prospective study of intraoperative swab collections from 187 patients identified a putative fallopian tube microbiota and a clear shift in ovarian cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2023, about 19,710 new cases of ovarian cancer (OC) will be diagnosed and about 13,270 individuals will die from OC in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cancer Facts &amp; Figures 2022, 2022</xref>). Unlike most other cancers, the mortality rate for OC has declined only slightly in the last 40 years due to lack of early diagnostic tests and effective treatments. The 5-year survival rate for all types of OC averages 49.7%, much lower than many other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cancer Stat Facts: Ovarian Cancer, 2019</xref>). The high mortality rate of OC is linked to a lack of understanding of ovarian carcinogenesis and precursor lesions, contributing to the failure of early detection and late-stage diagnosis. Even the cell origins of various OC subtypes have not been fully appreciated until recently, with ovarian carcinoma representing a heterogeneous collection of cancer subtypes, each with distinct origins and molecular drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shih et al., 2021</xref>). The fallopian tube (FT) epithelium is the likely origin of most high-grade serous carcinomas, the most common subtype of ovarian carcinoma. There is a critical need for innovative research to illuminate the origins and pathogenesis of this deadly cancer, thus enabling targeted approaches for early detection, treatment, and prevention.</p><p>Based on the epidemiological data, we propose a novel hypothesis for ovarian carcinogenesis: ascending infection with some genital tract bacteria leads to inflammation in the FTs and DNA damage to cells contributing to neoplastic transformation. The evidence supporting this hypothesis includes: (1) The FTs form a conduit between the lower genital tract and the pelvic cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Henderson et al., 1979</xref>). (2) Blocking the communication between the FTs and the environment, such as through tubal ligation or hysterectomy, results in lower OC incidences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gaitskell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Parker et al., 2009</xref>). (3) Increased cellular and bacterial transit between the lower genital tract and the peritoneal cavity, as in endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease, is associated with increased OC risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Melin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). (4) Inhibiting ovulation through oral contraceptives may decrease OC risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Narod et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tworoger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ness et al., 2001</xref>) by reducing the opportunities of incorporating ascending pathogens into the ovarian surface epithelium during ovulation-induced microtrauma. (5) The fallopian tubal epithelium has been implicated in recent studies as the site of origin for at least a substantial proportion of high-grade serous carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Norquist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Medeiros et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lamb et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated the presence of genital tract bacteria in the upper reproductive tract of women without known infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mitchell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chambers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Walther-AntÃ³nio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ventolini et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, bacteria ascending from the lower genital tract may reside in the FTs and could induce a pro-inflammatory environment, which could influence neoplasia of the tubal or ovarian epithelium, with outcome dependent on species of bacteria, concentration, host factors, and duration of exposure.</p><p>Even though the above epidemiological studies have hinted to the possible connection between an altered microbiota in the FT and OC, few studies have examined this plausible hypothesis. Even the existence of a microbiota in the FT has not been convincingly demonstrated, in part due to the technical challenges of accessing this site in a sterile fashion. Several studies have provided evidence that the FT may not be sterile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Miles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewster et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asangba et al., 2023</xref>), but rigorous controls and large sample sizes are needed to assess the microbiota in low-biomass samples. Here, we examine the FT microbiota from a large study population with collection of swabs in a sterile fashion in the operating room from both patients with OC and those without. The FT bacterial concentrations and compositions were compared between two groups: women who are cancer free, and women who have any type of OC. We built in numerous controls in our study design to help differentiate likely contaminants from signal of an FT microbiome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patient overview</title><p>A total of 187 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Methods) were enrolled in this study.

Three hundred and sixty-nine swabs were collected from the FT and ovarian surfaces. We also designed additional layers of controls and collected from multiple sites for comparisons. To assess the microbial environment in the operating room, 130 âair swabsâ were collected from the patientâs room. To assess the cervical microbiota, 152 cervical swabs were collected before surgical area preparation and vaginal sterilization. To assess the skin microbiota that may be introduced into the pelvic cavity during laparoscopic port insertion, 81 âlaparoscopic port swabsâ were collected after the port insertion and before the start of operation. To assess the microbiota in the abdominal cavity away from the surgical or cancer sites, 122 âparacolic gutter swabsâ were collected from the right paracolic gutter before the start of operation. To assess potential contamination of DNA extraction reagents, during each batch of DNA extractions we included âbuffer controlsâ that contained only DNA extraction buffer without any swab or other DNA. These 36 âbuffer controlsâ were processed and then sequenced together with the swab samples.

These 84 bacterial species may represent the FT microbiota that are present in some women. When analyzing the 340 samples that contained at least one read of these 84 species, the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) plot showed a high level of similarity between the fallopian tube/ovarian surface and the paracolic gutter swabs, indicating these species represent the shared microbiota community in the abdominal and pelvic cavity within each individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). An overview of these 84 bacterial species and their presence in each FT/ovarian surface sample shows that some of the bacterial species are prevalent in multiple individuals, such as <italic>Klebsiella</italic> or <italic>Anaerococcus</italic>, while others are only present in a few individuals, such as <italic>Casaltella</italic> or <italic>BV-associated bacterium 2</italic> (<italic>BVAB2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

After ranking the FT bacteria based on the prevalence difference, we found a clear shift in the microbiota of the OC patients when compared to the non-cancer patients. Interestingly, 90% of the top 20 species that were most prevalent in the FT of OC patients were bacteria that predominantly exist outside the female reproductive tract. Among these, 12 (60%) predominantly reside in the gastrointestinal tract, such as <italic>Klebsiella, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic>, <italic>Ruminiclostridium</italic>, and <italic>Roseburia</italic>. Six of the top 20 species (or 30%) normally reside in the mouth, such as <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic>, <italic>Corynebacterium simulans/striatum</italic>, and <italic>D. invisus</italic>. On the contrary, vaginal bacterial species, such as <italic>Corynebacterium amycolatum</italic>, <italic>Gardnerella</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic>, are more prevalent in the FT from non-cancer patients, representing 75% of the top 20 bacterial species that are most prevalent in non-cancer patients. This pattern was also consistently observed in the paracolic gutter samples which share the same low-biomass environment of abdominal and pelvic cavity , suggesting that the above findings of FT microbiota were not random. When the histology subtypes were considered in the analysis, we found that the most common subtype, serous carcinoma, had higher prevalence of almost all 84 FT bacterial species compared to the other OC subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), indicating a higher level of perturbance in the FT microbiota in the serous carcinoma cases.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Prevalence of the 84 bacterial species in ovarian cancer versus non-cancer cases.</title><p>Each number is the percentage of individuals in each category with the presence of each bacterial species.

When only laparotomy cases were considered in the comparison of OC versus non-cancer patients, the pattern of prevalence of majority of the 84 FT bacterial species was nearly identical as the overall comparison including all surgical types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). When laparotomy cases were compared to laparoscopic or robotic cases within the non-cancer patients, the prevalence of most of the 84 FT bacterial species was similar between the surgical types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). These analyses demonstrate that the differences we observed in the putative FT microbiota between OC and non-OC patients were not caused by the differences in surgical approaches.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this large prospective study, we analyzed the microbiota on swabs collected in a sterile fashion in the operating room during surgery, including from the FT and ovarian surface in 187 patients with or without OC, with the objective of determining an FT microbiome and identifying microbiome differences associated with OC. After detailed analyses and filtering out likely contaminants, we found 84 bacterial species that are present in FT or ovarian surface, which may represent an FT microbiota in some women. Comparison between the OC and non-cancer cases revealed a significantly higher prevalence of bacterial species that predominantly do not reside in the reproductive tract in patients with OC, while the FT from non-cancer patients favored vaginal bacterial species. It is unclear whether OC leads to this microbiota shift or if the microbiota shift precedes OC.</p><p>We proposed a novel hypothesis of ovarian carcinogenesis based on epidemiological evidence before initiating our study, namely that ascending infection with some genital tract bacteria leads to inflammation in the FT and causes DNA damage to cells resulting in OC. Our study showed the existence of bacterial species at a low concentration in the FT and ovarian surface in most women without overt signs of infection. Some of these bacterial species overlapped between the FT and the cervical swabs, indicating potential ascension from the lower to the upper genital tract. Some other bacterial species are not typical vaginal microbiota, and the origins of these bacteria in the FT samples are less clear. Patients with OC, especially the serous carcinoma subtype, showed significantly higher prevalence of many of the bacterial species we identified as the putative FT microbiota, indicating a potential link between a perturbed FT microbiota and OC. The FT microbiota may be different in different OC histology subtype, which was consistent with a recent study with limited sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asangba et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>One of the most interesting findings from our study is that most of the top bacterial species that were more prevalent in OC patients had predominant niche outside of female reproductive tract, normally residing in the gastrointestinal or oral tract. Some of these bacterial species were also identified in previous small studies examining the bacteria incorporated into the FT and OC tissues, such as <italic>Anaerococcus</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asangba et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>). The origin and route of ascension of these bacteria to the FT and ovarian surfaces remain unknown. In late-stage cancers, even when there are no overt signs of gastrointestinal invasion, the permeability of the intestinal tract may be increased which can increase the prevalence of these bacterial species in the FT, ovarian surfaces, and paracolic gutters. The causal effect of bacterial or other pathogens on the FT inflammation or carcinogenesis will need to be investigated in future studies using preclinical models. However, our study provides a list of top bacterial candidates that can be further investigated.</p><p>Our approach in collecting swabs in a sterile fashion in the operating room before the surgical case starts is unique and has not been used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Miles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewster et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asangba et al., 2023</xref>). This approach enables us to evaluate the microbiota in each individual patient at multiple sites to infer transfer among sites. Previous studies mostly used the tissues collected from the pathology department after gross examination, which can introduce contamination. These studies infrequently included negative controls to assess for environmental or laboratory contamination, which is critically important when assessing a low-biomass microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Salter et al., 2014</xref>). We collected swabs not only from the site of interest, that is, FT and ovarian surface, but also from key control sites linked to cases, such as the air in the OR, the laparoscopic port, the paracolic gutter, and the cervix. These biological controls, along with the DNA extraction and PCR controls during the sample processing and sequencing processes, provide a fuller picture of the patient-specific microbiota and differentiate the biologically meaningful bacterial species from likely contaminants. The approach taken here may serve as a guide for others undertaking microbiome studies of low-biomass environments, particularly when considering study design, types of controls, and analytical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">OâCallaghan et al., 2020</xref>). The sample size is among the largest in microbiome studies of low-biomass sites, which is helpful in differentiating signal from the noise in this setting. All previous microbiome studies that included FT as a study site had less than 40 patients in each group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Miles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewster et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asangba et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>There are some limitations to our study. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, we have limited ability to link specific bacteria to ovarian carcinogenesis, as we would need to demonstrate that exposure to bacteria precedes the cancer. However, identifying associations between FT microbiota and OC is a critical first step. Further investigations, especially backed by in vitro studies, are needed to test our initial hypotheses. Due to the large sample size, we processed the samples in five batches and sequenced the libraries on four plates. Even though we separated the cervical samples with the low-biomass samples on different sequencing plates to prevent cross-contamination, we sequenced the low-biomass samples on three different sequencing plates, which could introduce bias due to batch effects. However, all samples were processed by a single experienced technician, and each sequencing plate contained samples from different processing batches, which helped to diminish potential batch effects. By requiring the bacterial species be present in both FT/ovarian surface swabs and the cervical swabs, we may have missed part of the FT microbiota that may have originated from sources other than the lower genital tract.</p><p>In conclusion, in this large prospective study with extensive controls, we analyzed the FT swabs from 187 patients together with controls that were collected intraoperatively in a sterile fashion, and identified a putative FT microbiota that exists in many women without any overt signs of infection. Patients with OC had a high prevalence of some key bacterial species, indicating a potentially perturbed microbiota co-existing with OC. Further studies are needed to investigate whether there is a causal relationship between these bacterial species and ovarian carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study population</title><p>Specimens and clinical information were obtained from patients who provided informed consent under a protocol approved by the institutional review board at University of Washington (Protocol # 2872).

Rather, the authors present this hypothesis as a rationale for a cross-sectional study involving 81 patients with ovarian cancer (most with the most common subtype of high grade serous ovarian carcinoma, though other subtypes were also included), as well as 106 control patients with various non-infectious conditions including endometriosis and benign ovarian cysts. In all patients was there a comprehensive microbiome sampling of ovarian surface/fallopian tube, cervix and peritoneal cavity as well sampling of a number of potential sources of contamination, including surgery sites, ambient environment, consumables used in the DNA extraction and sequencing pipeline, etc. In line with the hypothesis presented at the outset, species with a threshold of at least 100 reads in both at least one cervical and at least one fallopian tube sample, while absent from environmental swabs, were considered relevant to the postulated pathway.</p><p>Remarkably, fallopian tube microbiota in ovarian cancer patients tended to cluster more closely to those retrieved from the paracolic gutter, than fallopian tube microbiota in non-cancer controls, which showed more relative similarity to vaginal/genital tract microbiota.</p><p>Although not really addressed by the authors, there also seem to be quite a few differences, at least in terms of abundance, in cervical microbiota between ovarian cancer patients and controls as well, which is an interesting finding, even when accounting for differences in age distribution between ovarian cancer patients and included control patients.</p><p>Overall, very few data are available thus far on the upper genital tract/fallopian tube microbiome, while also invariably controversial, as it has proven extremely difficult to obtain pelvic samples in a valid, &quot;sterile&quot; manner, i.e. without affecting a resident low-biomass microbiome to be analyzed. The authors took a number of measures to counter so, and in this respect, this is likely the largest and most valid study on the subject, even though biases and contamination can never be completely excluded in this context.</p><p>As such, I believe the strength of this study and paper primarily relates to the rigour of the methodology, thereby giving us a valuable insight in the presumed fallopian tube/ovarian surface microbiome, which may definitely serve as an impetus and a reference to future translational ovarian cancer research, or ovarian microbiome research for that matter.</p><p>I believe that the authors should acknowledge in more detail, that the data obtained from their cross-sectional study, valid as these are, do not provide any direct support to the hypothesis - albeit also plausible - set forth, a discussion that I somehow missed to a certain extent. It is important to realize in this and related contexts that neoplasia may well induce microbiome alterations through a variety of mechanisms, hence microbiome alterations not per se being causative. Conclusions should therefore be more reserved. Along the same lines, potential biases introduced through the selection of control patients (some detail here would be insightful) also deserves some discussion, as it is not known, whether other conditions such as benign ovarian cysts or endometriosis have some relationship with the human microbiome, be it causative or 'reversely causative', see for instance very recent work in Science Translational Medicine.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs detailed review and thoughtful comments.
