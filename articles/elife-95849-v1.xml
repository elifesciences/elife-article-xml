According to latent state theories, this is determined by the level of surprise, or prediction error, generated by the new information: a small prediction error leads to the updating of existing memory, large prediction error leads to encoding of a new memory. We tested this idea using a protocol in which rats were first conditioned to fear a stimulus paired with shock. The stimulus was then gradually extinguished by progressively reducing the shock intensity until the stimulus was presented alone. Consistent with latent state theories, this gradual extinction protocol (small prediction errors) was better than standard extinction (large prediction errors) in producing long-term suppression of fear responses, and the benefit of gradual extinction was due to updating of the conditioning memory with information about extinction. Thus, prediction error determines how new information is organized in memory, and latent state theories adequately describe the ways in which this occurs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prediction error</kwd><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>extinction</kwd><kwd>latent state</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2201036501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Killcross</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Westbrook</surname><given-names>R Fred</given-names></name><name><surname>Holmes</surname><given-names>Nathan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT190100697</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holmes</surname><given-names>Nathan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE210100292</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jessica C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015539</institution-id><institution>Australian Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Nicholas GW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When new and past experiences are similar, the memories of those experiences are stored together, and when new and past experiences are different, the memories of those experiences are stored separately.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Learning about the relations between events in the environment is a fundamental aspect of animal and human life. It allows organisms to use the past to predict the future and, thereby, behave appropriately in the present. For example, upon hearing a distinctive sound that had previously signaled the presence of a predator, organisms engage in defensive responses that serve to avoid the imminent danger; and upon detecting a distinctive smell that had previously signaled the presence of food, organisms engage in approach responses that procure the food. However, environments change, and events that previously served as reliable signals for biologically significant states-of-affairs may cease to do so: the sound may not be followed by the arrival of the predator and the smell might be present but the food absent. How is this new information organized with respect to the existing knowledge? One possibility is that it is directly incorporated into the original knowledge, resulting in some form of overwriting (the sound and the smell are now encoded as less reliable signals for their associated consequences). Alternatively, the new information may be classified as distinct from the original knowledge, resulting in separate storage of the new information (the sound and smell predict danger and food in some circumstances, but not others). However, it is not currently clear what factors determine the use of either processing strategy.</p><p>Many contemporary models of learning suggest that prediction error influences how new information is organized in memory. These models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gershman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gershman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Redish et al., 2007</xref>) hold that animals and people encode information about events/contexts and assign this information to a particular ‘state’ of the memory system. Critically, this assignment of information is regulated by prediction error: that is, the difference between what is predicted to happen based on one’s existing knowledge and what actually happens. These so-called latent state models are like classic associative models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pearce and Hall, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>) in holding that prediction error drives learning, such that the greater the prediction error, the greater the amount of associative change. However, they differentiate themselves from earlier models in proposing that prediction error is also an index of similarity to past experiences, which then influences the assignment of event and context information to memory. When a new experience is similar to a past experience and, hence, the prediction error is small, the new experience is integrated into the same memory state as the past experience, resulting in updating (or overwriting) of existing information. By contrast, when a new experience is different to past experiences and, hence, the prediction error is large, the new experience is encoded into a new state, resulting in the preservation of existing information.</p><p>Extinction of Pavlovian conditioned fear in rats is a laboratory protocol that has been used to study how new information is integrated with existing knowledge (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dunsmoor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gershman et al., 2013</xref>). In this protocol, rats first learn that a conditioned stimulus (CS [e.g. a tone]) signals a brief-but-aversive unconditioned stimulus (US [e.g. a foot-shock]). They are then exposed to repeated presentations of the CS alone, across which conditioned fear responses (e.g. potentiated startle, freezing) decline in frequency or vigor until they cease altogether, at which point they are said to be extinguished. Importantly, this extinction of conditioned fear is not due to unlearning of the CS-US association, as evidenced by findings that fear responses can be restored through a range of post-extinction manipulations including the passage of time (spontaneous recovery), re-exposure to the US (reinstatement), or exposure to the CS outside of its extinction context (renewal). Instead, such findings have been taken to imply that extinction involves new learning (e.g. CS-no US) that leaves the original conditioning intact but interferes with its expression in behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bouton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouton, 2004</xref>).</p><p>According to latent state models, the CS-US association survives extinction (and thereby permits fear restoration) because of so-called ‘state-splitting’ triggered by the abrupt removal of the US. One such model is that proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref>. This model not only explains fear restoration phenomena but also a wider range of conditioning phenomena than other latent state models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Redish et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gershman et al., 2010</xref>: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref>, for comparisons). Consequently, we use the Cochran-Cisler model here as an exemplar. According to this model, the shift from conditioning to extinction causes the subject to experience a large prediction error: hence, they infer that a new state is active (this is the state-split) and encode the extinction experience into this state, separate from that of conditioning. Importantly, the subject is also biased towards assuming that the most recent latent state is active; however, this bias decreases with time outside of the experimental context and, with sufficient time, all states return to equal probability of activation. Thus, during extinction, the subject continues to believe the extinction state is active, however, when the subject is re-exposed to the extinguished CS after a significant passage of time, the conditioning state has a greater likelihood of activation (relative to the same likelihood at the end of extinction), resulting in recovery – that is, spontaneous recovery – of conditioned responding (for simulations, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> latent state model simulation of standard extinction with spontaneous recovery.</title><p>The simulations depict the associative strength (<bold>A</bold>) and latent state beliefs (<bold>B</bold>) of a conditioned stimulus (CS) across conditioning, extinction, and spontaneous recovery.

The right panel (<bold>B</bold>) depicts the degree of belief that the most recent latent state is active. If the belief changes throughout the simulation, this indicates that a new latent state has been inferred. Upon the beginning of extinction (t=11), the figure indicates that a new state has been inferred (due to the large prediction error generated by the absence of the unconditioned stimulus, US). The simulation captures the decrement of performance associated with extinction as well as the recovery of performance that occurs after a time delay.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95849-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>An implication of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> model is that, if the prediction error on the initial trials of extinction is small, the CS-alone experiences would be assigned to the same state as that of the prior CS-US experiences and more effectively impair recall of conditioning. In practice, small prediction errors could be achieved by progressively and gradually reducing the intensity of the US across sessions prior to presentations of the CS alone (e.g. shifting from 0.8 mA to 0.4 mA, to 0.2 mA, to 0.1 mA, to no US). If the series of small prediction errors is sufficient to produce learning but prevent state-splitting, then manipulations that typically recall the CS-US experiences should be less effective in doing so and, thus, evoke less responding. Thus, in contrast to the standard case where CS-US and CS alone experiences are encoded in different states, the gradual case permits CS-US and CS alone experiences to be encoded in the same state. Hence, the gradual case should more effectively undermine recovery and/or reinstatement of responding to the CS (for simulations, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Gradual extinction is more effective than standard extinction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Design for Experiment 1: Rats were conditioned with tone-shock pairings and then either received standard extinction (Group Extinction, n=8, tone alone presentations) or gradual extinction (Group Gradual, n=8, tone-shock pairings – shock intensity decreased across the day).

Initially, there are 10 conditioning trials (t=1–10, <italic>R</italic>=1), followed by 80 extinction trials (t=11–90). Within the (gradual) extinction trials, the CS is still paired with the unconditioned stimulus (US), however, the intensity of the US is halved every 20 trials (t=11–30, <italic>R</italic>=0.5; t=31–50, <italic>R</italic>=0.25; t=51–70, <italic>R</italic>=0.125) until it is removed for the final 20 extinction trials (t=71–90, <italic>R</italic>=0). A time delay was inserted between trials 90 and 91, simulating spontaneous recovery, before a final 20 extinction trials (t=91–110, <italic>R</italic>=0). Associative strength (<bold>B</bold>) increases across conditioning, decreases steadily across gradual extinction, and remains low after a time delay, indicating an absence of spontaneous recovery.

If the belief changes throughout the simulation, this indicates that a new latent state has been inferred.

Specifically, they examined whether a gradual extinction protocol (one which generates small prediction errors) produces a combined conditioning and extinction state and, thereby, less spontaneous recovery and reinstatement of responding with the passage of time or US re-exposure, respectively. The initial experiments confirmed that gradual extinction does, indeed, have these effects, as predicted by the Cochran-Cisler model and other latent state models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gershman et al., 2010</xref>). Subsequent experiments examined the conditions under which this gradual extinction effect is observed. Finally, we attempted to explain the full pattern of results in these experiments using simulations of the Cochran-Cisler model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1: Gradual extinction produces less spontaneous recovery of fear than standard extinction</title><p>Experiment 1 assessed the prediction of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> latent state model that gradual extinction results in less spontaneous recovery than standard extinction. Simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>) confirmed this prediction. To assess this prediction, all rats received fear conditioning, consisting of four pairings of a tone CS and foot shock US (0.8 mA × 0.5 s). They were then allocated randomly to two extinction conditions. Rats in the first condition (standard extinction) received CS alone presentations each day across three days, while those in the second condition (gradual extinction) continued to receive pairings of the CS and shock US across these days. The duration of the shock remained at 0.5 s, but, critically, the intensity of the shock was reduced from one day to the next: from 0.4 mA on day one, to 0.2 mA on day two and, finally to 0.1 mA on day three. Rats in both conditions then received CS alone presentations across two further days. Finally, two weeks later, rats in both conditions were tested for spontaneous recovery of fear responses (freezing) to the extinguished CS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> for design).</p><p>Here and in subsequent experiments, results are reported for the data of interest; specifically, the levels of freezing elicited by the CS in the final session of extinction and the tests for spontaneous recovery and/or reinstatement.

This accords with the simulations of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> latent state model which holds that rats which received gradual extinction encoded their conditioning and extinction experiences into a single state, while rats which received standard extinction encoded their conditioning and extinction into separate states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Experiment 2: Gradual extinction produces less reinstatement of fear than standard extinction</title><p>Experiment 2 had two aims. The first was to replicate the results of the previous experiment by again using the spontaneous recovery test to compare the long-term effectiveness of gradual extinction relative to standard extinction. We additionally included a control group to provide some indication of the level of spontaneously recovered responding among rats exposed to gradual or standard extinction. The second aim was to assess the generality of the results from Experiment 1 by using a reinstatement manipulation to restore responding to the extinguished tone CS. Reinstatement typically consists of re-exposing rats to the US (shock) prior to testing of the CS alone. According to latent state models, the occurrence of the US after standard extinction is taken to imply that the conditioning state is again active, hence conditioned responses return. The hypothesis to be tested is that, among rats trained in the gradual extinction protocol, the occurrence of the shock is less likely to reinstate responding to the extinguished tone because the conditioning and extinction experiences occupy the same state: hence, they cannot be easily disambiguated.</p><p>The design is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. Three groups of rats received pairings of the tone CS and a 0.8 mA × 0.5 s foot shock US followed by extinction. For rats in Group Gradual, the intensity of the shock US paired with the CS was progressively reduced across the first three days of the extinction stage, and this was followed by a fourth day on which the CS was presented alone. For rats in Group Extinction, the extinction stage involved four days of CS alone exposure.

According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> model, the effectiveness of gradual extinction is due to the series of small prediction errors, created via the progressive reduction in US intensity from that used to condition the CS to the final CS alone presentations. However, the designs of the previous experiments confounded the progressive reductions in shock intensity with exposure to lower-intensity shocks. It is possible that simply receiving lower-intensity shocks following conditioning, regardless of their order, is sufficient to produce the pattern of results observed thus far. If this were to be the case, then presenting the same number and intensity of CS-shock pairings, but in a scrambled order, would produce the same robustness of extinction as the progressive reduction in shock intensities. However, the Cochran-Cisler model predicts that the prediction errors produced by the scrambled CS-shock pairings would, like standard extinction, produce state-splitting, and thus, would not produce the same robustness of extinction. Simulations confirmed this prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The effectiveness of gradual extinction is dependent on a progressive reduction in the shock intensity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Design for Experiment 3: Rats were conditioned with tone-shock pairings and then either received standard extinction (Group Extinction, n=8), gradual extinction (Group Gradual, n=8), or scrambled extinction (Group Scramble, n<italic>=</italic>8 – same number and intensity of tone-shock pairings as Group Gradual but in a pseudo-random order).

There were three groups. The gradual and standard extinction groups differed from the previous experiments only in that the initial three days of the extinction stage was followed by six daily sessions of CS alone presentations (as opposed to the two and one days of CS alone presentations used in Experiments 1 and 2). The six additional days of extinction were included to ensure that conditioned freezing was more fully extinguished than in the previous experiments. The third group (Scrambled) continued to receive CS-shock pairings across the initial three days of the extinction stage. The number of pairings and intensities of the shocks were identical to those received by the gradual group but the order in which the intensity of the shock changed was scrambled rather than progressively reducing as in the gradual group. Specifically, trials on which the CS was paired with the 0.4, 0.2, or 0.1 mA shock were delivered in a pseudo-random order within each session, (e.g. a 0.4 mA pairing followed by a 0.1 mA and then a 0.2 mA, etc.). This scrambled group then received six sessions of CS alone presentations as described for the other two groups. Two weeks later, all groups were tested for spontaneous recovery of freezing to the CS, and this was followed by a final test for reinstatement of freezing following shock re-exposure.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> shows mean freezing (±SEM) across the final session of extinction (left), the spontaneous recovery test (middle), and the reinstatement test (right).

Rather, the series of small prediction errors, created by progressively reducing shock intensities, is critical.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Experiment 4: The effectiveness of gradual extinction is not due to shock devaluation</title><p>The previous experiments leave open the possibility that the gradual extinction effect is due to the devaluation of the US representation rather than any change in prediction error. That is, after conditioning, the subject presumably holds a representation of the CS and the shock US. Receiving the series of lower-intensity shocks following conditioning degrades the subject’s shock representation, such that the shock comes to be represented as very weak. Thus, recall of the CS-shock association in tests for spontaneous recovery (Experiment 1) or reinstatement (Experiments 2 and 3) elicits little fear. This explanation differs from that of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> model in that degradation of the shock representation is not bound to the size of any prediction error. Rather, it implies that shifting immediately to a very low-intensity shock (0.1 mA) after conditioning with a high-intensity shock (0.8 mA) would be sufficient to protect against spontaneous recovery and/or reinstatement. By contrast, the Cochran-Cisler model predicts that shifting immediately to a very low-intensity shock (0.1 mA) would still produce a large prediction error, resulting in state-splitting and, thereby, susceptibility to fear restoration. Simulations in relation to this prediction are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>.</p><p>Experiment 4 tested this prediction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> for design). There were four groups. The gradual and standard extinction groups differed from those in the previous experiments only in that the initial three days of the extinction stage was followed by three daily sessions of CS alone presentations. Three days were chosen as an intermediary between one and six, as we assumed that those amounts of extinction under-extinguished or over-extinguished the CS, respectively. The treatment of the remaining two groups differed from that of Groups Gradual and Extinction only in the initial three days of the extinction stage. One group (0.1 × 3) received pairings of the CS and the lowest intensity shock, 0.1 mA, on each of these days, matching the total amount of shocks administered to Group Gradual. The final group (0.1 × 1) received pairings of the CS and a 0.1 mA shock for only the first of these days, and CS alone presentations for the remaining two days. This group was included to test whether a single session of low-intensity shocks was sufficient to protect against fear restoration. After the final three days of the extinction stage, across which all groups received CS alone presentations, all groups were tested for spontaneous recovery of freezing to the CS. The interval to the spontaneous recovery test was increased to three weeks (from two weeks in the previous experiments) in an attempt to increase recovery of the extinguished CS. The following day, all groups received a shock-alone presentation and a test for reinstatement of extinguished freezing.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> shows mean freezing (±SEM) across the final session of extinction (left), the spontaneous recovery test (middle), and the reinstatement test (right).

The results of the experiments conducted thus far are consistent with this model, but a feature of both the model’s explanation and the previous experiments is that all prediction errors have been generated by a change in the CS-US relationship. While the model permits contextual (e.g. spatio-temporal) information to be encoded concomitantly with the formation of the CS-US association, it predicts that only prediction errors relating to the CS-US association influence the process of state-splitting. The model also holds that a shift in context, whether it be a change in the physical environment or interpolating a delay between sessions (analogous to a change in the temporal context), means that the most recent active state is no longer most likely to be active (i.e. now all stored states are equally likely to be active). However, such shifts do not influence the process of state-splitting. That is, prediction error produced by a difference in contextual information does not influence whether new information is encoded into an existing or new state. Hence, the model predicts that the gradual extinction effect should survive a physical or temporal context shift: i.e., a physical or temporal context shift will <italic>not</italic> attenuate the effectiveness of gradual extinction in protecting against spontaneous recovery and/or reinstatement.

From inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, the interaction was due to gradual extinction producing less spontaneous recovery than standard extinction when conditioning and extinction occurred in the same context; but more spontaneous recovery than standard extinction when conditioning and extinction occurred in different contexts. Thus, a shift in physical context between conditioning and extinction reversed the advantage of gradual extinction over standard extinction. The implication for latent state models is that combining the reduction in shock intensity with a change in context produced a prediction error sufficiently large to cause state-splitting. Thus, rats exposed to this combination (Group Gradual-Different) exhibited more freezing to the CS at the test than their standardly extinguished counterparts as the CS-shock experiences are likely to have been represented in multiple states of memory.

In each experiment, rats were first exposed to pairings of a CS and a moderately intense shock US. Over the next few days, rats received additional CS-US pairings; however, the intensity of the shock US was gradually reduced until the CS was presented alone and completely extinguished. Testing revealed that rats subjected to this gradual extinction protocol showed less spontaneous recovery and reinstatement of fear (freezing responses) than rats subjected to a standard extinction protocol (i.e. an abrupt shift from CS-shock pairings to CS alone presentations). Importantly, these effects of gradual extinction depended on the reduction in shock intensity being both progressive and gradual: there were no decreases in spontaneous recovery and/or reinstatement among rats exposed to either the lower-intensity shocks in a pseudo-random order; or abruptly shifted to the lowest intensity shock. The effects of gradual extinction also depended on where and when the US intensity was gradually reduced in relation to the initial CS-US pairings: there were no decreases in spontaneous recovery and/or reinstatement among rats for which the US intensity was reduced in a different context to that of the initial conditioning, or several days after the initial conditioning. Thus, the effects of gradual extinction cannot be attributed to differences in shock exposure per se or the way that shock is represented in memory. Instead, the findings are consistent with accounts of extinction in terms of memory interference: that is, gradually reducing the shock intensity across the shift from conditioning to extinction means that the memory of the CS alone experiences can more effectively interfere with retrieval/expression of the CS-US memory in fear responses.</p><p>Latent state models provide a convenient way of thinking about memory interference in extinction, and the latent state model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> explains most of the present findings. According to this model, during a standard extinction protocol, omission of the shock US produces a large prediction error; and this large prediction error results in the CS only experiences being encoded separately from the CS-US memories formed in conditioning: i.e., formally, the large prediction error results in state-splitting, such that the CS alone experiences are encoded in a separate state to that of the CS-US experiences in conditioning. This separation means that the CS-US memories are able to be re-expressed in fear responses when the extinguished CS is presented under certain circumstances, including after the passage of time (spontaneous recovery) or following US re-exposure (reinstatement). By contrast, during a gradual extinction protocol, the progressive reductions in US intensity produce a series of small prediction errors which are sufficient to produce new learning but not sufficient to cause state-splitting. Hence, the conditioning and extinction experiences are encoded together in the same state, and the ability of the extinction experiences to interfere with the retrieval/expression of the conditioning experiences is thereby greatly increased.</p><p>In this manner, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> model accommodates our findings that gradual extinction protects against both spontaneous recovery and reinstatement; and correctly identifies these gradual extinction effects with progressive reductions in US intensity across the shift from conditioning to extinction. This was confirmed in a series of model simulations. When the shock intensity changes progressively and gradually across the shift (i.e. in the gradual extinction protocol), the model predicts that the conditioning and extinction experiences are encoded into a single state of memory, resulting in lower levels of responding when the CS is tested after the lapse of time or following US re-exposure. By contrast, when the shock intensity changes unpredictably from one trial to the next (scrambled control) or is immediately reduced to its lowest possible value (0.1 mA control), the model predicts that the conditioning and extinction experiences are encoded into different memory states, resulting in higher levels of responding when the CS is tested after the lapse of time or following US re-exposure.</p><p>It is important to note that, while the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> model explains the gradual extinction effect, it does not contain any mechanism by which a context change or lapse of time might contribute to the state-splitting process. As such, the model is challenged by the results of Experiments 5 and 6, which showed that the effectiveness of gradual extinction was attenuated when the US intensity was progressively reduced in a different context to that of the initial conditioning. That is, the unexpected CS and shock presentations in a different context attenuated the effectiveness of gradual extinction, suggesting that contextual prediction errors do, indeed, contribute to the state-splitting process. This being said, the impact of a context change on the effectiveness of gradual extinction is <italic>generally</italic> consistent with latent state models. According to the broader class of models, new experiences are encoded into the same state as past experiences when the two are sufficiently similar, and into a new state when they are sufficiently different. Thus, in principle, state-splitting can be identified with any sort of prediction error, including those relating to context. Incorporating a mechanism by which context changes can explicitly affect the state-splitting process would be a useful extension of latent state models, including that proposed by Cochran and Cisler.</p><p>The present study adds to a growing body of evidence that manipulations applied across the shift from CS-US pairings to presentations of the CS alone can influence the effectiveness of extinction. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gershman et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouton et al., 2004</xref> showed that gradually reducing the proportion of reinforced CS presentations results in less spontaneous recovery and slower reacquisition, respectively; though both studies left open fundamental questions about the basis of their findings (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Woods and Bouton, 2007</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Popik et al., 2020</xref> demonstrated that, after conditioning with a reasonably intense foot shock, pairing the CS with a very weak foot shock accelerates the loss of fear responses across extinction, and decreases levels of renewal and spontaneous recovery (relative to standard extinction). This procedure, termed ‘deconditioning,’ resembles the 0.1 mA control condition used in Experiment 4 where rats were conditioned with a strong shock and immediately shifted to the lowest intensity shock prior to a series of CS alone presentations in extinction. In contrast to the findings of Popik and colleagues, we found no evidence that extinction was more effective under these circumstances. However, it is important to note that rats in our 0.1 mA control group were initially conditioned with a strong (0.8 mA) shock before being shifted to the weak shock (0.1 mA), whereas rats in the Popik et al. study were initially conditioned with a moderate (0.5 mA) shock before being shifted to the same weak shock (0.1 mA). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> and other latent state models, rats in our 0.1 mA control group will have experienced a greater prediction error across the shift from conditioning to extinction compared to rats in the deconditioning protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Popik et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, they are more likely to have encoded the CS alone experiences in a different state to that of the initial conditioning experiences, resulting in normal levels of spontaneous recovery and reinstatement (i.e. no evidence for deconditioning). That is, we take our results and those of Popik et al. to provide very strong evidence that the size of the prediction error across the shift from conditioning to extinction determines the effectiveness of the latter; specifically, a series of small errors are more effective than a moderate or large error in promoting extinction.</p><p>One question that remains to be addressed concerns how state-splitting signals are registered in the brain. Some evidence suggests that they may be registered in activity of the adrenergic system. For example, neurons in the locus coeruleus respond to contingency changes across a variety of learning procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Devauges and Sara, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sales et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Vankov et al., 1995</xref>) including omission of an expected outcome in extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sara et al., 1994</xref>). These neurons also provide input to the hippocampus, resulting in the suppression of previously activated neuronal ensembles and the recruitment of new ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>). These and other findings provide a framework for thinking about extinction in the standard and gradual protocols. In the standard extinction protocol, the large prediction error produced by shock omission activates noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus; and this, in turn, provides a signal for state-splitting in the hippocampus. Hence, the CS alone experiences are encoded separately from the prior CS-US experiences, and the latter retain their capacity to be re-expressed in behavior. By contrast, in the gradual extinction protocol, the small prediction errors produced by progressive reductions in US intensity are not large enough to activate neurons in the locus coeruleus. Hence, the CS alone experiences are encoded together with the prior CS-US experiences and, thereby, more effectively interfere with retrieval/expression of the latter (for similar arguments in relation to memory reconsolidation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bonanno et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ferrara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Popik et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the present study has shown that a gradual extinction protocol is more effective than a standard extinction protocol in promoting extinction. That is, gradually reducing the US intensity across a series of CS-US pairings increased the effectiveness of extinction, which was evident in lower levels of spontaneous recovery and reinstatement. These findings are consistent with latent state models, including tthose proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref>. According to these models, prediction error determines how new experiences are encoded in states of memory. Small prediction errors result in new experiences being encoded into the same memory state as past experiences, which creates interference in recall of either experience. By contrast, large prediction errors result in new experiences being encoded into a new memory state, which minimizes interference when either experience is recalled. Future work will examine how the brain uses prediction error signals to update existing memory states (small errors) or create new ones (large errors), including the role of the central adrenergic system in mediating these different effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects were 16 experimentally naïve, adult male Long Evans rats, weighing between 250 and 400 g.

The correlation between the two sets of scores was greater than 0.9 but any discrepancies were resolved in favor of the naïve observer.</p><p>Conditioning, extinction, and spontaneous recovery data were analyzed using a mixed-model ANOVA with a between the factor of Group and a within a factor of Day (for Extinction) or Trial (for Conditioning and Spontaneous Recovery).

The agent believes that rewards can be predicted as a function of the environmental cues present, a latent state, and a latent error. A latent state indicates which distinct cue-reward contingencies are active in the environment. Latent error refers to the variability in reward generation. To predict rewards, the agent must invert their world view to identify which latent state is currently active, the contingencies between cues and rewards for that latent state, and the variability in rewards associated with that state. For a full characterization of the model, as well as a mathematical justification under the premise of computational rationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gershman et al., 2015</xref>) see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-2"><title>Parameters</title><p>The parameters chosen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3—table 1</xref>) were those used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> to simulate an array of classical conditioning phenomena.

The number of trials (t) per stage was consistent across the different simulations. The conditioning stage consisted of 10 trials where the CS was paired with a reward (R). The extinction stage consisted of 80 trials where the CS was presented alone or paired with a weaker version of the reward before being presented alone. Finally, the spontaneous recovery stage consisted of 20 trials where the CS was presented alone after a time-delay. The conditioning and spontaneous recovery stages remained identical across simulations; however, the extinction stage differed between simulations.</p><p>For each simulation, we present the associative strength of the CS across its presentations as well as inferred beliefs about which latent state is active. Associative strength was defined as the expected reward conditional on the cue being presented alone. Belief in a latent state was defined as the estimated probability of the latent state given observations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-4"><title>Standard extinction</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1A, B</xref> display simulations in relation to a standard extinction protocol. Extinction was simulated by pairing a CS with reward (Conditioning, t=1–10, <italic>R</italic>=1) and then presenting that CS in the absence of reward (Extinction, t=11–90, <italic>R</italic>=0). Finally, after a time delay (the equivalent of 200 trials in the model), the CS again is presented in the absence of the reward (Spontaneous Recovery, t=91–110, <italic>R</italic>=0). Associative strength increases across conditioning and declines across extinction before briefly recovering at the spontaneous recovery test. The model infers a new state is active upon extinction, due to the large prediction errors generated by the absence of the expected reward. The extinction state is believed to remain active, as the agent is biased to believing the most recently experienced latent state is active. The time delay has the effect of a context shift, such that the agent’s beliefs about which latent state is active are reset. Therefore, the agent now believes that it is equally likely that the conditioning state is active relative to the extinction state. This is reflected in the brief increase in associative strength. Thus, the model can successfully capture the decrement in performance associated with non-reinforcement of a conditioned CS as well as the recovery of performance that comes with passage of time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-5"><title>Gradual extinction</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1C, D</xref> display simulations in relation to a gradual extinction protocol. The conditioning and spontaneous recovery stages were identical to the standard extinction simulation. The extinction stage was split into four separate blocks (t=11–30; t=31–50; t=51–70; t=71–90). Across the first three blocks, the CS continued to be paired with reward; however, the reward value (intensity) was progressively decreased between blocks: it was halved across the first three blocks before being omitted altogether (as it was in the empirical experiments), such that <italic>R</italic>=0.5 for block one (t=11–30), <italic>R</italic>=0.25 for block two (t=31–50), <italic>R</italic>=0.125 for block three (t=51–70) and, finally, <italic>R</italic>=0 (reward removed) for block four (t=71–90). Associative strength steadily declined across extinction as the reward intensity decreased. Critically, at no point was a new state inferred as prediction error magnitude did not reach the threshold necessary for a new state. Therefore, the agent only has a single state in the spontaneous recovery stage and does not display any recovery of performance. Thus, the model can explain why gradual extinction results in robust extinction learning such that performance does not recover with the passage of time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-6"><title>Scrambled extinction</title><p>The model predicts that the gradual extinction effect depends on an ordered reduction in the reward intensity. Specifically, it predicts that presenting the same number of lower-intensity rewards in a pseudo-random order would not allow for conditioning and extinction to be encoded in the same state, which is the very basis of the gradual extinction effect according to latent state models. Simulations support this prediction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1E, F</xref> show simulations of a scrambled extinction protocol. The conditioning and spontaneous recovery stages were identical to those stages in the previous simulations. The extinction stage was once again split into four blocks as in the gradual extinction simulation. The first three blocks contained equal amounts of each lower-intensity reward used in the gradual extinction simulation (e.g. 7 × R=0.5, 7 × R=0.25, 6 × R=0.125 for block 1 [block 1 contained 6 × R=0.125, block 2 contained 6 × R=0.5, block 3 contained 6 × R=0.25]). Block 4 once again had the reward removed (<italic>R</italic>=0).</p><p>Associative strength decreased somewhat upon entering extinction and then, was roughly maintained as the reward value jumped around before finally decreasing to zero. Critically, the lack of ordered reduction created large predictions errors: hence, a new state was inferred to be active when the reward was fully removed (final block of extinction), and associative strength increased in the test stage for spontaneous recovery. Thus, the model shows that scrambled extinction, achieved by presenting the lower-intensity shocks in a pseudo-random order, is not sufficient to produce robust extinction learning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-7"><title>Weak shock extinction</title><p>The model further predicts that the gradual extinction effect is dependent on a gradual reduction in reward intensity, as opposed to an abrupt removal. Abruptly decreasing the reward intensity will cause state-splitting and will not allow for conditioning and extinction to be encoded in the same state. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2A, B</xref> display simulations in relation to a weak shock extinction protocol. The conditioning and spontaneous recovery stages were identical to those stages in the previous simulations. The extinction stage was split into four blocks where the first three blocks had <italic>R</italic>=0.125 (t=11–70, <italic>R</italic>=0.125), the lowest value reward used in the gradual extinction simulation. The final block had the reward removed (t=71–90, <italic>R</italic>=0).</p><p>Associative strength decreased sharply upon entering extinction and further decreased to 0 once the reward was removed. The large prediction error created by the abrupt reduction in reward intensity caused a new state to be inferred, leading to a recovery of associative strength in the final spontaneous recovery test. Thus, the model explains why a gradual reduction in reward intensity is necessary to observe the gradual extinction effect, as an abrupt reduction in reward intensity produced a recovery of performance after a time delay.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11"><title>Contextual shifts and gradual extinction</title><p>The model conceptualizes context shifts (i.e. shifting the physical and/or temporal context) as a resetting of an agent’s beliefs in latent states. That is, when the context is shifted, beliefs are reset to be uniform, such that all known latent states are equally likely to be active (i.e. the degree of belief in a single state is 1 /L [L=total number of latent states]). This removes the agent’s bias to believing the state active on the most recent trial is likely to be active again. Critically, context shifts do not affect the state-splitting process. Only prediction errors relating to the CS-US relationship are able to determine whether a new state is inferred to be active or not. Thus, despite a context shift resetting current beliefs about active latent states, the model predicts that combining gradual extinction with a shift in context (physical or temporal shift) will not attenuate the gradual extinction effect. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2C, D</xref> display simulations of gradual extinction with a physical context shift; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2E, F</xref> display simulations of gradual extinction with a temporal context shift.</p><p>A context shift is instantiated in the model as resetting beliefs to 1 /L for a physical context shift (L=number of latent states). For a temporal shift, as the chosen time interval grows, the beliefs approach 1 /L. The chosen interval for the simulations was t=200, effectively fully resetting beliefs to 1 /L. The context shift (temporal and physical) occurred between conditioning and extinction, the simulations remained identical to the gradual extinction simulation otherwise.</p><p>The pattern of associative strength was identical to the gradual extinction simulation, as the context shift had no impact on whether a new state was inferred. Thus, as there is only a single state at the spontaneous recovery stage, associative strength did not recover. Thus, the model predicts that the robust learning produced by gradual extinction is not affected by a physical or temporal context shift. However, the results of Experiments 5 and 6 contradict this prediction as they show that a context shift (physical or temporal) attenuates the effectiveness of gradual extinction. Therefore, an expanded role for context would be a worthwhile addition to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> latent state model.</p><fig id="app3fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 3—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simulations of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochran and Cisler, 2019</xref> latent state model for designs used in Experiments 4–6.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

They tested an idea based on latent theory that suggests that large prediction error leads to the formation of a new memory, whereas small prediction error leads to memory updating. They directly tested the prediction by extinguishing fear conditioned rats with gradual extinction. For their experiment, gradual extinction was carried out by progressively reducing the intensity of shocks that were co-terminated with the CS, until the CS was presented alone. Doing so resulted in diminished spontaneous recovery and reinstatement compared to Standard Extinction. The results are compelling and have important implications for the field of fear learning and memory as well as translation to anxiety-related disorders.</p><p>The authors carried out the Spontaneous Recovery experiment in 2 separate experiments. In one, they found differences between the Gradual and Standard Extinction groups, but in the second, they did not. It seems that their reinstatement test was more robust, and showed significant differences between the Gradual and Standard Extinction groups.</p><p>The authors carried out important controls which enable proper contextualization of the findings. They included a &quot;Home&quot; group, in which rats received fear conditioning, but not an extinction manipulation. Relative to this group, the Gradual and Standard extinction groups showed a reduction in freezing.</p><p>In Experiments 3 and 4, the authors essentially carried out clever controls which served to examine whether shock devaluation (Experiment 4) and reduction in shock intensity (rather than a gradual decrease in shock intensity) (Experiment 3) would also yield a decrease in the return of fear. In-line with a latent-cause updating explanation for accounting for the Gradual Extinction, they did not.</p><p>In Experiment 5, the authors examined whether a prediction error produced by a change of context might contribute interference to the latent cause updating afforded by the Gradual Extinction. Such a prediction would align with a more flexible interpretation of a latent-cause model, such as those proposed by Redish (2007) and Gershman et al (2017), but not the latent-cause interpretation put forth by the Cochran-Cisler model (2019). Their findings showed that whereas Gradual Extinction carried out in the same context as acquisition resulted in less return of fear than Standard Extinction, it actually yielded a greater degree of return of fear when carried out in a different context, in support of the Redish and Gershman accounts, but not Cochran-Cisler.</p><p>Experiment 6 extended the findings from Experiment 5 in a different state-splitting modality: timing.

In theory, this could be assessed using Rescorla’s (2000) compound test procedure. However, application of this procedure requires the use of a within-subject design and latent state theories would not predict the gradual extinction effect in such a design (as all prediction errors generated in such a design would affect the state-splitting process). That is, the between-subject design used to generate the gradual extinction effect is not amenable to application of the compound test procedure; and the within-subject design in which the compound test procedure could be applied is unlikely to generate the gradual extinction effect. Thus, we instead rely on the high degree of similarity between our results and those predicted by Cochran &amp; Cisler (2019) to argue that the gradual extinction protocol produces a series of smaller prediction errors than does the standard extinction protocol: hence the present pattern of results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The devaluation experiment is quite clever, but it also would be strengthened if there was evidence in the paper that this procedure does indeed lead to shock devaluation.</p></disp-quote><p>The aim of Experiment 3 was to determine whether the gradual extinction effect is due to prediction error-based memory updating or shock devaluation. If the effect was due to shock devaluation, the group that received the gradual extinction treatment should have displayed the same low level of spontaneous recovery as the group that only experienced the shock at its lowest (0.1 mA) intensity (i.e., the shock devaluation group). Contrary to this prediction, the results showed that the gradually extinguished group displayed <italic>less</italic> spontaneous recovery than the shock devaluation group. That is, in this experiment, the slow and progressive reduction in shock intensity <italic>was</italic> processed differently to the repeated 0.1 mA shock exposures but the results were inconsistent with any shock devaluation effect. Hence, we conclude that the gradual extinction effect does not involve shock devaluation but instead is due to prediction error-based memory updating.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It would have been very exciting to see even more parametric examinations of this idea, like maintaining shock intensity but gradually reducing shock duration, which would have increased the impact of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point. As each shock was presented for just 0.5 s, we are not confident that rats would detect gradual and progressive changes in its duration in the same way as they can obviously detect gradual and progressive changes in its intensity. We are, however, investigating the effects of gradual extinction in a second order conditioning protocol, which will allow us to examine the full range of parameters that are important for its regulation, including manipulations of stimulus duration. In our second-order conditioning protocol, rats are first exposed to pairings of a 10 s S1 and a 0.5 s foot shock US; and then exposed to pairings of a 30 s S2 and the 10 s S1. Across the latter pairings, rats acquire second-order conditioned fear responses to S2. Importantly, these responses can be extinguished through repeated presentations of the S2 in the absence of its S1-associate; and the duration of the S1 can be progressively and gradually reduced from 10 s to 0 s across the shift to this extinction. These experiments are currently in progress and will eventually represent an extension of the present findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Individual data points should be represented in the test figures (see above also).</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the figures to show these data points.</p><p>Rescorla, R.

However, following a discussion with the reviewers, the significance of the findings could be bolstered to fundamental if you decided to revise the current manuscript by scaling up the investigation to examine a wider set of parameters and conditions under which error can influence state allocation of memories. One way of doing this, but not limited to this, is suggested in the reviews (e.g. maintaining shock intensity, reducing its duration). Relatedly, a more extensive discussion of the Gershamn et al. (2013) paper would be relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in our response to Reviewer 3, we are currently investigating the effects of gradual extinction in a second order conditioning protocol, which will allow us to examine the full range of parameters that are important for its regulation, including manipulations of stimulus duration. These experiments are in-progress and will eventually represent an extension of the present findings. They are not, however, ready to be included as part of the present study.</p><p>We have further referenced the Gershman et al., (2013) paper as well as the related Bouton et al., (2004) paper on the effects of gradually reducing the frequency of the US across extinction. This appears in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion: “The present study adds to a growing body of evidence that manipulations applied across the shift from CS-US pairings to presentations of the CS alone can influence the effectiveness of extinction. For example, Gershman et al., (2013) and Bouton et al., (2004) showed that gradually reducing the proportion of reinforced CS presentations results in less spontaneous recovery and slower reacquisition, respectively; though both studies left open fundamental questions about the basis of their findings (see also Woods &amp; Bouton, 2007).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I don't have any strong recommendations. I think the paper is really great as is.</p><p>One minor suggestion to consider:</p><p>The authors carried out the Spontaneous Recovery experiment in 2 separate experiments. In one, they found differences between the Gradual and Standard Extinction groups, but in the second, they did not. This is perhaps not entirely surprising, since their extinction test was conducted 2 weeks post-extinction, and not all rats show spontaneous recovery within that timeframe. The authors mention that the lack of SR might be due to the low level of freezing reported in their test, but since they are showing group mean data, they might consider showing the individual data points to showcase the range of SR freezing as an additional way to make sense of the variability (ie, maybe a few rats that showed very low freezing carried the mean down in the Standard Extinction group, while others showed return of fear).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have included individual data points for test results in Figures 2D, 2F, 3D, 3H, 4D and 4H. Hence, these figures now reflect both group and individual freezing levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, I thought this was an exceptional paper. Aside from the comments listed above which I'm not sure are inherently addressable, the only real changes I would like to see are that individual data points should be depicted in the main testing figures, as is becoming more conventional in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments. As indicated in our response to the other reviewers, we have added individual data points to the histograms showing test results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Figures</p><p>(1) The test data are presented as bars, but I did wonder if there were differences between the groups from the start of testing or if those emerged across testing (SR vs extinction savings).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added two new figures to the supplementary section, Figures 8 and 9. These display the trial-by-trial data from spontaneous recovery and reinstatements tests in each experiment. The data clearly show that the between-group differences in freezing were very stable across the test sessions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) While I understand the importance of presenting the last extinction session, I felt depicting the entire CS session would be more informative. Alternatively, removing this altogether and leaving the information from the extinction session in the supplemental would focus the reader on the key test data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point. It is important to show that the groups displayed equivalent freezing in the final extinction session prior to testing. Given that the test data are conveniently and best presented in a histogram, we have chosen to present the data from the final extinction session in the same way. The full, trial-by-trial trajectory of freezing across conditioning and extinction, as well as the analyses of these data, are presented in the supplementary A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) I did not find the figures to be very aesthetically pleasing (in part because some panels were unnecessarily large). For example, I found it rather odd that the simulation panels were split in Figure 1. One suggestion of how this figure could look better is to keep the size of panels B, C, and D the same and align them on the same row with the design figure above them. The other option is to have the design figure above the test figure and the two simulation figures above each other and next to the design and test. Also, there are grey lines that appear around the simulation figures on my PDF.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the figures so that they are consistent across experiments and more aesthetically pleasing. Specifically, we have consistently: (1) inserted the simulations of Cochran &amp; Cisler (2019) next to the design schematic; (2) inserted the extinction and test data beneath the design schematic; and (3) Made the sizing of figures more uniform across Experiments 1-6.</p></body></sub-article></article>
