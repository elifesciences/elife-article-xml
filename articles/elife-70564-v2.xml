chromosome amplification provides a route for rapid phenotypic variation and supports the long-term evolution of gene functions. Although the evolutionary importance of copy-number variation is known, little is understood about how genetic background influences its tolerance. Here, we measured fitness costs of over 4000 overexpressed genes in 15 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains representing different lineages, to explore natural variation in tolerating gene overexpression (OE). Strain-specific effects dominated the fitness costs of gene OE. We report global differences in the consequences of gene OE, independent of the amplified gene, as well as gene-specific effects that were dependent on the genetic background. Natural variation in the response to gene OE could be explained by several models, including strain-specific physiological differences, resource limitations, and regulatory sensitivities. This work provides new insight on how genetic background influences tolerance to gene amplification and the evolutionary trajectories accessible to different backgrounds.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene overexpression</kwd><kwd>natural variation</kwd><kwd>copy number variation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA229532</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hose</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Jochem</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name><name><surname>Gasch</surname><given-names>Audrey P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0018409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Place</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Gasch</surname><given-names>Audrey P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GT32GM007133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>DeElegant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32HG002760</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>DeElegant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The genetic background of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> yeast strains influences responses to gene overexpression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic variation that underlies phenotypic differences provides the material on which evolutionary selection acts. This variation includes single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and small deletions, and other structural rearrangements. DNA copy number variants (CNVs) can also serve as a powerful source of variation. CNVs span small tandem duplication of one or few genes to large segmental duplication and even chromosomal aneuploidy that amplifies many genes together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levasseur and Pontarotti, 2011</xref>). Although most duplications are likely lost shortly after creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ohno, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lynch and Conery, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Voordeckers and Verstrepen, 2015</xref>), the functional redundancy afforded by gene duplication can support the long-term evolution of new functions (neofunctionalization) or a division of functional labor among the duplicated genes (subfunctionalization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graur and Wh, 2000</xref>). Neutral or nearly neutral variants can accumulate over time in a population, and this standing variation can accelerate evolution when organisms encounter a new environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hermisson and Pennings, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Przeworski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrett and Schluter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). But CNVs can also produce immediate changes in cellular fitness due to the effective increase in gene expression, at least for some genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kondrashov, 2012</xref>). For example, yeast cultures challenged by low glucose, sulfate, or nitrogen levels benefit from amplifying genes encoding transporters of glucose (<italic>HXT6/7</italic>), sulfate (<italic>SUL1</italic>), and amino acids (<italic>GAP1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gresham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanchez et al., 2017</xref>). A genome-wide study in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> showed that 115 amplified genes, including efflux pumps/transporters, regulatory genes, and prophage genes, increased tolerance to numerous antibiotics and toxins when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Soo et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, amplification of transporters and resistance genes is an early event in the bacterial evolution of antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sandegren and Andersson, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, whole-chromosome duplication in human fungal pathogens can produce immediate resistance to anti-fungal agents, due to overexpression (OE) of drug efflux pumps and their regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Selmecki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sionov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berman and Krysan, 2020</xref>), and gene amplifications often underlies chemoresistance in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yasui et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mishra and Whetstine, 2016</xref>). These examples illustrate the importance of gene duplication in rapid phenotypic change, especially in response to drugs and environmental stresses where tolerant individuals can rapidly emerge.</p><p>While the potential evolutionary benefits afforded by gene amplification are well known, there is also a significant fitness cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moriya, 2015</xref>). The costs and consequences of gene OE are perhaps best studied in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Protein overproduction can cause a shortage of resources, including nucleotides required for additional DNA synthesis, nucleosides consumed by transcriptional burden, and amino acids and ATP required for translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wagner, 2007</xref>). Which resources become limiting can depend on the environment: for example, transcription was shown to be limiting in yeast grown during phosphate starvation, whereas translation is likely limiting when cells are grown in minimal media with low amino acid availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Metzl-Raz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Metzl-Raz et al., 2020</xref>). Other cellular processes can become taxed as well. Several studies used the yeast gene-deletion library to investigate genes and processes required to accommodate OE of specific proteins such as GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farkas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kintaka et al., 2020</xref>). Although results varied somewhat by which protein was overproduced, collectively these studies showed that gene OE can put a burden on mRNA and protein export systems, protein folding chaperones, and protein degradation machinery.</p><p>Cells are also impacted by OE of specific genes and functional classes. Several studies have quantified the fitness consequences of gene-OE libraries in laboratory strains of budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to reveal fitness consequences across many OE genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sopko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Magtanong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makanae et al., 2013</xref>). Deleterious OE genes are enriched for those encoding proteins in multi-subunit complexes such as the ribosome. One model to explain this enrichment is that perturbing stoichiometric balances will perturb complex assembly and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Papp et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Veitia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birchler and Veitia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moriya, 2015</xref>). Cells have mechanisms to control the dosage of some of these proteins, yet high-copy OE can still overwhelm these mechanisms in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fewell and Woolford, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ascencio et al., 2021</xref>). Protein OE can also force promiscuous interactions, perturbing protein interaction networks. Proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are particularly susceptible to promiscuous interactions with other proteins, and deleterious OE genes are enriched for those with IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gsponer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vavouri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chakrabortee et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, proteins encoded by gene duplicates fixed in several species are under-enriched for those with IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting the impact on long-term evolution. Finally, OE of transcription factors, kinases, and other regulators can trigger broad downstream effects that in turn amplify the expression of other downstream proteins, further taxing proteostasis but potentially also producing phenotypes that could be beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sharifpoor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moriya, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Youn et al., 2017</xref>). Ultimately, the fitness benefit of gene OE must outweigh the fitness costs in a given environment in order for the duplication to be beneficial to the cell.</p><p>Although the evolutionary importance of gene duplication has long been appreciated, little is known about natural variation in the <italic>tolerance</italic> of duplication of specific genes. Variation in the cost of a gene’s duplication could have a significant influence on evolutionary trajectories that are accessible to different individuals. Anecdotal evidence shows that different individuals can vary widely in their response to OE of specific genes. For example, prior results from our lab showed that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains from different genetic lineages have unique fitness responses to overexpressed genes when strains are grown in the presence of toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sardi et al., 2016</xref>). A major unanswered question is the degree to which reported trends in the fitness consequences of gene OE vary across natural isolates beyond lab strains and how natural variation influences the response to gene OE.</p><p>To investigate these questions, we expressed the same high-copy gene OE library applied previously to laboratory <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains, in 15 different yeast isolates together representing four lineages and several admixed strains, to explore the variation in tolerance to gene OE. Our results distinguish universal effects common to many studied strains versus strain-specific effects, including global responses independent of the OE gene as well as gene-specific sensitivities. We present evidence for several general models explaining strain-specific variation in the response to gene OE. These results raise important implications for the accessibility of evolutionary trajectories afforded by gene OE depending on genetic background.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview</title><p>We chose 15 genetically diverse <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains for analysis, including strains from four defined genetic lineages (including European Wine, North American Oak, Asian, and West African), one commonly used lab strain (BY4743), and three strains that represent recently admixed ‘mosaic’ strains. These isolates were collected from diverse environments including soil, vineyards, sake production, sewage, and clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capriotti, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurtzman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCullough et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sniegowski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Strope et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In addition to genetic diversity, these strains display extensive phenotype variation, for example, in nitrogen and carbon utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Warringer et al., 2011</xref>), nutrient requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Warringer et al., 2011</xref>), and stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kvitek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Will et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Warringer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Strope et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng and Wang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sardi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sardi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Each strain was transformed with the MoBY 2.0 library that includes ~4900 open reading frames (ORFs) with their native upstream and downstream sequences, cloned into a high-copy 2-µm replicating plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Magtanong et al., 2011</xref>). We chose the high-copy expression system to expose gene-specific fitness differences that may be too subtle to score when genes are merely duplicated. Although the lab strain replicates the empty vector at ~11 copies per haploid genome, most other strains maintain ~2–5 copies per haploid genome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). All strains were readily transformed with the library and grew at expected growth rates in selective media, indicating that all strains could maintain the plasmid. An aliquot of each library transformed culture was collected before and after 10 generations of competitive growth, and relative plasmid abundance was scored by quantitative sequencing of plasmid barcodes to measure changes in plasmid abundance in the population, in biological triplicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see Materials and methods).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of experiment and results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Isolates transformed with the MoBY 2.0 overexpression library were grown competitively and changes in plasmid abundance were quantified, see Materials and methods for details.

We measured the log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) in relative barcode abundance after 10 generations of competitive growth, which we refer to as the relative fitness score. Genes that are detrimental when overexpressed will drop in frequency in the population because of reduced cell growth or because cells suppress the abundance of toxic plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makanae et al., 2013</xref>), both of which we interpret as a relative fitness defect. In contrast, beneficial plasmids will rise in frequency in the population over time. We focus on genes with a significant fitness effect when OE at a false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;5% (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>We first validated our results by comparing fitness effects measured in lab strain BY4743 to a previous study using a similar library of yeast genes expressed from their native promoters in a similar strain background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makanae et al., 2013</xref>). There was highly significant overlap between the 851 genes, we identified that produce a defect upon OE and previous results of Makanae et al. (p=8 ×10<sup>−45</sup>, Hypergeometric test) despite differences in media and experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makanae et al., 2013</xref>). Deleterious OE genes identified in both studies were enriched for genes involved in translation, including ribosomal proteins and essential genes, and a largely overlapping group of genes repressed as part of the yeast Environmental Stress Response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>) (p&lt;1.4×10<sup>−10</sup>, Hypergeometric test). Thus, our approach is robust to replication and comparable to previous studies, validating our methods.</p><p>We next quantified the library effects across strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We identified 4064 genes whose OE produced a reproducible fitness effect in at least one strain (FDR&lt;0.05), with a median of 1726 genes per strain. However, there was a wide range in the number of consequential genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Mosaic strain Y2209 was affected by 635 OE genes, whereas Y12 (isolated from African palm wine but genotypically similar to Asian strains) was affected by 3060 OE genes. (We note that the low number of genes identified in YPS606 may be influenced by reduced statistical power since only duplicates of that strain were analyzed, and the lower abundance of the 2-µm plasmid in the case of YJM1592 and YJM978.) Most significant OE genes were detrimental, although there were some differences across strains. For example, whereas roughly half of the significant OE genes in the lab strain BY4743 caused a defect, over 95% of significant OE genes in the Y12 strain were detrimental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Strain backgrounds display a wide range of fitness effects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The number of deleterious genes in each strain (FDR&lt;0.05), colored by lineage as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.

Indeed, we found that commonly deleterious genes had more protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oughtred et al., 2021</xref>) (p=4.0×10<sup>−69</sup>, Wilcoxon test) and included more proteins that form complexes as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pu et al., 2009</xref> (p=6.6×10<sup>−12</sup>, Hypergeometric test) compared to all other genes measured in at least one strain. This confirms the result of Makanae et al. who also found that dosage-sensitive genes in the lab strain are enriched for proteins with many interactions and proteins in complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makanae et al., 2013</xref>). Translation factors accounted for 163/431 (~38%) of the commonly deleterious genes and are known to participate in many interactions, raising the possibility that this functional group is driving the result. Even after removing genes involved in translation from consideration (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), the remaining commonly deleterious genes were still enriched for complex members and proteins with many physical interactions, strongly suggesting these features as driving factors in toxicity. We also noted that common deleterious OE genes contain a higher proportion of disordered proteins (as estimated by median IUPRED scores for each protein; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mészáros et al., 2018</xref>) than other genes measured in the experiment (p&lt;4.7×10<sup>−12</sup>, Wilcoxon test), which is consistent with other analyses of deleterious OE genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vavouri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Another hypothesis for dosage sensitivity is that already abundant proteins emerging from genes and transcripts that are highly transcribed and/or translated may be more subject to aggregation if further overexpressed. While the total set of common genes is expressed at higher mRNA and protein abundance, this trend was driven by translation factors and was not significant when translation factors were removed from the analysis. Thus, while high abundance of translation factors could contribute to their dosage effects, high expression alone is not a predictor of OE toxicity for other genes. Together, our work suggests that the propensity to disrupt protein interaction networks is likely a driving factor in OE gene toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Strain-specific responses to library overexpression may reflect global differences in resource allocation</title><p>Although we identified a common set of deleterious OE genes, strains clearly varied in their response to the library, in multiple distinct ways. Even for commonly deleterious genes, isolates varied in the severity of their responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In general, strains with a larger number of deleterious OE genes displayed more severe median relative fitness costs in response to common-gene OE than strains with fewer deleterious OE genes—the exception was North American oak-soil strains that showed aberrantly high fitness costs of common-gene OE even though they were not the most sensitive in terms of number of deleterious-gene effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, purple boxes). These differences cannot be explained by gross differences in gene-OE levels, since strains with comparable Moby 2.0 copy numbers showed vastly different responses. For example, BC187 and YPS128 carry comparable plasmid copy numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), yet YPS128 is much more sensitive to commonly deleterious genes than BC187. Instead, these data suggest that some strains are more sensitive to gene amplification, even for OE genes that are commonly deleterious across many strains.</p><p>Several possibilities could explain these results. One is that cells have different capacities for tolerating protein overproduction, regardless of the OE gene. To test this, we measured growth rates in response to OE of a non-native yeast protein, GFP, expressed from the highly active <italic>TEF1</italic> promoter on a low-copy CEN vector. Strains with the most deleterious OE genes in fact did not show higher sensitivity to GFP overexpression; however, three of the four North American oak-soil strains did, as indicated by significantly slower doubling times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The reduced growth was not due to excessive GFP production as the oak strains express GFP at levels comparable to other strains tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). One possibility is that these strains have reduced capacity to tolerate high protein production due to general amino acid shortage. To test, we measured growth rates during GFP OE when strains were grown in synthetic media with and without amino acids; however, growth rates of the oak strains as a group were not different than other strains, all of which grew comparably slower in the absence of amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The sensitivity of all strains to amino acid shortage is consistent with previous reports in the lab strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farkas et al., 2018</xref>). However, the degree of sensitivity to amino acid shortage did not correlate with the overall number of deleterious genes per strain, indicating that this is unlikely a driving factor explaining strain-specific effects.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Strains show different sensitivities to protein and DNA expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The average and standard deviation (n=3) of doubling times for strains containing a CEN empty vector (light gray) or CEN vector expressing GFP from the <italic>TEF1</italic> promoter (purple).

There was also no correlation between deleterious gene number and Moby 2.0 copy number.

Although many strains grew slower when expressing the empty vector under selection, some strains were more significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). While none of the tests passed an FDR&lt;0.05, the trend was consistent across replicates for most strains. Indeed, the number of deleterious OE genes was correlated with the percent decrease in growth rate when strains expressed the empty Moby 2.0 vector (r=0.7, p=0.005, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, strains with the greatest sensitivity to the empty Moby 2.0 vector were not the same as those most sensitive to GFP overproduction, revealing separable effects. Thus, the added stress of DNA/Moby 2.0 overproduction may render some strains more sensitive to gene OE (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Strain-specific responses to specific genes implicate models for variable OE tolerance</title><p>In addition to gene-independent differences in tolerating overproduction, strains also varied in their response to specific OE genes. Most overexpressed genes produced a relative fitness effect in a small number of strains, suggesting the widespread influence of genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To further investigate, we identified genes whose OE produced a significant fitness effect in each strain and not more than two others, which we defined as ‘strain-specific’ gene lists. The lists ranged from 41 genes in the Y2209 strain to 1763 genes in the Y12 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). It is important to note that some of these effects in strains overly sensitive to the empty vector could still reflect generalized strain sensitivities. For example, 60% of the deleterious genes identified by our criteria as ‘strain-specific’ in Y12 were shared with another of the top four strains most sensitive to the empty vector (DVBPG1373, YJM1592, YPS163, and YJM1389, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We compared, separately, genes that were specifically beneficial or detrimental in a given strain to a list of genes in that strain that were well-measured but produced no effect on fitness (FDR&gt;0.1, see Materials and methods). To interpret the results, we also measured strain-specific gene expression differences through triplicated RNA-seq transcriptomic experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) to explore connections between native gene expression and the fitness consequences of gene OE.</p><p>Among the many sets of functional and biophysical enrichments (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), several themes emerged that suggest models for strain-specific responses to gene OE. The first model may be particular to our experimental design, in which the S288c allele is expressed in the library. Beneficial OE genes in BC187 and Y7568 harbored an overabundance of nonsynonymous SNPs between the overexpressed S288c allele and the strains’ native allele (p&lt;0.0009, Wilcoxon test). One possibility is that the S288c allele may complement deleterious SNPs accumulated in those strains. For two other strains, YJM1273 and Y7568, deleterious OE genes showed a higher proportion of amino acid differences between native and expressed alleles (p&lt;2×10<sup>−4</sup>, Wilcoxon test). Here, allelic conflict could explain strain-specific sensitivity to the S288c allele, if the focal strain evolved its own polymorphisms. These strains did not show higher genetic distances overall from S288c, raising the possibility that the high rate of allelic differences may reflect genes under accelerated evolution.</p><p>A second model explaining strain-specific gene OE effects is one in which the unique physiology of a strain causes a unique response to gene OE. This model is supported by functional enrichments for strain-specific OE gene lists, especially when those functions relate to differentially expressed genes in the same strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). There were several functional categories that were enriched for multiple strain-specific lists. For example, OE genes beneficial to DBVPG1373 or Y12 were enriched for genes involved in the mitotic cell cycle (p&lt;0.0004, Hypergeometric test). Both strains showed differential gene expression of cell-cycle genes: G2/M genes were expressed significantly lower in both strains and, in the case of DBVPG1373, S-phase genes were expressed significantly higher, raising the possibility of underlying differences in the strains’ cell-cycle regulation or timing. Another recurring example is reflected in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. Beneficial OE genes affecting BC187 and Y389 were enriched for mitochondrial functions including respiration and cytochrome complex assembly, respectively; both strains showed altered expression of genes related to mitochondria. In contrast, genes whose OE was deleterious to Y12 were enriched for those encoding proteins in the mitochondrial matrix, and this functional category was enriched among genes expressed higher in Y12. Notably, genes related to mitochondrial function were also deleterious in a number of other strains sensitive to the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), raising the possibility that these genes may be generally deleterious in suboptimal or stressful conditions (or conversely that strains with inherent differences in mitochondrial function, suggested by the differential expression in the native strains, are sensitive to the vector). Although the exact connections in these cases will require experimentation to elucidate, that related functional categories are associated with a strain’s unique gene-OE susceptibilities and their unique expression differences points to physiological differences that could influence strain responses (see Discussion).</p><p>A third model is a specific example of physiological differences—strain-specific resource limitation. OE genes deleterious to vineyard strain DBVPG1373 encode proteins with a higher proportion of tryptophan compared to inconsequential genes (p=8.1×10<sup>−5</sup>, Wilcoxon test). That the encoded proteins are related by their composition hinted that limited tryptophan availability in this strain could sensitize cells to proteins high in tryptophan content. Interestingly, transcriptomic profiling revealed that genes repressed in this strain are enriched for genes encoding aromatic amino acid biosynthesis proteins (p=4.1×10<sup>−6</sup>, Hypergeometric test), and other amino acids. Tryptophan is a precursor for de novo synthesis of NAD+, and other genes in this pathway (<italic>BNA1, 4, 6</italic>, and <italic>7</italic>) as well as genes in the nicotinic acid/nicotinamide salvage pathway (<italic>NTP1</italic>, <italic>NRK1</italic>, and <italic>TRP2</italic>) were also repressed in DBVPG1373. Together, these data raised the possibility that DBVPG1373 is sensitive to conditions that deplete tryptophan from the cell. One prediction is that DBVPG1373, but not other strains, should be especially sensitive to OE of tryptophan-containing proteins when grown in tryptophan-limiting media. To test this, we compared growth rates of DBVPG1373 and control strains BC187 and YPS128 overexpressing tryptophan-enriched genes <italic>COS1</italic> (3.9% tryptophan) or <italic>MAL32</italic> (3.4% tryptophan) in synthetic media with and without tryptophan. DBVPG1373 expressing Moby 2.0 vectors grew especially poorly in synthetic media compared to the other strains, perhaps obscuring the deleterious effects of <italic>COS1</italic> and <italic>MAL32</italic> OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Nonetheless, when overexpressing the genes, DBVPG1373 was reproducibly more sensitive in the absence of tryptophan (p≤0.05, one-tailed paired t-test), whereas the other strains were not. It is possible that this strain is more sensitive to any OE genes under these conditions, if the cellular system is taxed in the absence of tryptophan. Nonetheless, these results support the model that strains can vary in resource limitation (see Discussion).</p><p>A final model is that OE of regulators can perturb networks of downstream proteins, and strains sensitive to those networks will be overly sensitive to OE of the regulators. One possible example is seen in mosaic strain Y7568, whose deleterious OE gene list is enriched for DNA binding proteins (p=1.8×10<sup>−4</sup>, Hypergeometric test), including site-specific transcription factors (Flo8, War1, Pho2, Pdr1, Pdr8, and Hcm1). Collectively, the combined set of these factors’ targets is heavily enriched for genes encoding plasma membrane-localized proteins including drug and other transporters (p=5.7×10<sup>−5</sup>). Remarkably, the list of OE genes that are deleterious in Y7568 is also enriched for genes encoding plasma membrane proteins (p=1.8×10<sup>−4</sup>). Although not enriched above chance, 9% of the deleterious OE genes in Y7568 are direct targets of one of the six factors above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monteiro et al., 2020</xref>). These connections give support to the model that OE of regulators can be deleterious via OE of downstream toxic genes, and that the effects can be strain-specific.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Genes highly beneficial to some strains may relate to 2-µm replication</title><p>We identified a unique cluster of 21 genes whose OE was strongly beneficial in over half (60%) of the strains, but notably not the lab strain.

Interestingly, over half the genes are located next to a centromere, and on closer inspection the plasmids would have cloned the centromere in the genes’ upstream regions. This was interesting because 2-µm segregation is closely coupled with chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mehta et al., 2002</xref>).

Out of the ~4000 genes whose OE impacted fitness in at least one isolate, only ~12% influenced fitness in 10 or more of the 15 strains. A hallmark of the 431 commonly deleterious OE genes is their potential to perturb protein-interaction networks, either because the proteins naturally display many connections or because their biophysical properties may force promiscuous interactions when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gsponer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vavouri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chakrabortee et al., 2016</xref>). But even for commonly deleterious genes, strains varied in the cost incurred by their OE. We suggest two main classes for strain-specific effects. One is general responses that may be independent of the overexpressed gene. For example, some strains became sensitized to gene OE in the context of the high-copy plasmid: those with greater sensitivity to the empty vector (independent of the vector copy number) showed proportionately more deleterious OE genes and with greater fitness costs. Whether this limitation is due to the burden of extra DNA or something related to the stress of 2-µm replication is not clear; nonetheless, the result unmasks strain-specific vulnerabilities that have a broad impact. We note that many of the genes scored as deleterious in these sensitive strains may cause fitness defects in other strains grown in suboptimal or stressful conditions. The second class of strain-specific effects pertains to gene-specific responses. Our results suggest several explanatory models, including strain-specific physiological differences, strain-specific resource limitation, and unique sensitivities to network perturbation by regulator amplification.</p><p>The implications of our study are several-fold. The first is that strains may have differential access to evolutionary trajectories if the cost of gene duplication varies across individuals. CNVs can produce immediate phenotypic gains for genes not subject to dosage control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kondrashov, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hose et al., 2015</xref>), but they can also produce standing genetic variation on which selection can later act. This standing variation is important for the long-term functional evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ohno, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graur and Wh, 2000</xref>) and it can also accelerate evolution when selective pressures change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). If the cost of gene duplication, or simply increasing expression from a single-copy gene, is higher in some backgrounds, then those strains may be less likely to evolve through CNV mechanisms. An extreme example is whole-chromosomal aneuploidy, which is a potent mode of rapid evolution that is prevalent in some genetic backgrounds yet poorly tolerated in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Torres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gallone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scopel et al., 2021</xref>). Differences in aneuploidy tolerance could be heavily influenced by different gene-specific sensitivities across strains. Consistent with the notion that these differences can affect evolutionary trajectories, several studies have found that different fungal strains evolve through different mechanisms when exposed to the same laboratory selections, where some genetic backgrounds leverage aneuploidy, polyploidy, and CNV while others do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Filteau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerstein and Berman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tung et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Another implication of our work is the interplay between gene OE, genetic background, and environment. Past work has shown that the cost of gene OE in a single strain can vary with nutrient limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wagner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frumkin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farkas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kintaka et al., 2020</xref>). We propose that variation in environmental responses will further reveal variation in gene OE differences across strains, as hinted at by our studies. For example, strain Y7568 showed little sensitivity to GFP OE—unless amino acids were removed from the media in which case it grew among the worst across strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The sensitivity of vineyard strain DBVPG1373 to tryptophan-containing proteins was exacerbated by tryptophan depletion, an environment that produced little added effect on other strains. Even the sensitivity to the Moby 2.0 empty vector may have unmasked strain sensitivities that are not evident if those strains are grown in other environments. Understanding gene-by-environment interactions is among the greatest challenges in genetics. Understanding how this interplay influences evolutionary potential is even more complicated but beginning to emerge through experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Filteau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tung et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The results of our work also have broad application, from microbial engineering to human health. Many industrial processes use gene OE to improve microbial traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keasling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xie and Fussenegger, 2018</xref>). Understanding (and ultimately predicting) how the response to engineering strategies will vary across host strains could accelerate engineering efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Steensels et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sardi and Gasch, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sardi and Gasch, 2018</xref>). Interpreting functional variants, from SNPs to CNVs, is also a major goal in human genetics and precision medicine. While already a colossal goal, incorporating genetic background interactions in such predictions will be fundamental. Elucidating mechanistic underpinnings in model organisms will continue to pave the way toward deeper understanding.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (kan<sup>r</sup>)</td><td valign="top">kan<sup>r</sup></td><td valign="top">Yeast knockout Collection; Horizon Discovery</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">kanMX</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BY4743 MATa/α his3Δ1/his3Δ1 leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0 LYS2/lys2Δ0 met15Δ0/MET15 ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">BY4743</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BC187</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerke et al., 2006</xref>, doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.106.058453">10.1534/genetics.106.058453</ext-link></td><td valign="top">BC187</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DBVPG1373</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capriotti, 1955</xref></td><td valign="top">DBVPG1373</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NCYC3290</td><td valign="top">Bili wine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liti et al., 2009</xref>, doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07743">10.1038/nature07743</ext-link></td><td valign="top">NCYC3290</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Y12</td><td valign="top">Palm wine, C.

Measured and imputed data were analyzed using edgeR version 3.22.1, using a linear model with generation (0 or 10) as a factor. Genes whose barcodes were significantly different after 10 generations of growth in each strain at an FDR&lt;0.05 were taken as significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>).

The correlation was lower for these strains (0.55–0.65) even though their replicates agreed well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); the apparently lower correlation is almost certainly driven by noise in the nearly negligible fitness changes (i.e., log<sub>2</sub> values close to 0).

Cultures were pelleted by centrifugation and flash frozen with liquid nitrogen and maintained at −80°C until RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted by hot phenol lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gasch, 2002</xref>), digested with Turbo DNase (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37°C, and precipitated with 5 M lithium acetate for 30 min at −20°C. rRNA depletion was performed using the Ribo-Zero (Yeast) rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and libraries were generated according to the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA sample preparation guide (revision E). cDNA synthesis was performed using fragment prime finish mix (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Illumina adaptors were ligated to DNA using PCR (10 cycles). The samples were pooled, resplit, and run across three lanes on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer, generating single-end 100 bp reads, with ~7,494,848 reads per sample.

Interestingly, the results show universal effects common to most of the genetic backgrounds, but also strain-specific effects of the gene over-expression. Together, these findings show how the effect and fitness cost of expression changes depends on both the affected gene as well as the general genetic background in which the expression change takes place.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Natural variation in the consequences of gene overexpression and its implications for evolutionary trajectories&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Initial plasmid coverage can significantly impact the bc enrichment analyses. Looking at the data I don't think the authors have real biological triplicate data, e.g. the imputated values are usually also presented in all triplicates.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data are biological triplicates, in that the 10 generations of growth were done independently on different days. We transformed each strain to least 5-fold replication (i.e. 5X more colonies that the number of plasmids) with the same pool of plasmid DNA. The biological replicates were performed independently on separate days, by thawing the original replicated pool and growing precisely 10 generations. We went to great care to handle replicates as precisely as possible, owing to the high replication. Interestingly, in other experiments in our lab done during stress (not shown) the results are more variable across replicates, suggesting that not all conditions will give as high replication as we have produced here. Nonetheless, by all reasonable measures, these can be considered biological replicates. Data were imputed only for genes that were well measured at Generation 0 – data imputation was done for the most deleterious genes that reproducibly drop out of the population after outgrowth, which is why they are often imputed in multiple of the replicate Generation-10 samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What's the number of genes that were quantifiable across different strain backgrounds at T0? How does the initial bc frequency impact the number of significant OE genes in each strain?</p></disp-quote><p>Excluding YPS606 which was done only in duplicate, the number of genes measured at Generation 0 (and thus used as input in edgeR) ranged from 3525 in YPS128 to 4072 in strain BY4743. There was no correlation between the number of genes measured at Generation 0 and the number of significant genes (R2 = 0.007). As outlined below, differences in statistical power cannot explain our results, since strains with nearly identical correlation among replicates show wildly different numbers of significant genes. Thus, while there are always subtle differences in statistical power, this cannot explain our main conclusion – that different genetic backgrounds show different sensitivities to gene OE, due to generalizable and gene-specific responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For the statistical tests the authors performed, although the test and p-value was indicated, the actual statistics are mostly absent. More information is needed for these tests, for example the exact number and identity of the background genes in all the hypergeometric tests.</p></disp-quote><p>We were careful to document all the statistical methods as well as details about what gene sets were used a background for the various tests. We now provide an additional supplemental Supplementary File 5, which summarizes genes used as the background set including: all measured genes except common genes (used for Wilcoxon and Fisher tests analyzing the Common gene set), genes with no effect in each strain, i.e. those that were well measured but had no fitness effect (FDR &gt; 0.01, used for tests analyzing strain-specific gene sets listed in Dataset 1), and the total set of genes significant in one or more strains, less the common genes (used for hypergeometric tests for strain-specific gene lists). All of the gene lists on which enrichment and functional assessment were done area already provided in various tabs in Dataset 1. These gene lists and our detailed descriptions provide all the necessary information to repeat all the statistical analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors discussed several models for strain specific OE phenotypes, however, they were all conjectures with overwhelming confounding effects from plasmid maintenance/tolerance differences, general protein over expressing tolerance etc. I think these parts should be more of a discussion than part of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point. As outlined elsewhere in this response letter, we have now added more clarification to the text that some of the effects are due to strain sensitivity to the Moby vector, we provide a new analysis that shows that 60% of strain-specific genes in Y12 may be due to it’s sensitivity to the empty vector, and we provide more balanced presentation at multiple points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The experiments done on the beneficial OE genes are inconclusive at best and again, too much confounding factors can be in the play here to draw any solid conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>In the manuscript, we discuss a set of genes whose OE is beneficial to a number of strains. Many of the OE plasmids cloned a centromere, suggesting a link to their beneficial effect. We went to considerable lengths to elucidate the mechanism and if the cloned CEN explains the fitness benefit; however, in the end our results were not conclusive. We made no claims about the mechanism in the paper. As this information may still be useful to others in the field, we opted to keep it in the manuscript without a strong focus or conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) It would be important to show the full fitness score distributions, including neutral and beneficial OEs, in a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>These plots are not particularly informative; however we direct the readers to Figure 1B which shows the colorized magnitudes and distributions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reproducibility of the screen should be provided for each strain. I also wonder how does the number of toxic genes differ between strains that show very similar measurement errors / statistical power? Can still large differences be observed?</p></disp-quote><p>As presented above, the replicate correlations are misleading – strains with the fewest genes of large effect (i.e. strains in which most log2 fitness effects are close to 0) have a reduced replicate correlation simply because the correlation is driven by noise / subtle variation in near-zero values. The distributions and replication is evident from Figure 1B, since we show all the biological replicates for each strain in the figure. As discussed above for two strains with nearly identically replication, there are widely different numbers of significant genes. Thus, differences in statistical power cannot explain our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be biologically insightful to attempt to statistically separate strain-specific OE effects from the strain-specific cost of carrying the empty Moby plasmid. Thus, identify strain-specific effects that would not be expected based on empty plasmid cost. These cases might better reflect physiological differences between strains.</p></disp-quote><p>This would be very difficult to do. We do not know the reason for strain sensitivity to the empty Moby 2.0 library, and thus it is hard to know how to correct for. We did add several clarifications to the text and cited that 60% of the genes meeting our strain-specific criteria in Y12 were shared with at least one other strain sensitive to the Moby 2.0 vector, raising the possibility that these are not really gene-specific responses but may represent general sensitivity of those strains to gene OE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the analysis of tryptophan-enriched genes, it would be important to include, as a negative control, a few other genes that have similar functions but are not tryptophan-enriched.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the guidelines of the editor, we have added a clarification that it is possible that this strain is sensitive to all OE genes in the absence of tryptophan.</p></body></sub-article></article>
