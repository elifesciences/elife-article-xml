transcribed position in mRNA and snRNA that is essential for diverse physiological processes. m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping methods assume each gene uses a single start nucleotide. However, gene transcription usually involves multiple start sites, generating numerous 5’ isoforms. Thus, gene-level annotations cannot capture the diversity of m<sup>6</sup>Am modification in the transcriptome. Here, we describe CROWN-seq, which simultaneously identifies transcription-start nucleotides and quantifies m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry for each 5’ isoform that initiates with adenosine. Using CROWN-seq, we map the m<sup>6</sup>Am landscape in nine human cell lines. Our findings reveal that m<sup>6</sup>Am is nearly always a high stoichiometry modification, with only a small subset of cellular mRNAs showing lower m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry. We find that m<sup>6</sup>Am is associated with increased transcript expression and provide evidence that m<sup>6</sup>Am may be linked to transcription initiation associated with specific promoter sequences and initiation mechanisms. These data suggest a potential new function for m<sup>6</sup>Am in influencing transcription.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA modifications</kwd><kwd>m6Am</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>small nuclear RNA</kwd><kwd>PCIF1</kwd><kwd>FTO</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 NS111631</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaffrey</surname><given-names>Samie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 OD030335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaffrey</surname><given-names>Samie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RM1 HG011563</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaffrey</surname><given-names>Samie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH121072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaffrey</surname><given-names>Samie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DA059544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaffrey</surname><given-names>Samie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CROWN-seq provides the first precise and quantitative map of <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>,2’-<italic>O</italic>-dimethyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>Am) in mRNA and snRNA, revealing the link between m<sup>6</sup>Am modification and efficient transcription, rather than translation and RNA stability.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>m<sup>6</sup>Am (<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>,2’-<italic>O</italic>-dimethyladenosine) is the most common modified nucleotide in mRNA. m<sup>6</sup>Am is found specifically at the first transcribed position of mRNAs, termed the transcription-start nucleotide (TSN), which reflects the transcription-start site (TSS) in DNA. During transcription, the TSN typically acquires a 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methyl modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galloway et al., 2020</xref>), which is deposited by CMTR1 (Cap-specific mRNA nucleoside-2'-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bélanger et al., 2010</xref>). In the case of mRNAs that use adenosine as the TSN, the initial 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methyladenosine (Am) can be further methylated on the <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup> position of the adenine nucleobase to form m<sup>6</sup>Am by PCIF1 (phosphorylated CTD interacting factor 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akichika et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Studies using PCIF1 depletion (i.e. m<sup>6</sup>Am depletion) have revealed that m<sup>6</sup>Am has important roles in cell physiology. In normal cells, PCIF1 depletion does not appear to affect cell growth or viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akichika et al., 2019</xref>). However, in oxidative stress conditions, PCIF1 deficiency leads to impaired cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akichika et al., 2019</xref>). In cancer cells, PCIF1 depletion markedly enhances cell death during anti-PD1 therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2023b</xref>). During viral infection, PCIF1 depletion results in increased HIV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>), impaired SARS-Cov-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2023a</xref>), and increased VSV immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tartell et al., 2021</xref>). These studies indicate that m<sup>6</sup>Am has important roles in diverse cellular contexts.</p><p>A major goal has been to identify and characterize the m<sup>6</sup>Am- and Am-containing mRNAs. Initial chromatographic studies in the 1970s demonstrated that cellular mRNAs can exist in m<sup>6</sup>Am and Am forms, with the Am form being more predominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wei et al., 1975</xref>). To map m<sup>6</sup>Am modified genes, several antibody-based methods were developed, including miCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mauer et al., 2019</xref>), m<sup>6</sup>Am-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2021</xref>), m6ACE-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koh et al., 2019</xref>), and m6Am-exo-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sendinc et al., 2019</xref>). These methods can identify m<sup>6</sup>Am sites (miCLIP and m6ACE-seq), m<sup>6</sup>Am peaks (m<sup>6</sup>Am-seq), or m<sup>6</sup>Am containing genes (m<sup>6</sup>Am-exo-seq). Am genes were identified when m<sup>6</sup>Am was not detected but the reported TSN in publicly available datasets was A. The remaining genes were annotated as Gm, Cm, or Um based on public TSS annotations.</p><p>However, despite these transcriptome-wide m<sup>6</sup>Am maps, the effect of m<sup>6</sup>Am on mRNA is unclear. By examining m<sup>6</sup>Am genes, along with the change in mRNA stability and translation, small and inconsistent effects have been observed from different labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akichika et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sendinc et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulias et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mauer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We considered the possibility that the difficulty in establishing m<sup>6</sup>Am function may be due to flaws in the way that genes are designated as m<sup>6</sup>Am genes. Previous m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping studies treated m<sup>6</sup>Am like other modified nucleotides, which are internal. In studies of internal nucleotides, such as m<sup>6</sup>A, isoform diversity is generally not considered since these different isoforms rarely impact the detection of the nucleotide. In contrast, m<sup>6</sup>Am is highly affected by isoform diversity since it is located at the 5’ end. Most genes generate multiple transcript 5’ isoforms that each use a different TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>). However, previous m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping studies assumed that each gene has a single TSN, whose identity was based on existing gene annotations. Therefore, existing m<sup>6</sup>Am maps that assign a specific start nucleotide to each gene cannot be accurate, since most genes produce a range of transcripts, with possibly multiple start nucleotides. For this reason, m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping and functional studies of m<sup>6</sup>Am need to be performed in a way that considers the 5’ isoform diversity of most genes.</p><p>Another concern is that the existing m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping studies designated each gene as either m<sup>6</sup>Am or Am. However, it is possible that m<sup>6</sup>Am levels can be variable, with only a fraction of transcripts containing m<sup>6</sup>Am and the remainder containing Am. Stoichiometric maps of m<sup>6</sup>Am can potentially reveal the degree to which a transcript would be influenced by m<sup>6</sup>Am-dependent pathways.</p><p>Quantitative m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping is especially important for small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), which also contain m<sup>6</sup>Am at their TSN. Initial biochemical characterization of snRNAs revealed that the first nucleotide was Am (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dönmez et al., 2004</xref>), but subsequent studies showed that nearly half of all snRNAs are initially methylated to m<sup>6</sup>Am, and then demethylated by FTO to Am (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mauer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koh et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, m<sup>6</sup>Am is a transient intermediate in snRNA biogenesis. Notably, m<sup>6</sup>Am levels can be highly regulated in snRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mauer et al., 2019</xref>), however, current m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping methods are unable to quantify changes in m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry.</p><p>To understand the transcriptome-wide distribution of m<sup>6</sup>Am, we developed CROWN-seq (<bold><underline>C</underline></bold>onversion <bold><underline>R</underline></bold>esistance detection <bold><underline>O</underline></bold>n <bold><underline>W</underline></bold>hole-transcriptomic transcription-start <bold><italic><underline>N</underline></italic></bold><sup>6</sup>,2’-<italic>O</italic>-dimethyladenosine by <bold><underline>seq</underline></bold>uencing), an antibody-free quantitative m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping method. Using CROWN-seq, we define the overall repertoire of 5’ isoforms for each gene, and the specific isoforms that use m<sup>6</sup>Am as the TSN across nine different cell lines. We find that annotations of genes based on a single start nucleotide do not capture the diversity of 5’ transcript isoforms for most genes. Instead, m<sup>6</sup>Am is more accurately assessed for each 5’ isoform separately. Nearly all A-initiated transcript isoforms have very high m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry, and that transcripts containing Am as the TSN are relatively rare. Transcript isoforms that contain m<sup>6</sup>Am are more highly expressed, and loss of m<sup>6</sup>Am due to depletion of PCIF1 leads to reduced expression of transcript isoforms containing m<sup>6</sup>Am. However, we find that this effect is not due to decreased mRNA stability. Instead, the depletion of PCIF1 affects transcripts based on upstream core promoter elements. Our data suggest that transcription mechanisms that utilize specific core promoter sequences achieve high expression, which might be linked to a transcription-promoting effect of m<sup>6</sup>Am. Overall, our quantitative transcriptome-wide transcription-start nucleotide m<sup>6</sup>Am maps reveal a markedly distinct m<sup>6</sup>Am profile different from previously measured, show that m<sup>6</sup>Am is the predominant modified nucleotide relative to Am in mRNA, and suggest roles of m<sup>6</sup>Am in transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ReCappable-seq reveals high transcript isoform diversity at the 5’ end</title><p>In previous m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping studies, genes were annotated to be m<sup>6</sup>Am, Am, Gm, Cm, or Um (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akichika et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mauer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sendinc et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulias et al., 2019</xref>), based on the assumption that each gene has one major transcription-start nucleotide. To determine how often genes are characterized by a single major TSS we used ReCappable-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yan et al., 2022</xref>), a method for quantitative measurement of transcription-start sites. ReCappable-seq is similar to traditional TSS-seq methods which involve ligation of an oligonucleotide to the 5’ end of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>), thus precisely marking the TSN. However, ReCappable-seq adds an enrichment step for capped mRNA fragments to significantly reduce background signals from internal sites that are derived from RNA cleavage. Thus, ReCappable-seq provides a highly sensitive and precise mapping of TSNs at single-nucleotide resolution (see Materials and methods).</p><p>By analyzing ReCappable-seq data in HEK293T cells, we found that protein-coding genes tend to have multiple TSNs. Among the 9199 genes analyzed, we identified 87,624 TSNs (see Materials and methods). On average, a gene uses 9.5±9 (mean and s.d., hereafter) TSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Only ~9% of genes contain a single TSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Using this criterion, we found that only ~24% of m<sup>6</sup>Am genes determined by miCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulias et al., 2019</xref>) are primarily composed of A-TSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similar observations were also found in other m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akichika et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sendinc et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><p>Our ReCappable-seq analysis also suggested that previous m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping methods may not have detected the diversity of m<sup>6</sup>Am in the transcriptome. ReCappable-seq identified many more A-TSNs than the total number of previously mapped m<sup>6</sup>Am sites. For example, in both <italic>SRSF1</italic> and <italic>ADAR</italic>, many A-TSNs are seen using ReCappable-seq, however, m<sup>6</sup>Am signals were only found at a few of these A-TSNs by either miCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulias et al., 2019</xref>), m<sup>6</sup>Am-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2021</xref>), or m6ACE-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koh et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). This might suggest that only a few A-TSNs are m<sup>6</sup>Am modified. However, it is also possible that the antibody-based mapping methods do not have the resolution or sensitivity to distinguish between m<sup>6</sup>Am at different 5’ isoforms. Notably, previous m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping studies exhibited very low overlap with each other. miCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulias et al., 2019</xref>), m<sup>6</sup>Am-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2021</xref>), and m6ACE-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koh et al., 2019</xref>) together identified 7480 m<sup>6</sup>Am sites in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Among these sites, only 1.1% (84) are found in all three methods and 9.7% (728) are found in at least two studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate a variety of concerns about existing m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CROWN-seq integrates TSN mapping and m<sup>6</sup>Am quantification</title><p>To understand the distribution of m<sup>6</sup>Am in the transcriptome, we sought to develop a method to identify the entire repertoire of TSNs among all the 5’ transcript isoforms for each gene. In this way, we can identify the specific 5’ isoforms for each gene that contain m<sup>6</sup>Am. Additionally, we wanted a quantitative method rather than the qualitative assessment provided by previous antibody-based methods. Recently, chemical methods using sodium nitrite were developed for m<sup>6</sup>A analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mahdavi-Amiri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Werner et al., 2021</xref>). This method identifies m<sup>6</sup>A by chemically deaminating (‘converting’) unmethylated A’s into inosines (I’s), while leaving m<sup>6</sup>A’s intact. During sequencing, the A-to-I conversions are readily detected because I’s are reverse transcribed into G’s. This approach leads to precise and robust m<sup>6</sup>A quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). Because of the chemical similarity between m<sup>6</sup>Am and Am, we explored the potential use of sodium nitrite conversion to map and quantify m<sup>6</sup>Am.</p><p>We first asked if Am is susceptible to deamination by sodium nitrite. To test this, we performed sodium nitrite conversion on a m<sup>7</sup>G-ppp-Am-initiated transcript (see Materials and methods). We applied the sodium nitrite conversion protocol used in GLORI, which includes glyoxal treatment to prevent modification of guanosine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). After sodium nitrite treatment, the RNA was reverse transcribed and sequenced. The conversion rate of Am was quantified by counting A or G reads at the first nucleotide position. In this assay, Am was completely converted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that sodium nitrite efficiently converts Am and thus can be used for m<sup>6</sup>Am quantification.</p><p>We considered the possibility that GLORI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2023</xref>) could be mined to measure m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry at previously mapped m<sup>6</sup>Am sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulias et al., 2019</xref>). We noticed that many A’s at these TSNs were highly converted in GLORI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting prevalent Am. This is inconsistent with mass spectrometry analysis of mRNA cap structures from us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galloway et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akichika et al., 2019</xref>), which has suggested that m<sup>6</sup>Am is very prevalent while Am is relatively rare in mRNA. A potential cause of the high level of Am at TSNs predicted by GLORI could be the extensive RNA fragmentation that occurs with sodium nitrite treatment. RNA fragments that have 5’ ends that align to the TSNs of overlapping transcript isoforms can confound the measurement of m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Thus, GLORI cannot distinguish between true TSNs and internal bases that are found at the 5’ end of RNA fragments. To overcome this limitation, we sought to develop a method that selectively analyzes A-TSNs and thereby removes the confounding effect of overlapping transcripts.</p><p>We developed CROWN-seq, which selectively analyzes TSNs throughout the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In this method, Am residues in mRNA are converted to Im using sodium nitrite. Next, we specifically isolate the 5’ ends of mRNA by replacing the m<sup>7</sup>G cap with a desthiobiotin affinity tag using a decapping-and-recapping strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yan et al., 2022</xref>). By enriching the m<sup>7</sup>G-proximal sequence, we can simultaneously sequence the TSN of all transcripts, including both m<sup>6</sup>Am and non-m<sup>6</sup>Am TSNs. This is conceptually different from existing m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping methods which only examine the m<sup>6</sup>Am transcripts. For A-TSNs, m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry can be quantified by counting the number of A reads (reflecting m<sup>6</sup>Am) or G reads (reflecting Am). In this way, we not only obtain TSN locations but also m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry in the same RNA molecule.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CROWN-seq correctly maps and quantifies m<sup>6</sup>Am.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of CROWN-seq. RNAs are firstly treated with sodium nitrite, which causes Am at the transcription-start position to be converted to Im. To isolate the TSN, m<sup>7</sup>G caps are replaced with 3’-desthiobiotin (DTB) caps. These DTB caps are enriched on streptavidin beads, while uncapped background RNA fragments are uncapped and washed away. After washing, an enriched pool of transcript 5’ ends is released from the beads by cleaving the triphosphate bridge, leaving 5’ monophosphate ends that are ligated to an adapter. After adapter ligation, cDNA was synthesized and amplified for Illumina sequencing. During sequencing, the converted sequences were aligned to a reference genome. The TSNs can be determined as the first base immediately after the 5’ adapter sequence. To quantify m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry, we count the number of A (m<sup>6</sup>Am) and G (Am) bases at the TSN position. (<bold>B</bold>) CROWN-seq enriches reads that contain the TSN. The relative coverage of reads mapped to the TSS and non-TSS regions across the m<sup>7</sup>G-ppp-Am-initiated RNA standard was calculated. The average relative coverage of reads that map to the TSS and to non-TSS positions are shown for three technical replicates. The 95% CI of the relative coverages is shown using error bars. (<bold>C</bold>) CROWN-seq exhibits high quantitative accuracy for measuring m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry. RNA standards were prepared with 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry. To make m<sup>6</sup>Am standards in different m<sup>6</sup>Am levels, we generated both Am transcripts and m<sup>6</sup>Am transcripts by in vitro transcription with cap analogs m<sup>7</sup>G-ppp-Am and m<sup>7</sup>G-ppp-m<sup>6</sup>Am. Five transcripts were made in the Am and m6Am form and mixed to achieve the indicated m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry. These transcripts have identical 5’ ends and different barcodes. Linear least-squares regression was performed to calculate the correlation between expected non-conversion rates and the observed average non-conversion rates for each standard. All TSNs shown in this plot have high sequencing coverage, ranging from 656 to 21,545 reads. (<bold>D</bold>) CROWN-seq results for <italic>SRSF1</italic>. CROWN-seq shows that 54.0% of <italic>SRSF1</italic> transcripts initiate with A. Among the A-initiated transcripts, 93.4% were resistant to conversion (A’s, shown in green), and therefore m<sup>6</sup>Am. As a result, <italic>SRSF1</italic> has 50.4% m<sup>6</sup>Am transcripts, 3.6% Am transcripts, and 46.0% non-A-initiated transcripts. Notably, a previous miCLIP study identified an internal m<sup>6</sup>A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Linder et al., 2015</xref>) which we found was m<sup>6</sup>Am at the TSN based on CROWN-seq. (<bold>E</bold>) CROWN-seq results for <italic>JUN</italic>. CROWN-seq shows that ~58% of <italic>JUN</italic> transcripts initiate with A. Unlike <italic>SRSF1</italic> which A-TSNs are highly methylated, <italic>JUN</italic> A-TSNs are only ~75% methylated. As a result, <italic>JUN</italic> has 43.5% m<sup>6</sup>Am transcripts, 14.5% Am transcripts, and 42% non-A-initiated transcripts. (<bold>F</bold>) CROWN-seq identifies most m<sup>6</sup>Am sites identified in previous studies. 7480 m<sup>6</sup>Am sites in HEK293T cells found either by miCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulias et al., 2019</xref>), m<sup>6</sup>Am-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2021</xref>), or m6ACE-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koh et al., 2019</xref>) were analyzed. The high-confidence sites in CROWN-seq were defined as A-TSN with ≥20 unique mapped reads. The results shown are from HEK293T cells, which is the same cell line used in all previous studies. Among the 1,284 sites uniquely found in other studies, 811 sites are also mapped by CROWN-seq but at lower coverage (1–19 reads); 319 sites are mapped very far (&gt;100 nt) away from any TSS annotation and thus can be considered as false positives; the remaining 154 sites are mapped very closely to known TSSs and may be false negative results in CROWN-seq.

In this analysis, we compared the non-conversion of A-TSNs between wild-type and <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout cells. For the 6,457 A-TSNs annotated by Gencode v45, most of them have high non-conversion rates in wild-type cells and very low non-conversion rates in <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout cells, indicating correct TSN mapping. Similar to the annotated TSNs, 25,435 newly found A-TSNs were also found to have differential m<sup>6</sup>Am between wild-type and <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout. Thus, these newly found A-TSNs were also mostly true positives. In this analysis, only A-TSNs mapped by at least 20 reads in both wild-type and <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout HEK293T cells were used. (<bold>I</bold>) The previously identified m<sup>6</sup>Am sites are biasedly in higher expression and higher m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry. Shown are the sequencing coverage (left) and non-conversion rates (right) of different sets of m<sup>6</sup>Am sites in HEK293T CROWN-seq data. In total, 98,147 sites found by CROWN-seq, 2129 sites found by miCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulias et al., 2019</xref>), 3693 sites found by m6ACE-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koh et al., 2019</xref>), and 1610 sites found by m<sup>6</sup>Am-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2021</xref>) are shown.

In this analysis, sensitivity is defined as m<sup>6</sup>Am/A-TSN found per million mapped reads. For CROWN-seq, sensitivity was defined as the slope of linear regression result between sequencing depth and A-TSN number among different samples in this study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

In this plot, the bases that match the reference are shown in gray, while G mismatches are shown in brown. The A-to-G mutation in the TSS position indicates successful A-to-I conversion during sodium nitrite treatment. In this assay, the 5’ Am in ERCC-00057–1-TCGTCG transcript was made by using m7GpppAmG analog during in vitro transcription (see Materials and methods). The ERCC-00057–1-TCGTCG transcript was decapped and spiked into the RNA sample for GLORI experiment. (<bold>B</bold>) GLORI underestimated m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry in m<sup>6</sup>Am sites found by miCLIP. In this analysis, we reanalyzed the reads in HEK293T GLORI libraries (GSE210563) generated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2023</xref>. To obtain the non-conversion rate of m<sup>6</sup>Am sites, we extracted the 5’ ends mapped to miCLIP sites found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulias et al., 2019</xref> (GSE122948). 1084 and 1067 m<sup>6</sup>Am sites were analyzed in each replicate, respectively.

We calculated the relative ratio of reads whose 5’ end mapped to not failed to map to the desired TSS of the ERCC-00057–1-TCGTCG. Only ~4.5% of the reads can be correctly mapped to the TSS. (<bold>D</bold>) A schema showing the reason why m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry is incorrectly estimated in the transcriptome. In transcriptome, a gene can have multiple TSSs, whose 5’ ends can overlap with each other. As a result, the A-TSN from TSS-2 can also be transcribed as an internal A base in transcripts generated by TSS-1. During the GLORI experiment, 5’ cleavage happens very frequently, which results in massive 5’ ends from internal A’s. Since the GLORI library is unable to distinguish between the ‘true’ 5’ ends with m<sup>7</sup>G cap and the ‘false’ 5’ ends with monophosphate, both ‘true’ 5’ ends and ‘false’ 5’ ends are counted for TSS-2. Because most of the internal A’s are not N6-methylated, the ‘false’ 5’ ends will dilute the m<sup>6</sup>Am signal from the ‘true’ 5’ ends and result in underestimated m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry. (<bold>E</bold>) CROWN-seq shows high reproducibility in m<sup>6</sup>Am identification. In the Venn diagram, four replicates of HEK293T CROWN-seq results were compared. Among the replicates, replicates #1 and #2 are two technical replicates of the same biological sample; while replicates #3 and #4 are the two technical replicates of another biological sample. In this analysis, A-TSNs with at least 20 reads mapped were included. Since replicate #1 and #2 have lower sequencing depth (~3 million reads each) than replicate #3 and #4 (~70 million reads each), the numbers of A-TSNs reported by replicate #1 and #2 are much lower than that by replicate #3 and #4.

In total, we identified 219,195 high-confidence TSNs, of which 92,278 were A-TSNs (see Materials and methods). These TSNs were highly reproducible across biological and technical replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Among the A-TSNs, 89,898 were from protein-coding genes, and 219 were from snRNA or snoRNA. Notably, among the mRNA A-TSNs, nearly all had high non-conversion rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating that nearly all A-TSNs contain high stoichiometry m<sup>6</sup>Am.</p><p>In contrast to previous m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping methods, CROWN-Seq reveals the diversity of TSNs among all the transcript isoforms for each gene.

For the remaining 1284 sites, 811 are also found in CROWN-seq, but in lower sequencing depth; 319 were located far away (&gt;100 nt) from any known TSSs and thus may be artifacts. Thus, CROWN-seq is highly reliable in detecting known m<sup>6</sup>Am sites. The low consistency between previous m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping studies likely reflects incomplete m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping in previous methods.</p><p>CROWN-seq clearly identified vastly more A-TSNs than all the other m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping methods combined (12.3-fold, 92,278 vs 7480). Notably, only ~12.2% of the newly found A-TSNs in CROWN-seq are annotated in Gencode v45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>), which primarily relies on CAGE data (see gene annotation guidelines by HAVANA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Havana, 2025</xref>). Notably, the newly identified TSNs with high coverage tend to overlap with or be located proximally to known TSSs, while the ones with low coverage tend to be located further to the known TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). The newly identified A-TSNs could be artifacts or could be actual TSNs that were undetected by previous TSS-mapping studies. We suspect that these are true A-TSNs for two reasons: First, as part of the mapping criteria, a minimum of 20 independent reads across all replicates was required for TSN identification. Second, if these sites were RNA fragments, they would not contain m<sup>6</sup>Am. However, these A-TSNs show high stoichiometry of m<sup>6</sup>Am (i.e. non-conversion) in CROWN-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>) which is lost in <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), except for some outliers such as TSNs of <italic>S100A6</italic>, <italic>IFI27</italic>, and <italic>ALDH1A1</italic>. Thus, the marked increase in the number of m<sup>6</sup>Am sites revealed by CROWN-seq reflects the preferential enrichment for mRNA 5’ ends, which leads to high sensitivity and read depth at TSNs transcriptome-wide.</p><p>In contrast to m<sup>6</sup>Am sites identified in CROWN-seq, m<sup>6</sup>Am that were identified in previous m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping methods tended to derive from high abundance transcripts or high abundance TSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).

However, these sites only showed small changes in non-conversion rates (p-value = 0.00037, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). It should be noted that our conclusion about the effect of FTO on internal m<sup>6</sup>A is restricted to specific m<sup>6</sup>A sites around 5’ ends since most internal m<sup>6</sup>A sites are not found in the 5’ fragments examined in CROWN-seq.</p><p>Taken together, FTO has a strong preference for demethylating m<sup>6</sup>Am in snRNA, snoRNA, and their pseudogenes, compared to mRNA. FTO is a major determinant of the overall m<sup>6</sup>Am levels of these transcripts in different cell lines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Functional studies of m<sup>6</sup>Am require highly accurate transcriptome-wide maps. However, m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping studies have relied on the assumption that each gene can be considered to have a single start nucleotide. To overcome this, we developed CROWN-seq, which maps the TSNs for all 5’ transcript isoforms, and measures the exact stoichiometry of m<sup>6</sup>Am at all A-TSNs. CROWN-seq reveals a markedly distinct distribution of m<sup>6</sup>Am from what was previously recognized, largely due to inaccuracies in previous maps, and the problem with assigning each gene to a single start nucleotide. In addition, the quantitative measurements of m<sup>6</sup>Am in CROWN-seq show that the earlier idea that many mRNAs contain transcription-start nucleotide Am is largely incorrect since nearly all A-TSNs exhibit high stoichiometry m<sup>6</sup>Am. Overall, this study establishes the first quantitative, transcript isoform-specific m<sup>6</sup>Am map in mammalian cells. The m<sup>6</sup>Am maps reveal that m<sup>6</sup>Am is associated with increased transcript abundance, with functions of m<sup>6</sup>Am more correlated with transcription initiation than stability.</p><p>By selectively capturing and examining only 5’ ends, CROWN-seq achieves exceptional read depth at the TSN, enabling highly accurate identification and quantification of m<sup>6</sup>Am. Notably, CROWN-seq is an antibody-free method and thus avoids the problem of immunoprecipitation of both m<sup>6</sup>Am- and m<sup>6</sup>A-containing fragments. This dual-specificity of antibodies creates ambiguities in m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping. Additionally, antibody binding cannot provide quantitative measurements of m<sup>6</sup>Am. In contrast, CROWN-seq uses a sodium nitrite-based chemical method for m<sup>6</sup>Am identification, which we show fully converts Am to Im, but leaves m<sup>6</sup>Am intact. Thus, the fraction of A-TSNs that contain m<sup>6</sup>Am or Am can be readily determined by sequencing, where all Am nucleotides are read as G. The exceptional read depth of CROWN-seq enables quantification of m<sup>6</sup>Am at single-nucleotide resolution, resulting in vastly more m<sup>6</sup>Am sites than all previous m<sup>6</sup>Am mapping methods combined. Although CROWN-seq involves many chemical and enzymatic steps, m<sup>6</sup>Am quantification by CROWN-seq is very accurate and robust, which was examined by m<sup>6</sup>Am standards, consistency across different technical replicates, and <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout data. Notably, chemical conversion-based methods tend to have artifacts in regions with stable RNA secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>), where the nucleotides cannot efficiently interact with the chemical reagent. However, we found that CROWN-seq is very reliable even for highly structured 5’ ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which might be due to the high accessibility of the TSN, the high stringency of the conversion steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2023</xref>), or RNA denaturation due to glyoxal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knutson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>It is worth mentioning that there is no golden standard for transcription-start nucleotide (site) mapping accuracy estimation. For CROWN-seq, we first tested the mapping accuracy by in vitro transcribed RNA oligos, which shows that ~93% of the 5’ ends can be mapped correctly. However, in practice, in vitro transcription might initiate at non-specific TSSs, resulting in 5’ ends not overlapping with the desired TSSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rong et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dousis et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, the mapping accuracy can be underestimated in this assay. Since mRNA A-TSNs in the cells are known to be highly methylated by PCIF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akichika et al., 2019</xref>), we considered that the presence or absence of m<sup>6</sup>Am at mapped A-TSNs can be used to assess the accuracy of TSN identification. True A-TSNs should have m<sup>6</sup>Am. In CROWN-seq essentially all previously annotated A-TSNs and newly found A-TSNs exhibited high non-conversion rates. These A-TSNs were well converted upon <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout. This indicates very high TSN mapping accuracy, even at the many previously unannotated TSNs described here. These previously unannotated TSNs were likely missed because traditional transcription-start mapping methods and pipelines lack the sensitivity to discover them. These unannotated TSNs might have specific molecular functions. Future studies might focus on the biology of these unannotated TSNs, for example, whether these unannotated TSNs, compared to major TSNs, are associated with different mRNA processing events, such as alternative splicing.</p><p>We performed CROWN-seq in nine different cell types to understand common principles that guide m<sup>6</sup>Am formation in mRNA. In all cell types, m<sup>6</sup>Am was a very high stoichiometry modification, with some exceptions. We found a correlation between PCIF1 expression and m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry, but even cells with very low PCIF1 expression exhibited high m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry. The CROWN-seq data is highly consistent with recent mass spectrometry analysis of mRNA caps by us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galloway et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akichika et al., 2019</xref>). These mass spectrometry studies purified the entire cap structure comprising the m<sup>7</sup>G, the triphosphate linker, and the first nucleotide. In these studies, m<sup>7</sup>G-ppp-m<sup>6</sup>Am was highly prevalent while m<sup>7</sup>G-ppp-Am abundance was typically 1/10 as m<sup>7</sup>G-ppp-m<sup>6</sup>Am in nearly all cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galloway et al., 2020</xref>). This mass spectrometry data was the first suggestion that transcription-start nucleotide Am was not a prevalent modification in mRNA, as had been suggested by early chromatography studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wei et al., 1975</xref>). We suspect that the high levels of Am seen in these early analyses of mRNA can be explained by contaminating snRNA or rRNA fragments, which are highly difficult to remove, even with multiple rounds of poly(A) purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Legrand et al., 2017</xref>). It remains possible that there are cell types or cellular contexts that remain to be discovered with low m<sup>6</sup>Am (i.e. high Am) levels. However, it is clear that high m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry is a general feature of most or all cell types in this study.</p><p>The initial m<sup>6</sup>Am maps relied on published TSN annotations. In the first m<sup>6</sup>Am map, annotations were based on FANTOM5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>), which primarily uses CAGE datasets to define the start nucleotide. However, these annotations selected a single start nucleotide even if multiple TSS signals from CAGE peaks were detected for a gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akichika et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulias et al., 2019</xref>). It should be noted that some genes may primarily use m<sup>6</sup>Am for all 5’ transcript isoforms. These genes would therefore have a high m<sup>6</sup>Am gene index. Genes with a high m<sup>6</sup>Am gene index are likely to be preferentially affected by PCIF1 depletion or pathways that affect m<sup>6</sup>Am.</p><p>Based on the small range of m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry in A-initiated mRNAs, it is unlikely that the variability in stoichiometry has functional significance for most mRNAs. Instead, our data suggest that mRNAs initiate with either Gm, Cm, Um, or Am, where Am is highly m<sup>6</sup>Am modified. mRNAs that initiate with m<sup>6</sup>Am may have shared regulatory mechanisms that distinguish them from mRNAs that initiate with Gm, Cm, and Um. Additionally, genes that primarily initiate with m<sup>6</sup>Am, either because they have only one major transcription-start site, or because all their transcription-start nucleotides are A, would be highly influenced by m<sup>6</sup>Am-dependent regulatory mechanisms. Currently, cellular pathways that target m<sup>6</sup>Am-initiated mRNAs are not well known.</p><p>Our study revealed a link between m<sup>6</sup>Am and transcription. This effect was detectable because of the highly quantitative nature of m<sup>6</sup>Am measurement in CROWN-seq. Although all A-TSNs show high stoichiometry, there are differences in the overall m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry between transcripts, for example ~0.85 stoichiometry vs. 0.95 stoichiometry which can readily be detected by CROWN-seq. We found that these differences are often related to the specific TSS motif. For example, the Inr-like SSCA<sub>+1</sub>GC TSS motif was associated with the highest m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry, while transcripts using the VA<sub>+1</sub>RR TSS motif exhibited relatively lower m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry. This finding highlights that the major role of m<sup>6</sup>Am might be linked to transcription regulation, which is supported by a recent study by .<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2024</xref>.</p><p>We then examined the effects of PCIF1 depletion on m<sup>6</sup>Am transcript abundance. We found that transcripts with higher methylation in wild-type cells tend to have a larger reduction in RNA expression level upon <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout. Further analysis showed that transcripts that use the SSCA<sub>+1</sub>GC TSS motif exhibited significantly reduced expression in <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout cells. In contrast, transcripts that use the VA<sub>+1</sub>RR TSS motif were largely unaffected. Notably, transcripts normally have small differences in methylation (i.e. methylation level at 0.9 vs 0.98). Thus, m<sup>6</sup>Am is unlikely to be a general stabilization mark in mRNA since it only affects transcripts based on promoter sequences. Instead, these different stoichiometries of m<sup>6</sup>Am are likely to be the consequence of different transcription mechanisms. Thus, it will be important to assess how these different transcription mechanisms use m<sup>6</sup>Am for gene expression.</p><p>PCIF1 is known to be associated with RNA polymerase II and is recruited to promoter regions during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sugita et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, PCIF1 is ideally positioned to regulate transcription processes. It is interesting to speculate that m<sup>6</sup>Am may provide a mark that enhances subsequent elongation and thus maintains high overall expression for transcription initiation complexes that assemble on the SSCA<sub>+1</sub>GC TSS motif. Other transcription initiation complexes, such as those using the VA<sub>+1</sub>RR TSS motif, may not need this mechanism. However, our data cannot provide further details on whether the loss of m<sup>6</sup>Am is related to exact mechanisms such as transcription initiation selection, elongation, or premature termination. Notably, the recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2024</xref> suggested that the loss of m<sup>6</sup>Am is related to enhanced premature termination and therefore leads to reduced RNA 5’ end expression. An et al. proposed that m<sup>6</sup>Am can sequester PCF11, an m<sup>6</sup>Am reader, and thereby promote transcription by reducing premature transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2024</xref>). However, it is still unclear whether the transcripts from the SSCA<sub>+1</sub>GC TSS motif are indeed more preferentially bound by PCF11. To better understand how PCIF1 regulates transcription, assays with transcription-start nucleotide resolution will be required.</p><p>Although m<sup>6</sup>Am and m<sup>6</sup>A are chemically similar, these two modifications appear to have very different biological functions. It is well known that m<sup>6</sup>A is a mark for RNA instability through the recruitment of YTHDF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). However, we find no correlation between m<sup>6</sup>Am and RNA instability. Additionally, our previous YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3 iCLIP studies did not show binding at mRNAs 5’ ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patil et al., 2016</xref>), which suggests that YTHDF proteins do not bind m<sup>6</sup>Am. Thus, specific m<sup>6</sup>Am-binding proteins might enable its unique functions in transcription.</p><p>Although most studies of m<sup>6</sup>Am and PCIF1 focus on mRNAs, we find that m<sup>6</sup>Am in snRNAs exhibit substantially higher variability and regulation than that in mRNA. Early biochemical studies of snRNA composition demonstrated that the first nucleotide was generally Am in all Pol II-derived snRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mauer et al., 2019</xref>). CROWN-seq generally supports this finding since most snRNAs have low m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry. However, the previous study mainly focused on HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mauer et al., 2019</xref>), which have very low m<sup>6</sup>Am in snRNA. In this study, nine different cell types were sequenced. These cell lines showed highly variable m<sup>6</sup>Am in snRNA. In some cases, several snRNAs can reach m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry up to 0.70–0.89. These data raise the possibility that m<sup>6</sup>Am may affect snRNA functions, such as splicing and gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mimoso and Adelman, 2023</xref>), and <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout phenotypes may be due to altered snRNA.</p><p>Notably, m<sup>6</sup>Am in snRNA is highly regulated by FTO, which is consistent with our earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mauer et al., 2019</xref>). However, the previous study did not have transcript isoform level resolution in analyzing the effect of FTO demethylation. With CROWN-seq, we find that FTO has markedly different effects on different snRNAs, where some snRNAs appear highly demethylated by FTO while others are insensitive to FTO. Some snoRNA, and snRNA/snoRNA pseudogenes are also demethylated by FTO. Notably, FTO depletion affects numerous aspects of cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mauer and Jaffrey, 2018</xref>). Our results thus raise the possibility that FTO-depletion phenotypes may result from increased m<sup>6</sup>Am levels in snRNAs, snoRNAs, or their pseudogenes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>One limitation of CROWN-seq is that it can be difficult to align sequencing reads to the genome. Unlike normal reads, which contain A, G, C, and U, most reads in CROWN-seq comprise only G, C, and U due to the conversion of A’s. This makes it difficult to align reads to highly similar genes, such as snRNA isoforms and pseudogenes which have very similar 5’ ends. For this reason, only a small fraction of reads from snRNA and pseudogenes were uniquely mapped to one genomic location and were used in this analysis. To better understand m<sup>6</sup>Am in these 5’ ends with similar sequences, future optimization is desired to increase the read lengths, which can help distinguish these sequences from each other. This requires technical innovations in reducing RNA fragmentation during sodium nitrite conversion, which comes from acid-catalyzed depurination and backbone cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mahdavi-Amiri et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we quantified m<sup>6</sup>Am in nine different cell lines, which cover a wide range of PCIF1 expression levels. Although we found high m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometries in all cell lines, it is possible that some cells or tissues have more variable m<sup>6</sup>Am levels. In our previous study, mass spectrometry showed that the CCRF-SB cell line has relatively low m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry at ~67.6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). However, these cells exhibit very slow growth as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). As a result, we were unable to obtain enough mRNA needed for CROWN-seq. Future CROWN-seq studies may lead to the identification of cell types or contexts with dynamic m<sup>6</sup>Am landscapes.</p><p>The last limitation of this study is that the focus of this study was to quantify m<sup>6</sup>Am and predict potential functions using <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout cells. However, it is possible that PCIF1 has non-catalytic functions that may contribute to the <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout phenotype. Future experiments using catalytic-dead PCIF1 can be useful to distinguish between the catalytic and non-catalytic functions of PCIF1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

The first 10 bases in GLORI libraries made with eCLIP protocol were first extracted by a customized script. GLORI reads were first quality trimmed by Cutadapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin, 2011</xref>). For the GLORI library generated by eCLIP protocol, the parameters are <monospace>--max-n 0 --trimmed-only</monospace> -a <named-content content-type="sequence">AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTG</named-content> -e 0.1 -q 30 m 40 <monospace>--trim-n</monospace>; for GLORI library prepared by ligation-based protocol generated in this study, the parameters are -m 32 j 4 -q 20 -e 0.25 -a <named-content content-type="sequence">AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTC</named-content> -A ATATNNNNNNNNNNN<named-content content-type="sequence">AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTG</named-content>. After pre-processing, the reads were firstly A-to-G converted and aligned to A-to-G (positive strand) and T-to-C (negative strand) converted reference genome and transcriptome by Hisat2-2.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Parameters in alignment: <monospace>-k 5 –fr –rna-strandness FR –no-temp-splicesite –no-mixed</monospace>. Only unique alignments were used. After alignment, the base information in sequences was restored so that m<sup>6</sup>Am signals can be reflected by the A-to-G mismatches. No further transcriptome alignment was performed on the unmapped reads. After alignment, a customized script based on Pysam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2009</xref>) was used to pileup every single base to obtain the A, C, G, and U counts. Every single base was assigned to a transcript isoform if possible (order: <monospace>mRNA &gt; lncRNA &gt; functional RNAs &gt; pseudogenes</monospace>). Non-conversion rate is defined as the number of A counts against the sum of A count and G count. Filters were applied to obtain high-quality non-converted A (m<sup>6</sup>A/m<sup>6</sup>Am) signals in a gene-specific manner: (1) only genes with at least 1000 counts were analyzed; (2) gene-specific non-conversion rates were computed for Binomial test on the frequency of non-conversion and sites with Binomial test p-value &lt;0.05 were used; (3) reads with more than three non-converted As were considered as noise and discarded; (4) sites with more than 5% signals were discarded due to the site may fall in a conversion-resistant region; (5) Only sites with no less than 20 reads covered and non-conversion rates over 0.1 were considered as m<sup>6</sup>A/m<sup>6</sup>Am sites. (6) Non-conversion rates of the same site from different replicates were averaged.

Several steps of library construction are now performed while the 5’ desthiobiotinylated cap is bound to streptavidin beads. This reduces the opportunity for carry-through of random fragmentation products to occur that would previously result in non-cap-derived 5’ ends to be ligated. Next, 5’ adapters with unique molecular indexes (UMIs) are used to permit robust PCR duplicate removal. Finally,~160 spike-in mRNAs from SIRV-ERCC Spike-in mixture (Lexogen #051.03) with single defined 5’ termini are used, which are used during analysis to build a dynamic thresholding pipeline that exclude false positive start sites.

RNA was denatured at 65 °C for 2 min before reaction mixes were added. First, 5’-phosphorylated RNAs were dephosphorylated using 25 U Quick CIP (NEB #M0525L) in a 50 μL reaction for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was cleaned using a Zymo RCC-5 column following the manufacturer’s&gt;200 nt protocol and eluted with 20 μL water. m<sup>7</sup>G capped RNAs were then decapped using 200 U yDcpS (NEB #M0463S) for 1 hr at 37 °C. This unique decapping enzyme liberates m<sup>7</sup>GMP, resulting in mRNAs with a 5’-diphosphate. The reaction was cleaned and eluted as before. Next, the 5’-diphosphorylated mRNAs were recapped with desthiobiotin-GTP (DTB-GTP) using vaccinia capping enzyme (5 μL VCE buffer, 0.5 μL inorganic pyrophosphatase (NEB #M0361S), 5 μL DTB-GTP (5 mM; NEB #N0761S), 50 U VCE (#M2080S)) for 45 min at 37 °C. The reaction was clean as before, however, a total of our washes were performed to ensure the complete removal of excess DTB-GTP. RNA was then fragmented by incubating at 95 °C for 2.5 min in a 25 μL reaction containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Fragmented RNA was placed on ice and brought to 30 μL with water. Streptavidin beads (NEB #S1421S) were washed in a high-salt wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and resuspended in the high salt buffer at 4 mg/mL. 30 μL beads were added to 30 μL fragmented RNA and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with agitation. Beads were washed twice in a high-salt buffer, twice in a lower salt buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), and twice in PNK wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2% Tween). Beads were next resuspended in 40 μL PNK reaction mix 8 μL 5 X pH 6.5 PNK buffer (350 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.5, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM DTT), 1 μL T4 PNK (NEB #M0201S), 1 μL RNaseOUT (Thermo Fisher #10777019) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with agitation to remove 3’ phosphates resulting from the fragmentation. Beads were washed once in PNK wash, once in the high salt wash, then twice again in PNK wash. Next, a 3’ adapter was added to RNA by resuspending beads in 40 μL 3’ ligation reaction mix (4 μL T4 RNA ligase buffer, 2 μL T4 RNA ligase 2 truncated KQ (NEB #M0373L), 1 μL RNaseOUT, 2 μL L7 adapter (20 μM stock), 16 μL of 50% PEG-8000) and incubated at 25 °C for 2 hr. The beads were washed once in PNK wash, once in high-salt wash, twice in lower salt wash, then resuspended in 30 μL lower salt wash containing 1 mM biotin (ThermoFisher #B20656) to elute DTB-capped RNA fragments. The eluted RNA was cleaned by ethanol-AMPure XP (1.8 volumes AMPure XP, then 1.5 volumes 100% ethanol). To increase stringency, the streptavidin bead enrichment was repeated omitting enzymatic steps and instead washing three times with high salt and then three times with lower salt wash, and the eluate was cleaned again by ethanol-AMPure XP. The DTB-GTP cap was removed using 0.5 U/µl RppH (NEB #M0356S) in 1 X ThermoPol buffer (NEB #M0356S) and incubating at 37 °C for 1 hr. The resulting 5’-monophosphate RNA fragments were purified by ethanol-AMPure XP. 30 pmol of a 5’ adapter was ligated for 3 hr at 25 °C with 2 U/μL T4 RNA ligase 1 (NEB #M0437M). This RNA adapter contains an 11 nt UMI followed by a fixed sequence (AUAU) at its 3’ end. The UMI allows robust duplicate removal, and the fixed sequence provides an anchor point to correctly identify the first nucleotide of the mRNA. The ligation reaction was inactivated by heating at 65 °C for 10 min and then immediately used in a reverse transcription reaction. 3 pmol of ReCappable-seq RT primer was annealed to the 3’ adapter of RNA fragments by heating to 65 °C for 5 min and cooling to 25 °C at a rate of 0.1 °C/s. Reverse transcription was carried out at 55 °C for 45 min in a reaction containing 0.5 mM dNTPs, 5 mM DTT, 20 U RNaseOUT, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, and 300 U SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher #18080044). Following heat inactivation, the reaction was cleaned using ethanol-AMPure XP and cDNA was resuspended in 21 μL. The final PCR was performed using 8 μL cDNA in a 40 μL reaction containing 1 X Phusion HF master mix (NEB #M0531L) and 4 μL each of a unique i5 and i7 barcoded primer combination for each sample (NEB #E7600S). Cycling conditions were typically 98 °C 2 minutes, then 11–13 cycles of 98 °C 15 s, 65 °C 30 s, 72 °C 30 s, with a final 5 min 72 °C extension. The optimal number of cycles for each library was determined by performing a set of test cycles using 1 μL cDNA in a 20 μL reaction. PCR libraries were purified with 2 rounds of bead clean-up using 0.9 X volume SPRIselect beads. Libraries were pooled at equimolar concentrations and sequenced in paired-end mode with 50–150 bp reads depending on the library on either an Illumina NovaSeq, NextSeq, or HiSeq (please refer to GEO accession for specific details for each library).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>ReCappable-seq analysis</title><p>The beginning of read 1 is the UMI plus an ATAT spacer sequence, and the nucleotide directly following this is the TSS. Reads were first filtered to identify pairs with the correct UMI +ATAT sequence, then the UMI was added to FASTQ headers using UMI-tools v1.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). ATAT sequence discarded. Adapters were trimmed using Cutadapt v3.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin, 2011</xref>). Next, reads mapping to ribosomal RNA and small non-coding RNAs were filtered away by aligning to these sequences using bowtie2 v2.4.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). Reads were then aligned to GRCh38 and m<sup>6</sup>Am standard sequences using HISAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). The alignment results were deduplicated by UMI-tools (<monospace>--paired --chimeric-pairs=discard --unpaired-reads=discard --method=unique</monospace>). Only reads without 5’ softclipping were used. A customized script based on Pysam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2009</xref>) was used to extract the 5’ ends from the BAM file. To annotate the sites by a gene, the 5’ ends were firstly annotated by the nearest TSS within the 100 bp region. If multiple annotations were found, the annotation was selected by the priority of <monospace>snRNA &gt; snoRNA &gt; mRNA &gt; lncRNA &gt; others</monospace>. BEDtools v2.27.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) was used to find the nearest annotation. To more accurately estimate the expression levels of each TSN, we normalized the read counts using the ‘RUVg’ function in RUVSeq pacakge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Risso et al., 2014</xref>). To calculate the expression levels of TSNs in wide-type cells, we calculated the TPM values based on the normalized read counts. To calculate the differential expression between wild-type and <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout cells, the normalized read counts were proceeded by DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Love et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>The comparison of TSS mapping methods</title><p>Currently, there are several types of TSS mapping methods. CAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murata et al., 2014</xref>) and TSS-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>) are the two most popular methods being used.</p><p>CAGE was tested to have the highest precision and sensitivity over other TSS mapping methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adiconis et al., 2018</xref>), except for ReCappable-seq. However, CAGE has two limitations. First, CAGE relies on template switching. Template switching is a process in that reverse transcriptase can ‘jump’ onto a template switching oligo, which contains an adapter sequence when the reverse transcriptase reaches the end of the RNA template. Template switching is very convenient in producing full-length cDNA without ligating adapter. However, template switching is not precise for transcription-start nucleotide identification, because template switching can introduce non-template bases (normally C’s) into the cDNA between the template and the adapter. It is very difficult to completely remove the non-template bases in the CAGE library because the number of incorporated non-template bases is uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). As a result, compared with TSS-seq and ReCappable-seq, CAGE can mistakenly assign TSSs within the same CAGE peak (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Second, the most widely used CAGE protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murata et al., 2014</xref>) contains an oxidation step, which results in massive indels and mutations in the cDNA. These indels and mutations can result in inaccurate alignments. Third, ‘strand invasion’ can cause TSS artifacts in CAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). Strand invasion is the process that reverse transcriptase mistakenly terminates and switches onto the template switching oligo before reaching the end of a template. Strand invasion can result in false positive TSSs in internal RNA positions.</p><p>TSS-seq is another available method in TSS mapping. TSS-seq relies on several enzymatic steps to remove non-m<sup>7</sup>G-capped 5’ end backgrounds in the sample. After removing undesired 5’ ends, the m<sup>7</sup>G cap is released and a 5’ adapter is ligated to the RNA 5’ ends. In theory, this procedure can result in precise 5’ end maps. However, tested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adiconis et al., 2018</xref>, TSS-seq exhibited low precision, sensitivity, and accuracy in TSS mapping. The low performance of TSS-seq is due to the incomplete removal of the non-m<sup>7</sup>G-capped 5’ end backgrounds.</p><p>ReCappable-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yan et al., 2022</xref>) can be considered as an improved TSS-seq. Recappable-seq overcomes the 5’ end background clean-up issue. In ReCappable-seq, the m<sup>7</sup>G caps of RNA polymerase II transcribed RNA is replaced by 3´-Desthiobiotin-G caps. The recapped RNAs can thus be enriched on streptavidin beads. During high-stringency washing, the 5’ end background can be completely removed. Thus, ReCappable-seq exhibited extremely high specificity in mapping transcription-start nucleotides.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-9"><title>CROWN-seq library preparation</title><p>CROWN-seq uses the glyoxal-based guanosine protection protocol from GLORI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2023</xref>) and a TSN enrichment protocol that is modified from ReCappable-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yan et al., 2022</xref>). In CROWN-seq, glyoxal protection is very important to prevent both internal G’s from being converted into xanthosine, which can interrupt base pairing and cause mutations during reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mair et al., 2022</xref>). Because N7-methyl does not interrupt the interaction between glyoxal and N1 and N2 positions of guanosines, glyoxal protection is also very useful to prevent m<sup>7</sup>G from being converted, which can help 5’ end enrichment. After glyoxal protection, A bases are deaminated into inosines by sodium nitrite. After deamination, the 5’ end RNA fragments with a m<sup>7</sup>G cap were enriched by ReCappable-seq workflow, where the m<sup>7</sup>G caps were replaced by a 5’ desthio-biotinylated cap for enrichment by streptavidin beads. 3’ adapter and 5’ adapter (with unique molecular indexes [UMIs]) were ligated to the enriched 5’ RNA fragments, so that the library can be made by reverse transcription followed by indexing PCR. Detailed workflow is described below.</p><p>Conversion. 0.8–2.5 μg oligo(dT) selected RNA was used as input. RNA was first diluted in 14 μl water. To perform glyoxal protection, 6 µl 8.8 M glyoxal and 20 μl DMSO were then added to the diluted RNA and well mixed. The 40 µl mix was first incubated at 50 °C for 30 min, then 10 μl boric acid was added to the mix. The 50 µl mix was then incubated for an additional 30 min at 50 °C. After protection, the 50 μl protected RNA was mixed with 50 μl deamination buffer (25 μl 1500 mM NaNO<sub>2</sub>, 4 μl 500 mM MES, pH 6.0, 10 μl 8.8 M glyoxal, and 11 μl water). The deamination reaction was performed at 16 °C for 8 hr. After deamination, the RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. To remove the glyoxal adduct from the RNA, the RNA pallet was dissolved in 50 μl deprotection buffer (500 mM TEAA pH = 8.6, 47.5% deionized formamide) and was incubated at 95 °C for 10 min. After incubation, the reaction was brought to 250 μl with water. Converted RNA was purified by ethanol precipitation and eluted in 39 μl water for 5’ end enrichment. The converted RNA was stored at –80 °C before 5’ end enrichment.</p><p>Recapping. To eliminate the contamination of RNA with 5’-triphosphate and 5’-monophosphate, 5 µl 10 X CutSmart buffer, 5 µl Quick CIP (5 U/µl) (NEB #M0525L), and 1 µl SUPERase·In RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher #AM2696) were added to the 39 μl converted RNA to set up a dephosphorylation reaction. The dephosphorylation reaction was performed at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was cleaned up using Zymo RCC-5 column and the RNA was eluted in 42 µl water. To decap the m<sup>7</sup>G capped RNA, a 50 µl decapping reaction was set up by adding 5 µl 10 X yDcpS buffer, 2 µl (200 U) yDcpS (NEB #M0463S), and 1 µl SUPERase·In to the 42 µl dephosphorylated RNA. The decapping reaction was performed at 37 °C for 1 hr. This unique decapping enzyme liberates m<sup>7</sup>GMP, resulting in mRNAs with a 5’-diphosphate. The reaction was cleaned and eluted as before. The reaction was cleaned up using Zymo RCC-5 column and the RNA was eluted in 33.5 µl water. The 5’-diphosphorylated mRNAs were recapped with desthiobiotin-GTP (DTB-GTP, NEB #N0761S) using vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE, NEB #M2080S; 5 μL VCE buffer, 0.5 μL inorganic pyrophosphatase (NEB #M0361S), 5 μL DTB-GTP (5 mM), 50 U VCE, 1 µl SUPERase·In) at 37 °C for 1 hr. The reaction was cleaned up using Zymo RCC-5 column and the RNA was eluted in 30 µl water. Now the RNA is ready for streptavidin enrichment.</p><p>5’ enrichment. Streptavidin beads (NEB #S1421S) were washed in a high salt wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and resuspended in the high-salt buffer at 4 mg/mL. To enrich the RNA and tag the 5’ and 3’ end by the specific adapter, the 30 µl recapped RNA was first mixed with 30 µl streptavidin beads and incubated at room temperature for 45 min with agitation. Beads were washed twice in high-salt buffer, twice in a lower salt buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), and twice in PNK wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2% Tween). To remove 3’ phosphates resulting from fragmentation during conversion, beads were resuspended in 50 µl PNK reaction without ATP (5 µl 10 X PNK buffer, 1 µl T4 PNK (#M0201S), 1 µl SUPERase·In, 43 µl water), and incubate at 37 °C for 30 minutes with agitation. The beads were then washed once in PNK wash buffer, once in 2 M NaCl wash, and twice in PNK wash. Next, RNA was ligated to a 74 nt-long 3’ adapter in the following 40 μl 3’ ligation mix: 4 μL T4 RNA ligase buffer, 2 μl T4 RNA ligase 2 truncated KQ (NEB #M0373L), 1 µl SUPERase·In, 2 μl extended-L7 adapter (20 μM stock), 16 μl of 50% PEG-8000 and incubated at 25 °C for 2 hr. After incubation, the reaction buffer was removed by washing once with high-salt buffer and twice with PNK wash buffer. To remove the exceeded adapter, the beads were incubated in 50 μl adapter digestion reaction (40 μl water, 5 µl 10 X RNA ligase buffer, 1 µl RecJf [NEB #M0264S], 1 5’ Deadenylase [NEB #M0331S], 1 µl SUPERase·In) at 30 °C for 15 min then at 37 °C for 15 min. The beads were washed once with PNK wash, once with high-salt buffer, and twice with low-salt buffer. To elute the DTB-labeled RNA, beads were then suspended with 30 µl low-salt wash buffer containing 1 mM free D-biotin (Thermo Fisher #B20656) and incubate at room temperature for 1 hr. The DTB-labeled RNA was purified with ethanol-AMPure XP (RNA:beads:ethanol = 1:2:3) and eluted in 30 µl water. To increase stringency, the streptavidin bead enrichment was repeated omitting enzymatic steps and instead washing three times with high salt and then three times with lower salt wash, and the eluate was cleaned again by ethanol-AMPure XP.</p><p>5’ adapter addition. The DTB-GTP cap was removed using 0.5 U/µl RppH (NEB #M0356S) in 1 X ThermoPol buffer (NEB #M0356S) and incubating at 37 °C for 1 hr. The resulting 5’-monophosphate RNA fragments were purified by ethanol-AMPure XP and eluted in 10 μl water. 1 μl (10 pmol) reverse transcription primer was pre-annealed to the templates by heating up to 75 °C for 5 min, then 37 °C for 15 min, 25 °C for 15 min, and chilled at 4 °C. 10 pmol of a 5’ adapter was ligated for 3 hr at 25 °C with 2 U/μl T4 RNA ligase 1 (NEB #M0437M). This RNA adapter contains an 8 nt- or 11 nt-long UMI followed by a fixed sequence (AUAU) at its 3’ end. The UMI allows robust duplicate removal, and the fixed sequence provides an anchor point to correctly identify the first nucleotide of the mRNA. 40 μl ligation product was used.</p><p>cDNA synthesis and PCR. Reverse transcription was carried out at 50 °C for 45 min in a 50 μl reaction containing 0.5 mM dNTPs, 5 mM DTT, 20 U RNaseOUT, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, and 300 U SuperScript III. To perform indexing PCR, 40 μl Phusion master mix (NEB # M0532L) was added to the reverse transcription product, along with 5 μl i5 indexing primer and 5 μl i7 indexing primer (NEB #E7600S). Cycling conditions were typically 98 °C 2 min, then 16 cycles of 98 °C 15 s, 65 °C 30 s, 72 °C 30 s, with a final 5 min 72 °C extension. Two rounds of 0.9 X AMPureXP bead purifications were performed to remove primers. Normally ~10 ng indexed library was obtained for each library. The libraries were mixed and sequenced by NovaSeq 6000 or NovaSeqX.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-10"><title>CROWN-seq data processing</title><p>The read pairs were firstly quality trimmed by Cutadapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin, 2011</xref>): -m 32 -q 20 -e 0.25-a <named-content content-type="sequence">AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTC</named-content>. For the 8 nt-long 5’ adapter, -A ATATNNNNNNNN<named-content content-type="sequence">AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTG</named-content> was used; for the 11 nt-long adapter, -A ATATNNNNNNNNNNN<named-content content-type="sequence">AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTG</named-content> was used. Then the UMI along with the fixed ATAT spacer sequences were extracted by UMI-tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). The alignment process was modified from the previous RNA bisulfite alignment strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). In brief, in silico converted read pairs (read1 A-to-G, read2 T-to-C) were aligned by HISAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2019</xref>) against A-to-G converted (for positive strand) and T-to-C converted (for negative strand) reference genome and transcriptome first (key options: <monospace>-k 5 –fr –rna-strandness FR –no-temp-splicesite –no-mixed</monospace>). Then the unique alignments were extracted and the in silico converted reads were inverse-transformed to the original format. Since two sequences after conversion can be easily confused, we require the best alignment results can be well distinguished from the secondary alignments. Here, the alignment scores (AS tag in Hisat2 alignments, higher is better) of the best alignments should be higher than –10. Meanwhile, the difference between the best alignments and secondary alignments should be larger than 9. For paired-end alignments, the alignment scores of read1 and read2 were summed. Only read1 was used in the 5’ end analysis. Only read1 reads without 5’ end softclips were used. Pileup was performed to obtain the read coverages of every 5’ end in the transcriptome. Non-conversion rates of the transcription start nucleotides were calculated by A counts over A and G counts.</p><p>To annotate the TSNs mapped in CROWN-seq, we used the TSSs in Gencode v45 as the reference TSS positions. We first calculated the distance between the mapped TSNs and the annotated TSSs by BEDtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). We then tried to assign a TSN to a gene if there was an annotated TSS &lt;100 nt away. Because there can be multiple annotations available, we used the following priority in selecting gene annotations: <monospace>snRNA &gt; snoRNA &gt; protein-coding &gt; lncRNA &gt; others</monospace>. We also annotated TSNs which come from RNA highly similar to snRNA, snoRNA, or their pseudogenes. To do so, we first built a BLASTn database containing all snRNA, snoRNA, and their pseudogene sequences from Gencode v45. We then performed BLASTn (BLAST 2.9.0+<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camacho et al., 2009</xref>) on the A-TSNs along with the first 50 nt downstream sequences to examine the similarity to the known snRNA, snoRNA, and pseudogenes. The following parameter was used: <monospace>-qcov_hsp_perc 50 -perc_identity 50 -word_size 10</monospace>. Sequences with bitscore ≥50 were considered as snRNA/snoRNA-like. We also annotated uORF and IRES elements based on uORFdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Manske et al., 2023</xref>) and IRES atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), respectively.</p><p>The choice of parameters can significantly affect the accuracy of TSS maps and the precision in m<sup>6</sup>Am quantification. In this study, we used several different parameters in defining TSS signals from ReCappable-seq and CROWN-seq. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, for the preliminary analyses with ReCappable-seq, we defined TSSs as those with ≥1 TPM coverage as previously used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yan et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, this threshold is empirical and subjective for TSS identification. This threshold can result in false negatives, especially for those TSS with expression levels a bit lower than 1 TPM. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, to define A-TSNs in CROWN-seq, we first called high-confidence A-TSNs which at least mapped by 20 reads. This threshold was used in a previous m<sup>5</sup>C mapping analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). The ≥20 reads threshold can yield acceptable precision in m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry estimation. When an A-TSN is mapped by 20 reads, the quantification precision is 0.05 (1/20). With this threshold, the median coverage of the A-TSNs is ~40–60 among samples, which means precision at 0.017–0.025. Notably, according to the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>, CROWN-seq exhibited very high accuracy in TSN mapping even for the TSNs mapped by three reads. Although this threshold allows us to roughly estimate m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry, the variability of the quantified stoichiometry can be high when the read depth is low (particularly for A-TSNs with &lt;50 reads). Thus, we used another criterion while generating the m<sup>6</sup>Am landscape among different cell lines. For m<sup>6</sup>Am landscape profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and the corresponding figure supplements), we want to precisely compare the m<sup>6</sup>Am stoichiometry between different cell lines. We first merged all the reads from different biological and/or technical replicates to obtain higher read depths for each cell line. We then increased the threshold of sequencing depth so that only A-TSNs mapped by ≥50 reads were quantified. With this threshold, the minimum precision is set to 0.02 (1/50). In practice, this threshold results in medium read coverage at ~130–150 reads, which indicates precision at 0.0067–0.0077. The high coverage also results in low variability in m<sup>6</sup>Am quantification between replicates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>The related pipeline and scripts are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jhfoxliu/CROWN-seq">https://github.com/jhfoxliu/CROWN-seq</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu, 2025b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-11"><title>RT-qPCR</title><p>1 μg total RNA was used as input.

Unlike the structurally similar and abundant internal mRNA modification m6A, m6Am's function has been controversial. One way to resolve controversies surrounding mRNA modification functions has been to develop new ways to better profile said mRNA modification. Here, Liu et al. developed a new method (based on GLORI-seq for m6A-sequencing), for antibody-independent sequencing of m6Am (CROWN-seq). Using appropriate spike-in controls and knockout cell lines, Liu et al. clearly demonstrated CROWN-seq's precision and quantitative accuracy for profiling transcriptome-wide m6Am. Subsequently, the authors used CROWN-seq to greatly expand the number of known m6Am sites in various cell lines and also determine m6Am stoichiometry to generally be high for most genes. CROWN-seq identified gene promoter motifs that correlate best with high stoichiometry m6Am sites, thereby identifying new determinants of m6Am stoichiometry. CROWN-seq also helped reveal that m6Am does not regulate mRNA stability or translation (as opposed to past reported functions). Rather, m6Am stoichiometry correlates well with transcription levels. Finally, Liu et al. reaffirmed that FTO mainly demethylates m6Am, not of mRNA but of snRNAs and snoRNAs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript that describes and validates a new m6Am-sequencing method: CROWN-seq as the first m6Am-sequencing method that can both quantify m6Am stoichiometry and profile m6Am at single-base resolution. These advantages facilitated Liu et al. to uncover new potential findings related to m6Am regulation and function. I am confident that CROWN-seq will likely be the gold standard for m6Am-sequencing henceforth.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Though the authors have uncovered a potentially new function for m6Am, they need to be clear that without identifying a mechanism, their data might only be demonstrating a correlation between the presence of m6Am and transcriptional regulation rather than causality.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104139.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jianheng Fox</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hawley</surname><given-names>Ben R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nicholson</surname><given-names>Luke</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jaffrey</surname><given-names>Samie R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Liu et al. present CROWN-seq, a technique that simultaneously identifies transcription-start nucleotides and quantifies N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) stoichiometry.

Unlike prior reports that associated m6Am with mRNA stability and expression, the authors suggest here that m6Am may increase transcription when combined with specific promoter sequences and initiation mechanisms. Additionally, they report intriguing insights on m6Am in snRNA and snoRNA and its regulation by FTO. Overall, the manuscript presents a strong body of work that will significantly advance m6Am research.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The technology development part of the work is exceptionally strong, with thoughtful controls and well-supported conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for the very positive assessment of the study.

Such a technique was a key need in the field since prior attempts to get accurate positional or quantitative measurements of m6Am positioning yielded starkly different results and failed to generate a consistent set of targets. As noted in the strengths section below the authors have developed a robust assay that moves the field forward.</p><p>Furthermore, their results show that most mRNAs whose transcription start nucleotide (TSN) is an 'A' are in fact m6Am (85%+ for most cell lines). They also show that snRNAs and snoRNAs have a substantially lower prevalence of m6Am TSNs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Critically, the authors spent substantial time and effort to validate and benchmark the new technique with spike-in standards during development, cross-comparison with prior techniques, and validation of the technique's performance using a genetic PCIF1 knockout. Finally, they assayed nine different cell lines to cross-validate their results. The outcome of their work (a reliable and accurate method to catalog cap-adjacent m6Am) is a particularly notable achievement and is a needed advance for the field.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>No major concerns were identified by this reviewer.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment of the method and dataset. We have addressed the concerns below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mid-level Concerns:</p><p>(1) In Lines 625 and 626, the authors state that “our data suggest that mRNAs initate (mis-spelled by authors) with either Gm, Cm, Um, or m6Am.” This reviewer took those words to mean that for A-initiated mRNAs, m6Am was the ‘default’ TSN. This contradicts their later premise that promoter sequences play a role in whether m6Am is deposited.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have changed this sentence into “Instead, our data suggest that mRNAs initiate with either Gm, Cm, Um, or Am, where Am are mostly m<sup>6</sup>Am modified.” The revised sentence separates the processes of transcription initiation and m<sup>6</sup>Am deposition, which will not confuse the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Further, the following paragraph (lines 633-641) uses fairly definitive language that is unsupported by their data. For example in lines 637 and 638 they state “We found that these differences are often due to the specific TSS motif.” Simply, using ‘due to’ implies a causative relationship between the promoter sequences and m6Am has been demonstrated. The authors do not show causation, rather they demonstrate a correlation between the promoter sequences and an m6Am TSN. Finally, despite claiming a causal relationship, the authors do not put forth any conceptual framework or possible mechanism to explain the link between the promoter sequences and transcripts initiating with an m6Am.</p><p>(3) The authors need to soften the language concerning these data and their interpretation to reflect the correlative nature of the data presented to link m6Am and transcription initiation.</p></disp-quote><p>For (2) and (3). We have softened the language in the revised manuscript. Specifically, for lines 633-641 in the original manuscript, we have changed “are often due to” into “are often related to” in the revised manuscript, which claims a correlation rather than a causation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>m6Am is an abundant mRNA modification present on the TSN. Unlike the structurally similar and abundant internal mRNA modification m6A, m6Am’s function has been controversial. One way to resolve controversies surrounding mRNA modification functions has been to develop new ways to better profile said mRNA modification. Here, Liu et al. developed a new method (based on GLORI-seq for m6A-sequencing), for antibody-independent sequencing of m6Am (CROWN-seq). Using appropriate spike-in controls and knockout cell lines, Liu et al. clearly demonstrated CROWN-seq’s precision and quantitative accuracy for profiling transcriptome-wide m6Am. Subsequently, the authors used CROWN-seq to greatly expand the number of known m6Am sites in various cell lines and also determine m6Am stoichiometry to generally be high for most genes. CROWN-seq identified gene promoter motifs that correlate best with high stoichiometry m6Am sites, thereby identifying new determinants of m6Am stoichiometry. CROWN-seq also helped reveal that m6Am does not regulate mRNA stability or translation (as opposed to past reported functions). Rather, m6Am stoichiometry correlates well with transcription levels. Finally, Liu et al. reaffirmed that FTO mainly demethylates m6Am, not of mRNA but of snRNAs and snoRNAs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript that describes and validates a new m6Am-sequencing method: CROWN-seq as the first m6Am-sequencing method that can both quantify m6Am stoichiometry and profile m6Am at single-base resolution. These advantages facilitated Liu et al. to uncover new potential findings related to m6Am regulation and function. I am confident that CROWN-seq will likely be the gold standard for m6Am-sequencing henceforth.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Though the authors have uncovered a potentially new function for m6Am, they need to be clear that without identifying a mechanism, their data might only be demonstrating a correlation between the presence of m6Am and transcriptional regulation rather than causality.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the very positive assessment of the CROWN-seq method. We have softened the language which is related to the correlation between m<sup>6</sup>Am and transcription regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer recommendations:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive suggestions. In the revised manuscript, we have corrected the errors and updated the requested discussions and figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The prior work from the research group, &quot;Reversible methylation of m6Am in the 5′ cap controls mRNA stability&quot; (PMID: 28002401), should be cited, even if the current findings differ from earlier conclusions-particularly in line 58 and the section titled &quot;m6Am does not substantially influence mRNA stability or translation&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have added the citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I wonder why the authors chose to convert A to I before capping and recapping, as RNA fragmentation caused by chemical treatment may introduce noise into these processes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. This is a very good point. We have indeed considered this alternative protocol. There are two concerns in performing decapping-and-recapping before A-to-I conversion: (1) it is unclear whether the 3’-desthiobiotin, which is essential for the 5’ end enrichment, is stable or not during the harsh A-to-I conversion; (2) performing decapping-and-recapping first requires more enzyme and 3’-desthiobiotin-GTP, which are the major cost of the library preparation. This is because the input of CROWN-seq (~1 μg mRNA) is much higher than that in ReCappable-seq (~5 μg total RNA or ~250 ng mRNA). In the current protocol, many 5’ ends are highly fragmented and therefore are lost during the A-to-I conversion. As a result, less enzyme and 3’-desthiobiotin-GTP are needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) During CROWN-seq benchmarking, the authors found that 93% of reads mapped to transcription start sites, implying a 7% noise level with a spike-in probe. This noise could lead to false positives in TSN assignments in real samples. It appears that additional filters (e.g., a known TSS within 100 nt) were applied to mitigate false positives. If so, I recommend that the authors clarify these filters in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We think that the spike-in probes might lead to an underestimation of the accuracy of TSN mapping. The spike-in probes are made by in vitro transcription with m<sup>7</sup>Gpppm<sup>6</sup>AmG or m<sup>7</sup>GpppAmG analogs. We found that the in vitro transcription exhibits a small amount of non-specific initiation, which leads to spike-in probes with 5’ ends that are not precisely aligned with the desired TSS. To better illustrate the mapping accuracy of CROWN-seq, we provided Figure 2H, which compares the non-conversion rates of newly found A-TSNs between wild-type and <italic>PCIF1</italic> knock cells. If the newly found A-TSNs are real, they should show high non-conversion rates in wild-type cells (i.e., high m<sup>6</sup>Am) and almost zero non-conversion rates (i.e., Am) in <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout cells. As expected, most of the newly found A-TSNs are true A-TSNs since they are m6Am in wild-type and Am in <italic>PCIF1</italic> knockout. Thus, we think that CROWN-seq is very precise in TSS mapping. We have clarified this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I wonder if PCIF1 knockout affects TSN choice and abundance. If not, this data should be presented. If so, how are these changes accounted for in Figure 2H and Figure S5?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. PCIF1 KO does not really affect TSN choice. Here we calculate the correlation of relative TSN expression within genes between wild-type and PCIF1 KO cells (shown using Pearson’s r). It shows that most of the genes have similar TSN choices (with higher Pearson’s r) in both wild-type and PCIF1 KO cells. Thus, PCIF1 KO does not alter global TSN expressions.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-104139-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The manuscript refers to Am as a rare modification in mRNA (e.g., introduction lines 101-102; discussion lines 574, 608; and possibly other locations) without specifying this only applies to transcription start sites.

We have updated Figure S2 to describe the newly found TSSs. Depending on the coverage in CROWN-seq, the TSSs with higher coverage tend to overlap with or locate proximally to known TSSs. In contrast, the TSSs with low coverage tend to be located further away from annotated TSSs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1b) The alternate TSNs can have effects on splicing patterns and isoform identity. Providing a few sentences to explain how regularly this occurs would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. It is a very interesting point.

The authors should also discuss this in light of recent findings by An et al. (2024 Mol. Cell), which support the former conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We now have updated the Discussion to address that our paper and An et al. can support each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Given that the authors showed m6Am promotes gene expression (Figure 5) but does not affect mRNA stability (Fig. S5), logic dictates that m6Am must regulate mRNA transcription. However, the authors should explain why this regulation focuses on the initiation aspect of transcription rather than other aspects of transcriptional e.g. premature termination, pause release, and elongation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In this study, we did not profile the 3’ ends of nascent RNAs and thus we can only make conclusions about the overall transcription process but not a specific aspect. We have updated the revised Discussion section to mention that An et al. discovered that m<sup>6</sup>Am can sequester PCF11 and thus promote transcription, and therefore some of the effects we see could be related to differential premature termination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Authors should add alternative versions of Figure 1D but with 3 colours corresponding to Am vs. m6Am vs. Cm/Gm/Um for all the cells, they performed CROWN-seq on.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.

Most mRNAs start with A or G. We therefore selected G-TSN as the control. Unlike G-TSNs which occur in diverse sequence and promoter contexts, C-TSNs and U-TSNs are unusual. Genes that mainly use C-TSNs and U-TSNs are the so-called “5’ TOP (Terminal OligoPyrimidine)” genes. The 5’ TOP genes are mostly genes related to translation and metabolism, and thus their expressions reflect the homeostasis of cell metabolism. Thus, we were concerned that any differential expression of the C-TSN and U-TSN genes between wild-type and PCIF1 knockout cells might reflect specific effects on TOP transcriptional regulation rather than the general effects of PCIF1 on transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Line 82, 470, 506, 676: The authors should also cite Koh et al (2019 Nat.
