biomarker and an effector of aging. However, its function in intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is unclear. In this study, p16 expression levels were found to be positively correlated with the severity of human IVDD. In a mouse tail suspension (TS)-induced IVDD model, lumbar intervertebral disc height index and matrix protein expression levels were reduced significantly were largely rescued by p16 deletion. In TS mouse discs, reactive oxygen species levels, proportions of senescent cells, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) were all increased, cell cycling was delayed, and expression was downregulated for Sirt1, superoxide dismutase 1/2, cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6, phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, and transcription factor E2F1/2. However, these effects were rescued by p16 deletion. Our results demonstrate that p16 plays an important role in IVDD pathogenesis and that its deletion attenuates IVDD by promoting cell cycle and inhibiting SASP, cell senescence, and oxidative stress.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neck and shoulder pain, lower back pain and leg numbness are conditions that many people will encounter as years go by. This is because intervertebral discs, the padding structures that fit between the bones in the spine, degenerate with age: their cells enter a ‘senescent’, inactive state, and stop multiplying.</p><p>A protein known as p16, an important regulator of cell growth and division, is known to accumulate in senescent cells. In fact, in mouse fat tissue, muscles or eyes, removing the cells that contain high levels of p16 delays aging-associated disorders. However, it was still unknown whether deactivating the gene that codes p16 in senescent cells could delay disc degeneration.</p><p>Here, Che, Li et al. discovered that p16 is highly present in the senescent cells of severely degenerated human intervertebral discs. The cells in the nucleus pulposus, the jelly-like and most critical tissue in the intervertebral discs, were extracted and grown in the lab under conditions that replicate the early stages of damage to the spine. Drugs and genetic manipulations were then used to decrease the amount of p16 in these cells.</p><p>The experiments showed that reducing the levels of p16 results in the senescent cells multiplying more and showing fewer signs of damage and aging. In addition, the discs of mice in which the gene that codes for p16 had been deleted were less prone to degeneration compared to ‘normal’ mice in similar conditions.</p><p>Overall, the work by Che, Li et al. shows that inhibiting p16 in disc cells delays the aging process and reduces the degeneration of intervertebral discs. These findings may one day be applicable to people with intervertebral disc diseases who, for example, could potentially benefit from a gene therapy targeting the cells which produce p16.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intervertebral disc degeneration</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>p16</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1158402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81572149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Yongxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSC201908080215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Che</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81671928</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xian</surname><given-names>Cory J</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1127396</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xian</surname><given-names>Cory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81730066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miao</surname><given-names>Dengshun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel IVDD mechanism that involves p16 is demonstrated and theoretical evidence is provided for effective methods to downregulate p16 and so reverse IVDD.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) refers to the physiological and pathological process of natural degeneration and aging of the intervertebral disc, which is the basis of various clinical spinal diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silagi et al., 2018</xref>). IVDD usually results in vertebral instability, disc herniation, and spinal canal stenosis, which are commonly accompanied by low back pain with or without symptoms of nerve root or spinal cord compression. These lead to tremendous societal and economic burdens worldwide. It has been estimated that, at some point during their lifetime, 80–90% of the world’s population suffer clinical low back pain, which is positively correlated with disc degeneration in approximately 23% of these people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Walker, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The human intervertebral disc is a non-vascular tissue, and its annulus fibrosus (AF) and inner layer nucleus pulposus (NP) rely mainly on the penetration of the end plate to provide nutrition. In this chronically high osmotic pressure, low pH, hypoxic and low-nutrition environment, the cells are less active. This is one of the reasons for the poor self-healing ability of the disc's structure and function after tissue damage, and thus, intervertebral discs degenerate more easily than other tissues in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2016</xref>). Among the many factors that cause intervertebral disc degeneration is the accumulation of senescent disc cells (most of which are NP cells), which has provided a novel insight into IVDD pathogenesis. Senescent NP cells generate only a small number of new cells; therefore, the number of functional cells decreases gradually. Moreover, senescent NP cells may change the disc microenvironment, creating a senescence-associated phenotype in which proinflammatory factors are overexpressed, extracellular matrix (ECM) is decreased, and growth factors and chemokines are downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le Maitre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Markova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van Deursen, 2014</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin cell senescence in IVDD are unclear.</p><p>Cell senescence is regulated by various molecular signaling pathways. One of the canonical molecules involved in cell senescence is p16 (p16INK4a), which is encoded by the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> gene and belongs to the cell cycle regulatory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Serrano, 1997</xref>). Senescent cells, most of which seem to express p16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Childs et al., 2017</xref>), accumulate with aging and are conducive to tissue dysfunction. The clearance of p16-positive senescent cells in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and the eye has been suggested to delay aging-associated disorders in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, the systemic clearance of p16-positive senescent cells and conditional <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> gene deletion have been shown to mitigate age-associated IVDD in mice, mostly by suppressing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), improving matrix homeostasis, and reducing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Novais et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Patil et al., 2019</xref>). However, we do not yet know how p16 drives disc cell senescence and whether other factors are present in the progression of IVDD, especially in human discs.</p><p>Increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), another main feature of aging, are involved in a number of age‐related pathologies. Senescence can occur under prolonged oxidative states; and thus, ROS is seen as an important mediator of the progression of cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colavitti and Finkel, 2005</xref>). Pathological ROS levels have been implicated in the induction of senescence-like phenotypes similar to that of p16-induced senescence. An increasing number of studies have shown that p16 might play a role in oxidative stress-associated senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mas-Bargues et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, whether p16 contributes to intervertebral disc aging by increasing ROS is unclear. The present study aimed to highlight the influence of p16 on disc degeneration, mainly focusing on oxidative stress and human NP cell proliferation, and verified this effect in mice that have homozygous deletion of <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>p16 was upregulated in the NP of degenerated human intervertebral discs</title><p>To explore the role of p16 in IVDD, p16 expression was first verified in the NP tissues of patients with various degrees of disc degeneration, as examined by histological staining (Pfirrmann grades 2–5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). H and E staining showed a substantially disordered tissue texture in samples with a high Pfirrmann grade, in which hypertrophic and vacuole-like cells and multinuclear giant cells were present at the end of the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Masson and Safranin O staining showed smaller amounts of proteoglycans (PGs) and increased levels of fibrosis in NP tissues that had a high Pfirrmann grade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results confirm that severely degenerated NP tissue is correlated with a high Pfirrmann grade. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting (WB) revealed that degenerated discs with a higher Pfirrmann grade expressed a higher level of p16 than those with a lower Pfirrmann grade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C,D;</xref> with p16 expression levels and their corresponding Pffirmann grades being shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

IL-1β was used to induce NP cell degeneration. Immunofluorescent (IF) and SA-β-gal staining clearly illustrated that IL-1β greatly increased the percentage of senescent NP cells and p16 protein expression when compared with control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D,E</xref>). In addition, the effect of altering p16 expression levels on NP cell degeneration and proliferation was investigated. p16 expression was down- and upregulated by siRNA or plasmid transfection, respectively. The transfection efficiencies of targeted siRNAs and plasmids, compared with those of null siRNA and empty plasmid, respectively, are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. p16 expression decreased after siRNA-mediated knockdown, which decreased the proportion of NP cells that demonstrated a senescent phenotype. By contrast, p16 overexpression caused a marked opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,H</xref>). In addition to the degree of aging, proliferative ability is another indicator of cellular degeneration.

Here, an unbiased comparison of p16 expression in NP cells from IVDD patients with varying Pfirrmann scores showed that p16 expression is positively correlated with the degree of human disc degeneration. Along with the increase in the severity of human IVDD, NP cells showed decreased PG contents, increased fibrosis, and greater vacuolization; moreover, more multinucleated giant cells were observed, and p16 accumulated. The findings show that p16 plays a role in IVDD progression. Using NP cells harvested from patients with disc degeneration with a Pfirrmann score of 2 (mild disc degeneration), in-vitro studies further explored the function of p16 in the pathology of disc degeneration. The results suggest that p16 deficiency decreases oxidative stress and DNA damage in NP cells and contributes to NP cell proliferation, which protects against IVDD by promoting cell-cycle progression. In addition, for potential therapeutic exploration, these findings have provided theoretical and experimental evidence to support the potential use of rapamycin or the upstream approach targeting NF-κB-p65 to suppress p16 expression. Thus, the current investigation has not only demonstrated the different mechanisms of p16 in IVDD but also may provide theoretical evidence to inform the exploration of effective methods to downregulate p16 in order to reverse IVDD.</p><p>Although the presence of p16-positive cells indicates that an organism is in an inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2011</xref>), it is unclear whether the differential expression of p16 affects human disc degeneration. To simulate the microenvironment in disc degeneration, IL-1β was used to induce NP cell senescence. Multiple analyses revealed that p16 expression increased significantly as the degree of senescence increased in NP cells. However, the senescent phenotype of NP cells became less pronounced when p16 was silenced. By contrast, increased NP cell senescence was observed when p16 levels were upregulated by plasmid transfection. These results imply that p16 not only is produced by NP cell senescence but also accelerates NP cell senescence.</p><p>ROSs are mainly induced during cellular aging, but the mechanism by how p16 regulates ROS levels in NP cells is not yet clear. The ROS levels in different groups of NP cells expressing different levels of p16 showed that ROS levels increased along with p16 overexpression. This result suggests a strategy to reduce ROS in NP cells via p16 suppression.</p><p>Senescence plays a basic role in regulating cell cycling by halting cell proliferation, and p16 expression was observed to be negatively correlated with human NP cell proliferation, an effect that was reversed by p16 downregulation. Previously, p16 was shown to be a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that is sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation and to induce aging features in mammals by restraining the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boquoi et al., 2015</xref>). The in-vitro model illustrated that p16 can inhibit the progression of NP cells from G<sub>1</sub> to S phase, which is an essential mechanism by which proliferation is regulated in human NP cells.</p><p>On the basis of the results described above, it is more feasible to suppress p16 expression using a specific drug rather than siRNA transfection. After all, for patients, drug therapy is more convenient and economical than gene therapy. Rapamycin was previously shown to have antiaging effects in multiple cells and organisms by modulating oxidative stress, nutrient sensing, and the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richardson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2017a</xref>). Rapamycin was also shown to inhibit p16 expression to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gidfar et al., 2017</xref>). However, previous studies on the effect of rapamycin on disc degeneration focused on the role of this compound in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, rapamycin was applied to inhibit p16 and to explore its function in regulating ROS levels and the cell cycle. Rapamycin significantly decreased p16 expression and reversed the senescent phenotype of human NP cells. Furthermore, rapamycin decreased ROS levels in NP cells, which showed increased proliferation. Cell-cycle analyses indicated that rapamycin promoted the progression of NP cells from G<sub>1</sub> to S phase. Therefore, rapamycin may suppress ROS levels and promote NP cell proliferation, and these effects may be related to its ability to suppress p16. Taken together, p16 downregulation is likely to exert an antioxidant effect and promotes human NP cell proliferation, therefore playing a protective role in IVDD.</p><p>To verify these results in vivo, compound mutant mice with homozygous <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> deletion were used to establish an IVDD model involving TS. As a shock absorber for the spine, the basic role of the disc is a mechanical one containing load distribution, energy dissipation, and motion permit in daily activities. Mechanical factors have been proposed as one of the mechanisms necessary for accelerating the aging progression of both human and rodent discs via altered loading in several studies, so the TS mice model is an applicable mechanical representation of both tensile force on human discs and the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hutton et al., 2002</xref>).

Levels of aggrecan and collagen II, which protect NP cells in the ECM, were significantly increased in p16 KO mice with or without TS. By contrast, the protein levels of the fibrosis markers collagens I and X decreased after p16 deletion. To demonstrate whether p16 deletion affects inflammation in mouse discs, some inflammatory factors were further examined, and the results showed that p16 deletion reduced both the protein and the mRNA levels of the inflammatory factors. Encouragingly, the measurements of ROS levels and antioxidant activity showed that p16 deletion improved antioxidant activity in the discs and decreased ROS levels and DNA injury. Furthermore, examinations of the proliferation markers Ki67, PCNA, and IGF-1 indicated increased proliferative capacity in NP cells after p16 deletion. Interestingly, angiogenesis, which has been shown to increase the risk of IVDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zaidi et al., 2018</xref>), was reduced in p16 KO mice compared with WT mice; this might be a novel direction for future research. Finally, the analyses of the cell cycle and cell cycle-related proteins confirmed that p16 suppression activates CDK4 and CDK6 to promote Rb protein phosphorylation, enhance E2F1/E2F2 activity, and promote the progression of NP cells from G<sub>1</sub> to S phase. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that ablation of p16 can relieve mouse disc degeneration by protecting the ECM, inhibiting fibrosis, reducing inflammation, decreasing ROS levels, and promoting proliferation by regulating the cell cycle.</p><p>As p16 plays an important role in IVDD, it is essential to understand the molecular mechanism of p16 activation and dysfunction. Previous studies have shown that Bmi-1 and 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D inactivate p16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamakoshi et al., 2015</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism of p16 activation is still unclear. Bmi-1 is reported to active NF-κB signaling in glioma angiogenesis, cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D takes part in the suppression of inflammation and anticancer properties by blocking NF-kB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fekrmandi et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, a decreased NF-kB-p65 level was observed in the discs of p16 KO mice compared with those of the WT. Therefore, further work is necessary to explore the relation between NF-kB-p65 and p16 in disc tissue. NF-κB-p65 is well known for its role in regulating inflammation, immune response, cell division and apoptosis, and has been shown to participate in IVDD progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2017b</xref>). The present results support the observation that NF-κB-p65 is involved in p16 activation. Furthermore, by conducting analyses with the JASPAR database of transcription factor binding profiles, five putative NF-κB-p65 binding sites were identified in the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> promoter, and the ChIP assays have confirmed the activity of two of these putative binding sites. Finally, these two binding sites were tested in luciferase reporter gene assays, which showed that NF-κB-p65 bound at one binding site in the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> promoter, confirming that NF-κB-p65 is upstream of p16.</p><p>Taken together, from the data in the current study, a model illustrating the role and possible mechanisms of p16 in regulating IVDD can be proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). NF-κB-p65 probably increases p16 expression by promoter activation. p16 deficiency regulates the antioxidative behaviors of NP cells, resulting in the suppression of ROS levels and the alleviation of both NP cellular senescence and the SASP. Subsequently, p16 deficiency promotes cellular proliferation and the production of ECM, such as collagen II and aggrecan. It can be speculated that molecular studies of the p16 in the development of IVDD may provide new solutions for preventing degenerative disc diseases.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A proposed model for the mechanism of p16 in regulating intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD).</title><p>NF-κB-p65 activates p16 expression. p16 deficiency alleviates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and cellular senescence.

All of the pathways ultimately protect against the development of IVDD.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52570-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4"

The levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in NP cell supernatants were determined using an ELISA kit (KeyGen, Nanjing, China).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Flow cytometry analyses</title><p>Total ROS production, NP cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression were separately assessed using diacetyl dichlorofluorescein staining (Sigma Aldrich, Ohio, USA), propidium iodide staining (KeyGen, Nanjing, China), and EdU Flow Cytometry Assay Kits (Invitrogen, Massachusetts, USA), respectively. Human and mouse NP single-cell suspensions were prepared in PBS, and the cells were treated with the corresponding specialized reagent. The cell pellets were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and obtained by centrifugation. Finally, the specimens were investigated by flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>CCK-8 cell viability assay</title><p>Cell proliferation was evaluated with a CCK-8 assay (KeyGen, Nanjing, China). In brief, cells in each group (5000/well) were allowed to grow for 24, 48, and 72 hr. Ten microliters of CCK reagent in a total volume of 100 μl was put into each well, before incubation for 3–4 hr. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured by an ELISA plate reader (Thermo Electron, Massachusetts, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay</title><p>The 2000-bp region upstream of the p16 gene was selected as the promoter region according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>). After predicting DNA-binding sites for the NF-κB-p65 transcription factor in the p16 promoter using the JASPAR core database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bryne et al., 2008</xref>), five putative binding sites were identified close to the transcription start site. ChIP primers targeting these sites were designed by Primer Premier. ChIP assays were carried out using a ChIP kit (CST, Massachusetts, USA) and a p65 antibody obtained from Abcam. The relative binding of NF-κB-p65 to p16 was assessed by PCR, followed by digital imaging of agarose gels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Plasmid constructs and luciferase reporter gene assay</title><p>WT and mutant <italic>CDKN2A</italic> gene promoter segments were synthesized by Promoterbio Lab (Taizhou, China) and then cloned into the pGL4.23‐basic luciferase vector to obtain the pGL4.23-p16-wt and pGL4.23-p16-mut plasmids: control plasmid (0.1 μg)+pGL4.23‐basic vector (0.1 μg)+Renilla plasmid (0.01 μg), control plasmid+pGL4.23‐WT p16 promoter vector+Renilla plasmid, control plasmid+pGL4.23‐mutant p16 promoter vector+Renilla plasmid, NF-κB-p65 sequence plasmid+pGL4.23‐basic vector+Renilla plasmid, NF-κB-p65 sequence plasmid+pGL4.23‐WT p16 promoter vector+Renilla plasmid, and NF-κB-p65 sequence plasmid+pGL4.23‐mutant p16 promoter vector+Renilla plasmid, separately with Lipofectamine2000 (Thermo Fisher, Massachusetts, USA). The cells were incubated in normal culture medium for 48 hr after transfection. Luciferase assays was implemented after the cells were collected and lysed. And then luciferase activity was standardized to Renilla luciferase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All analyses were carried out by SPSS software (version 20.0, USA). Mean ± SD was used to present the data. To compare differences between groups, one‐way ANOVA and student's t-test were used. After analysis using a chi‐square test, qualitative data are presented as percentages. All graphs were generated using GraphPad Software (version 5.0.0, USA). P values were two‐sided, and p&lt;0.05 indicated statistical significance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by Australia National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) (1158402, 1127396), National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) project grant (81572149, 81671928, 81730066), and State Scholarship Fund by the China Scholarship Council (CSC201908080215).</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: This work was implemented by the approval of the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (approval number: 2018-SR-233).

understanding of the mechanism(s) of intervertebral disc degeneration, which is the hallmark of the crippling aging disorder, osteoarthritis. The model was considered adequate to establish a role of p16 in regulating the cell cycle and oxidative stress. The review concerns were also thoughtfully and thoroughly addressed, which added to the high level of enthusiasm.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;p16 deficiency protects against intervertebral disc degeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Chao Xie (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Below is the summary of our discussion with the reviewers to help you prepare a revised submission..</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Both reviewers felt that the submission merited further consideration due to its overall novelty with regard to the role of P16 deficiency in human intervertebral disc degeneration, and the approach used for the study. Specifically, the study design, methods, and material were seen to be well described and the data collections presented clearly. However, there was unanimity among reviewers regarding the lack of critical information in certain areas, as well as the need for validations and further details, all of which are specified below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are issues with the Abstract and Introduction. The Abstract did not fully cover the findings in the manuscript. For example, the in vitro work in Figures 1-3 were not reflected in the Abstract. In addition, the significance of this work and the potential impact was not mentioned. Likewise, the Introduction did not provide enough information for the readers. For example, in the second paragraph of the Introduction, although the authors listed the characteristics of the microenvironment, it is still unclear why the microenvironment would make discs degenerate more easily. Another example is in the third paragraph of the Introduction, wherein it is unclear which tissue was examined.</p><p>2) The quality of the Figure 1A is poor. It was hard for the reviewer to see the multinuclear giant cells at this magnification from HE staining. Please provide counterstaining for P16. Also, please comment on p16 expression in the matrix in G5. Also, in Figure 1B, the criteria of p16 positive cells are not explained. Thus, positive cells in G2 may look different from those in G5 – please provide more detail.</p><p>3) Patient details are lacking. It is suggested that, in the Materials and methods section, a table should provide patient details, including age, sex and Pfirrmann score.</p><p>4) It remains unclear from the data generated from the human specimens whether the MRI Pffirmann Grade correlated individually with p16 expression. In other words, please provide the p16 expression level of each individual (IHC) and their corresponding MRI Pffirmann Grade as a supplement for Figure 1. Please also provide high power MRI images of mice lumbar intervertebral and MRI Pffirmann Grade.</p><p>5) Instead of randomly choosing regions of interest (ROI) for H&amp;E, Safranin O, Masson, and p16 IHC staining (Figure 1), please use adjacent slices for all of these labels, which should help document a relationship between different molecules, as has been done in Figure 5A.</p><p>6) Certain issues regarding mechanical loading of the spine through tail suspension used for the weightlessness simulation study need clarification. Please explain how this model could represent aging-related human IVDD? What is the validity and fidelity of this model as it relates to lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration?</p><p>7) Please clarify any differences in ventral vs. dorsal portions of the nucleus pulposus and vertebral endplate in the mechanical loading study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52570.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are issues with the Abstract and Introduction.

We have clarified more details about the feasibility of tail suspension as a model related to IVDD in the Discussion section. The basic role of the disc is a mechanical function such as load distribution, energy dissipation, and motion permission Mechanical factor is proposed as one of necessary mechanisms for accelerating the IVDD of both human and rodent disc via altered loading. Weightlessness simulation by TS changes hydrostatic pressure in the disc and leads to the ECM destruction, inflammatory response and a catabolic process representing premature aging-related IVDD progression (Foldes et al., 1996). Therefore, we believe TS mouse model is an applicable mechanical representation of tensile force on human disc as well as the aging process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please clarify any differences in ventral vs. dorsal portions of the nucleus pulposus and vertebral endplate in the mechanical loading study.</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciated your comments. Due to the physiological curvature of the spine, the ventral portions suffer more critical pressure compared with the dorsal portions. Umehara et al. reported that the posterolateral sections of the disc containing NP and vertebral endplate bear lower elastic modulus and presents a milder degenerated degree compared to other portions (Umehara S, et al: Effects of degeneration on the elastic modulus distribution in the lumbar intervertebral disc. Spine. 1996; 1; 21(7):811-9; discussion 820). Ebara et al. stated that the posterolateral regions of the disc sustained lower values of stress compared with the anterior regions in a tensile properties study (Ebara S, et al. Tensile properties of nondegenerate human lumbar anulus fibrosis. Spine. 1996; 15; 21(4):452-61). In addition, it has been found that the ability to withstand applied stress was significantly reduced in the middle portion of the disc (Fujita Y et al. Radial tensile properties of the lumbar annulus fibrosus are site and degeneration dependent. J Orthop Res. 1997; 15(6):814-9)</p></body></sub-article></article>
