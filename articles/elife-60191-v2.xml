major driver of malignancy and a highly validated but challenging target for the development of anticancer therapies. Novel strategies to inhibit MYC may come from understanding the co-factors it uses to drive pro-tumorigenic gene expression programs, providing their role in MYC activity is understood. Here we interrogate how one MYC co-factor, host cell factor (HCF)–1, contributes to MYC activity in a human Burkitt lymphoma setting. We identify genes connected to mitochondrial function and ribosome biogenesis as direct MYC/HCF-1 targets and demonstrate how modulation of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction influences cell growth, metabolite profiles, global gene expression patterns, and tumor growth in vivo. This work defines HCF-1 as a critical MYC co-factor, places the MYC–HCF-1 interaction in biological context, and highlights HCF-1 as a focal point for development of novel anti-MYC therapies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tumours form when cells lose control of their growth. Usually, cells produce signals that control how much and how often they divide. But if these signals become faulty, cells may grow too quickly or multiply too often. For example, a group of proteins known as MYC proteins activate growth genes in a cell, but too much of these proteins causes cells to grow uncontrollably.</p><p>With one third of all cancer deaths linked to excess MYC proteins, these molecules could be key targets for anti-cancer drugs. However, current treatments fail to target these proteins. One option for treating cancers linked to MYC proteins could be to target proteins that work alongside MYC proteins, such as the protein HCF-1, which can attach to MYC proteins.</p><p>To test if HCF-1 could be a potential drug target, Popay et al. first studied how HCF-1 and MYC proteins interacted using specific cancer cells grown in the laboratory. This revealed that when the two proteins connected, they activated genes that trigger rapid cell growth. When these cancer cells were then injected into mice, tumours quickly grew. However, when the MYC and HCF-1 attachments in the cancer cells were disrupted, the tumours shrunk. This suggests that if anti-cancer drugs were able to target HCF-1 proteins, they could potentially reduce or even reverse the growth of tumours.</p><p>While further research is needed to identify drug candidates, these findings reveal a promising target for treating tumours that stem from over-abundant MYC proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>MYC</kwd><kwd>ribosome biogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006537</institution-id><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Popay</surname><given-names>Tessa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012394</institution-id><institution>Robert J.

Capable of acting as both transcriptional activators and repressors, MYC proteins (hereafter 'MYC') dimerize with their obligate partner MAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackwood and Eisenman, 1991</xref>) to bind and regulate the expression of thousands of genes connected to the cell cycle, protein synthesis, metabolism, genome stability, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tansey, 2014</xref>). Fueled by reports that experimental inactivation of MYC promotes tumor regression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alimova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaulieu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giuriato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jain, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soucek et al., 2013</xref>), there is considerable interest in the idea that MYC inhibitors could form the basis of broadly effective anticancer therapies. MYC itself, however, is widely viewed as undruggable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dang et al., 2017</xref>), meaning that effective strategies to pharmacologically inhibit MYC will most likely come from targeting the co-factors with which it interacts to drive and sustain the malignant state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The interactome of MYC has been extensively interrogated (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baluapuri et al., 2020</xref>). One effective strategy for prioritizing which of these interaction partners to study has been to focus on those that interact with conserved segments of the MYC protein, which are referred to as ‘MYC boxes’ (Mb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meyer and Penn, 2008</xref>). In addition to the highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix domain that interacts with MAX, six evolutionarily conserved MYC boxes have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baluapuri et al., 2020</xref>). On average, MYC boxes are around 15 amino acid residues in length, and although it is clear that they each mediate multiple protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kalkat et al., 2018</xref>), a number of predominant interactors have been described for most of these segments: Mb0, for example, interacts with the general transcription factor TFIIF to stimulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kalkat et al., 2018</xref>), MbI interacts with the ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>FBW7</sup> to control MYC protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Welcker et al., 2004</xref>), MbII interacts with the STAGA component TRRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McMahon et al., 1998</xref>) to regulate histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kalkat et al., 2018</xref>), and MbIIIb interacts with the chromatin-associated protein WDR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>) to facilitate its recruitment to ribosomal protein genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thomas et al., 2019</xref>). The two remaining MYC boxes are less well understood, but MbIIIa is important for tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herbst et al., 2005</xref>) and recruitment of HDAC3 to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kurland and Tansey, 2008</xref>), and MbIV interacts with the ubiquitous chromatin-associated protein host cell factor (HCF)–1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>HCF-1 is an essential nuclear protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goto et al., 1997</xref>) that is synthesized as a 2035 amino acid precursor and proteolytically cleaved by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Capotosti et al., 2011</xref>) into a collection of amino- (HCF-1<sub>N</sub>) and carboxy- (HCF-1<sub>C</sub>) terminal fragments that remain associated. HCF-1 was first identified through its ability to assemble into a multiprotein–DNA complex with the herpes simplex virus transactivator VP16, but was later shown to function in uninfected cells as a co-factor for cellular transcription factors, and as part of the Sin3 and MLL/SET histone modifying complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wysocka and Herr, 2003</xref>). The interaction of HCF-1 with VP16 is likely direct and is mediated by a tetrapeptide ‘EHAY’ motif in VP16 that binds to a region within the HCF-1<sub>N</sub> fragment known as the VP16-induced complex (VIC) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freiman and Herr, 1997</xref>). This four residue HCF-1-binding motif (HBM)—consensus (D/E)-H-x-Y—is present in other viral and cellular transcription factors that interact directly with the HCF-1 VIC domain, including key cell cycle regulators such as the E2F family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tyagi et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We identified HCF-1 as a MYC-associated protein through proteomic approaches, and demonstrated that the interaction occurs through the VIC domain of HCF-1 and an atypical HBM within MbIV that carries the sequence 'QHNY' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>). Mutation of these four HBM residues to alanine disrupts the interaction of MYC with HCF-1 in vitro and reduces the ability of MYC to promote murine fibroblast tumor growth in nude mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The small and well-defined interaction point between MYC and HCF-1, and the importance of this interaction to tumorigenesis, raise the possibility that the MYC–HCF-1 nexus could be a viable venue for discovery of novel anti-MYC therapies. If that venue is to be pursued, however, we need to place this interaction in biological context, identify the gene networks that are under its control, and determine whether the MYC–HCF-1 interaction is required for tumor initiation, maintenance, or both. Here we use a combination of loss- and gain-of function approaches to interrogate the role of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction in the context of a canonically MYC-driven cancer—Burkitt lymphoma. We demonstrate that the interaction between MYC and HCF-1 is directly involved in controlling the expression of genes linked to ribosome biogenesis, translation, and mitochondrial function. We define the impact of modulation of this interaction on cell growth, metabolism, and global gene expression patterns. And we show that disrupting the MYC–HCF-1 interaction promotes rapid and persistent tumor regression in vivo. This work reveals how MYC executes a core arm of its pro-tumorigenic gene expression changes, defines HCF-1 as a tumor-critical MYC co-factor, and provides proof-of-concept for a new way to inhibit MYC in the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bidirectional modulation of the MYC−HCF-1 interaction</title><p>To understand the role of HCF-1 in MYC function, we sought to use separation-of-function mutations in MYC that modulate interaction with HCF-1 in a predictable way. We therefore introduced a number of mutations in the atypical HBM of MYC (QHNY) that we expected to decrease—or increase—interaction with HCF-1, based on properties of prototypical HBM sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freiman and Herr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We substituted the MYC HBM for the canonical HBM from VP16 (VP16 HBM); we also mutated the invariant histidine of the HBM to glycine in the MYC (H307G) and VP16 (VP16 HBM:H307G) contexts, or we changed all four HBM residues to alanine (4A). A mutation in the separate WDR5-binding motif (WBM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>) was our specificity control. We transiently expressed these full-length FLAG-tagged MYC proteins in 293T cells and measured their ability to interact with endogenous HCF-1 in a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, the 4A mutation disrupts the MYC–HCF-1 interaction, as do both histidine to glycine substitutions—confirming the essentiality of this core HBM residue to the MYC–HCF-1 association. In contrast, replacing the MYC HBM with the canonical VP16 sequence increases the amount of HCF-1 recovered in the co-IP. The enhanced binding of the VP16 HBM MYC mutant to HCF-1 is also observed in vitro using purified recombinant MYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and in vitro translated HCF-1<sub>VIC</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that the MYC HBM is an authentic HBM, and that its variation from the canonical HBM sequence leads to a tempered interaction with HCF-1. We also conclude that we can use the 4A and VP16 HBM mutations to probe the significance of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction through both loss- and gain-of-function approaches.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A gain- and loss-of-function system to study the MYC–host cell factor (HCF)–1 interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of MYC, depicting the location of the six MYC boxes (Mb0–MbIV).

The untranslocated <italic>MYC</italic> allele is not expressed in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bemark and Neuberger, 2000</xref>). Because sequences encoding the MYC HBM are contained within exon 3, we used CRISPR/Cas9-triggered homologous recombination of the translocated <italic>MYC</italic> allele to integrate an exon 3 switchable cassette for wild-type (WT) MYC, 4A, or VP16 HBM mutants, and confirmed appropriate integration by Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). In cells expressing an inducible CRE-ER<sup>T2</sup> recombinase, treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) results in the excision of exon 3 of <italic>MYC</italic>, bringing in place a modified exon 3 that carries an HA-epitope tag and drives expression of P2A-linked green fluorescent protein (GFP). Twenty-four hours after 4-OHT treatment, at least 85% of cells in each population are switched—as monitored by GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), and we observe the expected appearance of HA-tagged MYC proteins, which migrate more slowly due to the presence of the epitope tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, the exchanged MYC proteins are expressed at levels comparable to endogenous MYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), are predominantly nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), and behave as expected, with the 4A mutant showing reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and the VP16 HBM mutant enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), interaction with endogenous HCF-1. Also as expected, these mutations have minimal impact on the interaction of MYC with WDR5. Thus, we successfully generated a system for inducible, selective, and bidirectional modulation of the MYC−HCF-1 interaction in the context of an archetypal MYC-driven cancer cell line.</p><p>To monitor the contribution of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction to cell proliferation, we pulsed each of our engineered Ramos lines with 4-OHT for 2 hr to generate approximately equally mixed populations of switched and unswitched cells. Based on the ability of MYC to drive glutamine addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jeong et al., 2014</xref>) and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pajic et al., 2000</xref>), we monitored how the GFP-positive switched cells in the population compared to their unswitched counterparts in terms of glutamine-dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), cell cycle profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We see that 4A switched cells have a selective advantage over the WT switch in their ability to grow without exogenous glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This advantage is likely due to loss of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction, as the VP16 HBM mutant cells have a corresponding deficit in growth under glutamine-starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). When assayed in media replete with glutamine, cell cycle profiles for the two mutants are modestly altered compared to their WT counterparts, including small but statistically significant changes in the proportion of cells in G<sub>2</sub>/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), which again trend in opposite directions for the two MYC mutants—decreasing for the 4A-expressing cells and increasing for those that express the VP16 HBM mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Finally, in long-term growth assays in complete media, we observe that 4A mutant cells are gradually lost from the culture over time, whereas there is a significant enrichment of VP16 HBM cells, compared to the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The differences in representation of the two MYC mutants in these populations is unlikely due to apoptosis—we observe no differences in the proportion of sub-G<sub>1</sub> cells between the different switches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>)—but tracks with changes in cell doubling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), which are increased for the 4A, and decreased for the VP16 HBM mutant cells. The altered and opposing impact of the 4A and VP16 HBM mutations in these assays leads us to conclude that the MYC–HCF-1 interaction promotes the glutamine-dependency—and rapid proliferative status—of these BL cells in culture.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The MYC–HCF-1 interaction influences intracellular amino acid levels</title><p>As part of our survey of the impact of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction on Ramos cell processes, and because of its influence on glutamine dependency, we determined whether metabolite levels are altered in response to expression of the 4A or VP16 HBM MYC mutants. We performed global, untargeted, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics on switched cells using reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) separation methods. We detected ~2000 metabolites with each approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>), and there is strong consistency among biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In general, more metabolites are significantly changed, and with a greater magnitude, for the 4A than the VP16 HBM MYC mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B and D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">2</xref>). For both mutants, significantly changed metabolites group into a variety of categories, with a particular enrichment for those related to amino acid and lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>). Comparing the direction of individual metabolite changes for the 4A and VP16 HBM mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we note that a significant portion of the metabolite changes detected by both the RPLC and HILIC methods are in the same direction for the two MYC mutants. In general, these shared metabolite changes fail to cluster strongly into biological pathways; the only significantly enrichment being glycerophospholipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Focusing on metabolite changes that occur in opposite directions for the 4A and VP16 HBM mutants, however, we observe significant enrichment in pathways linked to nitrogen and amino acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). There is a clear anti-correlation between the impact of the 4A and VP16 HBM mutations on metabolites connected to aspartic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), and we observe that intracellular levels of glutamine (and associated metabolites) are increased in the 4A and decreased in the VP16 HBM mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Notably, these changes in intracellular amino acid levels are not confined to aspartic acid and glutamine, but there is a general tendency for amino acid levels to be increased in 4A and decreased in VP16 HBM mutant cells, compared to the WT switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Importantly, many of the genes that are differentially expressed upon HCF-1<sub>N</sub> degradation are also differentially expressed in the presence of either the 4A or VP16 HBM mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>), and we identified a union set of ~450 genes—oppositely regulated by the 4A and VP16 HBM mutants—the expression of which also changes when HCF-1<sub>N</sub> is destroyed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Within this set, loss of HCF-1<sub>N</sub> tends to mimic the loss of interaction 4A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Moreover, within the cohort of transcripts that are reduced by both HCF-1<sub>N</sub> destruction and the 4A mutation, we see clear representation of genes connected to ribosome biogenesis and the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>). Although performing RNA-Seq at this early time likely underestimates the impact of loss of HCF-1<sub>N</sub> on the transcriptome, the presence of these ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial matrix genes at the point of coalescence of all our RNA-Seq experiments strongly suggests that they are directly controlled by the MYC–HCF-1 interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Most HCF-1 binding sites on chromatin are bound by MYC</title><p>To help identify direct transcriptional targets of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction, we next compared the genomic locations bound by MYC and HCF-1<sub>N</sub> in Ramos cells.

To determine whether these genes are also bound by HCF-1, we compared our HCF-1<sub>N</sub> and MYC ChIP-Seq data to those we generated for WDR5 in this setting. Interestingly, there is little overlap of binding sites for MYC, WDR5, and HCF-1<sub>N</sub> in Ramos cells, with just ~5% of MYC–﻿HCF-1<sub>N</sub> co-bound sites also being bound by WDR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Moreover, of the 88 sites bound by all three proteins, only three of these are sites where WDR5 has a functional role in MYC recruitment. Thus, despite the fact that both WDR5 and HCF-1 are often members of the same protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2010</xref>), and despite both of them having links to key aspects of protein synthesis gene expression, the two proteins associate with MYC at distinct and separate regions of the genome.</p><p>Finally, we overlaid the physical location of MYC and HCF-1<sub>N</sub> on chromatin with gene expression changes we had monitored in earlier experiments. Looking at genes displaying promoter proximal binding of MYC and HCF-1<sub>N</sub>—where clear gene assignments can be made—we see that approximately one-third of these genes are differentially regulated in the presence of either the 4A or VP16 HBM MYC mutants, and that this is significantly more than that predicted by chance alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). For the 4A mutant, a slightly greater proportion of co-bound genes are downregulated, while the opposite is true for the VP16 HBM mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). A relatively small cohort of MYC–HCF-1<sub>N</sub> co-bound genes are oppositely impacted by the 4A and VP16 HBM mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>; ‘4A/VP’), but comparing these with those deregulated by depletion of HCF-1<sub>N</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), we again see that a majority are connected to ribosome biogenesis and mitochondria, and that most are positively regulated by HCF-1 and the MYC–HCF-1 interaction.

Binding of HCF-1<sub>N</sub> to chromatin is largely unaffected by the 4A or VP16 HBM mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), demonstrating that MYC does not recruit HCF-1 to chromatin.

Indeed, focusing on the top 140 significant changes, we see that the 4A and the VP16 HBM mutants both tend to have increased or expanded chromatin binding, compared to WT MYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Visual inspection of the ChIP-Seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>) confirms the subtlety of these effects and reinforces the concept that the binding of MYC (and HCF-1) to chromatin is not impacted in opposite ways by the 4A and VP16 HBM mutations.

Thus, although the HBM may play a modest role in chromatin targeting by MYC in cells, this is likely to be independent of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction.

As we observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thomas et al., 2019</xref>), the ‘WT to WT’ tumors continue to grow rapidly after switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>), and all mice had to be euthanized before 30 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). For the 4A switches, however, tumors rapidly regressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), and all mice survived—and were tumor free—for the 60-day duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Regression of the 4A tumors occurs at a pace that is virtually indistinguishable from the ∆264 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>), and like the ∆264 scenario, is accompanied by high levels of apoptosis, as measured by Annexin V staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), caspase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and sub-G<sub>1</sub> DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We conclude that the interaction of MYC with HCF-1 is essential for tumor maintenance in this context.</p><p>Finally, we performed RNA-Seq on tumor material excised 48 hr after switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>). Thousands of differentially expressed genes were identified in the mutant switch tumors, many of which are shared between the 4A and ∆264 mutants—for both the decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>) directions. Common reduced transcripts are enriched in those connected to ribosome biogenesis, translation, and mitochondrial envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>), whereas those that are induced are enriched for functions including transcription co-regulator activity, kinase binding, and the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Many of these gene expression changes are likely due to indirect effects of tumor regression. To tease these changes apart from those more closely connected to the MYC–HCF-1 interaction, we overlaid tumor RNA-Seq with that generated for the 4A MYC mutant in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Responses that were only observed in the tumor regression model were linked to fairly broad categories such as ‘protein binding’ or ‘mRNA metabolism’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1J and K</xref>). Responses that were shared between the in vitro and in vivo systems were, in contrast, more extensive and specific. Indeed, more than 70% of the genes repressed in the 4A cell line are also repressed in either 4A-1 or 4A-2 tumors, and there is a common set of 942 genes that are shared between all three data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). These genes coalesce on those connected to ribosome biogenesis, translation, and the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). The overlap of induced genes was less pronounced (30%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>) and these genes are less clustered, although we do observe modest enrichment in categories connected to metabolism, chromatin binding, and transcription coregulator activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>). The recurring connections we observe between the MYC–HCF-1 interaction and ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial function, both in vitro and in vivo, strongly support the notion that a major function of this interaction is to stimulate ribosome production and mitochondrial vigor, and that these actions are central for the ability of MYC to drive tumor onset and maintenance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The wealth of MYC interaction partners provides a rich resource for the discovery of novel ways to eventually inhibit MYC in the clinic. Unfortunately, the complexity of the MYC interactome also presents a barrier to prioritizing which co-factors to pursue. The highest priority co-factors should be those that play a critical role in the core tumorigenic functions of the protein, and where there is proof-of-concept that disrupting interaction with MYC would provide a therapeutic benefit in the context of an existing malignancy. Here we provide this information for HCF-1. We show that MYC interacts with HCF-1 via a non-canonical HBM, identify roles for the MYC–HCF-1 interaction in the control of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and mitochondrial function, and show that loss of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction promotes frank and irreversible tumor regression in vivo. Although we do not yet know if a therapeutic window exists for targeting MYC through HCF-1, and we do not know if our findings will extend to other tumor types, this work, together with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>), highlights HCF-1 as a critical MYC co-factor and one worth pursuing as means to inhibit MYC in cancer.</p><p>Through the use of mutations that bidirectionally modulate the interaction between MYC and HCF-1, inducible degradation of HCF-1<sub>N</sub>, and ChIP-Seq analyses, we identified a relatively small set of genes that we posit are direct targets of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction. It is possible that the multi-pronged strategy we took excludes some bonafide MYC–HCF-1 target genes. But this approach is important because we cannot exclude the possibility that MbIV interacts with multiple factors besides HCF-1. Indeed, we observed instances where the 4A and VP16 HBM mutations produce similar effects on MYC behavior, suggesting that they impact some common aspect of MYC function that is independent of HCF-1. Nonetheless, the genes surviving our stringent criteria can be considered high-confidence targets, and are particularly interesting because of their (i) biological clustering, (ii) connections to core pro-tumorigenic MYC activities, and (iii) ability to account for many of the overt consequences of modulating the MYC–HCF-1 interaction on metabolism and tumorigenesis. What is also interesting about this set of genes is that they appear to be regulated by MYC and HCF-1 through a co-recruitment-independent mechanism.</p><p>Among the direct targets of the MYC−HCF-1 interaction are genes that catalyze rate-limiting steps in both ribosome biogenesis (rDNA transcription by POLR1A) and translation (initiator tRNA binding to start codon by EIF2S1 [EIF-2α]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hershey, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laferté et al., 2006</xref>). MYC regulates ribosome biogenesis through controlling and coordinating the transcription of ribosomal DNA, ribosomal protein genes, and components in the processing and assembly of ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Riggelen et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, regulation of tRNA ligases by MYC is considered an essential contributor to MYC-driven cell growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zirin et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, even with the direct MYC–HCF-targets classified as mitochondrially connected, we see that links to protein synthesis—MARS2, MRPS12, and MRPL32, for example—are specifically involved in the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, including those required for oxidative phosphorylation. We conclude that, in the context of its relationship with MYC, HCF-1 is dedicated to promoting multiple aspects of biomass accumulation.</p><p>The notion that there are process-specific co-factors for MYC is not widely appreciated. MIZ-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vo et al., 2016</xref>) and WDR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thomas et al., 2019</xref>) are perhaps the best examples to date; our work here on HCF-1 further reinforces this concept. There are some particularly interesting parallels between the actions of WDR5 and HCF-1 as process-specific co-factors for MYC: both interact with MYC through conserved MYC boxes, both control the expression of relatively small cohorts of genes, both are required to interact with MYC to establish and maintain tumors, and both have clear links to biomass accumulation. Beyond this point, however, these parallels break down. There is little overlap of target genes regulated by the MYC–WDR5 and MYC–HCF-1 interactions, and whereas MYC and HCF-1 associate with predominantly control ribosome biogenesis, MYC and WDR5 work together to stimulate the expression of genes encoding structural components of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thomas et al., 2019</xref>). This division of labor between HCF-1 and WDR5 in different aspects of protein synthesis is particularly intriguing given that HCF-1 and WDR5 work together as part of multi-protein chromatin modifying complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tyagi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wysocka et al., 2003</xref>). Yet MYC interacts with each protein through separate MYC boxes, and indeed the way in which MYC interacts with WDR5 likely precludes WDR5 from assembling into canonical HCF-1-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>). We believe the separation of interaction surfaces allows MYC to access non-canonical functions of both WDR5 and HCF-1, and may have evolved to permit discrete regulation of the constituents of the ribosomes versus the factors required to assemble these constituents into ribosome particles. Indeed, because HCF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mazars et al., 2010</xref>), MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chou et al., 1995</xref>), and the MYC–HCF-1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itkonen et al., 2019</xref>) all have ties to the metabolic sensor OGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swamy et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible that this separation of function allows for rapid modulation of ribosome assembly by HCF-1 when the metabolic state of the cell declines, while at the same time ensuring that ribosome subunits are present for rapid recovery when metabolism ramps up.</p><p>The concept that HCF-1 is a biomass-specific co-factor for MYC can also account for our discovery that intracellular amino acid levels are increased when the MYC–HCF-1 interaction is disrupted. Impairment of ribosome biogenesis and translation can lead to an accumulation of amino acids and compensatory changes in the expression of their transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scott et al., 2014</xref>). Of note, the way in which amino acid levels almost globally respond to changes in the MYC–HCF-1 interaction can also provide a simple explanation for how the MYC–HCF-1 interaction contributes to the glutamine addiction of Ramos cells. If MYC partners with HCF-1 to drive biomass accumulation, the net effect of this interaction will be to increase the demand for intracellular amino acids, with glutamine playing a particularly important role in the biosynthesis of multiple non-essential amino acids, including glutamate, arginine, proline, and alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hosios et al., 2016</xref>). The ability of MYC to drive glutamine-addiction is a defining characteristic of its tumorigenic repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tansey, 2014</xref>), and is thought to result from the ability of MYC to promote glutaminolysis and induce the expression of amino acid transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wise et al., 2008</xref>). But the accumulation of glutamine we observe upon disruption of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction, together with the specific role HCF-1 plays in MYC function, suggests that glutamine addiction might also be fueled by the well-established ability of MYC to stimulate protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iritani and Eisenman, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Our discovery that MYC and HCF-1 work together to regulate transcription via a co-recruitment-independent mechanism is surprising, but not without precedent. E2F transcription factors interact with HCF-1 through a canonical HBM to control the expression of genes connected to cell cycle progression, yet depletion of these proteins has little effect on the recruitment of either to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iwata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tyagi et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myc and HCF interact to activate transcription and control growth, but their respective interactions with chromatin are independent of one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furrer et al., 2010</xref>). A co-recruitment-independent mechanism may thus be a common way in which transcription factors interact with HCF-1 to modulate transcription. In imagining how this might occur, it is interesting to note that the biochemical context in which HCF-1 exists can be influenced by client proteins; its interaction with E2F1 drives association with SETD1A complexes, whereas its interaction with E2F4 favors binding to the SIN3A HDAC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tyagi et al., 2007</xref>). Perhaps, therefore, the post-recruitment interaction of MYC and HCF-1 modulates transcription by promoting the ejection of inhibitory proteins like SIN3A from, or recruiting activating proteins like SETD1A to, HCF-1. Further experimentation will be required to determine the mechanism of action.</p><p>Finally, there are two additional cancer-relevant connections worth mentioning. First, the COSMIC database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tate et al., 2019</xref>) identifies three cancer-associated mutations within the MYC HBM, all of which convert the subprime ‘QHNY’ motif to ‘EHNY’, which matches the perfect HBM consensus and closely resembles the gain-of-function VP16 HBM we used in this study. It is possible, therefore, that these rare mutations in MYC could contribute to disease progression via enhancement of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction. This is an intriguing idea, and one worth testing in a less aggressive in vivo model where increases in the tumorigenic potential of MYC can be visualized. Second, our demonstration that disrupting the MYC–HCF-1 interaction in the context of an existing tumor promotes its regression provides compelling proof-of-concept for the idea that inhibitors of this interaction could have utility as anticancer agents. Switching WT MYC to the 4A mutant caused rapid and widespread induction of apoptosis and was associated with changes in the expression of genes connected to ribosome biogenesis, translation, and the mitochondria, consistent with the idea that reduced expression of these MYC–HCF-1 target genes triggers the regression process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pelletier et al., 2018</xref>). The small and well-defined nature of the HBM suggests that if structural information becomes available for the HCF-1 VIC domain, it could be possible to develop small molecule inhibitors that block the MYC–HCF-1 interaction. The most obvious concern with this strategy is that HCF-1 is not a MYC-specific co-factor, and that its interactions with other transcription factors may limit or prevent attainment of a therapeutic window. To our knowledge, MYC proteins and E2F3a are the only transcription factors that interact with HCF-1 via an ‘imperfect’ HBM, which we show here is sub-optimal for robust HCF-1 association. It might be possible to develop a therapeutic window by exploiting the non-canonical nature of the HBM in MYC, with the expectation that this interaction will be more sensitive than others that carry higher affinity HBM motifs. We note, however, that many of the factors with which HCF-1 interacts via an HBM are inherently pro-proliferative, with the E2F proteins in particular playing a predominant role in cancer initiation, maintenance, and response to therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kent and Leone, 2019</xref>). We also note that HCF-1 has been reported to be overexpressed in cancer, and its overexpression can correlate with poor clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glinsky et al., 2005</xref>). It is possible, therefore, that on-target collateral consequences of inhibiting the MYC–HCF-1 interaction could also have therapeutic benefit against malignancies.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

While it has been known for quite some time that MYC and HCF1 associate in mammalian cells and in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there is a lack of compelling evidence relating to the extent or the importance of this association, in particular its potential importance in MYC oncogenic activity. The present paper attempts to address these issues. The authors identify a short sequence (they term HBM) in MycBox4 that mediates association with HCF1 and furthermore devise a clever strategy to inducibly mutate this sequence in Ramos cells. By manipulating expression of the HBM mutant MYC as well as HCF1 itself they are able to characterize the effects on altering the MYC-HCF1 interaction at the level of proliferation, global gene expression, and tumor growth. Moreover, they examine genomic occupancy and binding overlap of wildtype MYC and HCF1. The results taken together make a good case for important regulatory and functional consequences of the interaction on a distinct subset of genes that are predominantly involved in ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial and amino acid metabolism; often considered to be &quot;core&quot; activities of MYC.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;MYC regulates ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial gene expression programs through interaction with Host Cell Factor-1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Martin Eilers as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Elmar Wolf (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All reviewers agree this is a very interesting paper that validates the interaction between MYC and HCF1 as biologically relevant in a tumor model and provides a lot of interesting data on what the interaction may do. At the same time, all three reviewers make suggestions as to how to improve the impact of the paper and raise several new questions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a comprehensive and technically well-executed manuscript that validates an interaction between MYC and HCF1 that has been previously demonstrated by the authors. The data are interesting with respect to effects on gene expression, while the impact on cellular metabolism remain less clear. Potentially the most surprising aspect is that – while MYC and HCF1 co-bind to a number of promoters – this appears to largely independent of the effect on gene expression. Collectively, the data clearly validate the interaction as being biologically relevant but leave at this reviewer without a clear take-home message. The strongest data are the ones that document a dependence of established tumors on the MYC/HCF1 interaction, which in my view clearly warrant publication, I would have a number of specific comments.</p><p>1) The effect of the switch between mutants on cell growth is measured with an ultrasensitive cell competition; this is relevant, since there is no effect on the relative distribution on cell cycle phases, suggesting that the &quot;real&quot; effect may be subtle. The authors need to show straightforward growth curves and then use this together with the cell cycle phases distribution to calculate the length of each cell cycle phase.</p><p>2) The Z-normalization needs to be removed from changes in metabolite levels and, as presented, the data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 are not informative, they are simply blue and red tiles.</p><p>3) It is not clear to this reviewer what the authors can conclude from the changes in steady-state levels of metabolites. Also, parameters like &quot;pathway impact&quot; seem very indirect conclusions. In the absence of flux data that they show that any of these pathways is affected, I would suggest to shorten or delete the metabolic data.</p><p>4) There must be a better way to represent the data shown in Figure 3D and E. I think the authors will agree that – just to give one example – dark blue lines between unnamed genes in the category &quot;ribosome biogenesis&quot; to unreadable individual genes are simply not informative</p><p>5) It is not clear to this reviewer why the authors Z-normalize their gene expression data and then do Go-term enrichment analyses. Why not simply rung GSEA analyses on them? This would allow a much simpler comparison with other datasets. for example, the effects of the mutations on the MYC (and other) Hallmark gene sets should be shown.</p><p>6) Figure 5G should be shown for an equal number of random non co-bound genes, which have the same expression levels as the median of the co-bound genes.</p><p>7) The tumor data for the VP16 replacement need to be shown. It may well be that the MYC/HCF1 interaction is attenuated in wildtype MYC to prevent excessive MYC function.</p><p>8) As the authors know very well, there is a view of MYC as a global regulator of RNAPII function. It is possible, therefore, that they overlook a global change in RNAPII function, and this may resolve some of the puzzles here. They should show one RNAPII ChIPseq (total, pS2, pS5) experiment that addresses the issue and stratify this for the different sets of genes they are interested in.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript &quot;MYC regulates ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial gene expression programs through interaction with Host Cell Factor-1&quot; Tessa Popay and her colleagues from the Tansey lab describe that regulation of a distinct group of MYC target genes depends on interaction with HCF-1. In an elegant set of experiments, the authors constructed both, loss- and gain of function mutants of the MYC/HCF-1 interaction and characterized them in multiple assays.</p><p>1) Alanine substitutions in MBIV (&quot;4A&quot;) abolish interaction to HCF-1. Other substitutions increase interaction (VP16HBM).</p><p>2) Switchable expression to 4A decreases RAMOS long term growth in vitro. VP16HBM increases.</p><p>3) 4A and VP16HBM changes amino acid metabolism.</p><p>4) Gene expression analysis demonstrated downregulation of RIBI and mitochondrial matrix genes after switch to 4A. Opposite observation after switch to VP16HBM.</p><p>5) Acute depletion of HCF-1: Downregulation od RIBI genes.</p><p>6) MYC and HCF-1 bind to a small common subset of target genes, which is different to MYC/WDR5 target genes but functionally similar.</p><p>7) Switch to 4a compromises tumor engraftment and inhibits tumorigenesis.</p><p>The topic of the paper is of general interest to scientists working on tumor biology and the function of MYC. The data is overall convincing and the paper is very nicely written. I support publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after few comments could be addressed:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the mutations in MBIV affect the &quot;direct&quot; interaction between MYC and HCF-1. This conclusion is supported by recombinantly expressed MYC and IVT HCF-1. I think, one cannot really conclude direct interaction by this assay, as the reticulocyte extract contains all other mammalian proteins. The authors should show direct interaction by other means (i.e. purified HCF-1) or tone down their statements (see also in Discussion). One would at least expect a Coomassie gel for MYC.</p><p>2) The authors should think of assays, which demonstrate that 4A/ VP16HBM MYC mutants are normal with the exception if binding HCF-1 (IF, Reporter assays, ChIP,.…). I think, this is important.</p><p>3) I like the heatmap shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 3C summarizing the RNA-seq results (maybe show in the main Figure? Maybe instead of the radar plots?). How do the authors interpret that about one third of all genes, which are regulated in respect to wildtype MYC, are regulated in the same direction? Interaction of MBIV to other binding partners? Maybe the authors want to discuss potential explanations?</p><p>4) The degron system seems to work very well – congratulations! Isn´t that an ideal system to support the authors conclusion &quot;gene expression changes that result directly from the MYC-HCF-1 interaction occur through a mechanism that is independent of their recruitment to chromatin.&quot;, by doing MYC-ChIP-seqs after dTAG? That experiment is, however, not essential in my view.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This highly interesting manuscript is focused on the relevance of the interaction between MYC and HCF1.

The authors state that these findings may provide leverage for inhibiting MYC. Overall, this is an impressive paper – the functional and biochemical data are extensive and convincing: the usage of CRISPR knock-ins is a particularly elegant and effective way to test the importance of the MYC-HCF1 interactions. In addition, the paper very well written and easy to follow.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One surprising finding of this study that is not explored or discussed in sufficient detail is that gene regulation by MYC-HCF1 occurs through a &quot;co-recruitment independent mechanism&quot;. This conclusion is derived from their data that, although the MYC 4A HBM mutant no longer interacts with HCF1, both MYC and HCF1 binding to target genes is not appreciably affected. This was determined using ChIP-qPCR on a small number of targets (Figure 5I, J). This leaves the reader with no clear idea of the basis for the actual mechanism of cooperation and the authors offer scant guidance. It is certainly conceivable that MYC and HCF1 bind independently to targets and the HBM serves to stabilize or increase the affinity of interaction, modulate the relative positions of the bound proteins, or determine inclusion in a condensate. Importantly aside from the ChIP qPCR of a few targets, global binding data in (i) the presence of the MYC 4A mutant and (ii) the absence of HCF1 (dTAG) are not provided. It would be of considerably strengthen this paper to include analysis of gene tracks of MYC4A in presence and absence of HCF to determine whether there are shifts in the extent of binding or positioning of MYC and/or HCF peaks, changes in PolII distribution, and epigenetic alterations. Another explanation is that the MYC HBM sequence actually serves as a binding site for other co-factors, in addition to HCF1, which could impact MYC activity (see point 2 below).</p><p>1) Does the 4A mutation disrupt any other known interactions of MYC with other proteins? Carrying out a proteomic screen using WT vs 4A could identify other candidates.</p><p>2) All the experiments appear to be done using a single (EBV negative) BL line: Ramos. How broadly applicable is this interaction in terms of other lymphoma lines or tumor types?</p><p>3) What happens in the context of endogenous MYC? Is the HCF-MYC interaction still critical e.g. in normal B cells. This is particularly important to assess from a translational standpoint.</p><p>4) Are there documented mutations in patients in the MBIV HBM region that could potentially be gain-of-function (i.e. similar to the VP16 HBM)?</p><p>5) Figure 5: Was there a significant enrichment seen for canonical E-boxes? The NRF and Sp1 motifs are not particularly specific to MYC and I do not think that these sequences were found to bind MYC-MAX in the Blackwell et al. paper cited. Are the binding sites identified actually specific for dual binding by MYC and HCF1. In Figure 6, there is substantial overlap between gene expression changes in the tumor engraftment experiment when compared to the in vitro data. However, there are a lot of changes seen that are absent in the cell line. Is there a GO analysis for the in vivo specific signatures?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60191.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a comprehensive and technically well-executed manuscript that validates an interaction between MYC and HCF1 that has been previously demonstrated by the authors.

At day zero, the switched and unswitched cells are present in a 50:50 ratio that is same for the WT, 4A, and VP16 HBM cells. I do agree, however, that any competition assay will give an exaggerated impression of differences, compared to stand alone studies of each of the individual experimental arms. We now include, therefore, the requested straightforward growth curves—both as raw cell numbers (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C) and as calculated doubling times (Figure 1—figure supplement 2D). These new data clearly show that 4A cells double more slowly than WT, whereas VP16 HBM cells double more quickly. The difference is two to three hours in either direction. I do not think it is prudent to extrapolate these differences out to specific cell cycle phases, because this would be highly speculative and would add little to the story. The important point we make is that the growth differences between the WT, 4A, and VP16 HBM cells are real—and quantified—and we thank the reviewer for prompting us to include this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Z-normalization needs to be removed from changes in metabolite levels and, as presented, the data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 are not informative, they are simply blue and red tiles.</p></disp-quote><p>The heatmaps in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 are shown with Z-normalization as a way to represent the consistency among replicates. We have added statements to the text indicating this purpose. We have also included, with each of these heatmaps, a representation of log<sub>2</sub>FC so that the magnitude of the changes associated with the 4A and VP16 HBM mutants can be assessed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not clear to this reviewer what the authors can conclude from the changes in steady-state levels of metabolites.

We do feel that the connections to steady state amino acid levels are worth reporting, so we have revised this section to focus specifically on how these are altered in response to the 4A and VP16 HBM mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There must be a better way to represent the data shown in Figure 3D and E.

This is a much more informative way of presenting the data. There is value to the Circos plots, however, because they allow individual genes in the categories to be represented. We have now included high resolution versions of these plots in new Figure 2—figure supplement 2; gene names can be visualized by zooming in. We would like to include the Circos plots as part of this story but if the reviewer feels strongly that these should be removed entirely, we will oblige.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is not clear to this reviewer why the authors Z-normalize their gene expression data and then do Go-term enrichment analyses. Why not simply rung GSEA analyses on them? This would allow a much simpler comparison with other datasets. for example, the effects of the mutations on the MYC (and other) Hallmark gene sets should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>I apologize for the confusion regarding Z-normalization. We do not Z-normalize gene expression data and then perform GO term enrichment analysis; we only Z-normalize for the heatmaps so that we can show variation among biological replicates. We have revised the text to make this point clear. I do not think there is anything wrong with using the GO term enrichment analysis here in Figure 3B, especially as we back up our conclusions by performing GO analysis on the specific gene sets that are regulated in the same, or opposing, ways by the 4A and VP16 HBM mutants (Figure 3E–F).</p><p>While these RNA-Seq data are being discussed, I point out that we added a new piece of validation data (not requested) in Figure 3—figure supplement 1C demonstrating that select gene expression changes we observe in the RNA-Seq are a bonafide consequence of switching (<italic>i.e.,</italic> responsive to 4-OHT).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5G should be shown for an equal number of random non co-bound genes, which have the same expression levels as the median of the co-bound genes.</p></disp-quote><p>Excellent recommendation. We have performed this analysis and it is now included as Figure 5I in the revised manuscript. The analysis clearly shows that MYC–HCF-1 co-bound genes are significantly more affected by the 4A or VP16 HBM mutants than equivalently expressed genes that are not cobound.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The tumor data for the VP16 replacement need to be shown. It may well be that the MYC/HCF1 interaction is attenuated in wildtype MYC to prevent excessive MYC function.</p></disp-quote><p>As we note in the manuscript, the Ramos model is already very aggressive (see the tumor growth curves in Figure 7—figure supplement 1B), and it is not clear that we would be able to visualize an increase in tumor growth under these circumstances. We plan to test this mutant in other in vivo models in the future, particularly those with a slower rate of progression, so that we can test this idea that interaction with HCF is tempered to prevent excessive MYC function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) As the authors know very well, there is a view of MYC as a global regulator of RNAPII function. It is possible, therefore, that they overlook a global change in RNAPII function, and this may resolve some of the puzzles here. They should show one RNAPII ChIPseq (total, pS2, pS5) experiment that addresses the issue and stratify this for the different sets of genes they are interested in.</p></disp-quote><p>We have struggled with this comment, in large part because it is not at all clear what &quot;puzzles&quot; are being referred to here. I would argue that we have gone above and beyond what is typically done in terms of identifying these ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial matrix genes as MYC-HCF-1 targets. We have a loss-of-function MYC mutant, a gain-of-function MYC mutant, HCF-1 degradation, and location on chromatin; all of which point to a very consistent set of genes. I think it could be interesting to look at the MYC–HCF-1 interaction and whether it influences the global functioning of MYC in the future, but I think that needs more than just an RNAPII ChIP and clearly extends beyond the scope of the current story.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the manuscript &quot;MYC regulates ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial gene expression programs through interaction with Host Cell Factor-1&quot; Tessa Popay and her colleagues from the Tansey lab describe that regulation of a distinct group of MYC target genes depends on interaction with HCF-1.

The data is overall convincing and the paper is very nicely written. I support publication in eLife after few comments could be addressed:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the mutations in MBIV affect the &quot;direct&quot; interaction between MYC and HCF-1. This conclusion is supported by recombinantly expressed MYC and IVT HCF-1. I think, one cannot really conclude direct interaction by this assay, as the reticulocyte extract contains all other mammalian proteins. The authors should show direct interaction by other means (i.e. purified HCF-1) or tone down their statements (see also in discussion). One would at least expect a Coomassie gel for MYC.</p></disp-quote><p>Excellent point. In response to this comment, we removed any mention of the interaction between MYC and HCF-1 being &quot;direct&quot; and added the Coomassie gel for recombinant MYC proteins as Figure 1—figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should think of assays, which demonstrate that 4A/ VP16HBM MYC mutants are normal with the exception if binding HCF-1 (IF, Reporter assays, ChIP,.…). I think, this is important.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we performed three additional sets of experiments, and include the new data in the revised manuscript. First, we carried out cellular fractionation assays (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A) and showed that both the A4 and VP16 HBM mutants reside within the nuclear fraction (P3), similar to wild-type MYC. Second, we performed immunofluorescence studies (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B) and showed that the A4 and VP16 HBM mutants are predominantly nuclear, again similar to wild-type MYC. Third, we performed ChIP-seq analysis (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and found that the localization of MYC on chromatin is largely unaffected by the 4A and VP16 HBM mutations; there are some changes, as we report, but these changes are subtle and trend in the same direction for the 4A and VP16 HBM mutants. In addition, and as included in the original submission, we show that the A4 and VP16 HBM MYC mutants retain DNA-binding capability in vitro (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), as well as the ability to interact with WDR5 (Figure 1D and Figure 1E). Finally, I point out that, although we cannot exclude the possibility that mutations in the HBM disrupt some unknown interaction partner or function of MYC, our focus on reciprocal changes emerging from parallel loss and gain of function approaches ameliorates many of the concerns that arise when a purely loss of function strategy is employed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I like the heatmap shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 3C summarizing the RNA-seq results (maybe show in the main Figure? Maybe instead of the radar plots?). How do the authors interpret that about one third of all genes, which are regulated in respect to wildtype MYC, are regulated in the same direction? Interaction of MBIV to other binding partners? Maybe the authors want to discuss potential explanations?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now moved this heatmap into Figure 3, as requested. In response to reviewer #1 comment # 4 we also moved the Circos (radar) plots out of the main figure and into a new Supplemental figure. Our speculation for the common gene expression changes shared between the 4A and VP16 HBM mutants is that they both disrupt a function of MYC that is distinct from HCF-1. We have added text to the Discussion, as recommended by the reviewer, to make this point clear. We are grateful to the reviewer for prompting us to discuss this point in the manuscript, as it also strengthens our argument that the dual loss-of-function and gain-of-function approach we have taken allows us to pinpoint genes controlled via the MYC–HCF-1 interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The degron system seems to work very well – congratulations! Isn´t that an ideal system to support the authors conclusion &quot;gene expression changes that result directly from the MYC-HCF-1 interaction occur through a mechanism that is independent of their recruitment to chromatin.&quot;, by doing MYC-ChIP-seqs after dTAG? That experiment is, however, not essential in my view.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. The addition of the degron system for HCF-1 definitely strengthens the story, particularly in terms of the connections between MYC, HCF-1, and RiBi and mitochondrial gene expression programs. I am not convinced, however, that it would add much to the mechanism, beyond what we can deduce from the 4A and VP16 HBM mutants. And in fact, it could be misleading. It is entirely possible, for example, that loss of HCF-1 will alter the chromatin state of associated loci, influencing MYC recruitment in a very indirect way. In my opinion, the HBM point mutants are a much better way of asking whether contact between MYC and HCF-1 influences the recruitment of either protein to chromatin.</p><p>I realize, however, that we did not go far enough in our original studies to support our broad statements about a recruitment-independent mechanism, largely because we only looked at binding of MYC and HCF-1 to a handful of genes. We therefore went back and performed an entirely new set of MYC and HCF-1 ChIP-seq experiments in the WT, 4A, and VP16 HBM cells. The resulting data, which is now included in Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1, shows that global chromatin binding by MYC and HCF-1 are largely unaffected by the 4A and VP16 HBM mutations; as stated earlier, there are some subtle changes for MYC, as we report in the manuscript, but these changes trend in the same direction for the 4A and VP16 HBM mutants. With these new data in hand, we can be confident that we have not missed critical genes where co-dependent recruitment oh MYC and HCF-1 occurs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This highly interesting manuscript is focused on the relevance of the interaction between MYC and HCF1. While it has been known for quite some time that MYC and HCF1 associate in mammalian cells and in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there is a lack of compelling evidence relating to the extent or the importance of this association, in particular its potential importance in MYC oncogenic activity. The present paper attempts to address these issues. The authors identify a short sequence (they term HBM) in MycBox4 that mediates association with HCF1 and furthermore devise a clever strategy to inducibly mutate this sequence in Ramos cells. By manipulating expression of the HBM mutant MYC as well as HCF1 itself they are able to characterize the effects on altering the MYC-HCF1 interaction at the level of proliferation, global gene expression, and tumor growth. Moreover, they examine genomic occupancy and binding overlap of wildtype MYC and HCF1. The results taken together make a good case for important regulatory and functional consequences of the interaction on a distinct subset of genes that are predominantly involved in ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial and amino acid metabolism; often considered to be &quot;core&quot; activities of MYC. The authors state that these findings may provide leverage for inhibiting MYC. Overall, this is an impressive paper – the functional and biochemical data are extensive and convincing: the usage of CRISPR knock-ins is a particularly elegant and effective way to test the importance of the MYC-HCF1 interactions. In addition, the paper very well written and easy to follow.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One surprising finding of this study that is not explored or discussed in sufficient detail is that gene regulation by MYC-HCF1 occurs through a &quot;co-recruitment independent mechanism&quot;. This conclusion is derived from their data that, although the MYC 4A HBM mutant no longer interacts with HCF1, both MYC and HCF1 binding to target genes is not appreciably affected. This was determined using ChIP-qPCR on a small number of targets (Figure 5 I, J). This leaves the reader with no clear idea of the basis for the actual mechanism of cooperation and the authors offer scant guidance. It is certainly conceivable that MYC and HCF1 bind independently to targets and the HBM serves to stabilize or increase the affinity of interaction, modulate the relative positions of the bound proteins, or determine inclusion in a condensate. Importantly aside from the ChIP qPCR of a few targets, global binding data in (i) the presence of the MYC 4A mutant and (ii) the absence of HCF1 (dTAG) are not provided. It would be of considerably strengthen this paper to include analysis of gene tracks of MYC4A in presence and absence of HCF to determine whether there are shifts in the extent of binding or positioning of MYC and/or HCF peaks, changes in PolII distribution, and epigenetic alterations. Another explanation is that the MYC HBM sequence actually serves as a binding site for other co-factors, in addition to HCF1, which could impact MYC activity (see point 2 below).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's interest in knowing the mechanism of action through which the MYC– HCF-1 interaction promotes transcription of direct target genes. But the reality is that, if one excludes co-recruitment as a mechanism, there are very few, if any, solid leads to pursue. It could take many years to figure this out, and there is no clear experimental trajectory that we can take (at the moment) to be sure to get us there. What we can do, however, and as the reviewer suggests, is fortify our conclusion that the mechanism is indeed co-recruitment independent; which we have now done.</p><p>In response to this comment, we performed ChIP-seq for MYC and for HCF-1 in the WT, 4A, and VP16 HBM cells after switching. These data (now included as a new Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) clearly show that recruitment of HCF-1 to chromatin is not impacted by the 4A or VP16 HBM mutations. They also show that recruitment of MYC to chromatin is largely unaffected by these mutations. As reported in the manuscript, we do see some changes in the binding of MYC to chromatin when the HBM is mutated, but these are subtle, and trend in the same direction for both the 4A and VP16 mutants—excluding the MYC–HCF-1 interaction as being responsible. We thank the reviewer for challenging us to perform these experiments because they now provide a much more solid foundation for our statements that the mechanism through which MYC and HCF-1 function to control transcription is <italic>not</italic> at the level of co-recruitment.</p><p>Additionally, we have included a statement in the Discussion that this area needs further investigation. We also developed the discussion of how a similar &quot;recruitment independent&quot; precedent exists for HCF-1, and offer one possible scenario for how this could occur.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Does the 4A mutation disrupt any other known interactions of MYC with other proteins? Carrying out a proteomic screen using WT vs 4A could identify other candidates.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is conceptually similar to that laid out in reviewer #2 comment #2. It is possible that the 4A mutation disrupts interaction of MYC with multiple factors besides HCF-1. But it is precisely this concept that led us to implement a combined loss-of-function and gain-of-function approach in this study, and focusing on reciprocal changes that occur between the 4A and VP16 HBM mutants. This concept also underlies our use of HCF-1 depletion as a way of further anchoring our findings to the MYC–HCF-1 connection. If another factor is involved, it would have to be sensitive the 4A and VP16 mutations in exactly the same reciprocal way as HCF-1, and its functioning would need to be sensitive to HCF-1 depletion. Again, we cannot formally exclude this possibility, but our comprehensive approach meets—and I would argue exceeds—the contemporary standard for validation of MYC co-factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) All the experiments appear to be done using a single (EBV negative) BL line: Ramos. How broadly applicable is this interaction in terms of other lymphoma lines or tumor types?</p></disp-quote><p>That is correct; all of our experiments have been done in Ramos cells. Given all the work involved, it is not feasible to extend to other cell or tumor types in this study. But the reviewer makes an important point—we do not know if this interaction will extend to other tumor types. To address this comment, we have added a statement to the beginning of the introduction that makes this point clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What happens in the context of endogenous MYC? Is the HCF-MYC interaction still critical e.g. in normal B cells. This is particularly important to assess from a translational standpoint.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know. I agree this is important from a translational standpoint. But looking in normal Bcells, or indeed in other tumor types as mentioned above, clearly is beyond the scope of the present study. I note that we refer specifically to this point in both the first and the last paragraph of the Discussion and state that we do not know if a therapeutic window could be achieved if MYC is targeted via the HCF-1 interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Are there documented mutations in patients in the MBIV HBM region that could potentially be gain-of-function (i.e. similar to the VP16 HBM)?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. There are three examples listed in the COSMIC database in which the HBM of MYC is mutated. Interestingly, all three of these convert the &quot;QHYN&quot; of MYC to &quot;EHNY&quot;, which perfectly matches the high affinity HBM consensus. We now discuss this point in the last paragraph of the Discussion. We thank the reviewer for asking this provocative question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5: Was there a significant enrichment seen for canonical E-boxes? The NRF and Sp1 motifs are not particularly specific to MYC and I do not think that these sequences were found to bind MYC-MAX in the Blackwell et al. paper cited. Are the binding sites identified actually specific for dual binding by MYC and HCF1. In Figure 6, there is substantial overlap between gene expression changes in the tumor engraftment experiment when compared to the in vitro data. However, there are a lot of changes seen that are absent in the cell line. Is there a GO analysis for the in vivo specific signatures?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed earlier, we realize that we placed too much emphasis on the NRF-1 motif in the original version of the manuscript. We were simply reporting that it is enriched in our motif analysis of HCF-1 binding sites and that it is likely an E-box variant—which makes sense given that almost all the HCF-1 peaks are co-bound by MYC. Delving deeper into the significance of this variant or the quality of Eboxes in general in not warranted, especially now the we have ChIP-seq data demonstrating that MYC and HCF-1 bind chromatin independent of their ability to interact with one another. We went back and looked carefully at the Blackwell et al., paper and we were correct in our statement that the CATGCG motif is a MYC:MAX binding site. In that paper, they present both gel-shift analysis, as well as methylation interference analysis, which clearly shows binding to this site in vitro (the relevant probe is &quot;M18&quot; in Figures 2 and 3). In response to this comment, we have revised and simplified the text to avoid giving the wrong impression, and we have cited an additional three papers that establish the CATGCG motif as an authentic MYC binding motif.</p><p>In response to the question of whether there is a GO analysis for the in vivo specific signatures, these have now been added as Figure 7—figure supplement 1J and 1K.</p></body></sub-article></article>
