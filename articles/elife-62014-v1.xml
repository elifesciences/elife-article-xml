They channel nutrients and energy from the primary producers to higher trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cushing, 1975</xref>), support the development of larger organisms including commercially important fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaugrand et al., 2003</xref>), and form an important component of the biological carbon pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Steinberg and Landry, 2017</xref>). Many species of zooplankton are motile and propel themselves. Motility grants them the ability to navigate in the most favorable direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genin et al., 2005</xref>), to exploit their heterogeneous resource landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Menden-Deuer and Grünbaum, 2006</xref>), and to interact with other organisms, whether prey, mates, or predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagøien and Kiørboe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiørboe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gemmell et al., 2012</xref>). Motility in the zooplankton therefore mediates and governs processes that determine much of their individual fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiørboe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiørboe, 2011</xref>) and that influence the biological dynamics of the ecosystem at multiple scales. This has direct ramifications for global processes such as food web productivity and the cycling and export of carbon in the ocean.</p><p>The motion of zooplankton is shaped by the combination of their limited swimming abilities and the movement of the ambient fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McManus and Woodson, 2012</xref>). In marine and estuarine environments where turbulence is highly intermittent both spatially and temporally, plankton often experience large fluctuations in flow velocity that impose physical constraints on their locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michalec et al., 2015a</xref>) and that may therefore interfere with their ability to perform fundamental processes mediated by motility. Intuitively, it seems that an immediate ecological consequence of turbulence is a reduction in the individual and population fitness of plankton. Indeed, field studies show that zooplankton migrate downward to calmer layers when turbulence is strong at the surface of the ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Incze et al., 2001</xref>), presumably to maintain perception capabilities and swimming strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Visser et al., 2009</xref>). However, despite its ecological significance, the nature of the interactions between turbulence and plankton motility in terms of fitness remains largely unknown. This limits our understanding of the links between turbulence levels in the environment and the distribution of plankton populations in the water column. In addition, while earlier views have usually considered flow and motility as decoupled processes in their contributions to individual fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Visser et al., 2009</xref>), recent observations indicate that plankton can actively modulate their motion in response to turbulence to improve their survival in flowing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiBacco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Michalec et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs et al., 2018</xref>). This reflects the need to better integrate the multifaceted coupling between physical forcing and self-motility in plankton ecology. However, up to date, the importance of these interactions is not well understood, primarily because of the considerable challenge of tracking organisms swimming and interacting in three dimensions and in turbulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yen et al., 2008</xref>). These technical difficulties have hindered the development of models and the testing of theoretical approaches against real empirical data. Consequently, there are currently no models that take into account explicitly the coupling between turbulence and behavior and that have been validated via experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rothschild and Osborn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pécseli et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examine how turbulence affects the ability of calanoid copepods to find mates for reproduction. Calanoid copepods are the most abundant metazoans in the ocean and in estuaries, where they represent a pivotal component of the food web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaugrand et al., 2003</xref>). These small organisms reproduce sexually. This involves encounters between two organisms and therefore requires the quest for mates, an obviously challenging task in their dilute environment. Several behavioral strategies, known from studies conducted in calm water, improve mate finding in calanoid copepods. In species that use chemical communication for mating, females attract males from a distance by releasing pheromone trails that can persist for tens of seconds and extend several centimeters away from the female. Males detect and follow these trails, increasing their swimming velocity along the pheromone gradient until contact is made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katona, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doall et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagøien and Kiørboe, 2005</xref>). However, under conditions involving turbulence, pheromone trails are bound to elongate exponentially because of the incompressibility of the flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batchelor, 1952</xref>). They thin out rapidly, become too thin to be detectable, and break within seconds or less into disconnected filaments of concentrated cues separated by gaps with no detectable signal. Then, further mixing and molecular diffusion cause local variations of the odorant to vanish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shraiman and Siggia, 2000</xref>). A similar reasoning applies for species that release clouds of pheromones, which start to erode at very low intensities of turbulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kiørboe et al., 2005</xref>). Sexual dimorphism in swimming patterns represents the second behavioral strategy. Studies conducted in still water show that females have more convoluted trajectories, while males are generally more directionally persistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiørboe and Bagøien, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michalec et al., 2015a</xref>). The assumption is that this feature prevents resampling the same volume and therefore increases the probability for males to encounter females or the chemical signals they release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiørboe and Bagøien, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Visser and Kiørboe, 2006</xref>). However, this strategy is not likely to significantly increase mating probability in turbulence, because ambient flow redistributes zooplankton in space irrespectively of their movement patterns in calm hydrodynamic conditions, and sexual dimorphism in motion patterns disappears even in weak turbulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michalec et al., 2015a</xref>). Consequently, the mechanisms by which these widespread and ecologically fundamental organisms find mates for sexual reproduction in flowing environments remain unknown.</p><p>Using an advanced particle tracking technique that allows observing organisms moving and interacting in three dimensions, we present experimental measurements of the relative velocity and spatial distribution of calanoid copepods swimming in turbulence. Inspired by the phenomenology of droplet coalescence in the atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Falkovich et al., 2002</xref>), we quantify the separate contributions of organism motility and physical effects due to turbulence to encounters between mates. We show that two key conditions for mating in turbulence are met. Firstly, copepods reach the radius of perception at higher rates than in still conditions due to the contribution of turbulence and active motion. Secondly, they detect and pursue nearby organisms entering their radius of perception within the short time frame of the encounter. The distance at which directed motion toward nearby mates takes place is similar in calm water and in turbulence, which reveals the surprising ability of copepods to differentiate between the hydrodynamic signals generated by a nearby conspecific and the background noise generated by turbulence. This behavior is driven by males only and allows copepods to convert high encounter rates within the perception radius to frequent contacts between organisms, and therefore to maintain efficient mate finding even when turbulence is strong. We then show that contacts lead to actual mating. These results add to our understanding of plankton encounter rates in turbulence, where it is often assumed that after an initial increase, the number of successful encounters in turbulence decreases because of a decrease in perception distance and because of the inability of the organisms to react to each other within the short time frame of the encounter. This trend was first recognized in theoretical studies of fish larvae feeding on zooplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MacKenzie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiørboe and MacKenzie, 1995</xref>) and was later confirmed by laboratory and field data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacKenzie and Kiørboe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pécseli et al., 2019</xref>). Our results show that copepods are able to reach nearby individuals crossing their perception distance even in relatively strong turbulence, leading to contacts between mates and then to actual mating. We suggest that this behavioral mechanism provides copepods with evolutionary advantages in flowing environments. Building on our experimental data, we develop a semi-empirical model of plankton encounter rates that shows satisfactory quantitative agreement with our measurements. Our theoretical approach allows incorporating the influence of turbulent velocity differences, preferential concentration (due to the density, shape, and finite size of the organisms), and self-motility on the pairwise radial relative velocity and therefore on encounter rates down to the radius of perception. This study provides new insights on how zooplankton maintain fitness in dynamic environments. It illustrates how the coupling between plankton motility and the movement of the ambient fluid shapes fundamental biological processes at the base of the trophic network in aquatic ecosystems.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Flow parameters</title><p>We measure simultaneously the motion of the calanoid copepod <italic>Eurytemora affinis</italic> and neutrally buoyant flow tracers in a device generating homogeneous isotropic turbulence via two panels of counter-rotating disks located on its lateral sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (see Materials and methods for additional details).

We define an encounter as any event where two individuals are separated by less than 1 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This distance corresponds to approximately one body length of an adult <italic>E. affinis</italic> and is the minimal distance at which two closely interacting copepods with complex shape and motion could be tracked reliably. We stress that this minimal distance corresponds to the separation between the centroids of two adjacent copepods. This means that two organisms whose centroids are separated by 1 mm are actually colliding and that we are able to observe encounters down to contact events. For every copepod involved in an encounter, we measure the distance <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> between its actual position along the observed trajectory and the position of a virtual particle transported passively by the flow.

This reveals the intriguing ability of copepods to correctly identify the hydrodynamic signals generated by a conspecific among the background noise caused by turbulence. We note that the actual correlation length <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf110"><mml:msub><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> of the velocity gradients in turbulence is usually several times larger than the dimensional estimate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf111"><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishihara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pécseli et al., 2014</xref>). This means that directed motion within the perception radius actually takes place within or over distances comparable to the viscous subrange where the velocity field is smooth. Our results show that, in this region, an organism appears to be able to distinguish between the flow disturbances created by another organism as it swims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kiørboe et al., 2014</xref>) and the linear velocity gradients of turbulence within <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf112"><mml:msub><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. We also note that for turbulence intensities lower than that used in our measurements and often met in the water column under calm hydrodynamic conditions, all the encounter process takes place within the viscous subrange.</p><p>The inward motion of the male within the perception radius leads to contact between the two organisms of the pair. In some cases, this contact is brief and the male almost immediately disengages. We assume that this behavior occurs when the second organism is also a male. In other cases, the contact leads to mating. It was technically not feasible to resolve the motion of two individuals involved in mating via our automatic stereoscopic particle tracking technique. The reason is that once contact occurs, the two organisms often appear as overlapping pixel blobs in the images and consequently they are detected as a single particle during image segmentation. We however verified visually from the raw images that many mating events occurred and stereo-matched some of them by manually tracking the two organisms in the images. That is, we manually tracked the centroid of the two individuals in the images to avoid errors in the segmentation and plugged their pixels coordinates into the collinearity equations to obtain their three-dimensional coordinates via triangulation. We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> a representative mating event obtained in this way, where a female swimming actively against the streamlines crosses the perception radius of a male that in this case is passively advected by the flow. It is visible that reorientation of the male occurs immediately after detection, then the male reaches the female by jumping while the female attempts at escaping. Earlier studies conducted in calm water have shown that, after successfully following a pheromone trail, male copepods make a final lunge for the female upon detecting the hydrodynamic signals it generates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doall et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagøien and Kiørboe, 2005</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that this fast lunging motion also occurs in turbulence within the very short time frame of the encounter. Active swimming and turbulence advection bring copepods within their perception distance, then males convert encounters to contacts via immediate reorientation and directed motion and then to actual mating. In general, we observed that during mating the pursuit is brief and contact always occurs within the perception radius. In some cases, the female struggles to break free from the male via vigorous jumps but the male successfully hangs on to the female. In other cases, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the pair tumbles passively as it is advected by the turbulent flow. A large number of mating events similar to the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are visible in the image sequences, indicating that mating does occur frequently in turbulence.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The inward motion of males within the perception radius leads to contact and mating.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Trajectory of a male (red) and a female (green) mating in turbulence, and instantaneous flow field (blue cones) along their trajectories.

Effects due to inertia manifest themselves as the tendency of particles to distribute non-uniformly in turbulence. This phenomenon is referred to as <italic>preferential concentration</italic>. It can substantially increase the encounter rate of particles that have a different density from the carrier fluid and/or a finite size, because it causes particles that have comparable inertia to cluster in the same regions of the flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reade and Collins, 2000</xref>). Preferential concentration is mainly driven by small-scale dissipative eddies. It has been intensively studied because it relates to important environmental and industrial processes, for instance the formation of rain droplets or the combustion of sprays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Falkovich et al., 2002</xref>). The focus has generally been on particles that are much smaller than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf113"><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, the dissipative scale of the flow. Clustering is attributed to the centrifugation of small and heavy particles by turbulent vortices and their accumulation within regions of high strain rate outside the vortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sundaram and Collins, 1997</xref>). Large and heavy particles also tend to cluster in strain-dominated regions of the flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guala et al., 2008</xref>). On the opposite, small and light particles preferentially concentrate in regions of high vorticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fouxon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tagawa et al., 2012</xref>). Much less is known about particles such as copepods, with sizes larger than or comparable to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf114"><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and densities close to that of the fluid.

They also further confirm the absence of significant clustering observed experimentally in earlier studies with finite-size, neutrally buoyant particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiabane et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The lack of preferential concentration due to particle inertia reduces the geometric collision kernel to the clearance rate.</title><p>Correlation of the particle concentration versus the voxel separation distance <italic>r</italic>.

The minimal separation distance between voxels corresponds to the size of a copepod. The correlation remains very close to one for uniformly distributed tracers (red).

An interesting observation is that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf133"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝒙</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝒓</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is maximal in living copepods swimming in calm water and deviates from one at a further distance (approximately 8 mm) than in turbulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The behavioral mechanisms responsible for enhanced local concentration at larger spatial scales are unknown but are likely to include communication via pheromones trails, which allows males to locate and move toward females beyond their perception radius for hydrodynamic perturbations. Support for the contribution of olfactory orientation in still water comes from the observation of mating events involving pheromone trail-tracking behavior in <italic>E. affinis</italic>, both in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katona, 1973</xref>) and in our measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Predicting plankton encounter rates in turbulence</title><p>Encounter rates in the plankton are governed by several physical and biological processes: motility and transport by flow, which are single-organism properties, and interactions at short range that correlate the behavior of two otherwise independent organisms. Drawing an analogy with the collision of water droplets in clouds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Falkovich et al., 2002</xref>), the contributions of these processes are captured in the collision kernel, which can itself be decomposed into the product of the geometric collision kernel <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf134"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and the collision efficiency.

The model takes into account the contributions of turbulence and organism motility and predicts the mean inward pairwise radial relative velocity <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf140"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟨</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo lspace="2.5pt" rspace="2.5pt">∣</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, from which it is possible to estimate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf141"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟨</mml:mo><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and therefore <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf142"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for <italic>r</italic> equal to or above the perception radius. The model builds on experimental data to derive a general framework that can be applied to other species with intermittent motion. Being semi-empirical, it does not rely on certain assumptions that are common to most existing theoretical formulations, for instance that organisms have a constant ballistic or diffusive motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Visser and Kiørboe, 2006</xref>). The model only requires empirical quantities that are easy to measure, ensuring its applicability beyond the species and experimental conditions considered in this work. Another highlight of our approach compared to existing formulations is that it takes into account the contribution of clustering in driving encounters.

Indeed, many species of zooplankton, from calanoid copepods to cladocerans, swim by alternating periods of slow cruising motion with frequent relocation jumps. In calanoid copepods, the slow forward motion derives from the creation of feeding currents accomplished by the high-frequency vibration of the cephalic appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kiørboe et al., 2014</xref>). Relocation jumps originate from the repeated beating of the swimming legs and result in sequences of high velocity bursts leading to an intermittent motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang and Kiørboe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Michalec et al., 2017</xref>).

Previous estimations of plankton encounter rates in turbulence are based on theoretical formulations that often require adjusting free parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pécseli et al., 2014</xref>), whereas our model is semi-empirical. It also avoids relying on simplified assumptions, for instance on the movement patterns of the organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Visser and Kiørboe, 2006</xref>). It requires only knowledge of the probability density function of the velocity in calm water, which is readily accessible experimentally. Therefore, we expect our model to remain valid for organisms displaying a wide range of motility patterns, allowing accurate predictions when studying mating, predation, and resource exploitation in the plankton.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results identify the physical and behavioral mechanisms that enable calanoid copepods, tiny crustaceans that dominate the zooplankton biomass and represent the most abundant metazoans in the ocean and estuaries, to maintain efficient mate finding when ambient flow challenges their limited swimming abilities and impairs motion strategies and olfactory orientation. We have previously shown that certain copepods increase their swimming activity in turbulence by performing more frequent relocation jumps that appear uncorrelated to localized flow signals and that persist in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Michalec et al., 2017</xref>). While jumping, they reach velocities that are larger than the turbulent velocity in typical oceanic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamazaki and Squires, 1996</xref>). The ecological significance of these jumps remains unknown. A more vigorous motility in turbulence may allow copepods to depart from the underlying flow streamlines, to transition from being passively transported by the flow to being able of directed motion, and to navigate in the water column in spite of the physical constraints that turbulence imposes on their motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genin et al., 2005</xref>). Swimming vigorously may also permit copepods to retain the fitness advantages provided by motility in terms of inter-individual interactions.</p><p>We study this important aspect of plankton ecology in the context of mating and show that self-locomotion indeed creates large differences in the inward component of the pairwise radial relative velocity of copepods. This directly results in high encounter rates at separation distances comparable to the spatial extend of the flow field they generate while swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kiørboe et al., 2014</xref>). A second mechanism, mediated by males only and consisting of directed motion toward neighbor organisms within the perception radius, allows copepods to convert the high encounter rate provided by active motion in turbulence into actual contact events within the short time frame of the encounter. Rheotaxis toward nearby organisms within the perception radius occurs both in calm water and in turbulence, which reveals the ability of copepods to correctly identify the flow signals generated by a conspecific amid the background noise of turbulence. The combination of these two behavioral mechanisms with turbulent advection results in an encounter rate that is substantially larger than that resulting from passive transport in turbulence, as evidenced by a clearance rate ratio <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf211"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟨</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟨</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> at short separations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The encounter rate in turbulence is also comparable to or even larger than that achieved by active motion in calm hydrodynamic conditions, where swimming strategies and olfactory orientation are possible. We note that the large encounter rate of copepods swimming in turbulence originates primarily from their active motion and not from the contribution of turbulence.

This indicates that being passively transported by the flow does not increase encounter rates beyond those achieved by motility in calm hydrodynamic conditions for organisms and turbulent velocities comparable to those considered in this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rothschild and Osborn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Visser et al., 2009</xref>). It requires active swimming for copepods to achieve an encounter rate that is comparable to or even larger than in calm water.</p><p>These results are significant because they provide empirical evidence that two key conditions for mating in turbulence are met. Firstly, the combination of active swimming and turbulent velocity differences increases the flux of organisms within the perception radius, thereby enhancing encounter rates. This mechanism has been extensively studied and is now well established in oceanography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MacKenzie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewis and Pedley, 2000</xref>). Secondly, copepods are able to convert high encounter rates to contact events by directed motion within the short time frame of the encounter. By manually extending the trajectories of the two individuals of the pair after the time of contact, we provide evidence that mating occurs after contact is made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Theoretical studies on the capture success of larval fish feeding on zooplankton indicate that strong turbulence reduces feeding rates below those achieved in calmer conditions because of a decrease in the probability of successful pursuit once an encounter has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MacKenzie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiørboe and MacKenzie, 1995</xref>). These pioneering studies, together with conclusive evidences for mate-tracking behavior from measurements conducted in calm water, have shaped our present understanding of copepod mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doall et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagøien and Kiørboe, 2005</xref>). It has long been assumed that copepods are evolved to mate in relatively quiet waters, although this was never confirmed. Our empirical results add to our knowledge on this fundamental issue. They suggest that reproduction is not restricted to temporal and spatial windows of calm hydrodynamic conditions, such as close to the pycnocline in the stratified ocean or during the tidal current reversal associated with the absence of flow in estuaries, where motility strategies and olfactory orientation that have been observed in calm water may remain significant and where the effect of turbulence on pursuit success is not strong enough to negate the increase in encounter rates. The ability for efficient mate finding even in relatively strong turbulence relaxes the boundaries between quiescent and turbulent conditions in terms of plankton fitness. It suggests that copepods have adapted to the heterogeneous hydrodynamic conditions that they experience in their dynamic environment, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf214"><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> can vary over six orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamazaki and Squires, 1996</xref>). This finding has large implications for our understanding of copepod ecology and of the relationships between turbulence intensity in the environment and the fitness of copepod populations.</p><p>Developing realistic models of plankton encounter rates in turbulence is challenging because of the complex coupling between flow and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boffetta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pécseli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardeshiri et al., 2017</xref>) and because the validity of theoretical approaches has seldom been tested empirically due to the difficulties in tracking organisms swimming and interacting in three dimensions and in turbulence. The first model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rothschild and Osborn, 1988</xref>) derives from a formulation that considers organisms swimming independently in random direction and in calm water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerritsen and Strickler, 1977</xref>). It introduces the contribution of turbulence to encounter rates by superposing squared velocity differences on top of organism motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rothschild and Osborn, 1988</xref>). However, particles and plankton move in the same coherent small-scale eddy at short separation distances corresponding to the radius of perception. A number of investigations have suggested improvements to this pioneering theoretical framework. In particular, they have considered the correlation of the flow velocity as the separation distance decreases, as well as the influence of the perception capabilities of the organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiørboe and MacKenzie, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewis and Pedley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pécseli et al., 2014</xref>). These models have allowed oceanographers to study the implications of turbulence-enhanced contact rates on grazing, predation, and optimal strategies in the plankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MacKenzie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lewis and Pedley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lewis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Visser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pécseli et al., 2019</xref>) and they often show good agreement between analytical results and field or laboratory data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pécseli et al., 2019</xref>). In this work, we provide a complete semi-empirical formulation for the geometric collision kernel <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf215"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for <italic>r</italic> above or equal to the perception radius that shows satisfactory quantitative agreement with our empirical data. The model deviates from previous formulations in that it uses as a starting point the probability density function of the magnitude of the velocity of the organisms in still fluid, from which it is possible to recover their pairwise radial relative velocity in turbulence. It does not rely on simplifying assumptions that are common in encounter rate models, for instance that the organisms move by cruising or by alternating pauses and periods of active swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MacKenzie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiørboe and MacKenzie, 1995</xref>). It also accounts for the effects of turbulence on behavior. Indeed, certain species of zooplankton react to specific flow signals in their environment. They can sense and respond to hydrodynamic forces by modulating their swimming activity and velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Michalec et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs et al., 2018</xref>). Their interactions with turbulence therefore include active behavioral responses in addition to physical effects due to the forces exerted by the flow. The model incorporates these indirect effects via the parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf216"><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, the fraction of time that a copepod is jumping. Therefore, our approach allows predicting encounter rates for different species that have different velocity distributions and different responses to turbulence. The model draws an analogy with the collision of water droplets in clouds. It considers the contribution of motility and turbulence in the pairwise radial relative velocity between copepods to predict the flux of organisms within the perception radius. It allows accounting for clustering effects due to particle density, shape, and finite size, since applications to cases where preferential concentration is significant is straightforward via the contribution of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf217"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf218"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>The second term of the collision kernel, termed the collision efficiency, provides corrections to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf219"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> that account for interactions between organisms at <italic>r</italic> below the range of validity of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf220"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, that is, for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf221"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> mm within the clearance volume. From a modeling perspective, an exhaustive estimation of the collision kernel can be achieved by multiplying the rate at which two organisms cross their radius of hydrodynamic interactions, given by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf222"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> mm), with the probability of successful contact following inward motion at shorter range, captured in the collision efficiency. It was however not possible to quantify the collision efficiency from our measurements at the same degree of accuracy because of the difficulties of resolving interactions between organisms at very small spatial scale while recording their motion in a much larger volume. Foreseen detailed observations within the radius of hydrodynamic interaction will allow quantifying the ability of male copepods to make contact with females when both the velocity gradients of turbulence and the escape reaction of females may oppose their inward motion. They will also provide additional information on the impacts of turbulence on the perception capabilities of copepods and on their consequences on the perception radius and therefore encounter rates. Very little information is currently available on this important issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lewis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pécseli and Trulsen, 2016</xref>). However, we show here that the perception distance is similar in calm water and in turbulence, as suggested by males moving inward, starting at the same separation distance (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf223"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> mm). Therefore, the perception capability appears to be relatively unaffected for this species, and we can already anticipate that the encounter rate will not vary substantially.</p><p>A fundamental determinant of the life of plankton is the interplay between organism behavior and turbulence, a prevalent feature of their environment. Our observation of a physical and behavioral coupling mechanism that sustains efficient mate finding in copepods amid ambient fluid motion, together with recent reports on the behavioral adaptations evolved by other zooplankton to enhance survival in turbulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiBacco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs et al., 2018</xref>), illustrates the implications of this coupling in terms of organism fitness and how it influences or even governs important biological processes at the base of the trophic network. We suggest that the ability of copepods to find mates in turbulence enables them to thrive in energetic ecosystems and has contributed to their formidable evolutionary success and widespread distribution in marine, coastal, and estuarine environments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plankton cultures</title><p>Our model species is the calanoid copepod <italic>Eurytemora affinis</italic>. This species complex includes a number of genetically divergent but morphologically similar populations inhabiting estuaries, lakes, salt marshes, and the Baltic Sea. It often dominates the mesozooplankton community in the low-to-medium salinity zone of most temperate estuaries, where it represents an important component of the food web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mouny and Dauvin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimmel and Roman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Devreker et al., 2010</xref>). We used organisms from our plankton rearing facility at Lille University. The cultures originate from individuals sampled in September 2014 from the oligohaline zone of the Seine Estuary (France). Copepods were grown in aerated 300 L containers at a temperature of 18°C, at salinity 15 (sterilized seawater from the English Channel adjusted to salinity with deionized water), and under a fluorescent light cycle of 12L:12D. They were fed with the micro-algae <italic>Rhodomonas baltica</italic> and <italic>Isochrisis galbana</italic> cultured in autoclaved seawater at salinity 30, in Conway medium, under a 12L:12D light cycle, and at a temperature of 18°C.

Measurements were conducted in October 2017, within a few days after shipment, and after acclimation of the copepods to the new laboratory conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Experimental setup</title><p>We recorded the motion of copepods and flow tracers by means of three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry. This technique identifies and follows individual particles in time and provides a Lagrangian description of their motion in three dimensions. It was originally developed to measure velocity and velocity gradients along tracer trajectories in turbulent flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malik et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lüthi, 2002</xref>), and we have previously applied it to study the swimming behavior of small aquatic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Michalec et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidler et al., 2017</xref>). The recording system was composed of four synchronized Mikrotron EoSens cameras. Three cameras were equipped with red band-pass filters and recorded the motion of fluorescent tracer particles from one side of the aquarium. The fourth camera was equipped with a green band-pass filter and mounted in front of an image splitter, which is an optical arrangement that allows stereoscopic imaging using one single camera. This camera recorded the motion of copepods from the opposite side of the aquarium. The cameras were fitted with Nikon 60 mm lenses and recorded on two <italic>DVR Express Core 2</italic> devices (IO Industries) at 200 Hz and at a resolution of 1280 by 1024 pixels. Illumination was provided by a pulsed laser (wavelength of 527 nm, pulse energy of 60 mJ) operating at 5 KHz. The aquarium was 27 cm (width) by 18 cm (depth) by 17 cm (height) and contained a forcing device creating homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoyer et al., 2005</xref>). The flow was forced by two arrays of four counter-rotating disks located on the lateral sides of the aquarium. The disks were 40 mm in diameter and smooth to prevent mechanical damage to the copepods. They were driven by a servomotor through a fixed gear chain mounted on top of the aquarium and they rotated at the same rate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Recording conditions</title><p>We restricted our measurements to a 6 cm (height) by 6 cm (width) by 2 cm (depth) volume centered in the middle of the aquarium, midway between the disks, where the turbulence is almost homogeneous and isotropic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoyer et al., 2005</xref>).

The mean distance between tracers was approximately 1.5 mm, yielding a spatial resolution of about 3 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf229"><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. We checked copepods for integrity under a microscope and selected healthy individuals only. For each measurement, we transferred copepods (size fraction above 300 µm, corresponding to adults and late-stage copepodites) into the aquarium, and allowed them to acclimate for 30 min. The fraction of males, females and copepodites was made roughly similar during the sorting. The number density was approximately one individual per cubic cm. This density is on the upper range of values observed in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Devreker et al., 2008</xref>). This allowed to record many copepods in the investigation volume and to obtain statistically robust quantities even at short separation distances. We recorded the motion of copepods and tracer particles in still water and in turbulence. For each condition, we conducted two measurements, using new individuals from the cultures. Each sequence lasted 5 min. The sequences in turbulence were preceded by an additional minute with the disks spinning, for the copepods to acclimate to turbulence and for the flow to reach statistical stationarity. Water temperature increased from 18°C to 19°C at the end of the recording. We conducted the same measurements using dead copepods to account for the effects of particle size and density. We obtained 10,643,329 and 7,535,728 data points for living copepods in calm water and turbulence, respectively, and 18,606,682 data points for inert carcasses in turbulence.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Particle tracking and trajectory processing</title><p>We calibrated the cameras using a calibration block on which reference points of known coordinates are evenly distributed along the three directions, and performed an additional dynamic calibration based on the images of moving particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liberzon et al., 2012</xref>). Knowing the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, we established correspondences between particle image coordinates and retrieved the three-dimensional positions of the moving particles by forward intersection. We tracked tracers and copepods using an algorithm based on image and object space information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Willneff, 2003</xref>). We connected broken trajectory segments by applying a predictive algorithm that uses the position, velocity, and acceleration of the particles along their trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Michalec et al., 2017</xref>). Trajectories were smoothed with a third-order polynomial filter, and the velocity of the particles was directly estimated from the coefficients of the polynomial. The width of the filter was set to 21 points, corresponding to approximately half of the Kolmogorov time scale. This value represents a good compromise between improving the measurement of the velocity and preserving the features of the data, especially the strong velocity fluctuations that result from the intermittent motion of copepods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Michalec et al., 2015b</xref>).

find mates in a turbulent environment, a major question in marine science. Through comprehensive experiments and models the authors demonstrate that mating occurs despite turbulence and that turbulence facilitates encounters. Animals are brought close to one another by the underlying flow; when a male perceives a potential mate, it achieves contact by direct and vigorous swimming. Perception occurs within 4 mm from the potential mate, and, intriguingly, this range is similar in calm and turbulent environments, suggesting copepods sensory systems are insensitive to turbulence.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Efficient mate finding in planktonic copepods swimming in turbulence&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The manuscript addresses the ability of copepods to find mates in a turbulent environment, a major question in marine science. The authors investigate the encounter rates by experimentally monitoring alive and dead copepods in a turbulent flow and model their individual trajectories. These are interesting data and a robust modelling methodology which merits publication, however we find that the level of biological insight provided by this work is not sufficient to grant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. There is a long literature about encounter rates of copepods in turbulent environment, including by these authors, and the overall picture is largely consistent with the author's findings. The main novelty of the present manuscript is the focus on mating.</p><p>However, the authors do not currently monitor actual mating events.</p><p>Documenting mating is especially important because it is not clear whether these animals do mate at such high turbulence intensity. In fact, trace following behavior by males suggests these animals may be adapted to mate at low turbulence levels (although this remains to be proven).</p><p>If the authors were able to distinguish males from females, the experiments may be adapted to documenting the actual mating between individuals. We would welcome such a study that fills a void in current knowledge, and would consider it as a new submission as this entirely changes the focus of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses an important aspect of marine science. Copepods are the most abundant metazoan on the planet and play an important role in recycling organic matter and in passing organic matter to higher trophic levels. The aim of this paper was to model the encounter rates of copepods in a turbulent environment and test the model by observing the interaction of copepods (Eurytemora affinis) in a turbulent field.</p><p>I have several fundamental issues with the manuscript that makes it not publishable in its current form. There are some small copy editing aspects that will also need to be addressed. I did not list them here since I assume the manuscript will be rewritten.</p><p>The theoretical approach is not novel. Gerritsen and Stickler (1977) modeled encounter rates of copepod based on their relative swimming speeds. Osborn and Rothshild, 1988 added turbulence to the equation. Since then (nearly 30 years ago) there have been updates to the models including the effects of turbulence on the perceptive field. Most study have assumed a parabolic shape of encounter success with increased turbulence. The initial rise in the encounter rate is due to the added relative velocity due to turbulence. The decrease in successful encounter at high turbulence is driven initially by the decrease in perception distance and then, at very high turbulence levels, by the inability of the copepods to react to each other within the short time frame of the encounter. The model shown in this study does not appear to advance our current understanding of how turbulence may enhance or diminish mating in copepods.</p><p>The authors state that &quot; We study this important yet unexplored aspect of plankton ecology in the context of mating and show that self-locomotion creates large differences in the inward component of the pairwise radial relative velocity of copepods, which directly results in larger encounter rates at separation distances comparable to the spatial extend (this should be extent) of the flow field they generate while swimming (Kiorboe et al., 2014)&quot;</p><p>This is simply not true. There is a rich history in the literature of looking at the effects of turbulence on the encounter rate of copepods. While not all of the work deals specifically with mating, it is described as encounter rate, or capture volume as the authors have done in this study.</p><p>In terms of the biological experiments in which copepods were observed and tracked in a turbulent regime, I have 2 suggestions that would make this manuscript stronger.</p><p>1) It would be valuable to quantify the ability of male copepods to actually grab and mate with female copepods under different levels of turbulence. Currently based on Figures 1-4 it is unclear if males and females were individually identified. This is important because females don't track males or other females. Only the males do the mate tracking. It also remains unclear if the males actually grabbed on to the females and mated or did they just get close to each other in the video? If the authors can identify the females and males in the video (using swimming patterns), the number of successful mating events could be quantified. This would be valuable data.</p><p>2) I am concerned about the level of turbulence used in this study. The copepods used in this study are on the order of 1.2 mm. The Kolmogorov length scale used in this study was 0.450 mm. The time scale was 0.2s. These turbulence levels are extremely high – not just at the high end of ocean turbulence. These levels are on the order of a tidal bore. The supplementary figure (Appendix 1—figure 3) shows a male copepod tracking a female's chemical trail. This mate tracking behavior suggests that these copepods are evolved to mate in relatively quiet waters. The length scales shown in this figure define a volume of 100 mls. At the turbulence levels used in this study, the eddy size would be 0.045<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> or 0.091 nanoliters. This is a tiny volume. At this level the trails laid by the female would be destroyed. The experiments need to be done at more moderate levels of turbulence to be realistic for this species.</p><p>Finally as a closing comment – the capture volume of copepods in turbulence is linearly related to the swimming speed of the copepods and the added speed caused by turbulence (Rothschild and Osborn). However the encounter rate is exponentially related to the perceptive distance. This has a huge impact of the ability of copepods to find each other. Currently, not much is known about the effects of turbulence on the mechano-receptive or chemo-receptive abilities of copepods. However it is likely that they are impacted by turbulence. Since the encounter rate is so highly dependent on this parameter is difficult to model the outcome without a kernel that parameterizes it impact.</p><p>Gerritsen, J. and Strickler, J. R.

The study is based on a combination of analytical models and careful experimental studies. It is found that copepods have an enhanced encounter rate in turbulent environments compared to than in calm waters. The conclusion is consistent with a number of related investigations dealing with encounters in turbulence. The topic of the study is thus not entire new, but the methods and results are well described and add to the existing knowledge in the field. As far as I can see, the paper is giving adequate credit to previous studies. I can, in principle, recommend publication of the paper, but have some comments for the authors. Some need their attention, and some I think should be considered.</p><p>1) Figure 1 needs attention. The caption mentions some cones, that I do not find, please clarify. The figure contains &quot;blur&quot; in blue colour: I presume this should represent turbulence? It is not explained. In part due to this blue colour, the colour coding of the trajectories becomes unclear: I had to enlarge the figure significantly to see this. Of course any reader can do the same, but only in the electronic version. The figure is important in my opinion, so it deserves more attention. Figure 1C has interesting information, this comes out quite clearly.</p><p>2) The authors discuss finite inertia of the copepods (an entire section is devoted to this) but not much their finite size which is mentioned only in bypassing, e.g. caption of Appendix 1—figure 1. It seems to me that organisms are discussed as being point particles. The mass density of copepods is not much different from that of water, after all, but the finite size can be important and have been discussed in the literature. Finite size effects may not be dramatic for spherical particles, but elongated ones are likely to cluster in turbulent flows (this is actually consistent with results given by the black symbols for dead copepods in Figure 4). The authors refer to comparisons of measurements for dead and live copepods, but it is not clear how they make use of this information. I agree though that the finite-size information is present in this measurement.</p><p>3) I would have expected the elongation of pheromone traces due to turbulence to be important. Indeed, it is mentioned in the Introduction. Since the flow is incompressible, the volume of a trace is constant, and since it elongates (nearly exponentially, e.g. Batchelor, &quot;The effect of homogeneous turbulence on material lines and surfaces&quot;, Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A 213, 349 (1952)) it must thin out quite rapidly and some places be too thin to be detectable. The pheromone traces will in reality break-up into several smaller ones. I would have expected discussions like this to take more place. The authors might consider the point?</p><p>4) As far as I can see, it is assumed that copepods will encounter as soon as they enter within a suitably defined &quot;region of interaction&quot;, this is how I read the discussion of Figure 1B, for instance. MacKenzie et al.,. &quot;Evidence for a dome-shaped relationship between turbulence and larval fish ingestion rates&quot;, Limnol. Oceanogr. 39, 1790 (1994) have argued that even in case two organisms come within a contact range, it might still happen that turbulent motions separate them again to reduce the probability of an ultimate encounter. It seems that this model has found some support (Pecseli et al. &quot;Feeding of plankton in turbulent oceans and lakes&quot;, Limnol. Oceanogr. 64, 1034 (2019)). Can this scenario have some bearing for the authors problem?</p><p>5) Finally, although the disposition of the paper is good, it is at places difficult to read (at least for me). Some sentences can be very long, often over 3 or more lines of text. It might be advisable to go through the manuscript once more and break up such long sentences.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>We have asked the opinion of a third reviewer, and the discussion reached the same conclusion as the original peer review. Specifically, all reviewers agree that both the model and the data are of great quality and advance the state of the art. However, as you also note in your appeal letter, the results demonstrate that males attempt at reaching other individuals, but there is no evidence that mating or even contact actually occurs.</p><p>The relevance of the findings for the biology of copepods hinges on the assumption that mating eventually occurs. We would be thrilled to reconsider this work as a new submission if you were to provide evidence to support this assumption.</p><p>The rest of the comments in the individual reviews were attached to help you improve the work, but were individual viewpoints of the reviewers and not shared not crucial for the decision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper reports on a study on the encounter dynamics of planktonic copepods in turbulent flows. It presents state-of-the-art measurements on the simultaneous tracking of copepods and fluid tracers in turbulence, which allow to assess the approaching velocity of copepods pairs down to a scale of 1mm (approximately one body length). The average properties of the approaching process are interpreted by means of an empirical statistical model.

In the preset setup the simultaneous tracking of copepods and fluid tracers could in principle allow to characterize the turbulence in the vicinity of a copepod.</p><p>In the light of the limitation at point 2), I judge the article not suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have overcome the limitation of our previous automated tracking approach by manually tracking individuals in contact with each other and we now provide the requested evidence. We have included a new figure (Figure 4 in the revised manuscript) showing a complete mating event in turbulence. The figure shows the sequence of steps leading to mating: the independent motion of the two copepods and the advection by the flow that together bring individuals within their perception radius, the detection of the female by the male, the immediate reorientation of the male, the pursuit, the capture, and finally the tumbling behavior that occurs when the male attempts at transferring its spermatophore. Together with the observation of many mating events in the original image sequences, this figure supports the assumption that copepods do mate efficiently in turbulence. We believe that this new figure completely addresses the concern of the first and third reviewer.

Gerritsen and Stickler (1977) modeled encounter rates of copepod based on their relative swimming speeds. Osborn and Rothshild, 1988 added turbulence to the equation. Since then (nearly 30 years ago) there have been updates to the models including the effects of turbulence on the perceptive field. Most study have assumed a parabolic shape of encounter success with increased turbulence. The initial rise in the encounter rate is due to the added relative velocity due to turbulence. The decrease in successful encounter at high turbulence is driven initially by the decrease in perception distance and then, at very high turbulence levels, by the inability of the copepods to react to each other within the short time frame of the encounter. The model shown in this study does not appear to advance our current understanding of how turbulence may enhance or diminish mating in copepods.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very familiar with the pioneering work of Rothschild and Osborn (1988) and with its limitations. The study of Rothschild and Osborn (1988) builds on the previous work by Gerritsen and Strickler (1977) who studied the encounter rates of species that move independently in random directions and for which the velocity magnitude follows a given distribution. Rothschild and Osborn (1988) introduced turbulent velocity difference on top of organism motion. They used squared velocity difference instead of the radial component of the difference, which is a non-rigorous approximation since particles (and plankton) move in the same coherent small-scale eddy. Therefore, the work of Rothschild and Osborn (1988) is applicable only for the species that was considered by Gerritsen and Strickler (1977) and is accurate by an order of magnitude only. Our work builds on real biological data to offer a model that is accurate up to approx. 20 % in terms of encounter rate and that can be applied to a wide range of species because it only requires knowledge of the probability density function of the magnitude of the velocity in calm water, which is straightforward to obtain empirically. Given the large offset we had opted not to include the references to Rothschild and Osborn (1988) and Gerritsen and Strickler (1977) in the submitted manuscript. We recognize now from the comments of the reviewer that this was not the best strategy and have included a note on these pioneering studies in the revised manuscript. We have also added references to earlier studies that have built on the work of Rothschild and Osborn (1988) and Gerritsen and Strickler (1977). More specifically, we wrote:</p><p>&quot;The first model (Rothschild and Osborn 1988) derives from a formulation that considers organisms swimming independently in random direction and in calm water (Gerritsen and Strickler 1977). […] These models have allowed oceanographers to study the implications of turbulence-enhanced contact rates on grazing, predation, and optimal strategies in the plankton (MacKenzie et al., 1994; Lewis and Pedley, 2001, Lewis, 2003; Visser et al., 2009; Pécseli et al., 2019) and they often show good agreement between analytical results and field or laboratory data (Pécseli et al., 2019).&quot;</p><p>We are also very familiar with the dome-shaped relationship between turbulence intensity and capture rates. It is often assumed that, after an initial increase, the number of successful encounters in turbulence decreases because of a decrease in perception distance and because of the inability of the organisms to react to each other within the short time frame of the encounter. This trend was first recognized in theoretical studies of fish larvae feeding on zooplankton and was later confirmed by laboratory and field data. We have added two notes on this specific point in the revised manuscript and we have also included more relevant bibliography (in the Introduction and in the Results and Discussion section). However, our results show that (a) calanoid copepods are capable to detect and pursue nearby organisms entering their reactive zone even in relatively strong turbulence and within the short time frame of the encounter, and (b) that the distance at which inward motion between nearby organisms takes place is similar in calm water and turbulence, which reveals the surprising ability of copepods to differentiate between the hydrodynamic signals generated by a nearby conspecific and the background noise generated by turbulence. These results are in sharp contrast with the comment of the reviewer. We believe that our results add substantially to our understanding or plankton encounter rates in turbulence. This information is now mentioned in the manuscript.</p><p>In addition, our model includes not only the contribution of organism motility and turbulent velocity fluctuations in encounter rates, but also the contribution of preferential concentration due to organism density, finite size, and elongated shape, via the term 𝑔(𝑟) in the geometric collision kernel 𝐾(𝑟) = 𝛾(𝑟)𝑔(𝑟). Therefore, our model is more complete than earlier formulations that have neglected the coupling between small-scale eddies and the inertia and shape of the organisms. Our model is directly applicable to species for which inertia and shape result in clustering, allowing accurate predictions when studying predation, interactions, and resource exploitation in the plankton. This information is given in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors state that &quot;We study this important yet unexplored aspect of plankton ecology in the context of mating and show that self-locomotion creates large differences in the inward component of the pairwise radial relative velocity of copepods, which directly results in larger encounter rates at separation distances comparable to the spatial extend (this should be extent) of the flow field they generate while swimming (Kiorboe et al., 2014).&quot; This is simply not true. There is a rich history in the literature of looking at the effects of turbulence on the encounter rate of copepods. While not all of the work deals specifically with mating, it is described as encounter rate, or capture volume as the authors have done in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We entirely agree with the reviewer that there is a rich literature on the effects of turbulence on the encounter rates of plankton. It was not our intention to claim priority on this issue and we have modified the text accordingly. However, to our knowledge, most of the work relevant to our study (encounter rates between organisms of similar swimming capabilities, therefore excluding studies on copepods feeding on microalgae) are theoretical or numerical, and none have addressed the specific case of mating. We have nevertheless added references to earlier studies in the revised version of the manuscript (in the Introduction and in the Results and Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be valuable to quantify the ability of male copepods to actually grab and mate with female copepods under different levels of turbulence. Currently based on Figures 1-4 it is unclear if males and females were individually identified. This is important because females don't track males or other females. Only the males do the mate tracking. It also remains unclear if the males actually grabbed on to the females and mated or did they just get close to each other in the video? If the authors can identify the females and males in the video (using swimming patterns), the number of successful mating events could be quantified. This would be valuable data.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that it is important to demonstrate that males actually engage in mating. In the first version of the manuscript, while we demonstrated that males attempted at reaching nearby individuals within the perception distance, there was no evidence that mating actually occurred. We have overcome the limitation of our previous automated tracking approach by manually tracking individuals in contact with each other. We now provide evidence that inward motion leads to contacts and that contacts lead to mating. We have prepared a new figure (Figure 4 in the revised manuscript) showing a complete mating event in turbulence. The figure shows the sequence of steps leading to mating: the independent motion of the two copepods and the advection by the flow that together bring individuals within their perception radius, the detection of the female by the male, the immediate reorientation of the male, the pursuit, the capture, and finally the tumbling behavior that occurs when the male attempts at transferring its spermatophore.

We document both the flux of organisms around swimming copepods for different perception distances and the behavioral response that correlates the motion of two organisms once motility and turbulence bring them in close proximity. We were able to resolve interactions between organisms up to contact events, for thousands of events, and we also show in the new Figure 4 that inward motion leads to contacts and that organisms engage in actual mating. Our manuscript now combines results obtained via an automatic particle tracking technique that allows us to obtain previously unavailable data at very high degree of statistical reliability and up to contact between organisms, with qualitative data that proves that contact leads to mating.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I am concerned about the level of turbulence used in this study. The copepods used in this study are on the order of 1.2 mm. The Kolmogorov length scale used in this study was 0.450 mm. The time scale was 0.2s. These turbulence levels are extremely high – not just at the high end of ocean turbulence. These levels are on the order of a tidal bore. The supplementary figure (Appendix 1—figure 3) shows a male copepod tracking a female's chemical trail. This mate tracking behavior suggests that these copepods are evolved to mate in relatively quiet waters. The length scales shown in this figure define a volume of 100 mL. At the turbulence levels used in this study, the eddy size would be 0.045<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> or 0.091 nanoliters. This is a tiny volume. At this level the trails laid by the female would be destroyed. The experiments need to be done at more moderate levels of turbulence to be realistic for this species.</p></disp-quote><p>A large body of literature indicates that the level of turbulence used in our measurements is representative of the hydrodynamic conditions experienced by <italic>Eurytemora affinis</italic> and many other species of copepods in their estuarine and coastal habitats where most of the turbulence comes from tidal forcing (Schmitt et al., 2011; MacMillan et al., 2016; Tu et al., 2019; Ross et al., 2019). The turbulence level is also well within the range considered in previous laboratory and theoretical studies of plankton motion in turbulence (e.g., Yen et al., 2008).

Previous empirical studies on copepod mating have already considered encounters in calm water. The case of mating in turbulence was never investigated, primarily because of the difficulties of resolving the motion of plankton swimming in three dimensions, in turbulence, and at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. The hydrodynamic conditions in these studies are very different from those experienced by copepods in their environment, where turbulence can very over six orders of magnitude (Yamazaki and Squires, 1996). Consequently, most of what we know about the ability of copepods to find mates and reproduce derives from observations conducted in flow conditions that are not always environmentally relevant. Empirical evidence for mate-tracking behavior in calm hydrodynamic conditions has shaped the present understanding of plankton ecology for decades (e.g., the seminal work of Yen et al., 1998 and Bagøien and Kiørboe, 2005) and has led some oceanographers to assume that copepods are evolved to mate in relatively quiet waters and are unable to mate in turbulence, although this was never confirmed.</p><p>Our empirical results show, for the first time, that this vision is largely incomplete. They suggest that reproduction in copepods is not restricted to spatial and temporal windows of low turbulence intensity, which differs from what the community has assumed over the past two decades. The ability of copepods to find mates efficiently in turbulence relaxes the boundaries between quiescent and turbulent conditions in terms of individual fitness, and suggests that copepods are well adapted to the intermittent hydrodynamic conditions that they experience in their dynamic environment. This finding has large implications for our understanding of copepod ecology and of the relationships between turbulence intensity in the environment and the fitness of copepod populations. This information is given in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Therefore, we do not agree with the reviewer that measurements should be conducted in calmer conditions. Such measurements would repeat previous studies, including our own (e.g., Yen et al., 1998; Bagøien and Kiørboe, 2005; Dur et al., 2011). They would provide information that is already well known, they would not allow studying how copepods find mates in flow conditions that are more environmentally relevant, and consequently they would not provide the new perspective that this work offers. We have made all possible efforts to evidence that mating occurs in turbulence. First, we have analyzed in depth the behavioral and physical mechanisms that lead to encounters. By measuring simultaneously the motion of copepods and flow tracers, we have quantified the contributions of motility, preferential concentration, and flow advection in driving enhanced encounter rates in turbulence. We document at unprecedented accuracy (tens of millions of data points) both the flux of organisms around swimming copepods and the behavioral response that correlates the motion of two organisms once motility and turbulence bring them in close proximity. Secondly, we were able to resolve interactions between organisms up to contact, for thousands of events, and we show in additional measurements using separate genders that the inward motion within the radius of perception is meditated by males only. Thirdly, we show that contacts lead to actual mating. Parametric studies over a range of turbulence intensities are beyond the scope and can be addressed in future work.</p><p>Bagøien E., Kiørboe T.

However the encounter rate is exponentially related to the perceptive distance. This has a huge impact of the ability of copepods to find each other. Currently, not much is known about the effects of turbulence on the mechano-receptive or chemoreceptive abilities of copepods. However it is likely that they are impacted by turbulence. Since the encounter rate is so highly dependent on this parameter is difficult to model the outcome without a kernel that parameterizes it impact.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer claims that turbulence is likely to impact the perception ability of male copepods, and therefore that it is difficult to model encounter rates without a kernel that parametrizes its impact. In this study, we provide experimental evidence that the perception distance of copepods is similar (approx. 4 mm) in calm water and in turbulence. This point is clearly indicated in the text where we wrote:</p><p>&quot;Surprisingly, the distance 𝑟 ≈ 4 mm (corresponding to approximately 8 𝜂) at which we observe directed motion between organisms is similar in calm water and in turbulence, which reveals the intriguing ability of copepods to correctly identify the hydrodynamic signals generated by a conspecific among the background noise caused by turbulence. […] Our results show that, in this region, an organism appears to be able to distinguish between the flow disturbances created by another organism as it swims and the linear velocity gradients of turbulence within 𝜂<sub>0</sub>.&quot;</p><p>We feel sorry that the reviewer seems to have missed this information. Besides, extension of our model to include perception is straightforward because we can again follow the analogy with rain formation and have an efficiency factor that multiplies the collision kernel. This point is indicated in the manuscript where we wrote:</p><p>&quot;The second term of the collision kernel, termed the collision efficiency, provides corrections to 𝐾(𝑟) that account for interactions between organisms at 𝑟 below the range of validity of 𝐾(𝑟), that is, for 𝑟 ≤ 4 mm within the clearance volume. […] Therefore, the perception capability appears to be relatively unaffected for this species, and we can already anticipate that the encounter rate will not vary substantially.&quot;</p><p>Therefore, we already give the framework for the extension of the model in this paper. If the perception ability is unaffected (as suggested by males moving inward, starting at the same separation distance in calm water and in turbulence), we can anticipate that the encounter rate remains unchanged, again in opposition to what the reviewer claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an interesting paper dealing with the ability of calanoid copepods to find mates in a turbulent environment. The study is based on a combination of analytical models and careful experimental studies. It is found that copepods have an enhanced encounter rate in turbulent environments compared to than in calm waters. The conclusion is consistent with a number of related investigations dealing with encounters in turbulence. The topic of the study is thus not entire new, but the methods and results are well described and add to the existing knowledge in the field. As far as I can see, the paper is giving adequate credit to previous studies. I can, in principle, recommend publication of the paper, but have some comments for the authors. Some need their attention, and some I think should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their constructive comments and are happy to hear that they find the paper interesting. While it is true that plankton encounter rates in turbulence have already been studied, to our knowledge most of the earlier work is theoretical or numerical (e.g., Pécseli et al., 2014). In this study, we take advantage of an advanced particle tracking technique to obtain direct experimental results at unprecedented accuracy. We prove that two key conditions for copepod mating in turbulence are met. Firstly, the ability to reach the radius of perception at higher rates than in still conditions thanks to the contribution of active motion and turbulence advection. Secondly, the ability to react to each other via directed motion within the perception radius and within the short time frame of the encounter. We then show that copepods convert high encounter rates to frequent contact events and then to mating (new Figure 4 in the revised manuscript), and therefore that they are able to mate even when turbulence is strong. The first point is therefore in good agreement with the literature, but the second and third bring new perspectives to the issue. Indeed, our observations call for a reappraisal of our current knowledge of the behavioral ecology of calanoid copepods. Empirical evidence for mate-tracking behavior in calm hydrodynamic conditions has shaped the present understanding of copepod behavioral ecology for decades (e.g., the seminal work of Yen et al., 1998 and Bagøien and Kiørboe, 2005) and it is often assumed that copepods are evolved to mate in relatively quiet waters, although this was never confirmed. Our empirical results show that this vision is largely incomplete. We provide responses to specific comments below.</p><p>Bagøien E., Kiørboe T.

The caption mentions some cones, that I do not find, please clarify. The figure contains &quot;blur&quot; in blue colour: I presume this should represent turbulence? It is not explained. In part due to this blue colour, the colour coding of the trajectories becomes unclear: I had to enlarge the figure significantly to see this. Of course any reader can do the same, but only in the electronic version. The figure is important in my opinion, so it deserves more attention. Figure 1C has interesting information, this comes out quite clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>The blue cones indeed represent the direction and magnitude of the flow velocity vectors. Their length and opacity are determined by the trade-off between achieving clearly identifiable individual cones and being able to see the copepod trajectories. Making the cones larger would results in poorly visible copepod trajectories, and making them smaller would blur the flow field and make this information lost to the reader. We have tried to reach an appropriate trade-off in Figure 1 and in the new Figure 4, and we wrote in the caption of Figure 1:</p><p>&quot;Because the cones are semi-transparent to allow visualizing the copepod trajectories, it may be necessary to zoom in to see them individually.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors discuss finite inertia of the copepods (an entire section is devoted to this) but not much their finite size which is mentioned only in bypassing, e.g. caption of Appendix 1—figure 1. It seems to me that organisms are discussed as being point particles. The mass density of copepods is not much different from that of water, after all, but the finite size can be important and have been discussed in the literature. Finite size effects may not be dramatic for spherical particles, but elongated ones are likely to cluster in turbulent flows (this is actually consistent with results given by the black symbols for dead copepods in Figure 4). The authors refer to comparisons of measurements for dead and live copepods, but it is not clear how they make use of this information. I agree though that the finite-size information is present in this measurement.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this point. We have mentioned in the revised manuscript that shape, in addition to size and density, may also influence the dynamics of copepods in turbulence and their preferential concentration. We show in Figure 5 that the clustering of dead copepods due to finite size, density slightly larger than seawater, and elongated shape is negligible and not likely to increase the flux of organisms within their perception radius. This information is given in the revised manuscript. We stress that the clustering analysis shown in Figure 5 quantifies the combined effects of density, finite size, and elongated shape, as mentioned by the reviewer.</p><p>We have decided to show the result of the clustering analysis for living copepods to maintain consistency throughout the Results and Discussion section. Indeed, all measurements have been conducted on tracers, inert carcasses, and living copepods both in calm water and in turbulence. We believe that the result of the clustering analysis for living copepods in turbulence is important because it shows clearly the signature of individuals moving toward each other at small separation distance, in good agreement with the analysis of the pairwise radial relative velocity. This information is given in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I would have expected the elongation of pheromone traces due to turbulence to be important. Indeed, it is mentioned in the Introduction. Since the flow is incompressible, the volume of a trace is constant, and since it elongates (nearly exponentially, e.g. Batchelor, &quot;The effect of homogeneous turbulence on material lines and surfaces&quot;, Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A 213, 349 (1952)) it must thin out quite rapidly and some places be too thin to be detectable. The pheromone traces will in reality break-up into several smaller ones. I would have expected discussions like this to take more place. The authors might consider the point?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have added a note on this specific point where we wrote:</p><p>&quot;However, under conditions involving turbulence, pheromone trails are bound to elongate exponentially because of the incompressibility of the flow (Batchelor, 1952), to thin out rapidly and become too thin to be detectable, and then to break within seconds or less into disconnected filaments of concentrated cues separated by gaps with no detectable signal until further mixing and molecular diffusion cause local variations of the odorant to vanish (Shraiman and Siggia, 2000).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As far as I can see, it is assumed that copepods will encounter as soon as they enter within a suitably defined &quot;region of interaction&quot;, this is how I read the discussion of Figure 1B, for instance. MacKenzie et al., &quot;Evidence for a dome-shaped relationship between turbulence and larval fish ingestion rates&quot;, Limnol. Oceanogr. 39, 1790 (1994) have argued that even in case two organisms come within a contact range, it might still happen that turbulent motions separate them again to reduce the probability of an ultimate encounter. It seems that this model has found some support (Pecseli et al. &quot;Feeding of plankton in turbulent oceans and lakes&quot;, Limnol. Oceanogr. 64, 1034 (2019)). Can this scenario have some bearing for the authors problem?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this important point.

The figure shows the sequence of steps leading to mating: the independent motion of the two copepods and the advection by the flow that together bring individuals within their perception radius, the detection of the female by the male, the immediate reorientation of the male, the pursuit, the capture, and finally the tumbling behavior that occurs when the male attempts at transferring its spermatophore. Together with the observation of many mating events in the original image sequences, this figure supports the assumption that copepods do mate efficiently in turbulence. We also wrote in the main text (in the Results and Discussion section):</p><p>&quot;The inward motion of the male within the perception radius leads to contact between the two organisms of the pair. […] A large number of mating events similar to the one shown in Figure 4 are visible in the image sequences, indicating that mating does occur frequently in turbulence.&quot;</p><p>Our manuscript now combines results obtained via an automatic particle tracking technique that allows us to obtain previously unavailable data at very high degree of statistical reliability and up to contact between organisms, with qualitative data that proves that contact leads to mating. We have also clarified in the manuscript (in the Results and Discussion section) that the minimal separation distance at which two organisms could be detected via our automatic particle tracking technique (1 mm) corresponds to the distance between the centroids of the two organisms. Because copepods are approximately 1 mm in size, this means that we can actually resolve the approach up to contact for thousands of events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The probabilistic model of plankton motion at difference from previously existing models neglects the existence of correlations between the swimming behavior (cruising, jumping) and turbulent cues (strain, shear or rotation dominated events). This is a central question to which many studies have been devoted in the past. Can this assumption be tested against the experimental data? In the preset setup the simultaneous tracking of copepods and fluid tracers could in principle allow to characterize the turbulence in the vicinity of a copepod.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very familiar with earlier studies that have studied correlations between specific flow signals and the behavior of copepods, notably their jumps. These studies show that, in calm water or in laminar flow, copepods react to localized flow velocity gradients in their vicinity (for instance, those created by the tip of a pipette) via powerful escape jumps. These jumps are often directed away from the source of the disturbance and occur even when the disturbance is very weak (e.g., Kiørboe et al., 1997; Buskey et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2015; Buskey et al., 2017). In Michalec et al., 2017, we have already tested whether this response also occurs in turbulence by testing for correlations between the swimming behavior of copepods and turbulent cues. Using the setup described in this manuscript, we have tracked copepods swimming freely in quasi-homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, together with inert flow tracers. We have quantified turbulence quantities at each time instant along copepod trajectories. We found no one-to-one correlation between the signals generated by turbulence near the copepods (shear stress, normal stress, inertial drag stress, and vorticity) and their jump behavior or even the direction of their motion. The absence of correlation is now mentioned in the revised manuscript. This result shows that copepods exposed to realistic turbulent conditions do not react to the turbulence properties of the background flow the same as they react to localized hydrodynamic disturbances of comparable intensities in a still or laminar environment. Local events of strong turbulence do not trigger escape jumps, even when turbulence quantities are well above reported threshold values in calm water. Therefore, our model does not include correlations with the instantaneous flow signals encountered by copepods along their trajectories.</p><p>However, we also found that copepods adapt their swimming activity to the turbulence intensity by performing more frequent relocation jumps of limited amplitude that seem unrelated to localized hydrodynamic signals (Michalec et al., 2017). In other words, they increase their jump frequency as the turbulence intensity increases. The existence of frequent relocation jumps in a motion that is otherwise dominated by turbulent transport allows for the possibility of active locomotion. It enables copepods to transition from being passively advected by the flow to being capable of maintaining a certain control over their displacements despite the physical constraints that turbulence imposes on their motion. Our model does account for this behavioral mechanism via the fraction of time that a copepod is jumping (Equation 4). This fraction influences the probability density function of the relative velocity of copepods with respect to turbulence and thus their pairwise radial relative velocity (Equation 7). Therefore, our model already includes the correlation between the turbulence intensity and the behavior of copepods. This information is given in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Buskey E. J., Lenz P.
