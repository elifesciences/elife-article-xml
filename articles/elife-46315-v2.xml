However, mechanisms of crosstalk between these processes remain elusive. Here, we show that in an in vivo tumor model expressing oncogenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (Hipk), tumor cells display elevated aerobic glycolysis. Mechanistically, elevated Hipk drives transcriptional upregulation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myc (dMyc; MYC in vertebrates) likely through convergence of multiple perturbed signaling cascades. dMyc induces robust expression of <italic>pfk2</italic> (encoding 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase; PFKFB in vertebrates) among other glycolytic genes. Pfk2 catalyzes the synthesis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which acts as a potent allosteric activator of Phosphofructokinase (Pfk) and thus stimulates glycolysis. Pfk2 and Pfk in turn are required to sustain dMyc protein accumulation post-transcriptionally, establishing a positive feedback loop. Disruption of the loop abrogates tumorous growth. Together, our study demonstrates a reciprocal stimulation of Myc and aerobic glycolysis and identifies the Pfk2-Pfk governed committed step of glycolysis as a metabolic vulnerability during tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46315.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer arises when cells in the body divide and grow excessively. These cells will often also take up more glucose than normal cells and break it down into another chemical known as lactate faster. This change to the chemical reactions happening within the cell, also called a metabolic change, is required to help produce the extra DNA, proteins and fatty molecules that it needs to grow.</p><p>Elevated levels of certain proteins can trigger the changes that lead to the growth of tumors. MYC (called dMyc in fruit flies) is one of these proteins. It controls cell division and increases the production of enzymes that break down glucose. Hipk is another protein that can induce tumor growth in fruit flies, but how it does so was unknown.</p><p>Here, Wong et al. show that high levels of Hipk boost glucose metabolism and accumulation of dMyc protein in fruit fly cells. They also describe the link between increased glucose metabolism and uncontrolled cell division.</p><p>First, fruit fly cells were fed a fluorescent molecule similar to glucose that cannot be broken down by the cells. This experiment established that glucose uptake increases in cells with too much Hipk. These cells also break down glucose faster, confirming that they have increased glucose metabolism.</p><p>Cells with high levels of Hipk also activate the genes that generate the enzymes involved in glucose breakdown, and increase the activity of the gene coding for dMyc. Levels of the dMyc protein are higher in these cells, which was shown by staining the cells with fluorescent molecules that specifically bind the dMyc protein. It is this buildup of dMyc protein that activates the genes coding for the enzymes responsible for glucose breakdown. PFK2 is one of these enzymes.</p><p>Finally, Wong et al. inhibited the production of the enzymes that are elevated in cells with high Hipk. Stopping the production of PFK2 prevents both tumor growth and the accumulation of dMyc protein. This shows that high levels of dMyc increase PFK2 levels, leading to further dMyc buildup, and creating a loop that links the uncontrolled cell division caused by too much dMyc and the shift to higher glucose metabolism.</p><p>These results highlight new potential targets for cancer therapy, showing that targeting glucose metabolism may reduce, or even stop, tumor growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic> cancer model</kwd><kwd>phosphofructokinase</kwd><kwd>aerobic glycolysis</kwd><kwd>MYC</kwd><kwd>phosphofructokinase 2</kwd><kwd>Hipk</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-156204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verheyen</surname><given-names>Esther M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Specific molecular links that orchestrate growth signals and metabolic reprogramming to achieve tumorigenesis are identified as potential metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer treatment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the 1920s, Otto Warburg first discovered that cancer cells vigorously take up glucose and preferentially produce lactate even in the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon now widely termed the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Warburg et al., 1927</xref>). Despite his pioneering work, the Warburg effect was largely disregarded for the subsequent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liberti and Locasale, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koppenol et al., 2011</xref>). After the discoveries of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, cancers are generally considered as genetic diseases rather than metabolic ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wishart, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seyfried et al., 2014</xref>). Not until the 1980s did the revisiting of the Warburg effect in connection with oncogenes spark substantial research in cancer metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koppenol et al., 2011</xref>), laying the foundation for 2-deoxy-2-(<sup>18</sup>F)fluoro-D-glucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in clinical cancer diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Haim and Ell, 2008</xref>), recognition of metabolic reprogramming as a hallmark of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ward and Thompson, 2012</xref>) and development of anti-cancer agents targeting aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganapathy-Kanniappan and Geschwind, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pelicano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Granchi and Minutolo, 2012</xref>).</p><p>How the Warburg effect arises and contributes to tumor progression have always been the center in the field of cancer metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Warburg hypothesized that mitochondrial impairment is the cause of aerobic glycolysis and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Warburg, 1956</xref>), which has sparked much controversy among scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Senyilmaz and Teleman, 2015</xref>). Contrary to his idea, the current, widely-accepted view is that oncogenic drivers such as RAS, MYC, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) promote cancer cell proliferation and directly stimulate aerobic glycolysis through regulating transcriptional expression or catalytic activities of metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koppenol et al., 2011</xref>). Several explanations for the Warburg effect have been put forward, including rapid adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and de novo biosynthesis of macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liberti and Locasale, 2016</xref>). Recently, Warburg effect functions are being re-evaluated as a growing body of evidence shows that metabolic rewiring in cancers impacts cell signaling and epigenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liberti and Locasale, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu and Thompson, 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> has proven to be a powerful genetic model organism for studying tumorigenesis in vivo largely due to high conservation of genes and signaling cascades between human and flies and reduced genetic redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonzalez, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herranz and Cohen, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The tumorigenic roles of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hipk seem to be conserved in mammals as the four members of the HIPK family (HIPK1-4) are also implicated in certain cancers (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blaquiere and Verheyen, 2017</xref>). For example, HIPK1 is highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines, colorectal cancer samples and oncogenically-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kondo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rey et al., 2013</xref>). Also, HIPK2 is elevated in certain cancers including cervical cancers, pilocytic astrocytomas, colorectal cancer cells and in other proliferative diseases, such as thyroid follicular hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Beiti and Lu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Orazi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saul and Schmitz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deshmukh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lavra et al., 2011</xref>). To gain a better understanding of cancer metabolism, we set out to use the fly Hipk tumor model to investigate whether and how cellular metabolism is altered in tumor cells. We find that Hipk-induced tumorous growth is accompanied by elevated aerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, we identify novel feedback mechanisms leading to prolonged dMyc expression and hence tumorigenesis.

Earlier studies have demonstrated that Hipk is a versatile regulator of numerous signaling pathways. For example, Hipk stimulates the transcriptional activity of Yorkie (Yki, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of YAP/TAZ), the effector of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Verheyen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poon et al., 2012</xref>). Hipk also functions as a positive regulator of both Wnt/Wingless (Wg) and Hedgehog signaling by stabilizing Armadillo (β-catenin in vertebrates) and Cubitus interruptus (Ci; Gli in vertebrates), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Swarup and Verheyen, 2011</xref>). In addition, Hipk has been found to antagonize Groucho, a global co-repressor, to promote Notch signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2009b</xref>). If Hipk-induced dMyc upregulation is through deregulation of multiple signaling pathways, we would expect to see dMyc accumulation when the signaling pathways are perturbed. We first focused on the dorsal hinge area since ectopic dMyc expression and tumor growth are most striking in such region in <italic>hipk-</italic>expressing discs.</p><p>Flip-out clones expressing a constitutively active form of Yki (Yki-S168A) to inactivate the Hippo pathway were usually round and most of them in the dorsal hinge displayed dMyc upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, arrowheads). Wing discs with flip-out clones expressing an active form of Arm (Arm-S10) featured an expansion in the hinge area and some dMyc accumulated at the interface between the clone and the neighboring wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, arrowheads) but not at the center of the clone. Flip-out clones expressing Ci to activate Hedgehog signaling in the hinge region were round or irregular in shape and exhibited elevated levels of dMyc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, arrowheads). Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Djiane et al., 2013</xref>), expression of activated Notch appeared to induce dMyc accumulation in both cell and non-cell autonomous fashions in the hinge area likely involving a signaling relay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Therefore, individual perturbation of signaling pathways that have been previously shown to be regulated by Hipk was sufficient to trigger ectopic dMyc expression in the hinge region.</p><p>In the wing pouch region, activation of Yki failed to cause any dMyc upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>). This is in contrast to previous findings that overexpression of Yki increased dMyc protein levels in both hinge and pouch regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ziosi et al., 2010</xref>). Such discrepancy could be due to the different expression levels of the <italic>UAS-Yki</italic> constructs. Flip-out clones expressing Arm-S10 or activated Notch displayed reduced dMyc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f and h</xref>), which is consistent with earlier studies showing that Wg and Notch signaling negatively regulate dMyc expression in the pouch region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duman-Scheel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herranz et al., 2008</xref>). Clones with <italic>Ci</italic> overexpression were few and tiny in the wing pouch and the dMyc levels in the clones seemed comparable to those in the neighboring wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1g</xref>). Our data suggest that the region specificity in dMyc upregulation applies to not only Hipk tumor cells, but also cells with other tumorigenic stimuli.</p><p>In summary, our data show that in the wing hinge region where Hipk tumor growth is most prominent, dMyc protein markedly accumulates. Individual perturbations in signaling pathways that have been shown to be regulated by Hipk also result in ectopic dMyc expression in the same region. Hence, it is likely that in the rapidly proliferating Hipk tumor cells, aberrant signals propagate and converge at the transcriptional control of dMyc. In other words, the modulation of dMyc levels by Hipk seems to be a cumulative effect of alterations in multiple signaling outputs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Hipk-induced dMyc governs aerobic glycolysis and tumor growth</title><p>In addition to growth control, dMyc/MYC plays a conserved role in upregulating glycolysis in vertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic> during normal development and in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de la Cova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallant, 2013</xref>).

Indeed, when we examined other signaling targets downstream of Hipk as readouts for Hipk activity, we found that Hipk-mediated stabilization of Armadillo (Wnt/Wg signaling), and induction of Cyclin E or <italic>expanded-lacZ</italic> (Hippo signaling) remained unaffected by knockdown of <italic>pfk2</italic> or <italic>pfk</italic> in a Hipk overexpression background, indicating Hipk is still functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our data suggest that while dMyc upregulation promotes glycolytic activities, the upregulation of Pfk2, along with subsequent F2,6-BP biosynthesis and Pfk activation, is required to foster the accumulation of dMyc proteins.

In the Hipk tumor model, the tumor cells are surrounded by wild-type cells. Our study primarily used fluorescence imaging such that we could examine changes in metabolite levels, gene and protein expression between tumor cells and the adjacent wild-type cells. Our work delineates the causes and significance of metabolic changes in tumor cells.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> tumor models frequently acquire metabolic changes, especially the Warburg effect. For instance, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven tumors, tumors with activated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (Pvr) and tumors with polarity loss (such as <italic>scrib</italic> or <italic>dlg</italic> mutant tumors) feature robust upregulation of <italic>Ldh</italic> among other glycolytic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eichenlaub et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunker et al., 2015</xref>). Depletion of <italic>Ldh</italic> was shown to reduce growth of EGFR-driven tumors but not tumors with polarity loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eichenlaub et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunker et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup>scrib<sup>−/−</sup></italic> tumors, elevated glucose uptake was evident, but its significance was not evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katheder et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to the previously described models, Hipk tumor cells exhibited elevated glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Metabolic reprogramming was driven by dMyc upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Although the transcript levels of another glycolytic inducer <italic>sima</italic> remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), we could not eliminate the possibility that Sima protein levels are altered in the tumor cells. Thus, whether Sima is involved in the tumor growth warrants further studies. Genetical inhibition of Pfk or Pfk2 was sufficient to block Hipk-induced tumorigenesis whereas depletion of Pgk, Pyk or Ldh at most slightly reduced tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, our data suggest that targeted but not generic inhibition of glycolysis is required to abrogate tumor growth.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A feedback loop between dMyc and aerobic glycolysis as a metabolic vulnerability in tumor cells</title><p>Although MYC functions in cancer metabolism are widely recognized, MYC is generally considered ‘undruggable’ largely due to its nuclear localization, lack of an enzymatic ‘active site’, and indispensable roles during normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soucek and Evan, 2010</xref>). Hence, limited therapeutic strategies have been developed, and identification of the ‘druggable’ regulatory proteins of MYC becomes critical.</p><p>Our study reveals two modes of dysregulation of endogenous dMyc specifically during Hipk-induced tumorigenesis. The first mode is transcriptional stimulation of dMyc likely as a consequence of convergence of multiple signaling outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). In our previous study, we found that genetically targeting individual signaling cascades failed to restrain Hipk tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blaquiere et al., 2018</xref>). This is likely due to the redundancy of signaling cascades in inducing <italic>dMyc</italic> upregulation. It is also interesting to note that dMyc upregulation and the associated tumor growth are most striking in the wing hinge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The pouch region, however, seems more refractory to such alterations. We also observed the lowest intracellular glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–h</xref>) and robust <italic>Ldh</italic> upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) in the hinge area. dMyc-dependent glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–c</xref>), on the other hand, was enhanced in both hinge and pouch regions even though dMyc protein buildup is undetectable in the wing pouch, suggesting that glucose uptake is particularly sensitive to changes in dMyc levels. Our data therefore imply that the Warburg effect and the tumor growth phenotype may be linked to the dMyc levels being induced. The region-specific susceptibility to tumorigenic stimuli has been previously described and the hinge region was coined a ‘tumor hotspot’ because of its unique epithelial cell architectures and high endogenous JAK/STAT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tamori et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that such features in the hinge region also contribute to the sensitivity of dMyc upregulation by elevated Hipk and other signaling pathways. Further studies are required to verify this proposition.</p><p>The second mode of dMyc regulation is the metabolic control of dMyc protein levels by aerobic glycolysis. Specifically, we found that the rate-limiting enzymes Pfk2 and Pfk are required to perpetuate dMyc buildup in tumor cells in a post-transcriptional manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Similar to the effects on tumor growth, while <italic>pfk2/pfk</italic> knockdown prevented dMyc accumulation, knockdown of other glycolytic enzymes had little effect on sustaining dMyc accumulation. Such a disparity could possibly be explained by the potency of the glycolytic enzymes in controlling glycolytic flux. While Pfk2 and Pfk govern the rate-limiting, committed step of glycolysis, RNAi targeting other glycolytic genes may fail to render the corresponding steps rate-limiting, especially in tumors with elevated aerobic glycolysis. In other words, knockdown of other glycolytic enzymes may not reach the threshold that would restrict glycolytic flux as potently as <italic>pfk2/pfk</italic> knockdown. Given that Pfk2 is mis-expressed in tumor cells but not in normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and that dMyc accumulation is most sensitive to the Pfk2-Pfk mediated committed step of glycolysis specifically in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), targeting Pfk2 may be a favorable, selective metabolic strategy in the treatment of cancers, especially those displaying ectopic MYC expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Potential pro-tumorigenic roles of the pfk and Pfk2 in addition to their core biochemical role in glycolysis</title><p>The human homologs of fly Pfk and Pfk2 are PFK and PFK-2/FBPase (PFKFB), respectively. The functions of mammalian PFK and PFKFB in controlling glycolytic flux are well-defined. The allosteric regulation of PFK by F2,6-BP seems to be conserved among mammals and insects as F2,6-BP is able to activate insect Pfk, likely due to the conserved amino acid residues for F2,6-BP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nunes et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that Pfk2 can induce Pfk activation and hence glycolytic flux through biosynthesizing F2,6-BP. A previous report shows that flies lacking <italic>pfk2</italic> exhibited levels of circulating glucose and reduced sugar tolerance, providing a functional link between Pfk2 and glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Havula et al., 2013</xref>). We provide evidence that both <italic>pfk2</italic> and <italic>pfk</italic> knockdown larvae exhibited significant decreases in pyruvate contents, confirming a conserved role of Pfk2 in regulating glycolytic flux.</p><p>Recently, the roles of PFK and PFKFB in the regulation of transcription factors or cofactors have drawn considerable attention. For example, vertebrate PFK was shown to physically interact with TEAD factors to stimulate YAP/TAZ activity, thus promoting proliferation and malignancy in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enzo et al., 2015</xref>). PFKFB4 (an isoform of PFK2) phosphorylates and activates oncogenic SRC-3 to promote breast cancers through stimulating purine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dasgupta et al., 2018</xref>). These studies point to the fact that PFK and PFKFB functions are not restricted to metabolic regulation. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that Pfk2/Pfk may sustain ectopic dMyc through a direct interaction with or even phosphorylation of dMyc. That being said, as knockdown of Pfk2 or Pfk had no effects on dMyc protein levels under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), we tend to believe that a tumorigenic environment with active aerobic glycolysis is necessary for the metabolic control of dMyc in particular through the committed step governed by Pfk2/Pfk. In summary, we and others show that glycolytic enzymes Pfk and Pfk2, likely through their core biochemical role in stimulating glycolytic flux, glycolysis-independent actions or both, act as key players in coupling metabolic demands with growth signals to achieve cancer progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics</title><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> flies were raised on standard cornmeal-molasses food.

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kits (Qiagen 74101). First strand cDNA was synthesized using OneScript Plus cDNA Synthesis Kit (Abm G236). qRT-PCR were performed using SensiFast SYBR Hi-ROS Kit (Bioline 92005) on StepOne Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>2-NBDG uptake</title><p>Imaginal discs from third instar larva were dissected in PBS, followed by incubation with 2-NBDG (Invitrogen N13195) at 0.3 mM for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, samples were fixed and processed according to standard immunofluorescence staining protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Intracellular glucose FRET analysis</title><p>The glucose sensor <italic>UAS-FLII<sup>12</sup>Pglu-700µδ6</italic> was generated by Dr. Schirmeier’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volkenhoff et al., 2018</xref>). Imaginal discs expressing the sensor with or without overexpression of <italic>hipk</italic> were mounted and imaged on the same day. The same confocal settings as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volkenhoff et al., 2018</xref>) were used to record the CFP and FRET images. FRET efficiency (FRET/CFP) was calculated as quotient of FRET and CFP using Image J. Since we were not determining the actual values of intracellular glucose concentrations, we did not take into account a correction for spectral bleed through and thus uncorrected FRET/CFP ratios were used to compare glucose levels in discs of different genotypes. The values of FRET efficiency were displayed using the Fire Lookup Table (LUT) in figures and shown in boxplots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Pyruvate measurement</title><p>Whole-body larvae were homogenized in PBS, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 10 min. The supernatants were used for the pyruvate assay. The pyruvate assay was performed using EnzyChrom Pyruvate Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems EPYR-100) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured in a SpectraMax M5 fluorescent microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Relative pyruvate levels were determined after normalizing with the protein levels. Protein quantification was performed using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad 500–0006) and absorbance at 595 nm was measured. Experiments were conducted with two biological replicates. Each assay was performed with two technical replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>For data analyses, unpaired two-tailed Student t-tests were used to determine <italic>p</italic>-values using Microsoft Excel. Bar graphs were generated by Microsoft Excel. Boxplots were generated using BoxPlotR with data points included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spitzer et al., 2014</xref>). We used the Spear definition to show the maximum and minimum values by the upper and lower whiskers, respectively. The third quartile, median and the first quartile are shown in the box accordingly to a standard boxplot.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories for providing fly strains and antibodies.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Metabolic alterations involving a dMyc-Pfk2-Pfk regulatory loop and active mitochondrial metabolism drive tumor growth&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jason Tennessen as the guest Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The consensus view is that the manuscript provides an interesting description of a mechanism linking Hipk with aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism within <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval cells. The manuscript provides three important observations:</p><p>1) Hipk overexpression within the wing imaginal disc induces elevated glycolytic metabolism as determined by 2-NBDG uptake, a glucose FRET-sensor, and changes in gene expression related to glycolysis. Overall, these findings suggest that Hipk overexpression induces the Warburg effect in the wing disc.</p><p>2) Hipk overexpression within the larval salivary glands induces significant changes in mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential.</p><p>3) Loss of either Pfk or Pfk2 expression results in a decreased dMyc levels, hinting at a mechanism in which Hipk induced expression of Pfk and Pfk2 promotes dMyc accumulation.</p><p>Individually, each of these points is interesting, however, the studies of mitochondrial metabolism are largely conducted in the salivary gland while the glycolytic studies primarily take place within the wing imaginal disc. Combining these two tissue-specific studies into a single manuscript raises the question as to whether Hipk activates different metabolic programs within each tissue. This dilemma is further emphasized by the last paragraph of the Results section, which revealed that PFK2 but not PFK is required for mitochondrial elongation and branching phenotypes observed in the salivary glands. Since this result is in contrast to the Hipk-induced imaginal disc tumors, which are dependent on both PFK and PFK2, substantial effort would be required to understand how Hipk differentially regulates metabolism in these two tissues.</p><p>After several discussions, the reviewers agree that the strength of this study lies in the relationship between Hipk, dMyc, and Pfk/Pfk2 within the wing imaginal disc. The mechanism proposed by the wing disc studies are better defined than the salivary gland work and they reflect the heart of the manuscript. Based on this conclusion, the manuscript should be split in two, with the wing disc studies serving as the foundation of a major revision and the mitochondrial studies acting as seed for a future manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the following major revisions are required before the paper can be accepted at <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>1) Reorganize the manuscript to focus on the link between Hipk, Myc, and glycolysis in the imaginal disc while removing the mitochondrial studies in the salivary gland.</p><p>2) The reviewers request three additional sets of experiments to demonstrate that glycolysis is both elevated and necessary in HIPK-induced tumors.</p><p>i) The reviewers would like additional experiments demonstrating that 2-NBDG serves as an accurate readout of cellular glucose import:</p><p>How efficient is the UAS-Glut-RNAi used?</p><p>Is Glut1 over-expression sufficient to cause an accumulation in 2-NBDG?</p><p>Does Glut1 depletion rescue tumor formation?</p><p>ii) Please provide some evidence that Pfk2 activity is linked with increased glycolytic flux. Insect PFK is regulated differently than mammalian PFK, as the insect enzymes are insensitive to both citrate and AMP levels. This evidence could be provided by an appropriate set of references from the insect metabolism literature, a biochemical study using S2 cells, or measurements of lactate and pyruvate in larvae following whole body Pfk-2-RNAi.</p><p>iii) The reviewers are concerned that the link between Pfk/Pfk2 and dMyc might not be the result of a direct interaction, but instead reflects a feedback from glycolysis onto dMyc stability. They request that the authors use RNAi to determine if depletion of other glycolytic enzymes affects Myc levels. Specifically, the authors should determine if dMyc levels are sensitive to the loss of a glycolytic enzyme that is encoded by a single gene (unlike the hexokinases) and directly catalyzes a glycolytic reaction (unlike Ldh). Possible suggestions would be Pgi, Pyk, or Pgk.</p><p>3) The authors must strengthen the connection between HIPK up-regulation and dMyc expression.</p><p>i) The authors claim in Figure 4 that HIPK induces elevated dMyc levels. While the increase in dMyc-lacZ resembles the dpp-expression pattern, dMyc protein levels exhibit a different pattern. The authors should clarify this discrepancy. Moreover, dMyc protein levels appear to be increased in some regions of the disc but not in all the dpp-expressing cells (e.g., the wing pouch in Figure 4E, or Figure 6A). The use of clones over-expressing Hipk could help the authors to assess this potential region specificity in dMyc protein upregulation.</p><p>ii) There are also concerns regarding the section that examines the role of different signaling pathways on dMyc protein levels. The authors examine dMyc protein when different pathways are deregulated in the disc but do not evaluate the effect of dMyc expression. The use of clones might give better resolution and will allow showing these results in a clearer manner.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A dMyc-Pfk2-Pfk regulatory loop drives the Warburg effect and tumor growth&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The focus on the wing disc eliminates the confusion caused by studying the divergent phenotypes in the different tissues.</p><p>Much of the manuscript now discusses the role of glycolysis in tumor growth. The authors were asked to provide additional data to bolster the assertion that Hipk over-expression causes glycolysis to be increased and that the increase in glycolysis is necessary. Particularly, the authors were also asked to demonstrate that the stability of dMyc was due to a direct interaction between Pfk/Pfk2 and dMyc.</p><p>While the authors performed many of the experiments requested, it is still not clear if the changes in tumor growth and dMyc stability are due to a direct interaction between Pfk or Pfk2 with dMyc (i.e. a mechanism that does not involve glycolysis) or whether the glycolytic role of Pfk is critical, but glycolysis is especially sensitive to inhibition at the Pfk step. In the rebuttal, the authors propose that the direct interaction model is supported by negative data describing the relative unimportance of the other glycolytic steps. The authors performed RNAi knock-downs of the other glycolytic enzymes (as requested during the initial review). These experiments show that knock-down of the other glycolytic enzymes do not reduce dMyc stability, but have also only, surprisingly, a very minor impact on tumor growth (Figure 6—figure supplement 1, Figure 6—figure supplement 2, Figure 6—figure supplement 3, Figure 6—figure supplement 4 and Figure 6—figure supplement 5). Is it really true, then, that elevated glucose import or glycolysis is not necessary for tumor growth, or could it be that the knock-downs of the other glycolytic enzymes do not reduce glycolytic flux to the same extent as the Pfk/Pfk2 knock-down? This is a very difficult question to resolve without quantitative flux data, though accepting the conclusion that elevated glycolysis is not necessary for tumor growth would be contrary to much previous work. The other solution to distinguishing between the two models would be to provide a clear mechanistic model that describes how Pfk/Pfk2 promotes dMyc stability independent of the role of Pfk in glycolysis – the authors provide no new data to describe how such a mechanism might operate.</p><p>In the absence of new data, I don't think a glycolysis-independent role of Pfk is supported – right now it seems very difficult to separate the two phenomena. Any model that is proposed should take this uncertainty more fully into account. On the other hand, it seems very reasonable to say the targeted inhibition of glycolysis is necessary to reduce tumor-growth and that the Pfk/Pfk2 step is the most sensitive step in this system (e.g. subsection “dMyc-driven metabolic rewiring in Hipk tumor model”).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46315.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the following major revisions are required before the paper can be accepted at eLife:</p><p>1) Reorganize the manuscript to focus on the link between Hipk, Myc, and glycolysis in the imaginal disc while removing the mitochondrial studies in the salivary gland.</p></disp-quote><p>Our manuscript now focuses on the link the between Hipk tumor growth, dMyc upregulation and the Warburg effect in the wing imaginal discs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers request three additional sets of experiments to demonstrate that glycolysis is both elevated and necessary in HIPK-induced tumors.</p><p>i) The reviewers would like additional experiments demonstrating that 2-NBDG serves as an accurate readout of cellular glucose import:</p><p>How efficient is the UAS-Glut-RNAi used?</p></disp-quote><p>The knockdown efficiency of the <italic>UAS-glut1-RNAi</italic> was evaluated by qRT-PCR.

We believe that in this edited version, we have addressed the concerns and discussed broader interpretations, and we hope the reviewers agree.</p><p>Given that inhibition of Pfk2 and Pfk potently rescues dMyc accumulation and the associated tumor growth in our Hipk tumor model, we previously focused on the potential links between the Pfk2-Pfk axis and dMyc, which could be therapeutically valuable in cancer treatment. We agree with reviewers that the suppression effect could be explained by two alternative models, a direct interaction between dMyc and Pfk2/Pfk and a general attenuation of glycolytic flux. In light of this, we changed the focus from the dMyc-Pfk2-Pfk interactions to emphasizing the feedback loop between dMyc and aerobic glycolysis, and correspondingly have changed the title to “A positive feedback loop between Myc and aerobic glycolysis sustains tumor growth in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> tumor model”. Furthermore, we highlight that inhibition of the Pfk2/Pfk-governed committed step of glycolysis may serve as an effective approach to abrogate tumor growth.</p><p>In the last paragraph of the Discussion section, we provide some references showing that in human cancer cells, PFK and PFKFB (Pfk2 in flies) can physically interact or directly phosphorylate oncogenic proteins like TEAD factors (Enzo et al.,2015) or SRC-3 (Dasgupta et al.,2018). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that Pfk2/Pfk may sustain ectopic dMyc through a direct interaction with or even phosphorylation of dMyc (subsection “Potential pro-tumorigenic roles of the Pfk and Pfk2 in addition to their core biochemical role in glycolysis”). However, we currently do not have appropriate reagents like fly strains or antibodies to investigate the potential physical interactions, and those studies are beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>In summary, we and others show that glycolytic enzymes Pfk and Pfk2, likely through their core biochemical role in stimulating glycolytic flux, glycolysis-independent actions or both, act as key players in coupling metabolic demands with growth signals to achieve cancer progression.
