Combining latency reversal agents (LRAs) with differing mechanisms of action such as AZD5582, a non-canonical NF-kB activator, and I-BET151, a bromodomain inhibitor is appealing toward inducing HIV-1 reactivation. However, even this LRA combination needs improvement as it is inefficient at activating proviruses in cells of people living with HIV (PLWH). We performed a CRISPR screen in conjunction with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 and identified a member of the Integrator complex as a target to improve this LRA combination, specifically Integrator complex subunit 12 (INTS12). Integrator functions as a genome-wide attenuator of transcription that acts on elongation through its RNA cleavage and phosphatase modules. Knockout of INTS12 improved latency reactivation at the transcriptional level and is more specific to the HIV-1 provirus than AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment alone. We found that INTS12 is present on chromatin at the promoter of HIV and therefore its effect on HIV may be direct. Additionally, we observed more RNAPII in the gene body of HIV only with the combination of INTS12 knockout with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151, indicating that INTS12 induces a transcriptional elongation block to viral reactivation. Moreover, knockout of INTS12 increased HIV-1 reactivation in CD4 T cells from virally suppressed PLWH ex vivo, and we detected viral RNA in the supernatant from CD4 T cells of all three virally suppressed PLWH tested upon INTS12 knockout, suggesting that INTS12 prevents full-length HIV RNA production in primary T cells. Finally, we found that INTS12 more generally limits the efficacy of a variety of LRAs with different mechanisms of action.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite advancements in keeping viral loads below detectable limits, HIV-1 still exists within a latent reservoir in vivo and viral replication returns when antiretroviral therapy (ART) is interrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davey et al., 1999</xref>). HIV-1 predominately infects memory CD4+ T cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Ammar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohn et al., 2020</xref>), and while many acutely infected cells, particularly the more differentiated effector memory cells, die off rapidly upon infection due to cytopathic effects, some cells can revert to a resting state where the provirus becomes transcriptionally silent (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duggan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mbonye and Karn, 2024</xref>). These infected resting memory cells form the HIV reservoir that is largely invisible to the immune system and not sensitive to enhanced ART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Siliciano and Siliciano, 2024</xref>). The reservoir of latently infected cells decays slowly and is maintained by both external stimuli and homeostatic proliferation even after initiation of ART (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohn et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the major barrier to HIV cure is the existence of this ART-insensitive and long-lived latent reservoir that is largely not sensed by the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chun and Fauci, 1999</xref>), reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duggan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mbonye and Karn, 2024</xref>.</p><p>One strategy being explored to target the latent reservoir, called ‘shock-and-kill’, uses small-molecule compounds called latency reversal agents (LRAs) to transcriptionally activate latent cells, so that immune-mediated mechanisms can then recognize and kill infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Archin et al., 2012</xref>), reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maina et al., 2021</xref>. This strategy would be employed in the presence of ART so that newly induced HIV virions could not infect more cells. However, inducing HIV-1 activation from latency is challenging because the latent reservoir size varies between people and heterogeneous HIV integration sites can influence the reactivation of infected cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Ammar et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, activation of latently infected resting T cells has not yet been able to induce HIV-1 replication from more than a fraction of the cells with a replication-competent provirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Siliciano and Siliciano, 2024</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptional repression of HIV-1 in its latent state is multifactorial, and it is known to be affected by repressive chromatin modifications and blocks to both transcription initiation and transcription elongation. Several classes of LRAs have been identified that can undo one or more blocks to latency reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stoszko et al., 2019</xref>), reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rodari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Singh et al., 2021</xref>. For example, AZD5582 is an LRA that targets a transcription initiation block by activating the noncanonical NF-kB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hennessy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pache et al., 2020</xref>) and has been shown to induce HIV transcription in HIV latency cell line models as well as induce viremia in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nixon et al., 2020</xref>). Another class of LRAs are BET inhibitors that undo a block to transcription elongation by targeting various bromodomain-containing proteins. I-BET151 is a pan-BET inhibitor that is thought to reverse HIV latency by either blocking host Brd4 from binding to P-TEFb to facilitate P-TEFb availability for HIV Tat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schröder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2005</xref>) or more generally by increasing the amount of P-TEFb not bound to the 7SK complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turner et al., 2024</xref>). Currently, no single LRA has been potent enough to reactivate the majority of the latent proviruses nor specific enough to HIV to not cause cyotoxicity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Debrabander et al., 2023</xref>). On the other hand, combinations of LRAs with different mechanisms of action have shown synergy in HIV latency reversal in different model systems including the combination of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falcinelli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laird et al., 2015</xref>) reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rodari et al., 2021</xref>. However, while the combination of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 is synergistic in activation of HIV in latency cell line models, and can induce robust HIV transcription initiation ex vivo in primary CD4+ T cells from virally suppressed people living with HIV (PLWH), it failed to induce full-length proviral transcription in the ex vivo system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falcinelli et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, there exist additional blocks to HIV reactivation that even potent LRA combinations currently cannot overcome.</p><p>Here we hypothesized that we could use a CRISPR screen to uncover pathways to improve LRA combinations. Previous work from our lab used a high-throughput CRISPR screening approach, called the Latency HIV-CRISPR screen, to predict gene knockouts that improve the efficacy of a single LRA, AZD5582. Specifically, knockout of ING3, a member of the NuA4 histone acetylation complex, could improve the potency and the specificity of AZD5582, both in J-Lat model systems and in a primary T cell model of latency. Thus, in this study, we used a similar strategy to identify gene knockouts to increase HIV latency reversal with the more powerful AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 drug combination, and uncovered Integrator complex subunit 12, INTS12, as contributing to a block in HIV reactivation, both on its own, but, especially in the presence of the AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 drug combination.</p><p>INTS12 is a subunit of the Integrator complex that is thought to act as a reader to link the complex to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welsh and Gardini, 2023</xref>). The Integrator complex functions as a genome-wide attenuator of mRNA transcription where it can antagonize transcription with both its cleavage and phosphatase modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2023</xref>), and members of Integrator have been shown to modulate transcription at the HIV LTR previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lykke-Andersen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stadelmayer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We found that knocking out INTS12 reactivates HIV on its own and improves reactivation with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment. RNA-seq analysis showed that INTS12 knockout (KO) more specifically reactivates HIV compared to AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment alone, and the combination of INTS12 KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 increases the potency of reactivation. Additionally, we have evidence of an elongation block being overcome with INTS12 KO paired with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 specifically showing an increase in bound elongation-competent RNAPII in the gene body of HIV that is not seen with either KO or LRA treatment alone. We found that INTS12 is bound to the viral promoter and therefore may be acting directly on viral transcription. Importantly, we saw reactivation of HIV in the CD4 T cells of the majority of the virally suppressed PLWH tested ex vivo, upon INTS12 KO with or without AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment. Crucially, we also detected viral RNA in the supernatant suggestive of the presence of HIV virions released into the supernatant, indicating that full-length HIV transcripts are being generated. Furthermore, we used the HIV-CRISPR screen approach to probe the Integrator complex as a whole and predict Integrator members comprising the cleavage module, phosphatase module, and core to all be involved in the control of HIV-1 latency in addition to the reader, INTS12. Lastly, we show that knockout of INTS12 can increase reactivation with diverse classes of LRAs, suggesting that INTS12 is a general block to HIV reactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Latency HIV-CRISPR screen identifies gene targets that increase HIV latency reversal with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment</title><p>We used a high-throughput CRISPR screen previously described by our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsieh et al., 2023</xref>) to identify gene targets that, when knocked out, would further improve LRAs. The screen involves a lentiviral vector, called HIV-CRISPR, that contains two functional LTRs, a packaging signal, a guide RNA, and Cas9 to knock out a gene of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cells that have a latent HIV provirus are transduced with a library of HIV-CRISPR-containing guides and then, after selection for integration of the vector, the cells are treated with the combination of LRAs, AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 to reactivate HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). If a gene knockout improves LRA reactivation, we will detect more HIV in the supernatant compared to the DMSO control. We can determine the gene knockout responsible for HIV reactivation because the HIV-CRISPR vector will be packaged along with the reactivated provirus from the cells and become enriched in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see purple or black HIV RNA in virions). We then determine how enriched a guide is by the ratio of guides in the supernatant compared to the total guide representation in the cells, and this generates a value called the MAGeCK gene score, where higher values correspond to more enrichment (i.e., HIV reactivation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, all guides to one gene target and replicates are factored into the MAGeCK gene score generation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A screen to predict gene knockouts that will improve HIV reactivation from the combination of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Basal J-Lat conditions (left panel) followed by screen scenarios (middle to right panels). Screen overview: J-Lat cells containing an internal provirus are transduced with the HIV-CRISPR vector to generate a library of knockout cells for the human epigenetic library. Knockout cells are selected by puromycin and then either treated with latency reversal agents (LRAs) or untreated (DMSO). The HIV-CRISPR vector is packageable and will accumulate in the supernatant if the internal HIV provirus is reactivated. Sequencing the supernatant and cells allows for measurement of how enriched a guide is. (<bold>A</bold>, from left to right) Basal conditions show a gene product can block reactivation of HIV at the transcriptional level. Knockout alone shows that upon introducing the HIV-CRISPR some gene knockouts will result in latency reversal in the absence of LRA treatment. LRA combo alone shows the effect of LRA stimulation alone and how this will result in non-targeting guides (black) accumulating in the supernatant. Knockout + LRA combo shows that some gene knockouts will improve reactivation with LRA treatment and result in more virus accumulation.

We validated INTS12 as a screen hit by either knocking out INTS12 with the HIV-CRISPR vector loaded with one guide and then selecting for knockout cells with puromycin (J-Lat 5A8 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>], J-Lat 10.6 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>]) or by electroporation with a combination of three of guides to INTS12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). We used AAVS1 knockout as a CRISPR control where the guide targets within a safe harbor locus and knockout should have a minimal effect on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2014</xref>). These knockouts were then treated with DMSO, a low dose of AZD5582 (10 nM), a low dose of I-BET151 (100 nM), or a combination of AZD5582 (10 nM) &amp; I-BET151 (100 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), and the amount of HIV-1 released into the supernatant was measured by a reverse transcriptase activity assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vermeire et al., 2012</xref>). As expected, we find in AAVS1 knockout cells that there is minimal reactivation in the DMSO control, a small amount of HIV induction from AZD5582 or I-BET151 alone, and we observe synergy with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 used in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Knocking out INTS12 alone in the absence of added LRAs also shows a modest increase in the amount of virus detected in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, DMSO), indicating that INTS12 itself is imposing a block to reactivation that is relieved upon knockout. In the presence of drug treatments, INTS12 knockout improves reactivation of either AZD5582 or I-BET151 alone, and we see the most HIV reactivation when INTS12 knockout is treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), as the screen predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

We first used an antibody against total RNAPII, RPB3, and generated pileup graphs of reads corresponding to where RPB3 is bound across the HIV-1 provirus and downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left panel). The peaks in each row correspond to at least 3–5 technical replicates averaged together. We quantified all reads of RPB3 in three regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right panel; exact coordinates in the ‘Materials and methods’). We see similar levels of RPB3 in region 1 for all four conditions. We defined region 2 as the remainder of the provirus excluding the LTR and the short 5’ region of HIV in region 1. We found that there was a dramatic statistically significant increase in RPB3/RNAPII occupancy in the body of the provirus (region 2) only with both INTS12 KO and AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We did not see this increase in RNAPII when we examined the gene downstream of the integrated provirus (region 3). More RNAPII within the body of the HIV provirus is suggestive of transcription elongation, but to strengthen this claim we measured Ser2 phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of RNAPII that is found on the elongation-competent form of RNAPII. We observed evidence of elongation-competent RNAPII for two conditions with LRAs: AAVS1 KO cells treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 and our INTS12 KO cells treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), as we saw a significant increase in reads in region 2 compared to the AAVS1 KO treated with DMSO control.

In our initial screen of epigenetic factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), only INTS12 was included in the CRISPR guide library of the 15-member Integrator complex. In order to more comprehensively interrogate the role of Integrator complex members in HIV latency, we remade a library of guides in the HIV-CRISPR vector where we included all Integrator members (with the exception of INTS15 that was not known at the time of library construction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Offley et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Replogle et al., 2022</xref>).

We took our AAVS1 KO cells or INTS12 KO cells and reactivated with TNF-α, a canonical NF-kB activator, or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 co-stimulation that activates T cells through the T cell receptor and observed that INTS12 KO is able to increase reactivation with both of these stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, left panel).

The ideal gene target would not only increase potency of this drug combination but maintain specificity to the virus and limit off-target effects. We used an epigenetic regulatory factor-focused guide library in combination with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 and identified INTS12 as the top hit. We validated that knockout of INTS12 results in increased latency reversal on its own but more in the presence of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment, as the screen predicted. We observed that INTS12 KO resulted in specific enrichment of HIV and minimal effects on host genes, and that INTS12 KO is more specific to HIV than AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment alone. INTS12 KO paired with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment further increased potency of HIV reactivation, but some specificity was lost compared to AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 alone and INTS12 KO alone. However, INTS12 KO paired with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 remains more specific to HIV than PMA and ionomycin combination treatment. With CUT&amp;Tag, we observed that INTS12 is at the HIV promoter which supports that it is acting directly on HIV-1 transcription, and we see an increase in elongation-competent RNAPII in the gene body of HIV only with the combination of INTS12 KO and AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151, supporting that an elongation block is specifically overcome with this combination. Additionally, we validated INTS12 in an ex vivo primary cell model of latency where we see reactivation from INTS12 KO in a majority of donors tested with or without AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment, and that reactivation upon INTS12 KO leads to detection of viral RNA in the supernatant, indicating that full-length HIV is likely generated. Furthermore, we used the CRISPR-screen approach to predict which members of the Integrator complex could be targeted to improve the AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 combination and identified the cleavage module, phosphatase module, and core Integrator members, in addition to INTS12 as playing a role in HIV-1 latency. Lastly, we demonstrated that INTS12 knockout can improve reactivation of a diverse set of stimuli supporting that INTS12 serves as a general block to reactivation of HIV from latency. This study highlights the promise of using the CRISPR-screening approach as a tool to identify blocks to HIV reactivation and improve LRA combinations, such as AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The role of Integrator complex in modulating HIV transcription</title><p>The Integrator complex is known to regulate and attenuate transcription at promoters that are bound by pausing factors NELF and DSIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Skaar et al., 2015</xref>). HIV is known to be regulated by these pausing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ping and Rana, 2001</xref>), and it has been shown that members of the Integrator are recruited to the HIV TAR loop and regulate processivity of HIV transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stadelmayer et al., 2014</xref>). The Integrator contains 15 members that fall within different submodules that perform various functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welsh and Gardini, 2023</xref>), and of these modules some members of the cleavage, phosphatase, and core have been shown to reverse HIV latency upon knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stadelmayer et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, knockout of INTS3 of the SOSS complex was not found to reverse latency in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stadelmayer et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, members of the core and phosphatase have been shown to improve an LRA combination of a BET inhibitor with a PKC agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2020</xref>). We have recapitulated these previous findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), but we have also predicted that all members of these modules can be targeted to improve the AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment, including the cleavage module for which this has not been explored in the context of LRAs.</p><p>One study explored the different effects on gene transcription upon targeting the cleavage module versus targeting the phosphatase module of the Integrator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2023</xref>). Selectively targeting the cleavage module of Integrator has been shown to result in a specific induction of lowly expressed genes since these genes are regulated by pausing factors and Integrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2023</xref>). Given that HIV is regulated by these same factors and poorly expressed during HIV latency, it may not be surprising that targeting this module has shown an increase in HIV transcription. Since the Integrator complex has been shown to modulate genes differently in the presence or absence of stress stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tatomer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yue et al., 2017</xref>), this may explain why targeting the Integrator complex in the presence of LRAs can improve reactivation. Moreover, Integrator is known to antagonize host P-TEFb function with its phosphatase module and enforce pausing at bound promoters. Therefore, targeting the phosphatase module can lead to more elongation at affected promoters. Given that HIV is sensitive to pausing and elongation, especially in cells from PLWH, and P-TEFb is considered to be one of the major rate-limiting steps to HIV reactivation, it is reasonable that removing a P-TEFb antagonist would help aid in HIV reactivation. Our results are also consistent with the hypothesis that transcription elongation with INTS12 KO cells treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 may be more efficient than the LRAs alone as the levels of Ser2 phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of RNAPII are also significantly lower near the LTR, but increased distal to the LTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, compare INTS12 KO treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 to DMSO in regions 1 and 2), which may suggest RNAPII is efficiently leaving the promoter and traveling within the body of the provirus to affect full-length transcription. This full-length transcription is also consistent with increased virus release that we observe both in cell lines and in primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>INTS12 as a target for small-molecule drug development</title><p>While our data suggests that many different members of the Integrator complex could be targeted to activate HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), we believe that INTS12 may be the better option to target over the rest of the complex. We find that INTS12 is located at the HIV-1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and knockout fairly specifically reactivates HIV compared to host genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, middle panel), which supports that INTS12 acts directly on HIV-1 transcription rather than indirectly through the modulation of other genes. There are several hypotheses for how targeting INTS12 is affecting HIV transcription. It could be that targeting INTS12 may keep catalytic activities of the Integrator complex partially intact or alter where those activities are exerted as this member is thought to toggle chromatin localization of the Integrator complex. Alternatively, it is possible INTS12 may be performing a separate function entirely from the remainder of the Integrator complex. In support of INTS12 being the best candidate to target, other studies have suggested that INTS12 knockdown does not grossly affect cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kheirallah et al., 2017</xref>), as opposed to other members of the Integrator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rienzo and Casamassimi, 2016</xref>), although it has been shown that even catalytic members have been able to be targeted for short periods of time without signs of catalytic activity disruption in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elrod et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, with the caveats that the function of INTS12 in diverse T cell functions or other in vivo functions is not yet known and needs to be investigated in humans, we propose that targeting INTS12 with a small-molecule drug may be even more successful than targeting other Integrator members with short-term disruption in the shock-and-kill approach.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Ex vivo primary cell system</title><p>To our knowledge, our study is the first to report an analysis of an Integrator complex member in an ex vivo experiment in cells from virally suppressed PLWH. We observed that INTS12 knockout reactivates HIV transcription in a majority of donors on its own and especially in the presence of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This was in people with differing reservoir sizes, cells that have different HIV integration sites, and people on ART treatment for varying lengths of time. We were also able to show that HIV RNA could be detected in the supernatant, which is an aspect critical to consider with regard to the kill side of the shock-and-kill approach and has proven to be one of the more difficult elements of the approach so far with many studies showing reactivation but variable virus production. This result highlights the power in the CRISPR-screening approach and shows that even when cell line models are used, we can use LRA combinations and identify blocks to reactivation that can be used to improve reactivation in more clinically relevant cells from PLWH.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Synergy on multiple mechanisms</title><p>AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 are thought to synergize by acting to undo different blocks to latency reversal. AZD5582 working on the transcription initiation arm where noncanonical NF-kB is upregulated and I-BET151 on the transcription elongation arm where it is thought to impact available cellular P-TEFb that can work in conjunction with HIV Tat for HIV transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schröder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turner et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). When Integrator is bound to the HIV promoter, it can attenuate HIV transcription through its cleavage and phosphatase modules, as evidenced by knockout of members of these modules. As such, Integrator works on the elongation stage of transcription, and in our work, we have evidence that knocking out INTS12 overcomes a block to elongation. We not only see virus in the supernatant upon INTS12 KO in cells from PLWH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), but we also see that specifically with the combination of INTS12 KO and AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 there is an increase in elongation-competent RNAPII downstream of the HIV promoter and throughout the HIV provirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Therefore, our hypothesis is that targeting Integrator may allow for HIV transcription initiation events to not be aborted prematurely and allow for subsequent paused promoters to proceed to elongation from an unopposed P-TEFb. For this reason, removal of Integrator can lead to latency reversal on its own, but this also may explain why Integrator increases latency reversal with each LRA individually as well as improves the combination of INTS12 knockout with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151.</p><p>The Integrator complex itself is a fascinating target that needs to be considered for any HIV cure approach involving transcription. Not only does it govern transcription regulation at the HIV promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but it appears to do so in ways that may be contrary to the ways other genes are affected given its relative specificity for HIV transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, middle panel), and has the ability to influence reactivation with diverse LRAs. While it has been reported that Integrator can function differently in the presence of stress stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tatomer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yue et al., 2017</xref>), we did not observe differential expression of any Integrator members upon AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment in J-Lat cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, tabs 1 and 5) though this does not mean that recruitment of the complex does not vary under stimulatory conditions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we did not observe significantly different recruitment of INTS12 to the HIV LTR upon AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment but did not look at recruitment of other Integrator members and how their recruitment may be impacted. It is possible the general stoichiometry of the various Integrator members is important for the function of the complex at various promoters, though this has not been explored. Understanding how the Integrator complex and its modules are affected by different LRA stimuli may be crucial to optimizing the shock-and-kill strategy or even improving the reverse strategies of block-and-lock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lyons et al., 2023</xref>) seeking to silence HIV more effectively at the HIV promoter. While, to our knowledge, small-molecule drugs that target INTS12, or any member of the Integrator complex are not yet available, the development of such agents would be predicted to improve the efficacy of existing LRAs to achieve more effective viral reactivation as a step toward reservoir reduction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and maintenance</title><p>J-Lat 10.6 and J-Lat 5A8 cells were cultured with RPMI 1640 media (Thermo Fisher, 11875093) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), Penicillin/Streptomycin, and 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher, 15630080).

Virus supernatant was combined (by cell type) and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. For ultracentrifugation, about 30 mL of supernatant was aliquoted into each polypropylene tube (Beckman Coulter; 326823) and sterile-filtered 20% sucrose (20% sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, distilled water) was added slowly underneath to form a sucrose cushion. Tubes were then placed in a pre-chilled swinging buckets SW 28 rotor at 23,000 rpm for 1 hr at 4°C in a Beckman Coulter Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge. Supernatants were decanted, allowed to dry briefly, and pellets were resuspended overnight in 600 μL RPMI at 4°C (can do several hours). Concentrated lentivirus was then stored at –80°C in single-use small aliquots (~150 μL) and two 50 uL aliquots were stored at –80°C for titration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>HuEpi screen: HuEpi HIV-CRISPR cell generation</title><p>Virus was titered on TZM-bl cells (NIH AIDS Reagent Program; ARP-8129) in a colony-forming assay to calculate for a &lt;1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) (0.54 was used in the HuEpi screens). The number of cells to transduce was calculated to be &gt;500x (5029 HuEpi guides × 500 = 2.51e6 + error = 3e6 cells), so 3e6 J-Lat cells (ZAP KOs) were transduced per replicate. Cells were transduced with DEAE-Dextran (20 μg/mL final concentration, Sigma-Alrdich; D9885) and spinoculated for 30 min at 1100 × <italic>g</italic> and incubated overnight. After 24 hr, the supernatant was replaced with fresh media containing 0.4 μg/mL of puromycin (Sigma) and cells were selected for 10–14 days (cells were grown for 21 days in this experiment to acquire enough for the desired screen coverage and all experimental conditions).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>LRA resuspension</title><p>AZD5582 (MedChemExpress, HY-12600), I-BET151 (SelleckChem, S2780) TNF-α (Peprotech, 300-01A), SAHA (Selleckchem, S1047), and Tazemetostat (Selleckchem, S7128) were resuspended in DMSO to make 10 mM stocks stored at –80°C.

We calculated 25e6 cells were needed per replicate + error = 26e6 cells. We accounted for AZD5582’s viability and calculated 35e6 cells/replicate for each condition. AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 were resuspended in DMSO to 1 mM stocks stored at –80°C. All other dilutions were performed in RPMI and used immediately. For the screen, 35e6 cells/replicate were grown at 5e5 cells/mL in a flask and treated with 10 nM AZD5582, 100 nM I-BET151, 10 nM AZD5582 &amp; 100 nM I-BET151, or DMSO. Cells and supernatants were collected after 48 hr of stimulation. Cells were spun down at 1500 × <italic>g</italic> for 3 min, supernatants were transferred to a new 50 mL conical, filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (MilliporeSigma, SE1M179M6), and stored at 4°C (can store overnight) for virus concentration. Cells were washed once with DPBS (Gibco; 14190144) and resuspended in 1 mL DPBS to store aliquots of 5e6 cells (approximately calculated, not counted) at –80°C. Finish concentrating virus by following steps detailed in lentivirus production (above) but resuspend the pellet in 150 μL at the end.

We included AAVS1 treated with DMSO, AAVS1 treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151, INTS12 KO treated with DMSO, and INTS12 KO treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151. Treated samples were spun down at 1.45e6 cells/tube (I used two tubes/sample), the supernatant was aspirated, and cells were lysed with 700 µL of QIAzol (QIAGEN, 1023537). Samples were spun through a QIAshredder (QIAGEN, 79654) and then frozen at –80°C. Cells were processed with a miRNeasy kit (QIAGEN, 217004), DNase treated with RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN, 79254), and then reprocessed through the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 74104) with the EtOH wash modified to 700 µL for small RNAs. Combine tubes for each sample. RNA quality was checked by TapeStation (all samples had a RIN of 10), and 10 µL of RNA at 50 ng/µL was sent for RNA-seq to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center Genomics Shared Resources where rRNA was removed to select for the rest of the total RNA with the Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep, Ligation with Ribo-Zero Plus kit (20040525) followed by indexing with IDT for Illumina RNA UD Indexes Set A Ligation (20040553).

We show that INTS12 affects HIV latency reversal from agents that affect the non-canonical NF-kB pathway (AZD5582), the canonical NF-kB pathway (TNF-alpha), activation via the T-cell receptor (CD3/CD28 antibodies), through bromodomain inhibition (I-BET151), and through a histone deacetylase inhibitor (SAHA). This additional data has been added to the manuscript in Figure 7, panels B and C as well as adding text to the discussion.</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion to extend the discussion to emphasize how important pausing and elongation are to HIV transcription. Additionally, to further support our claim that INTS12KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 leads to an increase in elongation, that we previously showed with CUT&amp;Tag data showing an increase in total RNAPII seen in within HIV (Figure 5B), we measured RNAPII Ser2 phosphorylation (Figure 5C) and RNAPII Ser5 phosphorylation (Figure 5—figure supplement 2) and added these findings to the manuscript. Upon measuring Ser2 phosphorylation, a marker associated with elongation, we observed evidence of elongation-competent RNAPII in our AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 condition as well as our INTS12 KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 condition, as we saw an increase of Ser2 phosphorylation within HIV. Despite seeing elongation-competent RNAPII in both conditions, we only saw a dramatic increase in total RNAPII for our INTS12 KO and AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 condition (Figure 5B), which supports that there are more elongation events and that an elongation block is overcome specifically with INTS12 KO paired with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151. This claim is further supported by our data showing an increase in virus in the supernatant only with the INTS12 KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 condition in cells from PLWH (Figure 6C). We did not observe any statistically significant differences between RNAPII Ser5 phosphorylation, which might be expected as this mark is not associated with elongation (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Transcriptionally silent HIV-1 genomes integrated into the host`s genome represent the main obstacle to an HIV-1 cure.

The authors successfully mapped the identified HIV silencing factor at the HIV promoter.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Initial bias:</p><p>In the choice of the genes comprised in the library, the authors readdress their previous paper (Hsieh et al.) where it is stated: &quot;To specifically investigate host epigenetic regulators involved in the maintenance of HIV-1 latency, we generated a custom human epigenome specific sgRNA CRISPR library (HuEpi). This library contains sgRNAs targeting epigenome factors such as histones, histone binders (e.g., histone readers and chaperones), histone modifiers (e.g., histone writers and erasers), and general chromatin associated factors (e.g., RNA and DNA modifiers) (Fig 1B and 1C)&quot;.</p><p>From these figure panels, it clearly appears that the genes chosen are all belonging to the indicated pathways. While I have nothing to object to on the pertinence to HIV latency of the pathways selected, the authors should spend some words on the criteria followed to select these pathways. Other pathways involving epigenetic modifications and containing genes not represented in the indicated pathways may have been left apart.</p><p>(2) Dereplication:</p><p>From Figure 1 it appears that INTS12 alone reactivates HIV -1 from latency alone without any drug intervention as shown by the MACGeCk score of DMSO-alone controls. If INTS12 knockdown alone shows antilatency effects, why, then were they unable to identify it in their previous article (Hsieh et al., 2023)? The authors should include some words on the comparison of the results using DMSO alone with those of the previous screen that they conducted.</p><p>(3) Translational potential:</p><p>In order to propose a protein as a drug target, it is necessary to adhere to the &quot;primum non nocere&quot; principle in medicine. It is therefore fundamental to show the effects of INTS12 knockdown on cell viability/proliferation (and, advisably, T-cell activation). These data are not reported in the manuscript in its current form, and the authors are strongly encouraged to provide them.</p><p>Finally, as many readers may not be very familiar with the general principles behind CRISPR Cas9 screening techniques, I suggest addressing them in this excellent review: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479249/">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479249/</ext-link>.</p></disp-quote><p>(1) The CRISPR library used was more completely described in a previous publication (Hsieh et al, PLOS Pathogens, 2023). However, we now more explicitly refer the reader to information about the pathways targeted in the library. We also point out how initial hits in the library lead to finding genes outside of the starting library as in the follow-up screen in Figure 7 where each of the members of the INT complex are interrogated even though only INTS12 was the only member in the initial library.</p><p>(2) We understand the confusion between the hits in this paper and a previous publication. Indeed, INTS12 was observed in Hsieh et al., PLOS Pathogens, 2023 as a hit in the Venn diagram of Figure 3B of that paper, and in Figure 5A, right panel of that paper. However, it was not followed up on in the previous paper since that paper focused on a hit that was unique to increasing the potency of one particular LRA. We added text to the present manuscript to make it clear that the screens identified many of the same hits. We have also added additional data here on hit validation to underscore the reliability of the CRISPR screen. In one of the cell lines (5A8), EZH2 was a strong hit (Figure 1B). We have now added data that shows that an inhibitor to EZH2 augments the latency reversal of AZD5582/I-BET151 as predicted from the screen. This data has been added to Figure 1, figure supplement 1.</p><p>(3) We appreciate the concern that for INTS12 to be a drug target, it should not be essential to cell viability. We now show that knockout of INTS12 has no effect on cell proliferation (new data added in Figure 2—figure supplement 3). In addition, the discussion now adds additional literature references that describe how knockout of INTS12 has relatively minor effects on cell functions in comparison to knockout of other INT members which supports that the proposal that modulation of INTS12 may be more specific than targeting the catalytic modules of Integrator. Nonetheless, we completely agree with the reviewer that many other aspects of how INTS12 affects T cell functions have not been addressed as well as other potential detrimental effect of INTS12 as a drug target in vivo. We now more explicitly describe these caveats in the discussion but feel that the present manuscript is a first step with a long path ahead before the translational potential might be realized.</p><p>(4) We now cite the review of CRISPR screens suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Responses to recommendations for the authors</bold>:</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors report in the legend of Figure 2 (and similarly in other figures) that there was &quot;a calculated INTS12 knockout score of 76% (for the one guide used) and 69% (for one of three guides used), respectively.&quot; However, it would be helpful to show representative data on the efficiency of INTS12 knockdown in cell lines and primary cells, as well as data on the efficiency of the complementation (Figure 2C).</p></disp-quote><p>The knockout scores cited are the genetic assays for the efficiency based on sequence files. As the knockouts are done with multiple guides the knockout for each guide is an underestimate of the total knockout. The complementation, however, was done by adding back INTS12 in a lentiviral vector that also contains a drug resistance marker (puromycin). Cells were then selected for puromycin resistance, and therefore, all of them contain the complemented gene. What one would ideally like is a Western blot to quantify the amount of INTS12 remaining in the knockout pools. Unfortunately, despite obtaining multiple different commercial sources of INTS12 antibodies, we were unable to identify one that was suitable for Western blotting (as opposed to two that did work for CUT&amp;Tag). Nonetheless, the functional data in primary T cells from PLWH and in J-Lat cells lines does show the even if the knockout is suboptimal, we find activation after INTS12 knockout (e.g., Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Flow cytometry methods are not reported, but was a viability dye included when testing GFP reactivation (Figure S2)? More broadly, showing data on the viability of cells post-knockdown and drug treatments would help, as cell mortality is inherently associated with latency reactivation in J-Lat cells. For the same reason, reporting viability data would be important for primary cells, as the electroporation procedure can lead to significant mortality.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not include viability dyes in the data for GFP activation. However, as described in the public response, we have done growth curves in J-Lat 10.6 cells with and without INTS12 knockout and find no effects on cell proliferation (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). As the reviewer points out, it is not possible to do these experiments in primary cells since the electroporation itself causes a degree of cell death. Nonetheless, we do see effects on HIV activation in these primary cells (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure S2 shows a relatively high baseline expression (approximately 15%) of HIV-GFP, which is not unusual for the J-Lat 10.6 clone. However, Figure 3 appears to show no HIV RNA reads in the control condition of this same cell clone. How do the authors reconcile this discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the discrepancies in the flow cytometry versus RNA-seq assays are due to differences in the sensitivity of the assays, the linear range of the assays especially at the lower end, and the different half-lives of RNA versus protein. We now clarify that Figure 3 does not show “no” HIV RNA at baseline, but rather values of ~30 copies per million read counts. This increases to ~800 copies per million read counts when INTS12 knockout cells are treated with AZD5582/I-BET151. These values have the same fold change predicted in Figure 4, and more closely resemble the trend in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The combination of AZD5582 and I-BET151 consistently reactivates HIV latency (including GFP protein expression), as previously reported and as shown here by the authors. However, in Figure 5B, RPB3/RNAPII occupancy in the DMSO control appears higher than in the AAVS1KO + AZD5582 and I-BET151 samples. This should be discussed, as it could raise concerns about the robustness of RPB3/RNAPII occupancy results as a proxy for provirus elongation.</p></disp-quote><p>As addressed in the public comments, in order to strengthen our claims about transcriptional elongation control, we measured RNAPII Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation levels. We see evidence of elongation with Ser2 in the condition of concern (AAVS1 KO + AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151) as well as our main condition of interest (INTS12 KO + AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151) and no change in Ser5 for any condition. With both the Ser2 phosphorylation and total RNAPII as well as our virus release and transcription data we believe that we are seeing evidence of increased elongation with INTS12 KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151. One potential nuance that may not be gathered from the CUT&amp;Tag data is the turnover rate of the polymerase. Despite the levels of RNAPII appearing lower in the condition of concern (AAVS1 KO + AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151) compared to DMSO it is possible that low levels of elongation are occurring but that in our INTS12 KO + AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 condition there is more rapid elongation and this is why we can observe more RNAPII within HIV. This new data is added in Figure 5C and Figure 5—supplement 2 and its implications are now described in more detail in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors write that &quot;Degree of reactivation was correlated with reservoir size as donors PH504 (star symbol) and PH543 (upside down triangle) have the largest HIV reservoirs (supplemental Figure S2).&quot; I could not find mention of the reservoir size of these donors in the figure provided.</p></disp-quote><p>This confusion was caused by mislabeling of the supplement number, which we fixed, and we added additional labeling to make finding the reservoir size even more clear as this is an important part of the manuscript. This is now found in Supplemental file S4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The MAGeCK gene score is a feature that is essential for the interpretation of the results in Figure 1. The authors do quote the Li et al. paper where this score was described for the first time (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0554-4">https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0554-4</ext-link>), however, they may understand that not all readers may be familiar with this score. Therefore a didactic short description of this score should be done when introducing the results in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a short description to the paper to address this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 4. The authors write: &quot;Among the host genes most prominently affected by INTS12 knockout with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 are MAFA, MAFB, and ID2 (full list of genes in supplemental file S3).&quot; I am a bit confused. In the linked Excel file there is only a list of a few genes. The differentially expressed genes appear to be many more from Figure 4. The full list should be uploaded.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe there was a mistake in our original uploading and naming of the supplements. We have now double-checked numbering on the supplements and added in text clarification of which excel tabs hold the desired information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 6: The authors are right in highlighting that there is a high level of variability in viral RNA in supernatants in the early stages of viral reactivation. It is therefore advisable to repeat measurements at Day 7, at which variability decreases and data are more reliable (please, see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00443-7/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00443-7/fulltext</ext-link>).</p></disp-quote><p>While it would have been nice to prolong these measurements, our current assay conditions are not optimal for longer term growth of the cells. We note that the measurements were all done in biological triplicates (independent knockouts) and in different individuals. Because the number of activatable latent proviruses is variable and the number of cells tested is limiting, the variability in the assays is expected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 7: The main genes outside the INTS family should be identified, also.</p></disp-quote><p>We include the full list in supplemental file S5 and sort by most enriched.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Methods: A statistical paragraph should be added in the Methods section, detailing the data analysis procedures and the key parameters utilized (for example, which is the MAGeCK gene score threshold that they used to consider knockdown efficacy on HIV latency?).</p></disp-quote><p>There is no MAGeCK score threshold that we use to determine efficacy on HIV latency. In a previous publication using CRISPR screens for HIV Dependency Factors (Montoya et al, mBio 2023), we showed that there is a relationship between the MAGeCK and the effect of that gene knockout on HIV replication (Figure 5 that paper). However, it is a continuum rather than a strict threshold and we believe that the effects on HIV latency would respond similarly. In the current paper, we have focused on the top hits rather than a comprehensive analysis of all the entire list. In case the reviewer is referring to the average and standard deviation of the non-targeting controls, we have added this to the figure legend and methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
