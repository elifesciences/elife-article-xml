coordination of gene expression on a genomic scale. Here we show that in vivo delivery of an engineered DNA-binding protein uncoupled from the repressor domain can produce efficient and gene-specific transcriptional silencing. To interfere with RHODOPSIN (<italic>RHO</italic>) gain-of-function mutations we engineered the ZF6-DNA-binding protein (ZF6-DB) that targets 20 base pairs (bp) of a <italic>RHOcis</italic>-regulatory element (CRE) and demonstrate <italic>Rho</italic> specific transcriptional silencing upon adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated expression in photoreceptors. The data show that the 20 bp-long genomic DNA sequence is necessary for <italic>RHO</italic> expression and that photoreceptor delivery of the corresponding cognate synthetic trans-acting factor ZF6-DB without the intrinsic transcriptional repression properties of the canonical ED blocks <italic>Rho</italic> expression with negligible genome-wide transcript perturbations. The data support DNA-binding-mediated silencing as a novel mode to treat gain-of-function mutations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12242.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12242.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12242.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins called transcription factors bind to sections of DNA known as regulatory elements to activate or deactivate nearby genes. In animals, transcription factors typically have two sections: a “DNA-binding domain” that attaches to DNA, and an “effector domain” that is responsible for interacting with other proteins to regulate the gene’s expression.</p><p><italic>Rhodopsin</italic> is a gene that encodes the instructions needed to make a light-sensitive protein in the eyes of humans and other animals. Botta et al. have now used this gene as an example to investigate whether proteins that contain a DNA-binding domain – but not an effector domain – can repress gene expression.</p><p>The experiments show that only a small section of the regulatory elements in the human <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> gene is actually required for the gene to be expressed. Botta et al. designed an artificial protein – referred to as ZF6-DB – that is able to bind to this section of DNA. The binding of ZF6-DB to this short DNA section was sufficient to switch off a <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> gene in living pig cells, and, unlike conventional transcription factors, seemed to have minimal impact other genes.</p><p>Next, Botta et al. used a virus to insert both the gene that encodes ZF6-DB and a normal copy of <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> into pigs. In these animals, ZF6-DB switched off the existing copy of <italic>Rhodopsin</italic>, but not the inserted copy so the cells produced a working form of the light-sensitive protein. Further experiments were carried out in mice that have both a faulty version and a normal copy of the <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> gene. ZF6-DB switched off the faulty <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> gene, which allowed the normal <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> gene to work without any interference from the faulty copy.</p><p>Mutations in <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> can cause an eye disease that leads to severe loss of vision in humans. These new findings could now guide future efforts to develop treatments for people with this condition. It will also be important to investigate how ZF6-DB binds to the regulatory elements in the <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> gene and whether a similar strategy could be used to alter the expression of other genes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12242.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12242.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>AAV</kwd><kwd>rhodopsin</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>gene therapy</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>zinc finger</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>311682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Surace</surname><given-names>Enrico Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002426</institution-id><institution>Fondazione Telethon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TMESMT211TT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Surace</surname><given-names>Enrico Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Photoreceptor genomic binding of a 20 base-pair-long DNA sequence by a synthetic DNA-binding protein turns off Rhodopsin expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription factors (TFs) operate by entangling their DNA-binding and transcriptional activation or repression functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ptashne, 2014</xref>). However, in eukaryotes TF DNA binding and effector activities are typically structurally modular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brent, 1985</xref>) consisting of a DNA-binding domain (DBD) controlling the TF topology on genomic targets and an effector domain (ED) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brent, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kadonaga, 2004</xref>) that recruits co-activator or co-repressor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Malik and Roeder, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perissi et al., 2010</xref>) resulting in either transcriptional activation or repression of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Neph et al., 2012</xref>). Engineered TFs mimic the design of natural TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pavletich and Pabo, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beerli and Barbas, 2002</xref>). To generate target specificity the DBD module is engineered to recognize unique genome sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beerli and Barbas, 2002</xref>), whereas the transcriptional activation or repressor properties are conferred by the selection of the ED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Konermann et al., 2013</xref>). To silence gain-of-function mutations, while studying the features of genomic DNA-TF interactions, here we investigated the hypothesis that engineered DNA-binding proteins without canonical ED activity possess transcriptional repression properties. As a transcriptional repression target we selected the G-protein-coupled Receptor Rhodopsin (RHO) gene whose gain-of-function mutations are those most commonly associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), an incurable form of blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dryja et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>We generated a DNA-binding protein targeted to a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element (CRE) of the human proximal <italic>RHO</italic> promoter region by deconstructing an engineered TF (synthetic) composed of a DBD (ZF6-DNA-binding protein, ZF6-DB) and the ED (Kruppel-associated box, KRAB repressor domain, KRAB), which we have shown to be effective in repressing specifically the human <italic>RHO</italic> transgene carried in an adRP mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mussolino et al., 2011a</xref>). The deletion of the ED resulted in a protein, ZF6-DB targeting 20 base pairs of genomic CRE, here named ZF6-cis, found at -84 bp to -65 bp from the transcription start site (TSS) of the human RHO gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mitton et al., 2000</xref>). Genomic ZF6-cis is without apparent photoreceptor-specific endogenous transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kwasnieski et al., 2012</xref>). To study the CRE features of ZF6-cis that ZF6-DB would interfere with upon binding in the absence of KRAB-mediated co-repressor recruitment, we deleted the 20 bp genomic ZF6-cis sequence and assessed its function by eGFP reporter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kwasnieski et al., 2012</xref>) in living porcine retina by AAV delivery. The 776 bp-long <italic>RHO</italic> promoter fragment carrying the ZF6-cis deletion upstream of the eGFP reporter gene (AAV-RHO-cis-del-EGFP), after delivery to the porcine retinal photoreceptor, showed loss of eGFP expression compared to the control vector (AAV-RHO-EGFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). This suggests that ZF6-cis CRE is necessary for <italic>RHO</italic> expression (at least for the 776 bp region used in the assay) and that binding of the synthetic ZF6-DB trans-acting counterpart of ZF6-cis, may indeed repress <italic>RHO</italic> transcription.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12242.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Delivery of ZF6-DB DNA-binding synthetic trans-acting factor targeted to a 20 bp of <italic>RHO</italic> cis-acting regulatory element (CRE) dramatically reduces <italic>Rho</italic> expression in photoreceptors.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the chromosomal location of the <italic>RHO</italic> locus and its proximal promoter elements indicating the transcription start site (in green, +1) and the location of ZF6-DB binding site (in red, ZF6-Cis) and ZF6-DB (based on Mitton <italic>et Al.,</italic> 12); BAT1, Bovine A/T-rich sequence1; NRE, NRL response element; TBP, TATA box binding protein.

To evaluate whether ZF6-DB represses transcription of the <italic>RHO</italic> gene in a physiological genomic context, we used the porcine retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mussolino et al., 2011b</xref>), which shares 19 out of 20 DNA bp with the human genomic ZF6-cis sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Subretinal delivery of a low AAV8 vector dose (1x10<sup>10</sup> genome copies; gc) of ZF6-DB (AAV8-CMV-ZF6-DB) resulted in a 45% decrease of porcine <italic>Rho</italic> transcript levels at 15 days post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis showed depletion of Rho protein and consequent collapse of the rod outer segments in ZF6-DB positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref>). Despite the lack of detectable <italic>Rho</italic> expression in most of the transduced rods, rows of photoreceptor nuclei were preserved from degeneration at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). To further evaluate the extent of <italic>Rho</italic> silencing in rod photoreceptors by ZF6-DB, we performed FACS analysis on eGFP-labelled rod cells. Rod cells were isolated from porcine retina that had received a subretinal injection of an AAV vector encoding eGFP under the control of a rod-specific promoter (human <italic>Guanine Nucleotide Binding Protein1, GNAT1</italic> promoter elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lee et al., 2010</xref>); AAV8-GNAT1-eGFP; dose 1x10<sup>12</sup> gc) with or without the vector encoding ZF6-DB (5x10<sup>10</sup> gc). Fifteen days after injection, the retina were disaggregated and FACS-sorted. The retina co-transduced with eGFP and ZF6-DB vector showed virtually a 'somatic knock-out' of <italic>Rho</italic> expression (~85% decrease of Rho transcript levels; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g,h</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate genome–wide transcriptional specificity, we analyzed the porcine retinal transcriptome by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) from retina harvested 15 days after subretinal injection of the AAV8 vector encoding ZF6-DB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For comparison we used the engineered TF with the ED, KRAB (AAV8-CMV-ZF6-KRAB). The low vector doses delivered to the porcine retina (1x10<sup>10</sup> gc) resulted in about twenty-fold lower expression levels of the ZF6-DB and ZF6-KRAB transgenes compared to <italic>Crx</italic> and <italic>Nrl</italic>, two retina-specific TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Swaroop et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Of note, despite these low expression levels, we observed robust <italic>Rho</italic> transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We then analyzed the transcriptional perturbation in response to the AAV retinal gene transfer of ZF6-DB by determining the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Remarkably, <italic>in vivo</italic> the ZF6-DB protein generated about ten-fold less transcriptional perturbation compared with the ZF6-KRAB protein (19 vs. 222 DEGs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Notably, this magnitude of perturbation is twenty five-fold lower than that induced by the ablation of an endogenous rod-specific TF (NRL, 500 DEGs vs 19 DEGs, ZF6-DBD; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Roger et al., 2014</xref>]). Retinal-specific pathway analysis of DEGs showed that ZF6-DB–induced down-regulation is restricted to the <italic>Rho</italic> biochemical interactor <italic>Gnat1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Palczewski, 2012</xref>), and the up-regulation of 2 genes associated with acute phase inflammatory response, <italic>alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2m</italic>) and <italic>glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). ZF6-KRAB induced the de-regulation of 17 retinal network associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that both ZF6-DB and the consequent <italic>Rho</italic> down-regulation marginally interferes with photoreceptor specific pathways, apart from <italic>Gnat1</italic> repression, and that the up-regulation of the inflammatory response genes may be due to the collapse of the retinal scaffold caused by Rho depletion. The intersection of retinal transcriptome changes between ZF6-DB and ZF6-KRAB showed that both drive similar perturbation in the expression of 16 genes, which represent 84% of the entire pool of ZF6-DB DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Consistently, both ZF6-DB and ZF6-KRAB generated similar functional effects, i.e. concordant up- or down- differential expression of these 16 shared genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). These results suggest that both ZF6-DB and ZF6-KRAB bind to similar genomic targets. We next studied whether the differential transcriptional repression induced by ZF6-DB and ZF6-KRAB was due to similar biochemical binding properties for the ZF6-cis DNA target. Both ZF6-DB and ZF6-KRAB proteins bind the ZF6-cis <italic>RHO</italic> DNA target site with similar affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data suggest that, despite the presence of an active canonical repressor domain, ZF6-KRAB generated <italic>Rho</italic> silencing by DNA binding. Indeed, ZF6-DB, being exclusively a DNA-binding protein identical to the DBD of ZF6-KRAB, showed similar <italic>Rho</italic> silencing effects but far less retinal transcriptional perturbations. This indicates that the specificity is conferred by both the engineered design of the DNA-binding on a genome-specific target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beerli and Barbas, 2002</xref>) and the lack of the ED.

The combination of <italic>Rho</italic> transcriptional silencing and the restricted transcriptome perturbation induced by ZF6-DB, without the intrinsic repression activity contained in an ED, indicate that the local binding to ZF6-cis per se is the determinant of transcriptional repression, whereas the high specificity observed may result by both DNA-binding specificity (biochemical affinity) of ZF6-DB and the rod genomic context. The transcriptional repression mechanism of ZF6-DB binding likely relies on the interference occurring between TFs and local DNA sequence features within the <italic>RHO</italic> proximal promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mitton et al., 2000</xref>), which we showed here to be necessary to control <italic>Rho</italic> expression at the genomic level. The lack of known TFBSs and the low level of expression of ZF6-DB expressed in the photoreceptors, which was twenty-fold below the levels of photoreceptor specific TFs (<italic>Crx</italic> and <italic>Nrl</italic>), suggest that the molecular determinant of silencing may not be the simple displacement of key <italic>RHO</italic> TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). We propose a model in which the molecular features of the DNA (loop, twisting, bending, for instance) may contribute to <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> transcriptional output. In this context, the DNA may be envisaged as not being exclusively the source of storage of functional information (protein coding and non-coding transcripts) or an inert DNA-binding protein harbor (i.e. positional information for TFs DNA binding), but also as an intrinsically active operator of the transcriptional function. This contribution of DNA is supported by both the transcriptional repression upon the ZF6-cis deletion of 20 bp of DNA and intereference in trans by using a synthetic DNA binding protein that, not being encoded by the genome, may occupy a protein-free portion of the genome. It follows that in terms of signaling, the information source, the DNA, generates an output signal the RNA and eventually a protein (TF), whose final output functional activity is completed back by the DNA. Thus the information source, the DNA, becomes also integral part of the signaling (<italic>Rhodopsin</italic> transcriptional output). In this vision, to act (interfere) upstream the DNA, an external function is necessary, which is, in this study, the synthetic ZF6-DB carried by the vector.</p><p>From a therapeutic prospective, a relevant property of ZF6-DB DNA binding interference is the high rate of transcriptional silencing observed after in vivo gene transfer, which is consistent with canonical TFs mode of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kiang et al., 2005</xref>). DNA binding interference via ZF6-DB in transduced retina generated 45% <italic>Rho</italic> transcriptional repression, which reached 85% when rods were sorted, supporting its use for diseases requiring correction of a large number of affected cells, such as adRP and other Mendelian disorders due to gain-of-function mutations. Furthermore, <italic>Rho</italic> transcriptional silencing and its complete <italic>RHO</italic> replacement support in principle the use of the DBR-R constructs for treatment of any <italic>RHO</italic> mutation including those caused by a dominant negative mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). However, the 38% silencing and replacement observed may not yet be sufficient to achieve therapeutic efficacy/benefit in patients with adRP. Therefore, further development of this proof-of-concept will include optimization of the design of the silencing and replacement double construct (tuning the strength of the promoter elements), vector selection and dose, and the surgical approach.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mussolino et al., 2011b</xref>). This retinal region is crossed by a streak-like region that extends from the nasal to the temporal edge parallel to the horizontal meridian, where cone density is high, reaching 20,000 to 35,000 cone cells mm<sup>2</sup>. Each viral vector was injected in a total volume of 100 µl, resulting in the formation of a subretinal bleb with a typical ‘dome-shaped’ retinal detachment, with a size corresponding to 5 optical discs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cloning and Purification of the proteins</title><p>DNA fragments encoding the sequence of the engineered transcription factors and ZF6-KRAB, to be expressed as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion were generated by PCR using the plasmids pAAV2.1 CMV-ZF6-KRAB and pAAV2.1 CMV-ZF6-DB as a DNA template. The following oligonucleotides were used as primers: primer 1, (GGAATTCCATATGGAATTCCCCATGGATGC) and primer 2, (CGGGATCCCTATCTAGAAGTCTTTTTACCGGTATG), for ZF6-KRAB primer 3, (GGAATTCCATATGCTGGAACCTGGCGAAAAACCG) and primer 4,(CGGGATCCCTATCTAGAAGTCTTTTTACCGGTATG) for ZF6-DB. All the PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and BamH1 and cloned into NdeI BamH1-digested pMal C5G (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) bacterial expression vector. All the plasmids obtained were sequenced to confirm that there were no mutations in the coding sequences. The fusion proteins were expressed in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21DE3 host strain. The transformed cells were grown in rich medium plus 0.2% glucose (according to protocol from New England Biolabs) at 37°C until the absorbance at 600 nm was 0.6–0.8, at which time the medium was supplemented with 200 µM ZnSO4, and protein expression was induced with 0.3 mM isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and was allowed to proceed for 2 hr. The cells were then harvested, resuspended in 1X PBS (pH 7.4), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µM leupeptin, 1 µM aprotinin, and 10 µg/ml lysozyme, sonicated, and centrifuged for 30 min at 27,500 relative centrifugal force. The supernatant was then loaded on amylose resin (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To remove the MBP from the proteins, bound fusion proteins as cleaved in situ on the amylose resin with Factor Xa (1 unit/20 µg of MBP fusion protein) in FXa buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaC1, 2 mM CaC1<sub>2</sub>) for 24–48 hr at 4°C and collected in the same buffer after centrifugation at 500 relative centrifugal force for 5 min. The supernatant containing the protein without the MBP tag was then recovered.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Gel mobility shift analysis</title><p>The affinity binding costant of proteins for <italic>hRHO</italic> proximal promoter sequence was measured by a gel mobility shift assay by performing a titration of the proteins with the oligonucleotides.

After incubation, the mixture was loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio) and run in 0.5 TBE at 4°C (200 V for 4 hr). Protein concentration was determined by a modified version of the Bradford procedure. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with the fluorescent dyes SYBR Green I Nucleic acid gel stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to visualize DNA. 2.5 µM of the ZF6-KRAB protein was incubated with increasing concentrations (130, 135, 145, 150, 165, 170, 175, 180, 190, and 200 nM, respectively) of the duplex hRHO 65 bp, an apparent higher protein concentration (2.5 µM) was required likely because not all the protein sample was correctly folded. In the case of ZF6-DB, 1.5 µM of the protein was incubated with increasing concentrations (145, 150, 170, 175, 195, 210, 220, 225, 240, and 250 nM, respectively) of the duplex hRho 65 bp.

Brifley, mice were dark reared for 3 hr and anesthetized. Flash electroretinograms (ERGs) were evoked by 10-ms light flashes generated through a Ganzfeld stimulator (CSO, Costruzione Strumenti Oftalmici, Florence, Italy) and registered as previously described. ERGs and b-wave thresholds were assessed using the following protocol. Eyes were stimulated with light flashes increasing from −5.2 to +1.3 log cd*s/m<sup>2</sup> (which correspond to 1×10<sup>−5.2</sup> to 20.0 cd*s/m<sup>2</sup>) in scotopic conditions.

For ERG analysis in scotopic conditions the responses evoked by 11 stimuli (from −4 to +1.3 log cd*s/m<sup>2</sup>) with an interval of 0.6 log unit were considered. To minimize the noise, three ERG responses were averaged at each 0.6 log unit stimulus from −4 to 0.0 log cd*s/m<sup>2</sup> while one ERG response was considered for higher (0.0−+1.3 log cd*s/m<sup>2</sup>) stimuli.

Also, we think that this manuscript would be a better fit as a &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; paper rather than a regular research paper.</p><p>The main issues, which I have extracted from the reviews and the subsequent discussion between the reviewers and me, are:</p><p>1) Revisions to the text that focus the story on use of the ZF6-DB to suppress RHO expression. This could be accomplished by changing the title, and revising the Introduction and Discussion. We would favor moderating the claims about potential clinical use of this approach since the repression-replacement approach wasn't tested in a disease model.</p><p>2) There is a question of ZF6-DB specificity and efficiency. Please provide the porcine, human, and mouse RHO TSS sequences for comparison, since it appears that the ZF6-DB recognizing hRHO TSS was used in these models regardless of any differences between the sequences. Does ZF6-DB recognize the porcine and mouse sequence? As to clinical therapeutic potential, how do the pig and human repression efficiencies compare? Is the 35% repression of Rho expression sufficient for dominant disease? These are important questions that could be addressed by supplying the sequences and the related data.</p><p>3) It is unclear why cone arrestin increases in Arr3. This suggests that there may be off-target effects. Does ZF6-DB also bind to the Arr3 TSS region? ChIP data should be supplied to address off-target issues.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> would benefit from the presentation of wild type mouse data. For example, eGFP, ZF6-KRAB, and ZF6-DB treatments of wild type mice to serve as a point of comparison and investigate the efficiency of ZF6-DB suppression of human and mouse rhodopsin respectively.</p><p>5) Regarding the repression-replacement experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it is not clear why a different promoter (CMV) was used in the control ZF6-DB vector than that used for the ZF6-DB cassette (modified RHO promoter) in the in the experimental ZF6-DB – RHO expression vector.</p><p>6) The level of repression of the RHO gene achieved in the repression-replacement experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is moderate. It is likely that greater than 35% suppression of a mutant RHO allele would be needed to have a therapeutic effect for patients affected by retinal degeneration due to gain-of-function mutations in RHO. While the data reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> suggest that repression of RHO expression in transduced photoreceptor cells is closer to 90%, it is unclear if suppressing RHO expression in 35% of photoreceptor cells would be therapeutic. Additional experiments to optimize the dose response and evaluate the potential of this approach for therapeutic use are needed to support the claim that a ZF6-DB based approach has the potential to be used clinically.</p><p>7) Clarity of presentation as indicated below by reviewers #2 and #3.</p><p>We look forward to receiving the revised version of your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Summary: Botta et al. report a method for gene-specific transcriptional silencing using an engineered DNA-binding domain, &quot;ZF6-DB.&quot; AAV-mediated expression of ZF6-DB in photoreceptors resulted in blockade of Rho expression, leading to therapeutic effects in animal models with gain-of-function cis- Rho mutations, such as autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.</p><p>Feedback:</p><p>Experiment 1-showed the 20 bp in ZF6-cis is required for Rho expression via eGFP reporter assay. ChIP showed ZF6-DB binds well to CRE. Put ZF6-DB into porcine retina using AAV and measured Rho transcripts, which were decreased. Finally, they compared ZF6-DB with eGFP expression levels</p><p>Criticism: n = 2 is a low number. They should supplement their claims with additional data points.</p><p>Experiment 2-Compared Rho transcription levels between ZF6-KRAB and ZF6-DB, found greater repression using ZF6-DB and less transcriptional perturbation.</p><p>Criticism: They claim that ZF6-KRAB and ZF6-DB bind to same genomic targets, but they didn't explain or otherwise address the possibility that the difference in the transcription perturbations may in fact be caused by off-targeting effects or the down-regulation of RHO expression. Should perform ChIP to confirm the two are binding to the same region (as well as Crx and Nrl). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> is confusing: comparing before and after ZF6-DB treatments, rather than different constructs would be more helpful.</p><p>Experiment 3-Compared the ERG a and b waves in the P347S RP murine model and saw much greater rescue in ZF6-DB compared with ZF6-KRAB or eGFP.</p><p>Criticism: they should further explore the reason that ZF6-DB has such a greater rescue than ZF6-KRAB despite their similar binding affinity (according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is a surprising discrepancy that merits exploration and explanation. It would also be helpful for them to repeat this experiment in wild type animals to see if ZF6-DB also represses RHO expression and compare the percentage of repression in wild type and R347S alleles.</p><p>Experiment 4-Created construct with ZF6-DB and hRHO and found suppression of mutant mouse Rho and expression of the hRHO.</p><p>Criticism: unclear why they didn't consistently use the CMV promoter and opted for the truncated Rho promoter, despite similar repression levels of RHO. Any rescue beyond P30?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes the use of a synthetic DNA binding protein to interfere with expression of the RHO gene. The experiments described build on prior work in which a hybrid protein consisting of a DNA binding domain coupled to a KRAB repressor domain was used to repress expression of the RHO gene. In this study, the activity of the DNA binding domain alone was evaluated.</p><p>It seems that the manuscript attempts to achieve two goals, and does not completely succeed for either. One focus is the potentially general idea that DNA binding proteins alone targeted to regulatory elements can be used to regulate expression of target genes. The data presented regarding the ZF6-DB for RHO support this idea, but without testing this hypothesis for other genes, the potential to use this approach more generally remains in question. The second focus is the idea that repression of RHO could be used therapeutically in patients with retinal degeneration caused by dominant, gain-of-function mutations in this gene. Since the ZF6-DB mediated repression of RHO expression isn't specific for the mutant allele, a repression-replacement strategy would be needed in patients. The tests of this approach described in the manuscript show some efficacy, but fall short of being convincing.</p><p>Specific comments are as follows:</p><p>1) Additional studies of the ZF6-DB approach with 1 or more additional genes would be needed to support the hypothesis that DNA binding proteins can be used broadly to regulate gene expression. Such data needs to be added to the manuscript, or the manuscript needs to be revised to focus on the specific application of this approach to the RHO gene.</p><p>2) The level of repression of the RHO gene achieved in the repression-replacement experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is moderate. It is likely that greater than 35% suppression of a mutant RHO allele would be needed to have a therapeutic effect for patients affected by retinal degeneration due to gain-of-function mutations in RHO. While the data reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> suggest that repression of RHO expression in transduced photoreceptor cells is closer to 90%, it is unclear if suppressing RHO expression in 35% of photoreceptor cells would be therapeutic. Additional experiments to optimize the dose response and evaluate the potential of this approach for therapeutic use are needed to support the claim that a ZF6-DB based approach has the potential to be used clinically.</p><p>3) Along these lines, the experiment testing the activity of the ZF6-DB in the transgenic RHO-P347S mice is helpful, but does not support the use of the ZF6-DB mediated RHO repression approach in patients, since the mutant human transgene is present on a mouse background. It would be better to test the activity of the ZF6-DB in a model with a mutant mouse allele, and include the complete repression-replacement approach in these studies.</p><p>4) The ChIP experiment is helpful to show occupancy of the RHO CRE by ZF6-DB. It would be helpful to report what other sequences were detected in the ChIP experiment. That is, what else does the RHO ZF6-DB bind to? Additional ChIP data to address the question of what proteins normally occupy the RHO regulatory element would also be helpful.</p><p>5) The repression of GNAT1 expression observed following treatment with the RHO ZF6-DB is interesting. Is there a similar CRE upstream of the GNAT1 gene? Or is some other mechanism responsible to the linked regulation of expression, as suggested by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? Further exploration of this issue is warranted.</p><p>6) The relative specificity of the ZF6-DB activity compared to that observed using the hybrid ZF6-DB-KRAB ED protein is impressive. Other studies have used more than 30 million sequence reads to sample gene expression by the neural retina thoroughly. It would be helpful to know why 30 million reads were used in this study, and if this provides complete sampling of retinal transcripts.</p><p>7) The discussion about the mechanism of ZFN-DB activity is interesting, but is beyond the data available in the current manuscript. The Discussion would be better focusing on interpreting the data in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Botta and colleagues report on in vivo targeted silencing of rhodopsin expression by transcription factor proteins -with and without effector domain (ED)- engineered to recognize a 20 bp-cis-regulatory element of the proximal region of the rhodopsin promoter. They provide data which support the view that both engineered transcription factor proteins, with and without ED, suppresses rhodospin expression by DNA binding with similar affinities to the 20 bp-cis-regulatory element. They show that the engineered transcription factor lacking the effector domain silences rather specifically the expression of rhodopsin gene as determined by transcriptome analyses. They report that AAV-based delivery of the engineered rhodopsin-specific transcription factor protein without ED to the retina of a transgenic mouse with a human rhodopsin gene harboring a dominant negative RHO mutation prevented retinal degeneration. Finally, as a first step towards the use of this original strategy in the clinics, they nicely demonstrate that AAV-based delivery of pig-specific rhodospin silencing transcription factor protein without ED and of human Rhodopsin permitted preservation of retinal cells which deprived of pig-rhodopsin expressed the human counterpart.</p><p>This is very nicely designed and executed study with real therapeutic promises. I have no major concern regarding the scientific aspects of this sound work.</p><p>I have however a major critic regarding the writing of the manuscript which makes this beautiful piece of work sometimes very hard to follow. Here are some points to clarify:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A: I</xref> would suggest to show clearly which nucleotide corresponds to +1 and which is the -84 -65 ZF6-cis sequence and to provide a legend mentioning each of the CRE that appear on the scheme.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C and 1E</xref> are a little confusing as in 1C the green corresponds to the e-GFP whereas in 1E that is just below the green labels the rhodopsin.</p><p>3) Anti-HA is used both in immunochemistry and CHIP analysis but it is not clearly mentioned that the constructs which were used encode this flag.</p><p>4) CHIP-seq analysis: I would suggest to precise before giving the results a short sentence describing what was done, i.e. AAV-based delivery of constructs encoding eGFP or silencing transcription factor protein with or without ED in HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitation using the HA tag and RT-PCR amplification using primers flanking (where are they by the way?). The supporting figure is obscure. What are the MOCKs? Why is there no mention of the results using the CMV-ZF6-KRAB construct?</p><p>In these experiments AAV2.1vectors were used whereas some others used AAV8. Not all the readers are aware of their tropism differences.</p><p>5) Transcriptomic analyses. Despite the importance of this analysis I have been unable to find in the manuscript reference to what was exactly done. How were the transduced cells collected? Were the transduced regions microdissected and then the rods FACs sorted? How were the mRNA outputs from the transduced versus the untransduced regions matched?</p><p>Overall, I would suggest the authors to submit their revised manuscript to a colleague that is not involved in this work to ensure clarity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;RHODOPSIN-targeted transcriptional silencing by DNA-binding&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The differences in sequence present in the mouse RHO TSS make it resistant to the activity of the ZF6-DB. As now shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the use of the ZF6-DB in wild-type mice did not result in any detectable effects as assessed by ERG analysis, thus supporting the specificity of the effect of ZF6-DB on both the human RHO promoter (present as a transgene in the P347S mouse model of adRP) and on the porcine RHO promoter.</p><p>Regarding the 35% repression of Rho expression in the whole porcine retina we agree that it might not be sufficient to treat a dominant disease such as adRP, although in singularly transduced cell (sorted rods) the repression almost reached 90%.

Currently, we are testing a series of mutant promoter elements with different strengths at a fixed vector dose to determine the impact on expression of ZF6-DB and in turn on Rho repression levels with the final aim of improving the overall suppression of Rho on the whole retina.
