This epigenetic signature correlates with an enrichment for an astrocytic gene signature, which together with the identification of enriched predicted binding sites of transcription factors known to cause demethylation and to be involved in astrocytic/glial lineage specification, point to a shared ontogeny between these glioblastomas and astroglial progenitors. At functional level, increased invasiveness, at least in part mediated by SRPX2, and macrophage infiltration characterise this subset of glioblastoma.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glioblastoma</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence QMUL</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CoE QMUL</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boot</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosser</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name><name><surname>Vinel</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name><name><surname>Pomella</surname><given-names>Nicola</given-names></name><name><surname>Guglielmi</surname><given-names>Loredana</given-names></name><name><surname>Marino</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C23985/A29199</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xinyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Marino</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Barts Charity</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MGU0447</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marino</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute for Health Research UCLH BRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(BRC399/NS/RB/101410</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Yau Mun</given-names></name><name><surname>Brandner</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A proportion of glioblastoma with global hypo-methylation are enriched for an astrocytic signature and display increased invasion and altered immune landscape.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glioblastoma IDH-wildtype (now renamed glioblastoma) is a highly aggressive brain tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wen and Kesari, 2008</xref>), with an extremely poor prognosis of 15 monthsâ median survival from diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcantara Llaguno and Parada, 2016</xref>). Glioblastoma is also the most prevalent primary adult brain tumour with an annual occurrence of approximately five cases per 100,000 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wen and Kesari, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Omuro and DeAngelis, 2013</xref>) and a mean diagnosis age of 64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bush et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Part of the difficulty in researching and treating glioblastoma is the heterogeneity of the tumour, both at inter- and intra-tumoural levels. Inter-tumoural heterogeneity reflects differences at the (epi)genetic level which is illustrated by the classification of glioblastomas into different subgroups, such as the transcription-based subgrouping proposed by the Verhaak group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2017a</xref>), and the DNA methylation-based subgrouping proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sturm, 2012</xref>. However, seminal studies by multiple groups have established that there is also considerable intra-tumoural heterogeneity in glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Patel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couturier et al., 2020</xref>). Established transcriptional glioblastoma subgroups profiles (Proneural, Neural, Classical, and Mesenchymal) are variably expressed in single cells from the same tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Patel et al., 2014</xref>) and tumour cells are characterised by distinct gene expression signatures and cluster separately from one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>). Single cells have also been shown to score highly for multiple gene expression signatures creating hybrid states, which further increases the heterogeneity of the tumour cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couturier et al., 2020</xref>, found that tumour cells fell into a spectrum of states, whereby cells at one end of the spectrum highly expressed neuronal genes, whilst cells at the other end of the spectrum up-regulated astrocytic genes. Subgrouping based on DNA methylation subtyping alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capper et al., 2018</xref>) show less heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sturm, 2012</xref>), although some degree of heterogeneity has been reported in a small number of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wenger et al., 2019</xref>). The tumour microenvironment also contributes to glioblastoma heterogeneity and the crosstalk between malignant cells and for example the inflammosome is well characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daubon et al., 2020</xref>) with macrophages known to drive the transition of cancer cells towards a mesenchymal-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hara et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Whether glioblastoma heterogeneity and its underlying epigenetic makeup is determined by the cell of origin or is acquired during transformation is a matter of debate. The putative cell of origin is thought to be a stem/progenitor cell that acquires the first genetic and/or epigenetic alterations that promote the formation of the tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcantara Llaguno and Parada, 2016</xref>). The debate over the cell of origin in glioblastoma centres around neural stem cells (NSCs) and lineage committed progenitor cells, such as oligodendrocyte, astrocytic, and neuronal precursor cells. NSCs are logically the prime candidate for the cell of origin of glioblastoma, because of their self-renewal potential, differentiation plasticity, and similarity in their gene expression with glioblastoma stem cells (here called glioblastoma initiating cells [GICs]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fan et al., 2019</xref>). A seminal study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>, in mice, showed that deletion of both <italic>Trp53</italic> and <italic>Pten</italic> by Cre recombinase under the control of the <italic>GFAP</italic> promoter increased the proliferative rate and self-renewal capability of NSCs, whilst also inhibiting their ability to differentiate into specific neural lineages, leading to transformation into high-grade malignant gliomas. Importantly, glioblastoma driver mutations have been identified in NSCs of the human subventricular zone (SVZ) in tissue samples obtained from patients, providing for the first-time evidence that these cells can act as cells of origin of glioblastoma in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Further mouse studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2015</xref>) have shown that inducing null alleles of <italic>Nf1</italic>, <italic>Trp53,</italic> and <italic>Pten</italic> using Cre recombinase under the control of NSC-specific <italic>Nestin</italic>, but also oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC)-specific <italic>NG2</italic> or bipotential progenitor cell-specific <italic>Ascl1</italic> led to high-grade glioma, whilst no tumours formed when the same null alleles were induced in mature neurons (<italic>Camk2a-Cre</italic>), immature neurons (<italic>Neurod1-Cre</italic>), and adult neuronal progenitors (<italic>Dtx1-Cre</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2019</xref>). These studies together with other mouse studies have also shown that OPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lu et al., 2016</xref>) and astrocyte precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chow et al., 2011</xref>) can behave as cell of origin of glioblastoma raising the possibility that tumours may originate from glial progenitor cells at different developmental stages, hence contributing to their heterogeneity.</p><p>Here, we leveraged pairs of patient-derived GICs and patient-matched expanded potential stem cells (EPSCs)-derived neural stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vinel et al., 2021</xref>) and progenitor cells to investigate the DNA methylation landscape of GICs as compared to their putative cell of origin in a patient-specific manner to further characterise glioblastoma heterogeneity and its ontogeny.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A DNA hypo-methylation bias in a subset of GBM</title><p>We have recently described the generation of a cohort of 10 pairs of GICs and syngeneic induced NSCs (iNSCs), where the latter has been validated as a suitable proxy for endogenous NSCs at both transcriptional and epigenetic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vinel et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we have leveraged this resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vinel et al., 2021</xref>) to investigate the DNA methylome of GICs as compared to syngeneic iNSCs. DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC array and data processed as described in the Materials and methods. Across the 10 intra-patient comparisons, we visualised the distribution of the median probe delta M values and the proportion of these probes that were either hypo- or hyper-methylated, as well as the number and proportion of hypo- and hyper- methylated regions (differentially methylated regions [DMRs]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel). GICs 19, 30, 31, and 17 stood out as they had over 60% hypo-methylated DMRs, and together had a statistically significant larger proportion of hypo-methylated probes and DMRs as compared to the other six GICs in the cohort. These four GICs were identified as âhypo-biasâ â herein referred to as bias-GICs (B-GICs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This subgrouping did not reflect the known DNA methylation-based classification of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sturm, 2012</xref>; three of the four B-GICs belonged to the RTKI (Proneural) subgroup and one to the RTKII (Classical) subgroup. The GICs without this hypo-bias, herein referred to as non-B-GICs (nB-GICs) were spread across the RTKI, RTKII, and Mesenchymal subgroups. Noticeably, the proportion of hypo-methylated and hyper-methylated DMRs was exaggerated, when patient-specific probes and DMRs were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A DNA hypo-methylation bias in a subset of GBM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The distribution of median probe delta M values (first row), the proportion of hypo- (red) and hyper- (blue) probes (second row), total number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (third row), and the proportion of hypo- and hyper-DMRs (fourth row) for each glioblastoma initiating cell (GIC)-induced neural stem cell (iNSC) comparison (left panel) and using patient-specific probes and DMRs (right panel).

This observation suggested that the hypo-methylation bias was GIC-driven, and not caused by the iNSC comparator, a conclusion which was confirmed when we performed non-syngeneic comparisons between each GIC and each of the iNSCs in our cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). GIC17 was found to be an exception as the proportion of hypo-methylated DMRs was not as high as the other three GICs (19, 30, and 31), and indeed this GIC did not cluster with GICs 19, 30, and 31 in the PCA plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, the average percentage of hypo-methylated DMRs for this GIC was still greater than 60% regardless of the comparator used. Interestingly, the average percentage of hypo-methylated DMRs for GIC26 was also greater than 60%, despite the cell line not meeting this threshold in the syngeneic comparison, possibly due to significant variability of the two biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1:</xref>). The proportion of hypo-methylated DMRs for the remaining GICs varied from 20% to 70%, however the mean percentage of hypo-methylated DMRs was below threshold (60%).</p><p>To validate this observation in an independent GIC cohort, DNA methylation data from the publicly available HGCC resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xie et al., 2015</xref>) was used. The HGCC dataset contains 71 GIC samples and given that non-syngeneic comparisons do not prevent the identification of the hypo-methylation bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), these GICs were compared with iNSCs from our cohort. HGCC GIC lines underwent differential methylation comparisons against four different iNSC lines in turn to determine whether the results were consistent across comparisons. The reported percentage of hypo-methylated DMRs was found to be consistent regardless of the iNSC comparator used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), in keeping with the results of the non-syngeneic comparisons performed in our own cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Given that the percentage of hypo-methylated DMRs in each GIC was determined four times â once for each iNSC comparator, each GIC had to meet a more lenient threshold of 50% hypo-methylated DMRs in all five iNSC comparisons in order to be classified as a B-GIC. Using this threshold, 46.5% of HGCC GICs were found to have a hypo-methylation bias. This was comparable with the proportion in our smaller cohort where we found 5/11 (45.5%) had greater than &lt;50% DMRs and 4/11 (36.4%) had &lt;60% DMRs. Next, for each HGCC GIC, the mean percentage of hypo-methylated DMRs when compared against all iNSCs was determined, to assess the extent of hypo-methylation bias for that GIC. HGCC GICs were stratified into a spectrum of states of either having no hypo-methylation bias (&lt;50% hypo-methylated DMRs), a very low bias (&gt;50%), low bias (&gt;60%), medium bias (&gt;70%), high bias (&gt;80%), or very high bias (&gt;90%). PCA of the 5000 most variable methylation probes across the HGCC GICs showed that PC1 separated patients on the extent of their hypo-methylation bias with very high B-GICs clustering to the right, and those with no bias clustering to the left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). TCGA subgroup classification confirmed no enrichment for a specific subgroup (of the 33 GICs deemed to have a hypo-methylation bias, 15 were Mesenchymal, 4 Proneural, 6 Classical, and 8 Neural), in keeping with the interpretation that the hypo-methylation bias observed is spread across the known glioblastoma subgroups.</p><p>Finally, formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue, which was available for all 10 GIC/iNSC pairs of our cohort, was used as the neoplastic comparator to exclude that the observed hypo-methylation bias was induced in GIC by in vitro culture. Once again, tumours 19, 30, 31, and 17 showed a greater proportion of hypo-methylated DMRs than the remaining six comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, left panel), and the proportion of hypo-methylated DMRs increased when only considering patient-specific DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, right panel).</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a subset of glioblastoma that harbour a DNA hypo-methylation bias when either the bulk tumour or GIC derived thereof are compared to iPSC-derived NSC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>B-GICs are transcriptionally distinct from nB-GICs</title><p>We used matched transcriptomic data from our GICs to assess any impact on transcription of the hypo-methylation bias. PCA based on the top 20% most variably expressed genes recapitulated the grouping of GICs observed at DNA methylome level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) with PC1 largely distinguishing the B-GIC and nB-GIC groups. Three out of four of the B-GICs (17, 19, and 30) grouped together to the right of the PC1 along with one biological replicate from GIC26 â a line characterised by substantial variability between replicas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This grouping of GICs 17, 19, 26, and 30 did not correspond to their transcriptional GBM subgroup as they are RTKII, RTKI, MES, and RTKI, respectively. The remaining nB-GICs largely clustered together to the left of the PC2, with one of the B-GICs â GIC31 â lying between these two groups. Despite these differences at transcriptome level, patient-matched pairs of GICs and iNSCs did not reveal a bias in the directionality of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that the hypo-methylation bias does not translate to a bias in gene up- or down-regulation. Known genes associated with epigenetic remodelling or DNA methylation such as DNMTs or TETs were not identified within the DEGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we queried whether the hypo-methylation bias impacted miRNA expression and carried out small RNAseq. Clustering of the 500 most variably expressed miRNAs did not recapitulate the grouping of samples into B-GICs and nB-GICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Similarly, comparisons between GICs and iNSCs did not reveal a bias in directionality of expression of differentially expressed miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly though, we identified five miRNAs differentially expressed in the same direction in all B-GICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Some of these five differentially expressed miRNAs have previously been linked either directly or indirectly to neural development and/or glial lineage specification.

The <italic>JAK</italic>/<italic>STAT</italic> pathway, which is known to be a key regulator of astrocyte differentiation and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xiao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonni et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">CeyzÃ©riat et al., 2016</xref>), is thought to be up-regulated by miR-4443, which is down-regulated in our GICs. Finally, miR-196, which is up-regulated in B-GICs, plays an essential role in neural development as it helps regulate Homeobox (<italic>HOX</italic>) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sehm et al., 2009</xref>), some of which have been shown to play a role in astrocyte biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vivinetto et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the hypo-methylation bias identified here did not lead to a bias in up- or down-regulation of gene or miRNA expression at a global level. However, PCA of the most variable genes indicated that there were transcriptional and regulatory differences between B-GICs and nB-GICs. One such difference was the differential expression of miRNAs involved in glial lineage specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Binding of transcription factors linked to DNA methylation and glial lineage specification are enriched at hypo-methylated loci in B-GICs</title><p>We used Homer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) to identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites that are enriched at hypo-methylated DMRs from B-GICs (17, 19, 30, and 31).

A subset of GICs that are highly enriched for the ACS were also identified in this cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). As there were no replicates for these GIC lines, we determined thresholds for the enrichment scores that separated the samples into enriched and non-enriched. Firstly, enriched cell lines had to have a higher-than-average enrichment score for the ACS (&gt;0.8429). Secondly, ACS enrichment scores had to be 10% greater than any of the OPC signature scores. Given these criteria, 55% of the samples were found to be enriched for the ACS in the HGCC dataset, compared to approximately 64% in our cohort, hence confirming an ACS enrichment in an independent GIC cohort.</p><p>Next, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data of glioblastomas from two different sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pombo Antunes et al., 2021</xref>) were interrogated to validate the signature enrichment observed in a proportion of GICs. The analysis of the integrated scRNAseq dataset of 15 glioblastomas showed presence of cancer cells, immune cells, oligodendrocytes, and a small cluster of endothelial cells. To identify patients enriched for the ACS signature, we employed two strategies. Firstly, by treating all the single cancer cellsâ expression as pseudo-bulk tumour tissue, we were able to identify a subset of tumours, which scored higher for the ACS than the two OPC signatures (MGH105, MGH114, MGH143, ND2, and ND4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Secondly, we determined enrichment scores for single cancer cells from each tumour and then assigned a signature identity to each cell to quantify the percentage of ACS, OPC Enriched-300, or OPC Specific-300 cells per tumour. Encouragingly the same tumours found to have a higher ACS enrichment score based on the pseudo-bulk analysis, had increased proportion of ACS cells: 75.07% Â± 19.40% compared to 26.26% Â± 11.69% in the remaining tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, we applied these same two approaches but using the six cancer gene signatures from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neftel et al., 2019</xref> (astrocytic: âACâ; mesenchymal: âMES1â and âMES2â; oligodendrocyte progenitor-specific: âOPCâ; and neural progenitor-specific: âNPC1â and âNPC2â). The same five patients (MGH105, MGH114, MGH143, ND2, and ND4) had higher enrichment scores and proportions of cancer cells, assigned to the astrocytic signature (âACâ) compared to the OPC signature, and the same held true for MGH115, MGH118, MGH124, MGH125, ND1, and ND6. For patients MGH143, ND2, and ND4, as well as for MGH115, MGH118, and ND5, the âACâ signature showed highest enrichment and percent assigned cells within the six studied gene modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D, E</xref>). Interestingly, we noted that the ACS from our study enveloped the âMES1â, âMES2â, and âACâ signatures from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neftel et al., 2019</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F, G</xref>) but scoring B-GICs from our cohort for the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>, signatures did not allow to further dissect the enrichment type as three out of four B-GICs (17, 19, and 30) scored most highly for the âMES1â and âMES2â signatures as well as the âACâ signature, GIC31 scored very similar for all Neftel et al. signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>A significant positive correlation was found between GIC ACS signature enrichment scores and the percentage of hypo-methylated DMRs in both our (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, L</xref>) and in the HGCC cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, M</xref>), raising the possibility that the two findings could be causally related.</p><p>To further explore the link between hypo-methylation bias and ACS enrichment, a differential expression analysis comparing B-GICs enriched for the ACS (termed bias-enriched [BE-GICs]), and GICs not harbouring a hypo-methylation bias and not enriched for the ACS (termed non-bias-enriched [nBE-GICs]) was performed. The BE-GIC group contained GICs 17, 19, 30, and 31, whilst the nBE-GIC group contained GICs 18, 26, 50, 52, 54, and 61. We reasoned that DEGs from this comparison could highlight key biological differences between BE-GICs and nBE-GICs. Of the 465 DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), 47 were part of the ACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1I</xref>) (Fisherâs exact test, p-value &lt; 0.00001). The same differential expression comparison in the HGCC cohort identified a total of 902 DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), of which a significant number (52) were also present in the ACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1J</xref>) (Fisherâs exact test, p-value &lt; 0.00001). When considering the top DEGs between the two groups in the HGCC cohort, <italic>RUNX2</italic> was up-regulated whilst <italic>OLIG2</italic> was down-regulated in BE-GICs as compared to the nBE-GICs. This is an interesting finding, as <italic>RUNX2</italic> has been shown to drive astrocytic differentiation, and <italic>OLIG2</italic> is a well-known master regulator of oligodendroglia differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tiwari et al., 2018</xref>). An overlap of 105 genes from the 465 DEGs identified in our cohort and the 902 DEGs identified in the HGCC cohort was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1K</xref>) (Fisherâs exact test, p-value &lt; 0.00001). Finally, pathway analysis on the two lists of DEGs revealed a shared enrichment for pathways associated with the extracellular matrix, morphogenesis, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, locomotion, wound healing, and cytokine signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), suggesting a deregulation of these pathways in BE-GICs.</p><p>In conclusion, we show in two independent GIC cohorts a positive correlation between the extent of hypo-methylation bias and the ACS enrichment score, in keeping with B-GICs being enriched for an astrocytic gene signature. An enrichment for an astrocytic signature is confirmed also in a proportion of glioblastoma at single cell level. Furthermore, when comparing BE-GICs to nBE-GICs, a significant number of DEGs that are present in the ACS are found and a predicted impact on cell movement/invasion is identified.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Increased invasion in xenografts derived from BE-GICs and role of SRPX2 in regulating invasion in vitro</title><p>Next, we set out to assess whether BE-GICs would give rise to tumours with distinct invasive properties as compared to those generated from other GICs.

We aimed to identify genes that play a role in the differentiation of iAPCs that are also deregulated in GICs and may be responsible for astrocytic signature enrichment in BE-GICs. Initially, DEGs present in both the GIC versus iNSC, and iAPC versus iNSC comparisons were selected for further analysis, for three reasons. Firstly, these DEGs could play a role in the differentiation of iNSCs to iAPCs if they are differentially expressed between these two cell types. Secondly, as these DEGs are also differentially expressed between GICs and iNSCs, they may play a role in neoplastic transformation. Thirdly, as these DEGs are not differentially expressed between iAPCs and GICs, they could contribute to the enrichment for an astrocytic signature. Once DEGs meeting these criteria had been identified across our four patients, we further selected for genes also present in the ACS, and specifically identified in the comparison of BE-GIC 19 and 31 and shared between the two (summarised schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>GLI pathogenesis related 1 (<italic>GLIPR1</italic>), sushi repeat containing protein X-linked 2 (<italic>SRPX2</italic>), and leukaemia inhibitory factor (<italic>LIF</italic>) were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). <italic>GLIPR1</italic> is very well studied in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Awasthi et al., 2013</xref>) and has been found to regulate migration and invasion of glioma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ziv-Av et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giladi et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, <italic>LIF</italic> is well studied in glioma and has been shown to contribute to the maintenance of glioma-initiating cell self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edwards et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">PeÃ±uelas et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, <italic>LIF</italic> has been shown to help mediate astrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nakashima et al., 1999</xref>). The pathogenic role and impact of <italic>SRPX2</italic> in GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tang et al., 2016</xref>) is less well characterised, despite been well studied in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Analysis of the pattern of expression of <italic>SRPX2</italic> in our dataset found that it was up-regulated in the comparisons between iNSC and iAPC across all patients, and its expression was specifically higher in the GICs of patients 19 and 31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), as expected. Given our limited cohort size, the deregulation of SRPX2 was further validated in other datasets and found that it was more highly expressed in glioblastoma tumour tissue as compared to non-tumour brain tissue according to TCGA data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and in BE-GICs from the HGCC cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Using survival data from the TCGA we also found that high SRPX2 expression confers a worse prognosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). To elucidate the role of <italic>SRPX2</italic>, the HGCC BE-GIC line, U3118, and GIC19 were transduced with lentiviral vectors, carrying short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs targeting <italic>SRPX2</italic> (termed SRPX2_90 and SRPX2_91) and a scramble control. The mRNA levels of <italic>SRPX2</italic> were decreased upon silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) and western blotting confirmed effective knockdown of the gene at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, J, K</xref>).</p><p>The differential expression comparison between BE-GICs and nBE-GICs identified cell movement/invasion among the differentially enriched pathways and BE-GICs gave rise to more invasive tumours upon intracerebral injection in mice. Cell movement/invasion is a process that is also impacted in astrocytic progenitors, which are more motile as compared to NSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schiweck et al., 2018</xref>). For these reasons, the impact of SRPX2 knockdown on the invasive phenotype of GICs was assessed using a transwell invasion assay. The nuclei of cells that moved across the transwell membrane were fixed 24 hr after seeding, then stained and counted as described in the Materials and methods. On average, a statistically significant lower number of nuclei per image field were found in both GIC19 and U3118 <italic>SRPX2</italic> knockdown lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>) (p-value &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>Interestingly, interrogation of the Ivy GAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Puchalski et al., 2018</xref>) resource revealed <italic>SRPX2</italic> expression predominantly in perivascular regions, including areas of microvascular proliferation and hyperplastic blood vessels, whilst it was down-regulated in the parenchymal leading edge and infiltrating tumour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). Given that gliomas invade mainly along two routes, the white matter tracts and the blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giese and Westphal, 1996</xref>), it could be speculated that <italic>SRPX2</italic> may play a role in the latter and not the former in the subset of glioblastoma with hypomethylation bias/astrocytic signature enrichment. Although functional studies in vivo will be required to substantiate this hypothesis, we scored single tumour cells from the scRNAseq data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pombo Antunes et al., 2021</xref>, for both the peri/microvascular signature (top 200 genes up-regulated in these regions according to Ivy GAP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Puchalski et al., 2018</xref>), the ACS and the two OPC signatures.

Hypo-methylated loci are enriched for binding motifs of TFs known to be involved in astrocyte differentiation, and DEGs and miRNAs known to play a role in astrocyte lineage commitment and differentiation were detected in B-GICs. At a functional level, BE-GICs are characterised by increased invasion in vivo, enhanced <italic>SRPX2</italic>-regulated invasive properties in vitro, and an altered immune microenvironment.</p><p>Alterations of the DNA methylome have been previously described in genetically defined high-grade gliomas. In particular, the G-CIMP hyper-methylator phenotype characterises IDH-mutant gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>), where mutated IDH gains the ability to convert Î±-KG to 2-HG, which functions as an oncometabolite whilst also being a competitive inhibitor of Î±-KG-dependent dioxygenases such as TET enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, IDH-mutant glioblastoma cells accumulate DNA methylation as TET enzymes are inhibited from removing methylation marks. A hypo-methylation bias has been previously found also in the paediatric H3 G34 mutant glioma subgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sturm, 2012</xref>), where mutations in the histone H3 variant H3.3 (H3F3A) block <italic>SETD2</italic> binding, leading to loss of H3K36 methylation, which in turn is linked to DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rose and Klose, 2014</xref>). Alternatively, mutation and loss of <italic>ATRX</italic>, which is consistently found in G34 mutant glioblastoma, could contribute to hypo-methylation at highly repeated sequences such as rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibbons et al., 2000</xref>). The DNA hypo-methylation bias described here is found in a proportion of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, which are enriched for an astrocytic signature. The pan-cancer analysis of DNA methylomes, published in 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saghafinia et al., 2018</xref>), reported that a proportion of IDH-wildtype gliomas exhibited high percentages of hypo-methylated loci, which correlated with a stemness signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Malta et al., 2018</xref>), based on hypo-methylation of specific loci enriched for the <italic>SOX2-OCT4</italic> binding motif. We did not find enrichment for the <italic>SOX2-OCT4</italic> motif in the hypo-methylated DMRs from B-GICs, but rather an enrichment for TF binding sites known to play a role in glial/astrocyte differentiation, which is consistent with the enrichment for an astrocytic signature. Importantly, we have shown that the hypo-methylation bias is not induced in GIC by in vitro culture as it was confirmed in the respective tumour tissue. Likewise, we have taken advantage of publicly available single-cell transcriptome datasets to confirm that enrichment for our bespoke astrocytic signature as well as published astroglia signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>) is found in a proportion of GBM.</p><p>Of particular interest was the finding of an enrichment for members of the <italic>NFI</italic> family in the hypo-methylated DMRs from B-GICs as previous studies have shown that astrocyte differentiation requires Nfia-induced demethylation of key astrocyte lineage specifying genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanosaka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Namihira et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanosaka et al., 2017</xref>, showed that the methylome underpins the differentiation potential of NSCs rather than gene expression itself. They found that E11.5 embryonic mouse NSCs were lineage-restricted and only giving rise to neurons, whilst E18.5 NSCs had an increased proportion of hypo-methylated loci and were multipotent â being able to give rise to glial and neuronal lineages. Furthermore, this study also showed that DMRs with reduced methylation (hypo-methylated) in E18.5 NSCs as compared to E11.5 NSCs are enriched for <italic>NFI</italic> binding sites, and that this gene family was responsible for the loss of DNA methylation and gain of multipotency for the glial lineage. It is intriguing that these previous studies may provide an interpretative framework as to why we find a positive correlation between the hypo-methylation bias and ACS enrichment. It is conceivable that B-GICs may arise from a neural progenitor population that has undergone priming for glial differentiation, for example by the <italic>NFI</italic> TF family. Other TF binding sites we found enriched in hypo-methylated loci are also known to be involved in glial/astrocyte differentiation, such as <italic>ETV4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tiwari et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>PLAGL1</italic>, the latter by transactivating <italic>Socs3</italic>, a potent inhibitor of pro-differentiative <italic>Jak</italic>/<italic>Stat3</italic> signalling, thereby preventing precocious astroglia differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmidt-Edelkraut et al., 2013</xref>). We found a significant enrichment for genes of the ACS in the DEGs between B-GICs and nB-GICs in both our and the HGCC datasets. Likewise, the five differentially expressed miRNAs identified in this comparison â miR-4443, miR-1275, miR-196, miR-5100, and miR-1268, which have been previously linked to cancer or glioblastoma pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang and Wang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2017b</xref>), have also been linked either directly or indirectly to glial differentiation. These include miR-196 known for its regulatory role of Homeobox (HOX) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sehm et al., 2009</xref>) in both a healthy and malignant developmental context and miR-1275 previously shown to be involved in glial lineage specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Katsushima et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, the results of the binding motif analysis and of the differential expression analysis raise the possibility that BE-GICs arise from a neural progenitor, which has undergone glial/astrocyte priming. Overexpression of <italic>NFI</italic> family members in nBE-GICs will be required to assess whether changes in DNA methylation and gene signature enrichment can be elicited, or whether this enrichment is a consequence of the hypo-methylation bias. Alternatively, disruption of the <italic>NFI</italic> binding motifs across the genome, for example by means of CRISPR-Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ran et al., 2013</xref>) could be carried out to assess the effect on DNA hypo-methylation and gene signature enrichment.</p><p>We noted that whilst the hypo-methylation bias was retained in bulk FFPE tumour tissue, the ACS enrichment was not. It is possible that this is due to the lower RNA quality, as compared to excellent DNA quality obtained from FFPE material, which limit the transcriptome characterisation. It is also possible that the transcriptome is more dynamic and prone to change, and so for example whilst GICs pass on their epigenetic signature to daughter cells when they proliferate, the regulation of their transcriptome may not be equally inherited by the daughter cells. Finally, the cellular heterogeneity, including the tumour microenvironment, could also be obscuring the astrocyte signature enrichment in the parental tumour.</p><p>Importantly, when comparing DEGs between BE-GICs and nBE-GICs, a predicted impact on cell movement/invasion was identified. In keeping with this prediction, xenografts generated from BE-GICs were found to grow more invasively as compared to those generated by nBE-GICs. This is of particular interest in glioblastoma, given the diffusely infiltrative growth of these tumours, which plays a significant role in limiting the effectiveness of the current therapies. Among the genes deregulated, <italic>SRPX2</italic> stood out as it has been previously shown to be associated with poor prognosis, and to promote tumour progression and metastasis in primary GICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, we show that silencing of this gene leads to impaired invasion in two BE-GIC lines in in vitro assays, although in vivo validation will be required to substantiate this finding.</p><p>The immune microenvironment plays a crucial role in tumour pathogenesis, including glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pombo Antunes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dumas et al., 2020</xref>). We have identified a significant deregulation of genes involved in immunomodulatory pathways in BE-GICs and analysis of scRNAseq datasets of glioblastoma has confirmed an altered immune landscape in glioblastoma with an ACS signature enrichment. The significant correlation between the ACS signature enrichment and the number of TAMs is of particular interest given the up-regulation of <italic>RARRES2</italic> in BE-GICs and the role of TAMs in glioblastoma invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersen et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, a SEPP1-hi phenotype was observed in these TAMs corresponding to an anti-inflammatory phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pombo Antunes et al., 2021</xref>), which raises the possibility that they could play a pro-tumourigenic role in these glioblastomas.</p><p>A recent methylome analysis of various tumour types has found that global methylation loss correlates with increased resistance to immunotherapy and immune evasion signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jung et al., 2019</xref>), hence the identification of GBMs with these features could have important implications in patient stratification for immunomodulatory treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tissue culture</title><p>We have previously described a novel experimental pipeline, SYNGN, to derive GICs and EPSCs as well as iNSCs from patients who underwent surgical resection of glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vinel et al., 2021</xref>).

To produce shRNA lentivirus, a Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen Cat. #L3000-015) transfection protocol was used. Transfection was carried out as per the manufacturerâs standard protocol, by forming DNA-lipid complexes which were then incubated on cells for 6 hr followed by addition of packaging media for lentivirus harvesting. Packaging media consisted of Optimem reduced serum media supplemented with Glutamax (Gibco Cat. #51985-034), with 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco Cat. #11360-039) and 5% FBS. Twenty-four hr post transfection, media was harvested from HEK293T cells and stored at 4Â°C, 10 mL of fresh packaging media was added. Fifty-two hr post transfection media was harvested once again and mixed with media previously harvested. Harvested supernatant was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min to remove cell debris, then filtered through a 0.44 Âµm filter (VWR Cat. #514-0329). To precipitate and concentrate lentiviral particles, 5Ã polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Sigma #89510-1KG-F) was prepared by mixing 200 g PEG, 12 g NaCl (Fisher Cat. #S/3166/60) and 1 mL of 1 M Tris (pH 7.5) (PanReac AppliChem Cat #A4263,0500) then ddH<sub>2</sub>O added to a total volume of 500 mL. pH of PEG was further adjusted to 7.2, and then autoclaved before use. 5Ã PEG was then added to harvested supernatant to give a final concentration of 1Ã and then incubated at 4Â°C overnight. The following day harvested supernatant mixed with PEG was centrifuged at 1500 g for 30 min at 4Â°C, supernatant was removed and spun again to remove excess supernatant. The lentiviral pellet was then resuspended in an appropriate amount of DPBS, aliquoted and stored at â80Â°C until use.</p><p>Harvested virus was titrated to determine the transforming units per mL (TU/mL) for each volume of virus used during titration. Cell lines were infected overnight with the stated multiplicity of infection (MOI) of lentiviral particles. The TU/mL that achieved 5â30% of fluorescent tag positive cells during lentivirus titration was selected for the calculation of the MOI. The following day after infection with lentivirus, media was changed, and the cells were left to recover. Once confluent the cells expressing the desired construct were then purified by Puromycin selection or FACS, if transduced with constructs with a Puromycin resistance gene or fluorescent tag.</p><p>Glycerol stocks of competent bacteria containing shRNA plasmids, for lentivirus production, were purchased from Horizon Discovery Dharmacon. To obtain plasmid for lentiviral production, a small of amount of glycerol stock was extracted and added to LB broth (Sigma Cat. #L3522) supplemented with the relevant antibiotic, and grown up in large liquid culture, overnight at 37Â°C. Following this, plasmid DNA was isolated and purified using the Qiagen Maxi Prep kit (Qiagen Cat. #12963).

Two biological replicates of each patient-matched GICs, iNSCs, iAPCs, and iOPCs were sent for DNA methylation array. DNA was assayed on the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC array (over 850,000 probes). Raw data was imported into an R workspace (R Version 3.5.0) and all analysis therein performed using the RStudio environment (Version 1.1.453). Raw data from the array was first processed using the ChAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morris et al., 2014</xref>) (Version 2.12.4) R package to remove any failed detections and flawed probes. Along with data, metadata was also imported and used to help perform analysis. After this initial processing, data were then further processed and normalised using the Subset-quantile within array normalisation (SWAN) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maksimovic et al., 2012</xref>). All methylation data used for further analysis such as differential methylation, PCA, or heatmap and dendrograms were SWAN normalised data.</p><p>After initial processing of DNA methylation array data, as described above, DMRs and genes were identified. To do so, output data from the SWAN normalisation algorithm in the form of beta values were imported into an R workspace and different datasets merged into a single dataset with the only probes that were common to all samples. After initial data processing, the R package DMRcate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Peters et al., 2015</xref>) (Version 1.18.0) was then used to first identify DMRs and then the corresponding genes. The minimum number of contiguous (or consecutive) differentially methylated probes per region to be called a DMR was set to 6, the beta cutoff was set to 0.3, and as the lambda parameter (bandwidth) was set to 1000, the scaling factor (C) was set to 2 as per the authorsâ recommendations. Unless otherwise stated here, all other parameters were set to their respective default settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>RNAseq data processing</title><p>RNA used for RNAseq was extracted and prepared as previously detailed. RNA samples from two biological replicates of patient-matched iAPCs, iNSCs, and GICs was of sufficient quality and quantity (minimum 1000 ng total mass at concentration of 50 ng/ÂµL with 260:280 and 260:230 ratios equal to ~2) as to perform Poly-A library preparation followed by sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform at 75 PE. For sequencing of miRNAs, total RNA extracted as already outlined was prepared using the NEBNext smallRNA kit for Illumina (E7330L). In some cases where insufficient quantities of RNA were isolated from single passages of cells, RNA from two passages were combined. iOPC samples yielded very low quality and quantity of RNA after extraction and therefore samples were not suitable to be prepared using the Poly-A library preparation method. Instead, two biological replicate iOPC samples, for each patient, were prepared using the SmartSeq2 library preparation method and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform at 75 PE.</p><p>The raw RNAseq data generated was processed in multiple ways depending on the output of the analysis. FastQC (Version 0.11.5) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>) was used to perform quality control of the raw data, to check the Phred score, the GC content distribution, and the duplication levels, then the TrimGalore tool (Version 0.4.5â1) (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.5127898) was used to remove low-quality reads (Phred score &lt;20) and residual adapters. For the use of differential expression analysis raw data was processed using the STAR gapped alignment software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) (Version 2.7.0), which generated gene counts. The reference genome used for alignment was Ensembl GRCh38 (release 90). Following alignment, prior to differential gene expression analysis, further processing of the STAR output data was performed. Genes with a counts per million (CPM) value &lt;1, in a minimum of half of the samples per group (i.e., GIC or iNSC) plus one, were removed. DEGs were identified using the R package: EdgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McCarthy et al., 2012</xref>) (Version 3.24.3) with the thresholds that the minimum absolute log fold change (logFC) in gene expression was 2 and the false discovery rate was less than 0.01. EdgeR analysis was performed using two statistical tests provided by the package â the likelihood ratio test (glmFit) and the quasi-likelihood ratio test (glmQLFit), however all gene lists used in further downstream analysis were generated from the more conservative glmQLFit test, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>For the differential gene expression analysis of GICs from the HGCC cohort, microarray data that had been pre-processed (normalised and Combat batch adjusted) was used. Differential gene expression analysis was then performed in an R workspace using the RStudio environment and limma package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Law et al., 2014</xref>) (Version 3.40.6). Linear modelling was implemented by the lmFit function and the empirical Bayes statistics implemented by the eBayes function and DEGs with a p-value &lt; 0.05, and logFC &gt;0.5, were selected by the topTable function. Volcano plots depicting the logFC and statistical significance of DEGs, from analysis of both microarray data and RNAseq data, were generated using the R package EnhancedVolcano (Version 1.5.10).</p><p>To generate heatmaps, dendrograms and perform PCA (all detailed below), a different approach was used to process raw RNAseq data. Alignment was instead performed using pseudoalignment package Salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patro et al., 2017</xref>) (Version 0.13.1), with the output being transcript expression level, which were then pooled to give gene level expression estimates expressed as transcripts per million (TPM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Durinck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Durinck et al., 2005</xref>).

The reference genome used for Salmon alignment was Ensembl GRCh38 (release 90).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>PCA, heatmaps, and dendrograms</title><p>PCA was performed on both methylation array data and RNAseq data to validate the sequencing data. Output data from the pseudoalignment package Salmon (TPM counts) were used for PCA of RNAseq data, and beta values from SWAN normalised data we used for PCA of methylation array data. Prior to PCA, data were filtered to include only the most variable methylation probes or genes, the exact number used for each figure is stated in the relevant figure legend. The R package NOIseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tarazona et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tarazona et al., 2011</xref>) (Version 2.26.1) was used to perform PCA and then the results plotted, using R packages ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wickham, 2009</xref>) (Version 3.1.1) (for two-dimensional plotting of two PCs) or plotly (Version 4.9.0) (for three-dimensional plotting of three PCs).</p><p>Heatmaps and dendrograms were generated using both DNA methylation and RNAseq data. The RNAseq data used was the output from the pseudoalignment package Salmon (gene expression data in units of TPM). DNA methylation data used was beta values from SWAN normalisation. RNAseq data was filtered prior to analysis by removing genes with a TPM value &lt;1 and the number of samples in each group (i.e., GIC or iNSC) that must express each gene to half the group size plus one. After this initial filtering, only the most variable genes were used in the analysis, with the exact number stated for each figure. In general, the Euclidean clustering method and complete distance methods were used as part of the standard heatmap.2 function in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Gene signature analysis</title><p>Gene signature analysis was performed using ssGSEA method. In order to calculate ssGSEA enrichment scores for our samples, the R package GSVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">HÃ¤nzelmann et al., 2013</xref>) (Version 1.30.0) was used. The gene level expression estimates output, expressed as TPM, from alignment using the Salmon (detailed earlier) were used as the input for this analysis. As well as gene expression data, gene lists or signatures were also required, and all gene lists/signatures were formatted as Ensembl gene IDs.</p><p>The oligodendrocyte gene signatures used here were taken from a published study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McKenzie et al., 2018</xref>. The ACS was manually generated by compiling multiple astrocytic gene signatures into one coherent gene signature. Astrocytic gene signatures were first found in the xCell bioinformatics tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aran et al., 2017</xref>): xCell is a tool used to de-convolute a sample composed of a mixture of cell types into its respective cell types, based on gene signatures curated and validated by the authors. Multiple data sources were used to generate gene signatures for as many cell types as possible, and the authors generated a gene signature for a given cell type from each data source, meaning more than one gene signature was generated for each cell type. For example, three data sources contained astrocyte expression data, and thus two astrocyte signatures were generated from each data source, meaning there were six signatures for the tool to use to de-convolute mixed samples. In this present study, we have taken these six astrocyte signatures used by the xCell tool and merged them into one coherent signature.

The tool findMotifsGenome.pl was used to perform de novo search as well as to check the enrichment of known motifs, in the context of the latest human genome annotation (hg38). Homer searched significantly enriched motifs (p-value &lt;0.05) with a length spanning a wide range of standard values (6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 bp) in a region of default size (200 bp) at the centre of each sequence. Following the Homer guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/index.html">http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/index.html</ext-link>), the option -mask was used, to minimise the bias towards long repeats in the genome, and the maximum number of mismatches allowed in the global optimization phase has been set to 3, to improve the sensitivity of the algorithm. Other settings have been left as default, such as the distribution used to score motifs (binomial). Finally, a scoring algorithm assigned a ranked list of best matches (known motifs or genes) to each de novo motif, to inform the biological interpretation of the results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Whole-slide images (WSI) of immunostained sections of xenografts derived from GICs lines were analysed using QuPath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bankhead et al., 2017</xref>). A machine learning-based pixel classifier was manually trained on a subset of WSI to detect tissue sections and vimentin immunostaining and create corresponding annotations.

The gene expression matrices were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.brainimmuneatlas.org/">https://www.brainimmuneatlas.org/</ext-link>, and GEO (accession number GSE131928), respectively. The gene expression matrices were merged, data was normalised, highly variable genes were detected, and their expression was scaled, followed by PCA, using the Seurat R package (Version 3.2.3). To account for the batch effect between samples, the cellular PCA embedding values were corrected with the harmony R package (Version 1.0), using a diversity clustering penalty parameter (theta) of one. Theta controls the level of alignment between batches, with higher values resulting in stronger correction. Next, the first 20 harmony corrected PCA embeddings were included in Louvain clustering (resolution = 0.25) and UMAP dimensionality reduction, using Seurat. The identified clusters were annotated as myeloid cells, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and oligodendrocytes, based on expression of cell type markers. The remaining group of clusters were annotated as cancer cells.</p><p>The lymphocyte cluster was disaggregated and re-clustered, using 10 harmony corrected PCA embeddings and resolution = 1. By using specific gene markers, the clusters were classified into B cells, regulatory T cells, proliferating CD8 T cells, NKT cells, naive T cells, interferon-response T cells, two clusters of CD4 T cells, two clusters of CD8 T cells, and two clusters of NK cells.</p><p>The myeloid cells were also disaggregated and re-clustered based on 30 harmony corrected PCA embeddings, and resolution = 1. We identified monocyte cluster, DC cluster, three clusters of microglia-derived TAMs (mg-TAMs), SEPP1-hi monocyte-derived TAMs (moTAMs), hypoxic moTAMs, IFN-response moTAMs, proliferating moTAMs, TAMs up-regulating heat shock protein genes (HSP TAM: HSPA1A, HSPA1B, HSP90AA1, HSPH1, HSPB1), one cluster specific for patient MGH105, as well as myeloid-cancer cell doublets.</p><p>The cancer cells were disaggregated and re-clustered using 20 harmony corrected PCA embeddings, and resolution = 1. One of the clusters, which was expressing macrophage markers, was removed from further analysis as a cluster of macrophage-cancer cell doublets. Additive module scores for the astrocytic (ACS) and OPC gene signatures defined in this study were calculated for each cancer cell, using the AddModuleScore function of Seurat. This function yields the average expression level of each gene signature, subtracted by the average expression of a control gene set. Then, each cell has been assigned the signature with the highest score (ACS, OPC Enrich-300, or OPC Spec-300). Alternatively, additive module scores were calculated for the six gene signatures described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neftel et al., 2019</xref> (âMES1â, âMES2â, âACâ, âOPCâ, âNPC1â, and âNPC2â). The six gene signatures were defined using the genes in Supplementary Table S2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>. Each cell was also assigned the signature with the highest from the six scores. For the gene set enrichment pseudo-bulk analysis of the cancer cells, the raw UMI counts were summed for all cancer cells per gene for each patient using the aggregateAcrossCells function from the scuttle R package (Version 1.0.4). The pseudo-bulk counts were normalised using the CPM method and log2-transformation by edgeR (Version 3.32.1).

Fisherâs exact tests, used to test the significance of the overlap between Venn diagram categories, were calculated using an online statistics tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/fisher/default2.aspx">https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/fisher/default2.aspx</ext-link>) (no reference available). Upset plots showing the number of DEGs found in various patient comparisons and the overlaps between patient comparisons were generated using the online tool Intervene Shiny App (<ext-link

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wafik El-Deiry as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarity of the piece, as raised by reviewers 1 and 3. Particularly Reviewer 3 â overall the manuscript was challenging to read and should be greatly clarified in general and according to specific comments from reviewers.</p><p>2) Identification and characterization of SPRX2 seem rudimentary (Reviewer 2) and more details should be provided.</p><p>3) More context would be necessary â for example, In the context of what we know about glioblastoma classification (Verhaak, etc), where does this subgroup belong? How does it affect patient outcome?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Glioblastoma is a devastating tumor type and is known to be comprised of various transcriptionally defined subtypes, which are of biologic and therapeutic relevance. Here the authors claim to have identified a new molecular subgroup with specific hypomethylation and an astrocytic gene signature, which is associated with increased invasion and macrophage infiltration. In general, this would be an interesting conclusion of relevance to the field. However, the approach seems convoluted, and explained at great and complex length, to the point where it is very difficult, even for a specialized reader, to understand. Greater clarity and simplification/brevity of the language throughout would greatly benefit this work. Nonetheless, there appear to be significant methodological issues which challenge the conclusions reached by the authors. Overall, it is not clear that the data support the concept of a new subgroup of glioblastoma.</p><p>1. How does the process of generating iNSCs affect the methylation status of the cells.</p><p>2.

The lack of strong transcriptional association with the hypomethylated group is confusing and the link to glial biology seems like cherry-picking â is there an ontological-based approach that could show this?

For the in vivo studies do the migration patterns correlate with the traditional transcriptional categories (PN, MES etc), or are they something different â this is not clear.</p><p>5. If this is a new subgroup of glioblastoma, how does it fit in with existing models, and what would be the impact on treatment response, and survival association with specific driver mutations?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) How closely is the methylation pattern in GIC lines reflecting the parent tumour? It would be interesting to know whether parent tumours of bias/enriched GIC lines share DMRs and/or ACS enrichment. Also, please clarify which cutoff value will separate hypomethylation bias from non-bias GICs or tumours and how robust this value is.</p><p>2) Figure 2, panel F-H: the difference in enrichment scores may be significant, but the effect size seems marginal. To better put this into context, the scale of the y-axis should start at 0 for all panels. It is also unclear to me why enrichment for astrocyte signatures was tested against all cell lines, but enrichment for oligodendrocyte signatures was only tested in iOPC and iNSC. The oligodendrocyte signatures should also be tested against iAPC to demonstrate specificity.</p><p>3) The authors identify SRPX2 as the target gene associated with hypomethylation bias/ACS-enriched GBM cells. The functional validation of SRPX2 is very limited though and includes only 3 in vitro assays (proliferation, invasion, sphere formation). It would be good to see a more comprehensive validation of SRPX2 including in vivo transplantation of at least one of the cell lines. Furthermore, does knockdown of SRPX2 affect expression of ACS markers?</p><p>4) Macrophage infiltration data relies only on scRNA-Seq analysis. This data may be biased by sample area or input cell numbers. It would be good to validate changes in immune cell content e.g. by histological staining of parent tumour samples from bias/enriched and non-bias GIC lines.</p><p>5) Figure S2: The immunofluorescence staining for GFAP and CD44 (panel B) looks like background staining and not a real signal. The images should be replaced with better ones.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am very sorry but I got too much stuck in this manuscript and not fully understanding which comparison served which purpose. If there are only ten or eleven samples to analyse, the difference between groups needs to be considerable as the high-dimensionality of the data makes the power limited. At least on the gene expression analysis, this was apparently not the case. The authors went on to do many different comparisons of GICs with iNSCs, iAPCs and iOPCs to find a rationale behind the reduced methylation signature, but why each comparison is done and why not always the same samples are compared is not always clear. It is quite possible that the comparisons are entirely valid, but it needs more clarification. I tried several attempts but had too many issues with fully understanding the flow of the experiments. That is not to say the manuscript is not of interest, methylation on gliomas is a very powerful tool, and finding new subtypes is of high relevance.</p><p>Consider the variables: GICs, iNSCs, iASC and iOPC and these are split into hypo and non-hypo samples either with or without enrichment for an ASC signature. For some analysis, subgroups are subsetted to hypo-bias/enriched. Likely because of this subsetting, the various comparisons use different samples for input. Any comparison can be done paired or unpaired (not always stated), and I could not find whether there was any correction for multiple testing/false discovery rate.</p><p>Just look at the following paragraphs on page 24/25 of the manuscript:</p><p>&quot;To identify genes that may contribute to the phenotypic characteristics of the bias/enriched GICs, and the tumours derived thereof, the following differential expression analyses were performed on a patient-by-patient basis: iAPC versus GIC, iAPC versus iNSC and iNSC versus GIC, with the aim to identify genes that play a role in the differentiation of iAPCs and are deregulated in GICs. Lists of DEGs for each patient comparison were then overlaid to find DEGs that were either unique or present in more than one comparison. DEGs present in both the iNSC versus GIC, and iNSC versus iAPC comparisons, were selected for further analysis as these DEGs could play a role in the differentiation of NSCs to astrocytes and because of the consequent similar expression level between GICs and iAPCs could indicate that GICs are ontogenetically linked to these progenitors.</p><p>We aimed at identifying genes that were differentially expressed in the two comparisons of interest and were at the same time part of the ACS (Figure 4 D). We focussed on DEGs that were specific to GICs 19, 31 and 44 and shared between all three. â¦&quot;</p><p>If I try to tease out what is stated here: there are three comparisons, for two phenotypes for a very limited number of patients. There is no data on individual comparisons, no data on the overlap between comparisons, they just end up with three genes. The comparison includes sample 44, likely because this sample had a minor AC phenotype (but was not hypomethylated). Sample 44 can therefore have been assigned to either label. Because the sample size is so small, it is important that labels are always similar. The comparisons also did not include samples 17 and 30, likely because iNSC were created from only five samples. If so, the comparisons are made on a very limited number of patients. There are just so many comparisons, filters used and sample selections made that probably make sense, but I had great difficulty in judging the validity thereof.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77335.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarity of the piece, as raised by reviewers 1 and 3.

Unfortunately, an attempt to optimise the available anti-SRPX2 antibody on FFPE material has failed, which prevented the assessment of SRPX2 expression at the invasion front in xenografts derived from B-GICs and nB-GICs. However, we have leveraged scRNASeq datasets from human glioblastoma to obtain additional validation of our hypothesis of a potential role of SRPX2 in invasion of tumours with an hypomethylation bias/ACS enrichment. We now show an enrichment for SRPX2 expression in one of two main invasive niche in glial tumours, namely the perivascular niche (page 25, line 22-24). We acknowledge that these remain correlative data, which will require in vivo functional validation and we mention this explicitly in the manuscript, page 25, line 26-27, however they provide additional support to our conclusion that SRPX2 may play a role in mediating at least in part the more invasive properties of tumours with an hypomethylation bias and astrocytic signature enrichment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More context would be necessary â for example, In the context of what we know about glioblastoma classification (Verhaak, etc), where does this subgroup belong?

We have not found any survival differences between B-GIC patients and nB-GICs, a finding which is perhaps not surprising given the short survival of all patients with glioblastoma and the lack of survival differences found also for both transcriptionally based and epigenetic-based glioblastoma subgroups (Verhaak et al. Cancer Cell, 2010). However, identification of subsets of glioblastoma with defined epigenetic and molecular features is an essential first step for future personalised therapy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Glioblastoma is a devastating tumor type and is known to be comprised of various transcriptionally defined subtypes, which are of biologic and therapeutic relevance.

However, we have revisited this analysis as suggested to determine if there are global transcriptional differences between the B-GICs and nB-GICs â and PCA of GICs shows that this is indeed the case (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 B). Therefore, we have now explained the concept better as there are transcriptional differences between B-GICs and nB-GICs, including the enrichment for an astrocytic signature.</p><p>We do not agree with the statement that âthe link to glial biology is cherry pickingâ. We have shown multiple lines of evidence emanating from our work pointing at this link. Firstly, hypo-methylated loci from B-GICs are enriched for transcription factor binding sites associated with astrocyte/glial differentiation (Figure 2). Secondly, miRNAs differentially expressed in B-GICs have been linked to astrocyte/glial differentiation (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1), and thirdly, differential gene expression between B-GICs and nB-GICs identifies up-regulation of RUNX2 and down-regulation of OLIG2 in B-GICs, which are TFs associated with astrocyte and OPC differentiation respectively (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

If this is a new subgroup of glioblastoma, how does it fit in with existing models, and what would be the impact on treatment response, and survival association with specific driver mutations?</p></disp-quote><p>On reflection we agree the term subgroup was confusing, we now argue that the hypomethylation bias identified here is a feature of a proportion of GBMs. It is not associated with a particular transcriptional or epigenetic subgroup among those already identified (Sturm et al. Cancer Cell, 2012) but seems to span previous subgroups. We have not found any survival differences between B-GIC patients and nB-GICs, a finding which is perhaps not surprising given the short survival of all patients with glioblastoma and the lack of survival differences found also for both transcriptionally based and epigenetic-based glioblastoma subgroups (Verhaak et al. Cancer Cell, 2010).</p><p>All GICs in the study were derived from glioblastoma samples, where the most frequent genetic alterations found in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, including mutations in the TERT promoter, 10q loss, 7p gain, EGFR amplification, EGFR vIII mutation and p53 gene mutations, had been tested for diagnostic purposes. We do not find any genetic alteration which is found only in B-GICs, although we would like to emphasize that our cohort is small, and this hinders any assessment of enrichment for defined genetic alterations. It could be interesting to carry out whole genome sequencing analysis to assess the genetic profile of B-GIC more comprehensively, however this is beyond the scope of this manuscript, and it is to be noted that the caveat of the small cohort size would remain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) How closely is the methylation pattern in GIC lines reflecting the parent tumour? It would be interesting to know whether parent tumours of bias/enriched GIC lines share DMRs and/or ACS enrichment.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point, which we have addressed, and the results are shown in Figure 1H. We show that the bias towards hypo-methylation is observed, albeit less pronounced, when the parental tumours, rather than the GIC derived thereof, are used for the comparison with the iNSC. This difference may be due to the cellular heterogeneity within the tumour tissue, including cells of the tumour microenvironment, which may obscure the methylation bias of the tumour cells. However, the enrichment for the ACS is not observed when the parental tumour tissue is used for the comparative analysis (data not previously shown but now added as Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 C and described on page 22). It is possible this is due to the lower quality of the RNA, as compared to the excellent DNA quality, obtained from FFPE material, which limit the transcriptome characterisation. It is also possible that the transcriptome is more dynamic and prone to change, and so for example whilst GICs pass on their epigenetic signature to daughter cells when they proliferate, the regulation of their transcriptome may not be equally inherited by the daughter cells. Finally, the cellular heterogeneity, including the tumour microenvironment, could also be obscuring the astrocyte signature enrichment in the parental tumour. We are discussing these points in the MS, page 29, paragraph 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, please clarify which cutoff value will separate hypomethylation bias from non-bias GICs or tumours and how robust this value is.</p></disp-quote><p>We observed that GIC from the HGCC cohort sit on a wide spectrum with regards to the extent of their hypo-methylation bias. For example, we find 16 GICs with 50% â 60% hypo-methylated DMRs, 10 with 60% â 70% hypo-methylated DMRs, 15 with 70% â 80% hypo-methylated DMRs, 9 with 80% â 90% hypo-methylated DMRs and 3 with &gt;90% hypo-methylated DMRs. In our smaller cohort though, the number of GIC was too low to see this spectrum. Therefore, it could be argued that setting a binary threshold with regards to a cut-off value for separating B-GICs and nB-GICs would not always be informative. One could argue that GICs with &gt;50% hypo-methylated DMRs have a bias towards hypo-methylation, as do GICs with &gt;90% hypo-methylated DMRs â however these two groups could be quite different. We believe therefore that in many cases, as we have done in Figure 1F, it may be more informative to stratify GICs, particularly those from large cohorts, into a spectrum rather than a binary classification. Future studies may wish to focus on the cause and effect of the extent of hypo-methylation bias of GICs across the spectrum.</p><p>Where a threshold was required to classify B-GICs / BE-GICs into two distinct groups for the purposes of comparative analyses such as differential gene expression or differential methylation analysis, we adopted lenient thresholds to include as many GICs that could be classified as having a bias. Thus, we used a threshold of &gt;60% for our own cohort where syngeneic comparisons were possible. This threshold is now clearly stated in the text, page 18, line 9.</p><p>Meanwhile, for the HGCC cohort, where syngeneic comparisons were not possible, which introduces some noise into the percentage of hypo-methylated DMRs, we used a more lenient threshold of &gt;50% â whereby GICs were classified as having a hypo-methylation bias if they had &gt;50% hypo-methylated DMRs in all 5 iNSC comparisons. These thresholds are now clearly stated in the text, page 19, line 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2, panel F-H: the difference in enrichment scores may be significant, but the effect size seems marginal. To better put this into context, the scale of the y-axis should start at 0 for all panels.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this, it is a good point, and it has been implemented, now all scale of the y-axis starts at 0. This applies also to Figure 3 A and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 A therefore we have changed these figures accordingly too. However, we would like to point out that even if the effect size is small the differences were shown to be statistically significant (Figure 2F: One-way ANOVA, Figures 2G &amp; H: Mann-Whitney T-Test), therefore the conclusions to be drawn by these graphs are sound.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also unclear to me why enrichment for astrocyte signatures was tested against all cell lines, but enrichment for oligodendrocyte signatures was only tested in iOPC and iNSC. The oligodendrocyte signatures should also be tested against iAPC to demonstrate specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to highlight that the iOPC were analysed separately from the iAPC due to a difference in library prep methods leading to a strong batch effect. Due to the low yield and quality of RNA isolated from FACS sorted iOPCs we could not use PolyA library prep methods and instead SmartSeq2 library prep methods had to be used. We observed a large batch effect in the data when merging with samples prepped via PolyA methods. We have previously tried to correct for this batch effect using ComBatSeq however we found that this did not remedy the problem. As we could not correct for the batch effect, we felt it would be inaccurate and misleading to analyse the cell types together.</p><p>However, to address the concerns of the reviewer we have created <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> which shows the enrichment scores for the oligodendrocyte signatures in our Poly-A library prepped samples as well as reference CNS samples. Therefore, whilst we cannot analyse the iOPC and iAPC together we do show here that the OPC signatures are specific to the OPC cell type and iOPCs from Garcia-Leon et al. show significantly higher enrichment scores than other cell types such as iAPCs, pAstros, iNSCs and iNeurons.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77335-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors identify SRPX2 as the target gene associated with hypomethylation bias/ACS-enriched GBM cells. The functional validation of SRPX2 is very limited though and includes only 3 in vitro assays (proliferation, invasion, sphere formation).

We found that the expression of SRPX2 is highest in regions of microvascular proliferation and hyperplastic blood vessels, whilst it is lowest in the leading edge and infiltrating tumour (page 25, line 22-24). This is potentially very interesting given that these two areas represent the two main invasive niches in glial tumours, namely the perivascular spaces (page 25, line 24-25) and the white matter tracts (Giese and Westphal, Neurosurgery, 1996). To further investigate this, we identified the top 200 genes up regulated in regions of microvascular proliferation and hyperplastic blood vessels, relative to other tumour regions. We then used these 200 genes as a signature and scored single tumour cells from Antunes et al. Finally, we correlated single tumour cells score for this signature against the ACS and OPC signatures used in this study and found that the ACS had a positive correlation with the genes up regulated in regions of microvascular proliferation and hyperplastic blood vessels. The OPC signatures had a negative correlation.</p><p>We acknowledge that these remain correlative data, which will require in vivo functional validation and we mention this explicitly in the manuscript, page 29, line 35 â 36, however they provide additional support to our conclusion that SRPX2 may play a role in mediating at least in part the more invasive properties of tumours with an hypomethylation bias and astrocytic signature enrichment.</p><p>We have added these findings to the manuscript on page 25 and in Figure 4 M &amp; N as well as Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 F &amp; G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, does knockdown of SRPX2 affect expression of ACS markers?</p></disp-quote><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77335-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To investigate the effect of silencing SRPX2 on ACS markers, we have selected four genes â LRCC17, CLU, FABP7, TIMP2 â as these genes were highly expressed in BE-GICs and had a positive correlation with SRPX2 expression according to TCGA data available on Gliovis. We assessed expression of these markers via qPCR in SRPX2 knockdown lines (N = 6) (both U3118 from the HGCC cohort and GIC19 from our cohort). We show in Author response image 2 that SRPX2 knockdown had no consistent impact on the expression of the selected genes. Overall, given that SRPX2 is a secreted protein that plays a role in the extracellular matrix, and not a transcription factor for example, it is perhaps not surprising that it does not impact widely on the expression of ACS markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Macrophage infiltration data relies only on scRNA-Seq analysis. This data may be biased by sample area or input cell numbers. It would be good to validate changes in immune cell content e.g. by histological staining of parent tumour samples from bias/enriched and non-bias GIC lines.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good suggestion, which we have followed. We have stained FFPE tumour tissue from parental tumours corresponding to BE-GICs and nBE-GICs for CD68 â a known marker of macrophages and found that there is a trend for a higher percentage of CD68+ cells in tumours from BE-GICs (p = 0.0528). Although not reaching statistical significance probably because of the small numbers of tumours stained and/or the more generic nature of CD68 as a macrophage marker as compared of the cell subtypes which can be identified in the scRNASeq datasets, we have added the data to the manuscript (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 C) as it does provide some additional validation even if only as a trend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure S2: The immunofluorescence staining for GFAP and CD44 (panel B) looks like background staining and not a real signal.

If there are only ten or eleven samples to analyse, the difference between groups needs to be considerable as the high-dimensionality of the data makes the power limited. At least on the gene expression analysis, this was apparently not the case. The authors went on to do many different comparisons of GICs with iNSCs, iAPCs and iOPCs to find a rationale behind the reduced methylation signature, but why each comparison is done and why not always the same samples are compared is not always clear. It is quite possible that the comparisons are entirely valid, but it needs more clarification. I tried several attempts but had too many issues with fully understanding the flow of the experiments. That is not to say the manuscript is not of interest, methylation on gliomas is a very powerful tool, and finding new subtypes is of high relevance.</p></disp-quote><p>We have simplified and clarified the text.</p><p>We have streamlined the terminology and we use it consistently across the manuscript:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>When referring to GICs with and without a hypomethylation bias we now define these B-GICs (Bias-GICs) and nB-GICs (non-Bias-GICs) respectively.</p></list-item><list-item><p>When referring to GICs that have both a hypo-methylation bias and astrocytic signature enrichment and those without, we now define these BE-GICs (Bias-Enriched-GICs) and nBE-GICs (non-Bias-Enriched-GICs) respectively.</p></list-item></list><p>We have re-written the result section, where we explain our rationale for identifying DEGs that play a role in the observed phenotype and have added a dedicated figure summarising the strategy schematically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Consider the variables: GICs, iNSCs, iASC and iOPC and these are split into hypo and non-hypo samples either with or without enrichment for an ASC signature. For some analysis, subgroups are subsetted to hypo-bias/enriched. Likely because of this subsetting, the various comparisons use different samples for input. Any comparison can be done paired or unpaired (not always stated), and I could not find whether there was any correction for multiple testing/false discovery rate.</p></disp-quote><p>Full details of the parameters i.e., statistical models, FDR thresholds and logFC thresholds used in the differential analyses carried out, are described in the Materials and methods of the manuscript (page 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Just look at the following paragraphs on page 24/25 of the manuscript:</p><p>&quot;To identify genes that may contribute to the phenotypic characteristics of the bias/enriched GICs, and the tumours derived thereof, the following differential expression analyses were performed on a patient-by-patient basis: iAPC versus GIC, iAPC versus iNSC and iNSC versus GIC, with the aim to identify genes that play a role in the differentiation of iAPCs and are deregulated in GICs. Lists of DEGs for each patient comparison were then overlaid to find DEGs that were either unique or present in more than one comparison. DEGs present in both the iNSC versus GIC, and iNSC versus iAPC comparisons, were selected for further analysis as these DEGs could play a role in the differentiation of NSCs to astrocytes and because of the consequent similar expression level between GICs and iAPCs could indicate that GICs are ontogenetically linked to these progenitors.</p><p>We aimed at identifying genes that were differentially expressed in the two comparisons of interest and were at the same time part of the ACS (Figure 4 D). We focussed on DEGs that were specific to GICs 19, 31 and 44 and shared between all three. â¦&quot;</p><p>If I try to tease out what is stated here: there are three comparisons, for two phenotypes for a very limited number of patients. There is no data on individual comparisons, no data on the overlap between comparisons, they just end up with three genes. The comparison includes sample 44, likely because this sample had a minor AC phenotype (but was not hypomethylated). Sample 44 can therefore have been assigned to either label. Because the sample size is so small, it is important that labels are always similar. The comparisons also did not include samples 17 and 30, likely because iNSC were created from only five samples. If so, the comparisons are made on a very limited number of patients. There are just so many comparisons, filters used and sample selections made that probably make sense, but I had great difficulty in judging the validity thereof.</p></disp-quote><p>GIC44 was found to be enriched for the astrocytic signature, it did not have a hypo-methylation bias hence it was excluded from the two groups in our analysis because it did not meet the criteria of either. However, to improve the clarity of the manuscript we have removed GIC44 from the whole manuscript/analysis to avoid confusion. With regards to the confusion around the various differential analyses comparisons â we have included a schematic (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 A) dedicated to summarising the comparisons performed and the strategy we used to identify genes of interest as well as completely re-written the section of the manuscript describing the strategy and the reasoning behind the strategy as well as the results â we hope that this will be much clearer to follow.</p></body></sub-article></article>
