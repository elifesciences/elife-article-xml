In proliferating cells, microtubules are highly dynamics, and proliferation cessation often leads to their stabilization. One of the most stable microtubule structures identified to date is the nuclear bundle assembled in quiescent yeast. In this article, we characterize the original multistep process driving the assembly of this structure. This Aurora B-dependent mechanism follows a precise temporality that relies on the sequential actions of kinesin-14, kinesin-5, and involves both microtubule–kinetochore and kinetochore–kinetochore interactions. Upon quiescence exit, the microtubule bundle is disassembled via a cooperative process involving kinesin-8 and its full disassembly is required prior to cells re-entry into proliferation. Overall, our study provides the first description, at the molecular scale, of the entire life cycle of a stable microtubule structure in vivo and sheds light on its physiological function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-21-CE13-0023-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laporte</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name><name><surname>Massoni-Laporte</surname><given-names>Aurelie</given-names></name><name><surname>Dompierre</surname><given-names>Jim</given-names></name><name><surname>Sagot</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#193366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laporte</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name><name><surname>Massoni-Laporte</surname><given-names>Aurelie</given-names></name><name><surname>Sagot</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1846262</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Mohan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Conseil Regional de Nouvelle Aquitaine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#20111301010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royou</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In quiescent yeast, a stable bundle of parallel microtubules is assembled from the centrosome by an original multistep mechanism that follows a precise temporality and involves Aurora B and various kinesins.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules (MTs) are hollow cylindrical polymers assembled by the non-covalent interaction of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers. MTs are generally nucleated at MT organizing centers (MTOCs) by a ɣ-tubulin complex (ɣ-TuC) that acts as a template and stabilizes the so-called MT ‘minus-end’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roostalu and Surrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sanchez and Feldman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thawani and Petry, 2021</xref>). At the opposite end, the ‘plus-end’ (+end), MTs elongate by the addition of GTP tubulin. The β-tubulin bound GTP is hydrolyzed and stable but transient GDP + Pi intermediates are generated in the region immediately behind the growing +end. Subsequent Pi release favors MT depolymerization, which can be rescued by de novo GTP-tubulin addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cleary and Hancock, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gudimchuk and McIntosh, 2021</xref>). Thus, MTs alternate between periods of growth and shrinkage, a behavior termed dynamic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>). In vivo, a profusion of MT-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate MT length and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bodakuntla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodson and Jonasson, 2018</xref>). In addition, MTs are often assembled from multiple tubulin variants or isotypes, and are modified by a cohort of post-translational modifications that modulate MT dynamics directly or by influencing the recruitment of MAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janke and Magiera, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roll-Mecak, 2020</xref>). Other MAPs organize MTs into high-ordered assemblies, either by cross-linking MTs or by connecting them with cellular structures such as membranes, chromosomes, or actin cytoskeleton components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bodakuntla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meiring et al., 2020</xref>). Cells fine-tune these mechanisms in both space and time to give rise to distinct MT edifices with specific functions.</p><p>In proliferating cells, MT dynamics are crucial for their functions. It allows exploration of the cell volume in search of structures to ‘capture’, such as centromeres during mitosis, or to exert pushing or pulling forces required for various cellular processes such as cell migration or morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heald and Khodjakov, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kirschner and Mitchison, 1986</xref>). The MT cytoskeleton can undergo extensive rearrangements and assemble more stable MT structures, especially when cells change fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meiring et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Röper, 2020</xref>). For example, in terminally differentiated cells, such as epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, or neurons, stable MT networks make up the majority and ensure critical cellular functions such as cell shape maintenance or long-distance intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Muroyama and Lechler, 2017</xref>). Defects in MT stabilization are at the origin of many human pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases and ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anvarian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wheway et al., 2018</xref>). Effectors responsible for MT stabilization have been actively searched for since the 1980s. In mammals, the involvement of specific MAPs such as Tau, MAP2, MAP6, and PRC1, or tubulin post-translational modifications, has been extensively studied. While their contributions to MT stabilization are central and undisputed, their sole actions do not fully explain the observed levels of MT stability in many types of non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hahn et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>For years, yeast species have been instrumental in unraveling the mechanisms that regulate MT dynamics in eukaryotes. While proliferating yeast cells exhibit a dynamic MT network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Winey and Bloom, 2012</xref>), proliferation cessation goes with the formation of dramatically stable MT structures in both <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laporte and Sagot, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laporte et al., 2015</xref>). Upon quiescence establishment, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells assemble a bundle composed of stable parallel MTs, hereafter referred to as the Q-nMT bundle, for <italic>Q</italic>uiescent-cell <italic>n</italic>uclear <italic>M</italic>icro<italic>t</italic>ubule bundle. This structure originates from the nuclear side of the spindle pole body (SPB), the yeast equivalent of the centrosome. It spans the entire nucleus and relocalizes kinetochores and centromeres, which remain attached to MT +ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laporte and Sagot, 2014</xref>). Because the MTs embedded in the Q-nMT bundle are not all of the same length, the structure has a typical arrow shape. When cells exit quiescence, the Q-nMT bundle depolymerizes and, by pulling the attached centromeres back to the SPB, allows the recovery of the typical Rabl-like configuration of chromosomes found in G1 yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin et al., 1998</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of this peculiar stable MT structure and its physiological function(s) are not understood. However, cells defective in Q-nMT bundle formation have a compromised survival in quiescence and a drastically reduced fitness upon cell cycle re-entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laporte and Sagot, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laporte et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that Q-nMT bundle formation is a multistep process that follows a precise temporal sequence. The first step relies on Aurora B/Ipl1 activity and requires the kinesin-14 Kar3, its regulator Cik1, and the EB1 homolog Bim1. It leads to the formation of a short (≈ 1 µm) and stable bundle that resembles a half mitotic spindle. Importantly, in this first step, MT polymerization and stabilization are coupled. In a second step, additional MTs polymerize from the SPB, elongate, and are zipped to pre-existing MTs in a Cin8/kinesin-5-dependent manner. Complete stabilization of the Q-nMT bundle is achieved in a third and final step that requires the kinesin-5 Kip1. Our observations further indicate that Q-nMT bundle assembly requires both MT–kinetochore attachment and inter-kinetochore interactions. Finally, we show that, upon exit from quiescence, the Q-nMT bundle disassembles from its +ends, each MT depolymerizing in coordination with its neighbors, via the action of the depolymerase Kip3, a member of the kinesin-8 family. Importantly, we show that the complete disassembly of the Q-nMT bundle is required for cells to re-enter the proliferation cycle. Overall, this study describes the entire life cycle of an MT structure, from the molecular mechanisms involved in its formation and stabilization to its disassembly, and further suggests that this atypical quiescent-specific structure could act as a regulator, or a ‘control point’ for cell cycle resumption upon exit from quiescence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Q-nMT bundle formation is a three-step process</title><p>We have previously shown that the Q-nMT bundle observed in quiescent cells is a stable nuclear structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate whether the stabilization of the Q-nMT bundle was concomitant with its assembly or whether it assembled first as a dynamic structure and then gets stabilized, we quantified the Q-nMT bundle length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) upon quiescence establishment following carbon source exhaustion. We found that the Q-nMT bundle assembly process could be divided into three sequential phases. In an initial phase (phase I), MTs elongated from the SPB to reach ≈ 0.8 µm. The number of these MTs, referred to as phase I-MTs, was approximately the same as in a mitotic spindle (see inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, phase I-MTs were resistant to nocodazole (Noc), a MT poison that causes dynamic MT depolymerization, indicating that phase I-MT stabilization was concomitant with their polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). In a second phase, beginning ≈ 10 hr after glucose exhaustion, additional MTs emerged from the SPB (phase II-MTs) and elongated along phase I-MTs, nearly doubling the thickness of the phase I MT bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At this stage, the tip of the newly elongated MTs was unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Complete stabilization of the Q-nMT bundle was achieved ≈ 48 hr after glucose exhaustion (phase III). Indeed, after this step, a Noc treatment did not affect either the length or the thickness of the Q-nMT bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Plotting Q-nMT bundle width as a function of length for each individual cell before and after Noc treatment further revealed the three successive phases of the Q-nMT bundle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Of note, Q-nMT bundles were also observed both in diploid cells upon glucose exhaustion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and in haploid cells transferred to water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The formation of the quiescent-cell nuclear microtubule (Q-nMT) bundle is a three-step process.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nuclear MT length in WT cells expressing mTQZ-Tub1, before (<bold>-</bold>) or after (+) a 15 min Noc treatment (30 µg/ml) upon entry into quiescence.

As expected, movies showed that upon Q-nMT bundle formation initiation, the Nuf2-GFP signal relocated from the SPB to the distal part of elongating Q-nMT bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In phase II, when cells were treated with Noc, the Nuf2-GFP signal followed depolymerizing MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left panel), testifying for the instability of phase II-MTs. In contrast, the Nuf2-GFP signal remained immobile upon Noc treatment in phase III as cells have fully stabilized Q-nMT bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right panel). Second, we measured the γ-tubulin (Tub4) signal at the SPB and found that Tub4 started to accumulate at the SPB at the beginning of phase I to reach a plateau at the end of phase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Interestingly, the amount of Tub4 at the SPB was proportional to the thickness of the Q-nMT bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Finally, in order to confirm the two waves of MT elongation, we developed a strain expressing mTQZ-Tub1 from the endogenous TUB1 promoter and mRuby-TUB1 under the ADH2 promoter, a promoter that is de-repressed after glucose exhaustion, as confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We observed that mRuby-TUB1 was incorporated into the Q-nMT bundle only after phase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), confirming the existence of a second wave of MT elongation during phase II. All the above experiments led us to propose the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Q-nMT bundle formation is an essential time-regulated process</title><p>Increasing cytoplasmic viscosity has been shown to dampen MT dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Molines et al., 2022</xref>). Upon quiescence establishment, yeast cells undergo a transition from a fluid to a solid-like phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>) and an acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacquel et al., 2021</xref>), which could contribute to the formation of the Q-nMT bundle. Several lines of evidence suggest that these changes in physicochemical properties are not involved in Q-nMT formation. First, 4-day-old quiescent cells can simultaneously display both dynamic cytoplasmic MTs (cMTs) and a stable Q-nMT bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>). Second, when we mimicked a fluid to solid-like phase transition in proliferating cells by artificially lowering the pH, no stable MTs were observed, whereas F-actin aggregation was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>) as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peters et al., 2013</xref>). Third, 2-day-old quiescent cells exhibiting a phase III Q-nMT bundle were able to grow de novo dynamic cMTs after a pulse-chase Noc treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, if Q-nMT bundle formation was solely dependent on physicochemical changes, this structure should be able to assemble in late quiescence. By treating cells with Noc upon glucose exhaustion, we were able to prevent the formation of the Q-nMT bundle in early quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Strikingly, when the drug was washed out, no Q-nMT bundle assembled, even 144 hr after Noc removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These cells had entered quiescence because they had assembled actin bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, right panel), another quiescent cell-specific structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>). This experiment strongly suggests that Q-nMT formation is a process induced by a transient signal emitted upon glucose exhaustion.</p><p>We have previously shown that mutants unable to assemble Q-nMT bundles have reduced viability in quiescence and a reduced ability to form colonies upon exit from quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>). To establish a direct link between the absence of the Q-nMT bundle and the above phenotypes, we took advantage of our ability to conditionally prevent Q-nMT bundle formation in WT cells using Noc treatment at the onset of glucose exhaustion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L</xref>, in the absence of the Q-nMT bundle, WT cells lose viability in quiescence and survivors have a reduced ability to generate a progeny upon exit from quiescence. In contrast, a similar Noc treatment of cells that have already assembled a stable Q-nMT bundle (5-day-old cells) did not affect either the viability in quiescence or quiescence exit efficiency, demonstrating that Noc did not have a toxic effect per se. Taken together, these experiments confirm our initial findings that the Q-nMT bundle is important for both cell survival during chronological aging and quiescence exit fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Steady-state tubulin levels and Tub3 isotype are critical for Q-nMT bundle formation</title><p>We then focused on deciphering the molecular mechanisms involved in Q-nMT bundle formation. Yeast cells express two α-tubulin isotypes, Tub1 and Tub3. In proliferating cells, Tub1 constitutes the majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aiken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nsamba et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schatz et al., 1986</xref>). In 4-day-old cells, the two α-tubulin isotypes were found embedded in the Q-nMT bundle. This was observed using two different pairs of fluorescent proteins in order to avoid any influence of the FP variants and using both widefield and expansion microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since Tub3 stabilizes MTs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bode et al., 2003</xref>), it may be key for Q-nMT bundle formation. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the phenotype of <italic>tub3∆</italic> cells. In phase II, <italic>tub3∆</italic> cells displayed short MT bundles that were sensitive to Noc. In phase III, no MT bundles were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, in this mutant, the MT bundles assembled during phase I were not stable and eventually collapsed.

Thus, the amount of α-tubulin, but not Tub3 itself, may be important for Q-nMT bundle formation.

Second, we focused on the chromosome passenger complex (CPC: Bir1/Survivin, Sli15/INCENP, Nbl1/Borealin, and Ipl1/Aurora B), a complex known to regulate kinetochore–MT attachment dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cairo and Lacefield, 2020</xref>). We found that inactivation of <italic>IPL1</italic> upon entry into quiescence using the thermosensitive allele <italic>ipl1-1</italic> prevented Q-nMT bundle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The absence of Q-nMT bundles in cells harboring the NA-PP1 kinase-sensitive allele <italic>ipl1-5as</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nerusheva et al., 2014</xref>) indicated that the Ipl1 kinase activity was required for this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and E</xref> for controls). While we could not detect Ipl1 and Nbl1 in quiescent cells, we found that Sli15-GFP and Bir1-GFP localized along the Q-nMT bundle with an enrichment at the Q-nMT bundle +end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In 4-day-old <italic>bir1∆</italic> cells, Q-nMT bundle were shorter and not fully stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, inactivation of <italic>SLI15</italic> upon glucose exhaustion using the thermosensitive allele <italic>sli15-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 1999</xref>) drastically impaired Q-nMT bundle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Finally, we examined the involvement of Bim1. Bim1 is a MT +end binding protein that plays a role in kinetochore MT-end on attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dudziak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>) and localizes along the entire Q-nMT bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, we found that that the amount of Bim1 correlated with tubulin incorporation during Q-nMT bundle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). <italic>BIM1</italic> deletion alone has no effect on Q-nMT bundle formation even in the presence of Noc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laporte et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, <italic>bim1∆ bir1∆</italic> cells barely assembled MT structures, and these structures were sensitive to Noc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This demonstrates that in the absence of Bim1, Bir1 is critical for Q-nMT bundle stabilization in phase I. Of note, we found that the viability of <italic>bim1∆ bir1∆</italic> cells in quiescence was drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Together, these experiments show that kinetochore–MT attachments are critical for the initiation of Q-nMT bundle formation upon entry into quiescence.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Kinetochore–kinetochore interactions are required for quiescent-cell nuclear microtubule (Q-nMT) bundle formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nuclear MT length distribution in WT (gray) and <italic>ndc80-1</italic> (violet) cells expressing mTQZ-Tub1 (green) and Nuf2-GFP (red), transferred to 37°C upon glucose exhaustion and maintained at 37°C for the indicated time.

To test this idea, we analyzed MT organization in s<italic>lk19∆</italic> cells, which are defective in kinetochore clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Richmond et al., 2013</xref>). In quiescence, Slk19-GFP was enriched at both ends of the Q-nMT bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). s<italic>lk19∆</italic> cells displayed shorter and thinner MT structures that were sensitive to Noc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Since Bim1 has been implicated in kinetochore–kinetochore interaction, we combined s<italic>lk19∆</italic> with <italic>bim1∆</italic>. MT structures detected in s<italic>lk19∆ bim1∆</italic> cells barely reached ≈1 µm and disappeared upon Noc treatment. In addition, in s<italic>lk19∆ bim1∆</italic> cells, kinetochores localized as a rosette around the SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and in s<italic>lk19∆ bim1∆</italic> cell viability was severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This demonstrates that in the absence of Bim1, Slk19 is required for MT bundling and stabilization in phase I. We then focused on monopolin (Mam1, Lrs4, Hrr25, and Csm1), a complex that is known to cross-link kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corbett et al., 2010</xref>). These proteins were found to be expressed in quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>), and when we analyzed the phenotype of <italic>mam1∆, lrs4∆,</italic> and <italic>csm1∆</italic> cells in quiescence, most of them displayed short MT structures often arranged in a star-like array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>). As for <italic>bir1∆</italic> and <italic>slk19∆</italic>, the combination of <italic>bim1∆</italic> with monopolin deletion worsened MT structure length and stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), as well as cell viability in quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Furthermore, cells deleted for <italic>SPO13</italic>, a gene encoding a protein involved in monopolin recruitment to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), showed similar phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that inter-kinetochore interactions are critical for Q-nMT bundle assembly.</p><p>Finally, we investigated whether kinetochore–MT interactions were required for the stability of Q-nMT bundle once it is formed. In 5-day-old WT cells, we used a UV pulsed laser to break the Q-nMT bundle into two pieces. In most cases, the length of both the released fragment and the fragment attached to the SPB remained constant, with the presence of dynamic cMTs after laser pulse testifying for cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref>). In contrast, as expected from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khodjakov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zareiesfandabadi and Elting, 2022</xref>), in proliferating cells, dynamic anaphase spindles promptly disassembled after the laser-induced breakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1L</xref>). This indicates that once Q-nMT bundles are formed, they do not require MT–kinetochore interaction to be maintained. Accordingly, inactivation of Ndc80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or Ipl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1M</xref>) in cells that were already in quiescence had no effect on the Q-nMT bundle maintenance.

From bacteria to human stem cells, changes in cell physicochemical properties are known to accompany the establishment of quiescence. Among these modifications, cellular volume reduction increases molecular crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>) and pH acidification both increases viscosity and causes changes in macromolecule surface charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charruyer and Ghadially, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacquel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Persson et al., 2020</xref>). Much evidence suggests that these modifications act as triggers for the auto-assembly of several types of enzyme-containing granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rabouille and Alberti, 2017</xref>) or complex structures such as P-bodies and Proteasome Storage Granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peters et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacquel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Currie et al., 2023</xref>). Recently, Molines and colleagues demonstrated that cytoplasmic viscosity modulates MT dynamics in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Molines et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we showed that the formation of the Q-nMT bundle does not depend on changes in the physicochemical properties that cells experience at the onset of quiescence establishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In fact, dynamic cMTs and a stable Q-nMT bundle can be observed simultaneously in a quiescent cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>), while physicochemical properties evolve in parallel in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, cellular volume reduction, pH acidification, and increased viscosity are observed within minutes upon glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>), whereas the Q-nMT bundles require a couple of days to be fully assembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, Q-nMT bundle formation cannot be delayed in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), and thus likely depends on a transient signal emitted upon glucose depletion. We speculate that the SPB may act as a platform that integrates this signal and transfers it to the MT machinery in order to assemble a stable MT structure.</p><p>As it is required for the onset of Q-nMT bundle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the CPC component Aurora B/Ilp1, a kinase that plays a key role at the MT–kinetochore interface in response to the tension status, could be one of the targets of the aforementioned nutritional signal. In parallel, upon quiescence establishment, chromosome hyper-condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guidi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rutledge et al., 2015</xref>) could modify the tension at the kinetochore/MT interface and as such could contribute to the initiation of phase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Besides, Bim1 has also been implicated in MT–kinetochore attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dudziak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>). Although its deletion alone has no effect on Q-nMT bundle formation, its role becomes critical for phase I when kinetochore–MT interactions are already destabilized by the absence of other CPC components, other than Ipl1, such as Bir1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that kinetochore–MT interactions are essential for phase I initiation, as confirmed by the absence of Q-nMT bundle in the <italic>ndc80-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for quiescent-cell nuclear microtubule (Q-nMT) bundle assembly.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) In G1, the nucleus is in a Rabl-like configuration.

Since monopolin and Slk19 are involved in kinetochore clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Plowman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rabitsch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tóth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mittal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Movshovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Richmond et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zeng et al., 1999</xref>), we speculate that kinetochore–kinetochore interaction may not only help prevent depolymerization of individual MTs, but also constrain elongating phase I-MTs and facilitate their concomitant cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).</p><p>With the initiation of phase I, Tub4 begins to accumulate at the SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) to enable the second wave of MT nucleation observed in phase II. As phase II-MTs elongate, they are simultaneously stabilized along pre-existing phase I-MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). This step relies on the kinesin-5/Cin8 as Q-nMT bundles assembled in <italic>cin8∆</italic> cells are thinner than WT Q-nMT bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). Intriguingly, in vitro, the monomeric form of the vertebrate kinesin-5, Eg5, promotes MT nucleation and stabilizes lateral tubulin–tubulin contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). We assume that in the absence of Cin8 either nucleation of phase II-MTs cannot occur, or phase II-MTs can elongate, but cannot be cross-linked and stabilized to pre-existing phase I-MTs as they grow, and thus rapidly depolymerize. Absence of bundle thickening in phase II is also observed in the ‘<italic>Tub1-only’</italic> mutant, that is, in the absence of Tub3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Tubulin isotypes or tubulin PTMs are known to promote the recruitment of specific kinesins and thereby modify MT properties (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sirajuddin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peris et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunn et al., 2008</xref>). Could Tub3 be important for Cin8 recruitment or function during phase II?</p><p>Following phase II, MTs elongate, but their distal parts (&gt;1 µm) are not yet stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Stabilization of full-length Q-nMT bundles is achieved approximately 4 d after glucose exhaustion. This step depends on the kinesin-5/Kip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which is essential for cross-linking and stabilizing elongating MTs during phase III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Accordingly, we observed a Kip1 enrichment at the Q-nMT bundle +ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, consistent with their ability to form homo-tetramers capable of cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Scholey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weinger et al., 2011</xref>) and stabilizing parallel MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shimamoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yukawa et al., 2020</xref>), and in addition to their role of sliding anti-parallel MTs, the two yeast kinesin 5 are essential for Q-nMT bundle formation. However, in quiescence, as well as in mitosis, Kip1 and Cin8 have non-equivalent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roostalu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shapira and Gheber, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Thus far, our results indicate that the mechanism of Q-nMT bundle formation is distinct from that of mitotic spindle assembly. Similarly, we show that Q-nMT bundle disassembly does not involve the same pathway as mitotic spindle disassembly as it requires Kip3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) but is independent of the anaphase-promoting complex and Aurora B/Ipl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). Interestingly, the longest MTs begin to depolymerize from their +ends first. Then, when they reach the +ends of shorter MTs, the shorter ones proceed to depolymerize alongside them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This cooperative behavior has been observed in vitro within parallel MT bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laan et al., 2008</xref>). Our data demonstrate that such a comportment does exist in vivo.</p><p>Finally, we show that the Q-nMT bundle is required for the survival of WT cells in quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). While we do not yet know why this structure is important for chronological aging, it is clear that the presence of the Q-nMT bundle modifies the organization of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laporte and Sagot, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laporte et al., 2016</xref>). Since chromatin organization influences gene expression, one hypothesis could be that the presence of the Q-nMT bundle is required for the expression of genes necessary for cell survival in quiescence. Another attractive hypothesis is that the Q-nMT bundle could be the yeast analog of the mammalian primary cilium. Indeed, these two structures are formed upon proliferation cessation, they are both composed of highly stable parallel MTs, their formation involves MT motors, and they are both templated from the centriole/SPB. More importantly, we show here that Q-nMT bundle disassembly always occurs prior to SPB separation upon exit from quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Thus, the Q-nMT bundle disassembly may control reentry into the proliferation cycle, just as the primary cilium does in ciliated mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim and Tsiokas, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, plasmids, and growth conditions</title><p>All the strains used in this study are isogenic to BY4741 (<italic>mat a, leu2Δ0, his3Δ0, ura3Δ0, met15Δ0</italic>) or BY4742 (<italic>mat alpha, leu2Δ0, his3Δ0, ura3Δ0, lys2Δ0),</italic> available from GE Healthcare Dharmacon Inc (UK), except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, in which strains of the S288c background were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nsamba et al., 2021</xref>), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, in which the W303 background was used.

Based on their results, the authors propose that Q-nMT bundle formation is a multistep process that comprises three distinct sequential phases. The authors further evaluate the role of different factors during the growth of the Q-nMT bundle upon quiescence entry, as well as during the disassembly of this structure once the cells resume their proliferation.</p><p>The Q-nMT is an interesting cellular structure whose physiological function is still widely unknown. Hence, providing new insights into the dynamics of Q-nMT bundle formation and identifying new factors involved in this process is an interesting topic of relevance in the field. The authors made a substantial effort in order to evaluate Q-nMT bundle establishment and provide a considerable amount of data, mainly obtained from microscopy analyses. Overall, the experiments are mostly well described and properly executed, and the data in the manuscript are clearly presented. Despite the interest of the study, nonetheless, there are several issues that could affect the validity of some conclusions drawn. In this way, regarding the analysis of the dynamics of Q-nMT bundle formation, the described experimental setup raises certain concerns, which mostly derive from the use of the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole as the only approach to evaluate this process. Also, regarding the factors involved in Q-nMT formation, the differences in microtubule length with the wild type strain, despite being statistically significant, are really subtle for many of the mutants analyzed (e.g., bir1, slk19, etc.). Furthermore, it is also puzzling that an effect on Q-nMT formation is proposed for meiosis-specific factors such as Mam1, which might as well be present during quiescence, but seems to be also detected in proliferating cells. Lastly, the evidence shown are insufficient to provide a direct link between defects in cell viability and aberrant Q-nMT formation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89958.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary: The authors investigate the assembly of the Q-nMT, a stable microtubule structure that is assembled during quiescence. Notably, the authors show that the formation of the Q-nMT cannot be solely explained by changes in the physico-chemical properties of quiescent cells. The authors report that Q-nMT assembly occurs in three regulated steps and identify kinesin motor proteins involved in the assembly and disassembly of the structure.</p><p>Strengths: The findings provide new insight into the assembly and possible function of the Q-nMT with respect to the response of haploid budding yeast to glucose starvation.</p><p>Weaknesses: The manuscript would benefit from more precise language and requires additional clarification regarding how claims are supported by the evidence. Clear definitions are also required, for example &quot;active process&quot; is not defined. Some conclusions are not supported by the results, for example the claim that the Q-nMT functions as a checkpoint effector that inhibits re-entry into the cell cycle.</p><p>After reviewing the responses of the authors and the revised manuscript I am now satisfied with the study in its current form.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89958.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Laporte</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Biochimie et Génétique Cellulaires</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bordeaux</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Massoni-Laporte</surname><given-names>Aurelie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Biochimie et Génétique Cellulaires, CNRS</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bordeaux</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lefranc</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Biochimie et Génétique Cellulaires, CNRS</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bordeaux</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dompierre</surname><given-names>Jim</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Biochimie et Génétique Cellulaires, CNRS</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bordeaux</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mauboules</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Biochimie et Génétique Cellulaires, CNRS</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bordeaux</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nsamba</surname><given-names>Emmanuel T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Royou</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Biochimie et Génétique Cellulaires, CNRS</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bordeaux</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gal</surname><given-names>Lihi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schuldiner</surname><given-names>Maya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Mohan L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Iowa State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ames</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sagot</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Biochimie et Génétique Cellulaires, CNRS</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">BORDEAUX</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>To hopefully contribute to more strongly support the conclusions of the manuscript, I am including a series of concerns regarding the experiments, as well as some recommendations that could be followed to address these issues:</p><p>(1) The Q-nMT bundle is largely unaffected by the nocodazole treatment in most phases during its formation. However, cells were only treated with nocodazole for a very short period of time (15 min). Have the authors analyzed Q-nMT stability after longer nocodazole exposures? Is a similar treatment enough to depolymerize the mitotic spindle? This result could be further substantiated by treatment with other MT-depolymerizing agents. Furthermore, the dynamicity of the Q-nMT bundle could be ideally also assessed by other techniques, such as FRAP.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments suggested by the reviewer have been published in our previous paper (Laporte et al, JCB 2013). In this previous study, we presented data demonstrating the resistance of the Q-nMT bundle to several MT poisons: TBZ, benomyl, MBC (Sup Fig 2D) and to an increasing amount of nocodazole after a 90 min treatment (Sup Fig2E).

Is the X-axis really displaying the length of the MTs as stated in the legend? If so, one would expect to see a displacement of the average MT length of the population as cells progress from phase II to phase III, as previously demonstrated in Figure 1A. Likewise, no data points would be anticipated for those phases in which the MT length is 0 or close to 0. Moreover, when the length of half pre-anaphase mitotic spindle was measured as a control, how can one get MT lengths that are equal or close to 0 in these cells? The length of the pre-anaphase spindle is between 2-4 um, so MT length values should range from 1 to 2 um if half the spindle is measured.</p></disp-quote><p>The graph in Fig1B represents the fluorescence intensity (a proxy for the Q-nMT bundle thickness) along the Q-nMT bundle length.</p><p>Fluorescence intensity is measured along a “virtual line” that starts 0,5 µm before the extremity of the QnMT bundle that is in contact with the SPB. In other words, we aligned all intensity measurements at the fluorescence increasing onset on the SPB side. We arbitrarily set the ‘zero’ at 0,5um before the fluorescence increased onset. That is why the fluorescence intensity is zero between 0 and 0,5 µm – The X-axis represents this virtual line, the 0 being set 0,5 µm before the Q-nMT bundle extremity on the SPB side. This virtual line allows us to standardize our “thickness” measurements for all Q-nMT bundles.</p><p>Using this standardization, it is clear that the length of the Q-nMT bundles increased from phase II to III (see the red arrow).

Unfortunately, it is technically very challenging to follow the entire process of Q-nMT bundle formation in individual cells, as it takes &gt; 48h.

We now mention it in the figure legends, see for example Fig. 5 legend line 1054.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Ipl1 inactivation using the ipl1-1 thermosensitive allele impedes Q-nMT bundle formation. The inhibitor-sensitive ipl1-as1 allele could have been further used to show whether this depends on its kinase activity, also avoiding the need to increase the temperature, which affects MT dynamics. As suggested, we have used the ipl1-5as allele. We have thus modified Fig 3B and now show that is it indeed the Ipl1 kinase activity that is required for Q-nMT bundle formation initiation (line 222).In any case, it is surprising that deletion of SLI15 does not affect Q-nMT formation (in fact, MT length is even larger), despite the fact that Sli15, which localizes and activates Ipl1, is present at the Q-nMT (Fig 3C). Likewise, deletion of BIR1 has barely any effect on MT length after 4 days in quiescence (Fig 3D). Do the previous observations mean that Ipl1 role is CPC-independent? Does the lack of Sli15 or Bir1 aggravate the defect in Q-nMT formation of ipl1-1 cells at non-permissive or semi-permissive temperature?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the Reviewer’s comments, we have re-checked our sli15Δ strain and found that it was accumulating suppressors very rapidly. To circumvent this problem, we utilized the previously described sli15-3 strain (Kim et al, JCB 1999). We found that sli15-3 was synthetic lethal with both ipl1-1, ipl1-2 (as described in Kim et al, JCB 1999) and with ipl1-as5, preventing us from addressing the CPC dependence of the Ipl1 effect asked by the Reviewer. However, using the sli15-3 strain, we now show that inactivation of Sli15 upon glucose exhaustion does prevent Q-nMT bundle formation (See new Sup Fig 3F and the text line 226-227).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Lack of both Bir1 and Bim1 act in a synergistic way with regard to the defect in Q-nMT bundle formation. Although the absence of both Sli15 and Bim1 is proposed to lead to a similar defect, this is not sustained by the data provided, particularly in the absence of nocodazole treatment (Supp. Fig 3E).</p></disp-quote><p>Deletion of bir1 alone has only a subtle effect on Q-nMT bundle length in the absence of Noc, yet in bir1Δ cells, Q-nMT bundles are sensitive to Noc. Deletion of BIM1 (bim1Δ) aggravates this phenotype (Fig. 3D). As mentioned above, Q-nMT bundle formation is impaired in sli15-3 cells. In our hands, and as expected from (Zimnaik et al, Cur Biol 2012), this allele is synthetic lethal with bim1Δ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, the simultaneous lack of Bir1 and Bim1 drastically reduces the viability of cells in quiescence and this is proposed to be evidence supporting that KT-MT attachments are critical for QnMT bundle assembly (Supp Fig 3G). However, similarly to what was indicated previously for the 24 h nocodazole treatment, here again, the lack of viability could be originated by other reasons that are associated with the lack of Bir1 and Bim1 and not necessarily with problems in Q-nMT formation. In fact, the viability defect of cells lacking Bir1 and Bim1 is similar to that of cells only lacking Bir1 (Supp Fig 3G).</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously shown that many mutants impaired for Q-nMT bundle formation (dyn1Δ, nip100Δ etc) have a reduced viability in quiescence (Laporte et al, JCB 2013). In the current study, a very strong phenotype is observed for other mutants impaired for Q-nMT bundle formation such as bim1Δ bir1Δ cells, but also for slk19Δ bim1Δ.</p><p>Importantly, as shown in the new Sup Fig 1L, in WT cells treated with Noc upon entry into quiescence, a treatment that prevents Q-nMT formation, showed a reduced viability, while a Noc treatment that does not affect Q-nMT bundle formation, i.e. a treatment in late quiescence, has no effect on cell survival. This solid set of data point to a clear correlation between the ability of cells to assemble a Q-nMT bundle and their ability to survive in quiescence. Yet, of course, we cannot formally exclude that in all these mutants, the reduction of cell viability in quiescence is due to another reason.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Both Mam1 and Spo13 are, to my knowledge, meiosis-specific proteins. It is therefore surprising that mutants in these proteins have an effect on MT bundle formation (Fig 3G-H, Supp. Fig. 3G). Are Mam1 and Spo13 also expressed during quiescence? Transcription of MAM1 or SPO13 does not seem to be induced by glucose depletion in previously published microarray experiments, but if Mam1 are Spo13 are expressed in quiescent cells, the authors should show this together with their results.</p><p>Indeed, it is interesting to notice that Mam1 and Spo13 are involved in both meiosis and Q-nMT bundle formation. As suggested by the Reviewer we have performed western blots in order to address the expression of those proteins in proliferation and quiescence (4d). We tagged Spo13 with either GFP, HA or Myc but none of the fusion proteins were functional. Yet, as shown in the new Sup Fig 3I, Mam1-GFP, Csm1-GFP and Lsr4-GFP were expressed both in proliferation and quiescence.</p><p>(13) In the laser ablation experiments that demonstrate that KT-MT attachments are not needed in order to maintain Q-nMT bundles once formed, anaphase spindles of proliferating cells were cut as a control (Supp. Fig 3I). However, late anaphase cells have already segregated the chromosomes, which lie next to the SPBs (this can be evidenced by looking at Dad2-GFP localization in Supp. Fig 3I), so that only interpolar MTs are severed in these experiments. The authors should have instead used metaphase cells as a control, since chromosomes are maintained at the spindle midzone and the length and width of the metaphase spindle is more similar to that of the Q-nMT bundle.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to “cut” short metaphase spindles, but as they are &lt; 1 µm, after the laser pulse, it is difficult to verify that spindles are indeed cut and not solely “bleached”. Furthermore, after the cut, the remaining MT structure that is detectable is very short, and we are not confident in our length measurements. Yet, this type of experiment has been done in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (Khodjakov et al, Cur Biol 2004 and Zareiesfandabadi et al, Biophys. J. 2022). In these articles the authors have demonstrated that after a cut, metaphase spindles are unstable and rapidly shrink through the action of Kinesin14 and dynein. This is now mentioned in the text line 265.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) In the experiment that shows that cycloheximide prevents Q-nMT disassembly after quiescence exit, and therefore that this process requires de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 5A), cells are indicated to express only Spc42-RFP and Nuf2-GFP. However, Stu2-GFP images are also shown next to the graph and, according to the figure legend, it was indeed Stu2-GFP that was used to measure individual QnMT bundles in cells treated with cycloheximide. In the graph, additionally, time t=0 represents the onset of MT bundle depolymerization, but Q-nMT bundle disassembly does not take place after cycloheximide treatment.

This background signal can also be observed in quiescent WT cells that do not express any GFP. We do not know what molecule could be at the origin of that signal but it may be derivative of an adenylic metabolite that accumulates in quiescence and could be fluorescent in the 550nm –ish wavelength, but this is pure speculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It is remarkable that a 20-30% decrease in tubulin levels had such a strong impact on the assembly of the Q-nMT bundle (Supp. Fig. 2).

Fig. 2). To answer Reviewer’s question, we would need to increase the amount of properly folded tubulin, in a tubulin folding mutant. One way to try to do that would be to find suppressors of GIM mutations, but this is a lengthy process that we feel would not add much strength to this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The graphs displaying the length of the Q-nMT bundle in several mutants in microtubule motors throughout a time course are presented in a different manner than in previous experiments, with data points for individual cells being only shown for the most extreme values (Fig 4C, 4H).

Fig. 1K: are only viable cells used for the colony-forming assay? How were these selected? If not, the assay would just measure survival (as in the viability assay).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, only viable cells were selected for the colony forming assay. We used methylene blue to stain dead cells. Then, we used a micromanipulation instrument (Singer Spore Play) that is commonly used for tetrad dissection to select “non blue cells” and position them on a plate (as we do with spores). Each micromanipulated cell is then allowed to grow on the plate and we count colonies (see picture in Sup Fig 1L right panel). This was described in Laporte et al, JCB 2011. We have added that piece of information in the legend (line 1129-1130) and in the M&amp;M section (line 580-586).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Could Tub3 have a role in phase I? It is not clear why the authors conclude involvement only in phase II.</p></disp-quote><p>As it can be seen in Fig 2D, MT bundle length and thickness are quite similar in WT and Tub1-only cells in phase I, indicating that the absence of Tub3 as no effect in phase I. In Tub1-only cells, MT bundles are thinner in both phase II and phase III, yet, they get fully stabilized in phase III. Thus, the effect of Tub3 is largely specific to the nucleation/elongation of phase II MTs. We hope to have clarified that point in the text (line 203-207).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Quantifications, statistics: for all quantifications, the authors should clearly state the number of experiments (replicates), and number of cells used in each, and what number was used for statistics. For all quantifications in cells, it seems that the values from the total number of cells across different experiments were plotted and used for statistics. This is not very useful and results in extremely small p values. I assume that the values for individual cells were obtained from multiple, independent experiments. Unless there are technical limitations that allow only a very small sample size (not the case here for most experiments), for experiments involving treatments the authors should determine values for each experiment and show statistics for comparison between experiments rather than individual cells pooled from multiple experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>All the experiments have been done at least in replicate. In the new Fig. 1A, we now display each independent experiment with a specific color code. For Fig 2B and 2C we now provide the data obtained for each separate experiment in Sup Fig 2C. Additional details about quantifications and statistics are provided in the M&amp;M section or in the specific figure legends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
