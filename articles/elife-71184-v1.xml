that MIBC carry many more p53 point mutations (p53m) than NMIBC (50% vs 10%). MIBC also has a higher mutation burden than NMIBC. These results suggest that DNA repair capacities, mutational susceptibility and p53m are crucial for MIBC development. We found MIBC cells are hypermutable, deficient in DNA repair and have markedly downregulated DNA repair genes, XPC, hOGG1/2 and Ref1, and the tumor suppressor, TAp63γ. In contrast, NMIBC cells are hyperactive in DNA repair and exhibit upregulated DNA repair genes and TAp63γ. A parallel exists in human tumors, as MIBC tissues have markedly lower DNA repair activity, and lower expression of DNA repair genes and TAp63γ compared to NMIBC tissues. Forced TAp63γ expression in MIBC significantly mitigates DNA repair deficiencies and reduces mutational susceptibility. Knockdown of TAp63γ in NMIBC greatly reduces DNA repair capacity and enhances mutational susceptibility. Manipulated TAp63γ expression or knockdown of p53m reduce the invasion of MIBC by 40–60%. However, the combination of p53m knockdown with forced TAp63γ expression reduce the invasion ability to nil suggesting that p53m contributes to invasion phenotype independent from TAp63γ. These results indicate that in BC, TAp63γ regulates DNA repair capacities, mutational susceptibility and invasion, and that p53m contribute to the invasion phenotype. We conclude that concurrent TAp63γ suppression and acquisition of p53m are a major cause for MIBC development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TAp63g</kwd><kwd>p53m</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>mutation susceptibility</kwd><kwd>bladder cancer</kwd><kwd>tumor invasion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA16087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Moon-shong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES00260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Moon-shong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA190678</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Moon-shong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cancer Etiology 1P01CA165980</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Moon-shong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical analysis shows that muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer cells are deficient in DNA repair and hypermutable, non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer cells are proficient in DNA repair, DNA repair capacity is regulated by tumor suppressor TAp63g, and cell invasions are regulated by TAp63g and p53.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bladder cancer (BC) is the fifth most frequently occurring cancer in the US; in 2018, there were 81,400 new BC cases and 17,980 BC deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). More than 90 % of BCs are urothelial cell carcinoma and the remaining 10 % are squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopez-Beltran and Cheng, 2006</xref>). There are two major forms of BC: the low-grade papillary types that are well- to moderately-differentiated and do not penetrate the lamina propria of the bladder wall (non-muscle-invasive BC, NMIBC), and the muscle-invasive types (MIBC) that are much more poorly differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Van Batavia et al., 2014</xref>). While the former is much less malignant and less lethal than the latter, it frequently recurs after surgery. The molecular paths that lead to these two types of BC are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu, 2005</xref>).</p><p>It has long been recognized that most, if not all, tumor cells have the propensity of malignant progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loeb, 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, only 20 % of NMIBC progress into MIBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knowles and Hurst, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nassar et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, it has been found that high-grade MIBC have a much higher genomic DNA mutation burden than the low-grade NMIBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nassar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pietzak et al., 2017</xref>). These results raise the possibilities that the low frequency of malignant progression of NMIBC is due to these BC cells being hyperactive for DNA repair and less mutable, and that MIBC cells are hypermutable and have a low DNA repair capacity.</p><p>To test these possibilities, we determined the susceptibility for DNA-damage-induced mutagenesis and quantified the DNA repair capacity in three well-established MIBC (T24, HT1197 and J82) and two NMIBC (RT4 and RT112/84) cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rigby and Franks, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Earl et al., 2015</xref>). We found that MIBC cells are more susceptible than NMIBC cells to bulky- and oxidative-DNA-damage-induced mutagenesis, and that although MIBC cells are deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER), NMIBC cells are proficient in both repair mechanisms. DNA repair genes such as XPC, Ref1, and hOGG1/2, and TAp63γ, the tumor suppressor isoform of p63, are suppressed in MIBC cells but are highly expressed in NMIBC cells. We found that forced TAp63γ expression up-regulates XPC, Ref1, and hOGG1/2, reduces the mutational susceptibility in MIBC cells, and furthermore reduces the invasion potential of MIBC by about 40–60%. It has been found that more MIBC (50%) carry p53 point mutations (p53m) compared to NMIBC (10%). We found that while knockdown p53m in MIBC reduces invasion potential by 50%, the combination of TAp63γ expression and p53m knockdown converts MIBC to become non-invasive. We also found that T3/T4 late-stage MIBC tissues in humans have lower DNA repair activity and p63 expression than Ta early stage NMIBC tissues. Our results indicate that TAp63γ is a major regulator of DNA excision repair genes that have major effects not only on DNA repair capacities and mutational susceptibility but also on the invasion potential of BC cells. TAp63γ suppression and acquisition of p53m are two major causes for BC becoming invasive.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MIBC cells are mutators, whereas NMIBC cells are not</title><p>We determined the mutational susceptibility of MIBC and NMIBC cells to DNA-damage-induced mutagenesis in a well-established <italic>supF</italic> forward mutation detection system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).

To test this possibility, we determined the capacity of NMIBC (RT4) and MIBC (T24 and HT1197) cells to repair UVC-induced bulky CPDs or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced 8-oxo-dGs in genomic DNA using the T4 endonuclease V (T4 endo V) and formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (Fpg) incision assays, respectively. It has been well-established that T4 endo V specifically incises UV-induced CPDs, and that Fpg incises ODD, mainly 8-oxo-dG adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Latham and Lloyd, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tchou et al., 1994</xref>).

Since it is well established that the major repair pathways for bulky CPDs and ODDs are NER and BER mechanisms, these results indicate that NMIBC cells are proficient in NER and BER, whereas MIBC cells are deficient in NER and BER.</p><p>Using the well-established host cell reactivation (HCR) assay and the in vitro DNA–damage-dependent-repair synthesis (DDDRS) assay, we quantified the relative repair capacity in MIBC cells versus NMIBC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).

Since multiple repair proteins are involved in NER for UV-induced CPDs, and BER for 8-oxo-dG adducts, and the repair rate-limiting factors such as damage recognition or incision and excision enzymes involved in these two repair pathways do not overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedberg Errol et al., 2006</xref>), it is unlikely that these three lines of MIBC cells share the same mutations in genes directly involved in NER and BER. Rather, it is more likely that the deficiencies in both NER and BER in these three MIBC cell lines are due to downregulation of NER and BER genes which are controlled by a common transcription factor and that this transcription factor is abundant in NMIBC but deficient in MIBC. Thus, we inquired what is this gene? In a genome-wide analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2009</xref> found that p63 controls multiple DNA repair associate genes. Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2012</xref> found that TAp63γ regulates the NER gene XPC in human fibroblasts. It had long been recognized that expression of the p63 gene is suppressed in MIBC cells but not in NMIBC cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Urist et al., 2002</xref>; these findings led us to determine the role of p63 in DNA repair, mutation susceptibility and invasiveness of BC cells in the current study.

We found that no p63 expression, including all the TAp63 and ΔNp63 isoforms, were detected in the MIBC cells such as T24, HT1197, and J82 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, the TAp63 isoforms are highly expressed in NMIBC RT4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results raise the possibility that it is TAp63 that contribute to the hyperactive DNA repair function in NMIBC cells and that the lack of TAp63 expression may contribute to the DNA repair deficiency in MIBC cells. Two more factors lead us to determine the role of TAp63 isoforms in DNA repair and invasiveness of BC cells. One, TAp63γ has been shown upregulates NER function and expression of repair genes XPC, DDB2 and GADD45 in human skin fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). While TAp63 isoforms have transcription transactivation function ΔNp63 isoforms lack this function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petitjean et al., 2008</xref>). Two, whereas TAp63 isoforms function as tumor suppressors ΔNp63 isoforms have oncogenic function by inhibition of TAp63 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores, 2007</xref>). It is well established that individuals deficient in DNA repair are more prone to develop cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedberg Errol et al., 2006</xref>), and that the somatic cells of these individuals are not only deficient in DNA repair but also more mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedberg Errol et al., 2006</xref>). These findings lead us to hypothesize the lack of DNA repair and the mutagenic and invasive prone of MIBC is more likely due to lack of TAp63 isoforms rather than lack of the oncogenic ΔNp63 isoforms. Therefore, we next aimed to determine which of these three major isoforms regulates DNA repair and invasion activity in BC cells. To do so, TAp63γ, TAp63α, and TAp63β were each transfected into MIBC T24 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) which are deficient in both NER and BER activity as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The NER and BER capacities in T24 cells with transfected TAp63γ, TAp63α, or TAp63β were determined in comparison to control vector stable transfectants. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> show that T24 cells with stable TAp63γ transfectants have a much higher level of NER and BER activity than T24 cells with stable control vector transfectants. In contrast, the T24 cells with stable TAp63α and TAp63β transfectants have a similar level of NER and BER activity compared to T24 cells with stable control vector transfectants. These results indicate that TAp63γ alone can regulate both NER and BER activity in these BC cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>TAp63γ regulates expression of DNA repair genes, XPC, hOGG1/2, and Ref one in BC cells.</title><p>The constructs of the MIBC (T24 and HT1197) with stable TAp63γtransfectants and NMIBC (RT4) cells with stable TAp63γmiR-RNAi are the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

Rather, p63 proteins are transcription factors, which likely regulate NER and BER by affecting the expression of the genes encoding the functional proteins directly involved in NER and BER mechanisms. We tested this possibility, by determining the expression of NER genes, XPA and XPC, as well as BER genes, hOGG1/2, and Ref1 in MIBC (T24 and HT1197) and NMIBC (RT4) cells. XPA is essential for both global genomic and transcription-coupled NER, and XPC is essential for global genomic NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanawalt and Spivak, 2008</xref>).

We found that HT1197 cells which carry p53m, are 2-fold more invasive than T24 BC cells which carry one wild p53 (p53wt) allele and one p53 allele with a nonsense mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper et al., 1994</xref>). While T24 cells have a low level of p53wt, the p53m in HT1197 is highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These results raise the possibility that p53m may enhance the invasion ability of MIBC independently from TAp63γ. We tested this possibility by determining the effect of knockdown p53m on the invasion ability of MIBC cells. We found that knockdown of p53 expression reduces invasion potential of T24 and HT1197 by more than 50 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, the combination of p53 knockdown and forced TAp63γ expression almost completely abolish the invasion potential of MIBC T24 and HT1197 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These results indicate that expression of p53m and suppression of TAp63γ are the crucial factors that make these cells invasive.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>DNA repair and P63 expression are inversely related to bladder cancer stage</title><p>Although the divergent abilities of cultured MIBC and NMIBC to invade are already well established, their distinct DNA repair capacity and mutation phenotypes, and their relationships with TAp63γ expression presented above have not been reported before. It is possible that some of these characteristics are due to mutations accumulated from generations of in vitro culture growth. Therefore, these characteristics may not be necessarily reflecting the inherent traits of human bladder tumors in vivo. The chance of acquiring “extra” genotypic changes in MIBC cells is even higher than in NMIBC cells since MIBC cells are deficient in DNA repair and are hypermutable. Furthermore, defining the relationship of DNA repair capacity and the level of expression of DNA repair genes and p63 for different grades and stages of human BC is useful for understanding the underlying mechanisms of BC pathogenesis. Therefore, we examined DNA repair capacity and the expression of p63, XPC, Ref1 and hOGG1/2 at the protein level in surgical samples acquired from BC (n = 16) and normal human urothelium mucosa (NHUM) (n = 13). The results show: (1) NHUM, which express UPIIIa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), are deficient in NER and BER and in the expression of XPA, XPC, hOGG1/2, Ref1, and p63 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, cultured human bladder epithelial progenitor (HBEP) cells, which do not express UPIIIa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), are proficient in NER and BER and in expressing these NER and BER genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>); (2) NER and BER capacity in stage Ta NMIBC is higher than stage T1, T2 MIBC, and stage T3, T4 MIBC have the lowest NER and BER capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>); (3) p63 expression is highest in stage Ta NMIBC followed by stage T1 &amp; T2 MIBC, and stage T3 &amp; T4 MIBC have lowest p63 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>); and (4) stage T3 &amp; T4 MIBC have lower XPC, XPA, and Ref1 expression than Stage Ta to T2 MIBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). These results demonstrate that stage Ta NMIBC and stage T3 &amp; T4 MIBC have similar NER and BER capacity to that in cultured NMIBC and MIBC cells, respectively. In contrast, NER and BER capacity in stage T1 &amp; T2 MIBC are lower than Ta NMIBC but higher than T3 &amp; T4 MIBC. These results demonstrate that both cultured MIBC cells and late stage MIBC tissues are deficient in NER and BER and p63 expression, while Ta NMIBC tissues and cultured NMIBC cells have relatively high p63 expression and high NER and BER capacity. In contrast, stage T1 and T2 MIBC tissues have intermediate levels of NER and BER capacity and p63 expression. These results indicate that expression of p63 and DNA repair capacity play a pivotal role in BC pathogenesis.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>NER and BER capacity, expression of repair genes, and p63 in human bladder cancer tissues of different stages.</title><p>Cell lysates were prepared from human bladder tumor tissues (BTT) of different stages (Ta to T4, n = 16).

The two MIBC lines T24 and HT1197, have similar, if not identical, deficiencies in NER and BER, as well as low expression of hOGG1/2, Ref1, XPC, and p63 genes, and both exhibit a hypermutable phenotype. Since these two cell lines were derived from different patients with T3 and T4 stage MIBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rigby and Franks, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O’Toole et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rasheed et al., 1977</xref>), it is unlikely these molecular features were obtained during prolonged in vitro culture conditions. Instead, it is more likely that they are the molecular traits of human MIBC. It should be noted that a third MIBC cell line, J82, also exhibits deficient p63 expression, and deficiency in NER and BER as with T24 and HT1197 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D, E, F ,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>), and that a second NMIBC RT112/84 cell line has high DNA repair capacity similar to that found in RT4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that while stage Ta NMIBC tissues are proficient in NER and BER, stage T3 and T4 MIBC tissues are deficient in both. Based on these results we reached the following six conclusions: (1) MIBC cells are hypermutable, whereas NMIBC cells are not; (2) MIBC cells are deficient in NER and BER, whereas NMIBC cells are hyperactive in NER and BER; (3) the hypermutable phenotype of MIBC cells is the result of a deficiency in DNA repair; (4) TAp63γ is suppressed in MIBC cells and highly expressed in NMIBC cells; (5) TAp63γ upregulates XPC, Ref1, hOGG1/2, and possibly other repair genes, and consequently regulates the NER and BER activity; BC cells with down-regulated TAp63γ are deficient in NER and BER and are hypermutable; and (6) TAp63γ plays a major role in MIBC development <italic>via</italic> both DNA-repair-activity-dependent and independent mechanisms.</p><p>It is well established that XPC is essential for repair of bulky DNA damage, and that hOGG1/2 and Ref1 are the major enzymes for repair of 8-oxo-dGs and abasic sites in genomic DNA, therefore suppression of these three DNA repair genes is sufficient to enhance both bulky DNA adducts and ODD-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">David et al., 2007</xref>). We found that the expression of TAp63γ in MIBC not only restores the DNA repair capacity but also greatly reduces DNA-damage-induced mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Furthermore, suppression of TAp63γ in NMIBC cells not only reduces DNA repair capacity, it also greatly enhances DNA-damage-induced mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). These results lead us to conclude that the hypermutable phenotype of MIBC cells is the result of a deficiency in DNA repair of these cells, which is due to suppression of TAp63γ, and that the non-mutator phenotype of NMIBC cells is due to the hyperactive DNA repair functions.</p><p>Our results show that XPA is expressed in both NMIBC (RT4) and MIBC (T24 and HT1197) cells and that neither forced TAp63γ expression in MIBC cells nor knockdown TAp63g expression in NMIBC cells affects the XPA expression in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These results indicate that XPA expression is not regulated by TAp63γ. Similar results were also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2012</xref>. However, our results show that the levels of both XPA and TAp63 in bladder tumors isolated from T3/T4 patients are relatively low compared to those in T1/T2 and Ta patients. These results raise the possibility that XPA was downregulated at the late stage of MIBC development, however, the mechanism is unclear. p63 expression is essential for the normal development of bladder tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karni-Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>). In mouse models it has been found that p63 knockout is developmentally lethal and that only one layer of bladder tissue is developed in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 1999</xref>). In the human bladder, p63 is expressed in three layers of urothelial cells but not in the outer layer of urothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with these results, we found that p63 is not expressed in normal human urothelial mucosa (NHUM) which also is deficient in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, we found that most BC tumor tissues we examined show some degree of p63 expression, with T3/T4 BC tissues expressing less than T1/T2 BC tissues and Ta BC tissues expressing higher p63 than T1/T2 BC tissues. The p63 expression in these BC tissues shows a positive relationship with DNA repair activity in that Ta BC tissues have higher repair capacities than T1/T2 BC tissues and T3/T4 BC tissues have lowest DNA repair capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results raise an intriguing question: which layers of urothelial cells give rise to bladder tumors, the outer layer of urothelial cells, which lack p63 expression and DNA repair activity or the basal layer urothelial cells, which have both? We propose that NMIBC is derived from urothelial cells which have TAp63γ expression and are proficient in DNA repair and that MIBC is derived from urothelial cells which have TAp63γ suppressed and a lack of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Van Batavia et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our results also raise the additional important questions regarding what mechanisms control TAp63γ expression in BC cells and how do bladder carcinogens affect these mechanisms? We found that expression of TAp63γ in MIBC and NMIBC cells is associated with H3K4me3, H3K9me2, and H3K27me3 markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). It has been found that the p63 gene is rarely mutated in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>). These results suggest the possibility that TAp63γ expression is regulated epigenetically rather than by mutations, and that suppression of TAp63γ in BC cells is a gradual process rather than an all-or-none process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). It also suggests that the level of TAp63γ expression determines the progression of this disease and that the late-stage BC cells are more mutable than the early-stage BC cells.</p><p>It has been well established that only 20 % of NMIBC develop into MIBC. While 50 % of the MIBC have p53 point mutations, NMIBC rarely have p53 point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nassar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robertson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cordon-Cardo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spruck et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>). These results indicate that p53 point mutations are crucial for MIBC development. We propose that the over expression of the p63 gene and hyperactive DNA repair in NMIBC cells may prevent the acquisition of p53 point mutations, thereby inhibiting the development of MIBC.</p><p>We found that TAp63γ expression can restore DNA repair capacity and reduce DNA damage induced mutagenesis to levels equal to the levels in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). However, TAp63γ overexpression or knockdown p53m alone in the MIBC cells cannot fully reduce the cell invasion to the level of NMIBC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results indicate that the invasion phenotypes are controlled by multiple mechanisms and that the p63 pathway is two of them. If this is the case, then MIBC with stable TAp63γ transfectants and NMIBC cells with suppressed TAp63γ and stable p53m transfectants will be able to provide us with well-characterized research platforms to search the additional mechanisms for cell invasion other than those that involve the p63 and p53 pathways.</p><p>Finally, the results showing that T1/T2 and T3/T4 BC cells are deficient in NER and BER, provide a strong rationale for exploiting DNA damaging agents as potential therapeutic agents for MIBC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>XPA, XPC, hOGG1/2, p53, and p63 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX), α-tubulin from Calbiochem (Billerica, MA), IgG antibodies from Amersham Biosciences (Pittsburgh, PA), T4 kinase, protease K, and RNase A from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA), α-<sup>32</sup>P-dATP from Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA), and growth medium MEM and EMEM from Sigma and ATCC, respectively.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Darel J Hunting (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The role and mechanism(s) of selective mutant p53 in migration and invasion in bladder cancer are characterized in this study, but the reviewers feel that the data presented do not fully support the conclusions. More specifically: two invasive bladder cancer cell lines studied here contain p53 mutations outside the DNA binding domain, and it is unclear whether these 2 mutant p53 proteins have GOF activity. It is also unclear whether the observation made from these 2 cell lines accurately reflects the role of mutant p53 in bladder cancer in general. Among the 3 hotspot mutant p53 (175, 248 and 273), only 248 exhibits a promoting effect on migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells, and this was tested only in 1 cell line with ectopic overexpression. The authors should provide additional experimental evidence with true GOF mutant alleles of p53.</p><p>2) The authors should examine the regulation of DNA repair by δ-N forms in bladder cancer cells or explain the rationale for examining TA isoforms only in this study.</p><p>3) The authors examined the effect of ectopic TAp63γ expression in invasive bladder cancer only (not in non-invasive bladder cancer) and TAp63 knockdown in non-invasive bladder cancer only (not in invasive bladder cancer). It is requested that the authors perform these experiments in both type of cells to compare whether there are difference between invasive and non-invasive bladder cancer cells or provide rationale for the current experiment design.</p><p>4) Please provide quantitation for migration, invasion, and wound healing experiments to increase the clarity, and provide error bars for the quantitative results.</p><p>5) The statement 'It should be noted that the level of p63 expression in NMIBC cells, is higher than in HBEP and that NMIBC cells have a higher repair activity than HBEP cells.' (line 164-165) is not supported by Figure 2A; please clarify.</p><p>6) Figure 3 shows that TAp63γ does not change XPA expression in bladder cancers. Therefore, the association of XPA and TAp63γ in bladder patient samples (Figure S3) may not be due to the direct regulation of XPA by TAp63. This should be addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>7) Please discuss and clarify the virtual absence of both NER and BER in the NMIBC cells. Is it because these cells are sickly and difficult to culture? These tumors should be extremely sensitive to DNA damaging agent, such as ionizing radiation.</p><p>8) The high levels of unmutated (WT) p53 expression in NMIBC cells should lead to cell cycle arrest and possibly apoptosis unless a downstream protein is mutated or altered in expression. It is requested that the authors test whether the p53 damage response pathway is functional in these cells.</p><p>9) Please discuss the potential role of low levels p63 in MIBC in double strand break repair.</p><p>10) The authors state that the NMIBC cells are hyperactive for DNA repair but they seem to be normal. Please tone down this conclusion or clarify it with data or examples from the literature.</p><p>11) Please explain why the two wavelengths of UV are used in the two assay in Figure 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Figure 2A shows that all types of p63 isoforms are largely disappeared in invasive bladder cancer lines, indicating the down regulation of both TA and δ-N forms. It is suggested to examine the regulation of DNA repair by δ-N forms in these cells.</p><p>Authors examined the effect of ectopic TAp63γ expression in invasive bladder cancer only (not in non-invasive bladder cancer) and TAp63 knockdown in non-invasive bladder cancer only (not in invasive bladder cancer). It is suggested to perform these experiments in both type of cells to compare whether there are difference between invasive and non-invasive bladder cancer cells.</p><p>Figure 5 shows that in bladder cancer cell lines tested, only selective mutant p53 proteins exhibit the promoting effects on migration and invasion.

More specifically: two invasive bladder cancer cell lines studied here contain p53 mutations outside the DNA binding domain, and it is unclear whether these 2 mutant p53 proteins have GOF activity. It is also unclear whether the observation made from these 2 cell lines accurately reflects the role of mutant p53 in bladder cancer in general. Among the 3 hotspot mutant p53 (175, 248 and 273), only 248 exhibits a promoting effect on migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells, and this was tested only in 1 cell line with ectopic overexpression. The authors should provide additional experimental evidence with true GOF mutant alleles of p53.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with reviewer’s critique that results presented in Figure 5 are lacking an assessment of the mechanistic role of p53 point mutation in BC invasion development, and that we do not have a convincing explanation of why p53<sub>m248</sub> and p53<sub>m273</sub> but not p53<sub>m175</sub> can promote the invasive potential of the non-invasive bladder cancer cells RT4. More experiments are needed to propose that these mutant p53 proteins have “gain-of-function” in bladder cancer cells, which may take a major effort to achieve this goal. Therefore, we removed the results in Figure 5 and eliminated all statements on the “gain-of function” as reviewer suggested.</p><p>Having said that we believe our results show direct relationship between p53 point mutations and bladder cancer invasion ability. Our results show that knockdown p53 in invasive BC cells, J82, T24 and HT1197 which carry p53 mutations in both alleles (J82, p53<sub>m271</sub>/p53<sub>m271</sub>), and one allele (T24, p53<sub>m126</sub>/in flame deletion, HT1197, p53m365/wt) reduces both migration and the invasion ability to 50%. These results indicate that factors other than p53m contribute to the invasion ability of these cells. It is well established that 50% of MIBC carry p53 point mutations with codons 248, 273, 280, 282 and 285 as mutation hotspots. In contrast, less than 10% of non-invasive bladder cancers carry p53 mutation. Since all three MIBC cells lines bear one or two alleles with p53 point mutation these results strongly suggest that mutated p53 proteins play an important role in the invasive property of these cancer cells. Our results shown in Figure 4 that knockdown of the p53 expression in T24, J82 and HT1197 can further reduce the invasiveness of these cancer cells significantly. The results from J82 cells are particularly strong, since both p53 alleles in J82 cells are mutated, and knockdown of the expression of the p53m271 reduces the invasion potential by 50%. We believe these results support the clinical findings that the mutated p53 protein may play important role in making bladder cancer invasive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should examine the regulation of DNA repair by δ-N forms in bladder cancer cells or explain the rationale for examining TA isoforms only in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>There are two major reasons for examining the roles of TAp63 isoforms but not ΔNp63 isoforms in regulating DNA repair and cell invasion function in bladder cancer cells. First, we have found that no p63 expression, including all the TAp63 and ΔNp63 isoforms, at either the protein and mRNA level, were detected in the muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) cells such as T24, HT1197 and J82 cells (Figure 2 and Supplementary S-Figure 2). On the other hand, the TAp isoforms are highly expressed in non-invasive bladder cells (NMIBC) RT4 at both mRNA and protein level (Figure 2 and Supplementary S-Figure 2). At protein level ΔNp63 isoforms were barely or not detectable in the NMIBC RT4 cells (Figure 2 and Supplementary S-Figure 2). It has been established that TAp63 isoforms have transcription activation function while ΔNp63 isoforms lack this function. Since we found that MIBC cells are deficient in NER and BER and have a suppressed expression of not only multiple DNA repair genes, such as XPC, hOGG1/2 and Ref1, but also TAP63γ. In contrast, both DNA repair genes and TAp63γ are highly expressed in NMIBC cells. These results raise the possibility the expression of these multiple repair genes requires transcription activation of TAp63γ. Second, it has been found that ΔNp63 isoforms do not function as transcription activation factor (lack of transcription activation domain) (Petitjean et al., carcinogenesis, 2008). It has been suggested that DNp63 isoforms function as inhibitors for TAp63 isoforms (via polymerization with monomeric TAp63?). Since at protein level ΔNp63 isoforms were not detectable in the MIBC, and were barely detectable or not detectable in NMIBC, these results strongly suggest that the deficient of DNA repair of MIBC has nothing to do with ΔNp63 function, and ΔNp63 isoforms may not play important role in both DNA repair and tumor invasion function.</p><p>Our results confirm that both of these reasons are correct. Our results are both necessary and sufficient to demonstrate that TAp63g role in DNA repair and invasion. These are the reasons we focused our research on determining the function of TAp63. We believe the same rationales are shared by many researchers in this area. For example, Liu et al., found that TAp63γ upregulates NER (DNA repair, 2012).</p><p>There are more than six TAp63 isoforms and six ΔNp63 isoforms have been identified in human cells. The results that MIBC cells are lacking expression of TAp63g and multiple DNA repair genes, and that while NMIBC cells lack ΔNp63 expression, they have abundant expression of TAp63γ and DNA repair genes, and that TAp63 isoforms have transcription activation function while ΔNp63 isoforms do not has led us to make a reasonable practical decision to test the role of major TAp63 isoforms including TAp63g rather than testing DNp63 isoforms in DNA repair function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors examined the effect of ectopic TAp63γ expression in invasive bladder cancer only (not in non-invasive bladder cancer) and TAp63 knockdown in non-invasive bladder cancer only (not in invasive bladder cancer). It is requested that the authors perform these experiments in both type of cells to compare whether there are difference between invasive and non-invasive bladder cancer cells or provide rationale for the current experiment design.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results show that MIBC cells are deficient in TAp63γ expression and repair, in contrast, NMIBC cells are repair proficient and have normal to hyper-expression of TAp63γ. To further find out the causative role of the expression of TAP63γ and the repair capacity in these two types of cells, we determined whether or not changing the expression of this isoform in MIBC and NMIBC would result in changing the repair capacity and invasion phenotypes. Our results in Figures 2-4 demonstrate that it is indeed the case. Namely, the TAp63γ expression is clearly related to the DNA repair capacity and invasion phenotypes of NMIBC and MIBC. The biochemistry results also clearly support the idea that TAp63γ regulates the DNA repair function (Figure 3). We believe these results are necessary and sufficient to support the hypothesis that TAp63γ regulates both repair and invasion function.</p><p>Since MIBC cells are deficient in TAp63γ already, it is difficult to envision that further knocking down this gene expression (to reduce p63 expression in the cells which have zero p63 expression) will provide more information on the role of this gene in DNA repair and invasion. The same is true in the case of NMIBC, since TAp63γ is highly expressed in these cells and these cells are repair proficient and non-invasive, it is difficult to envision further forced TAp63γ expression would yield more information on the role repair and invasion. Therefore, we believe that further knocking down the TAP63γ in cells which are deficient in the expression of this gene, and forced expression of this gene in cells which are already proficient in its expression, will not render more information on the role of this protein in DNA repair and invasion function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please provide quantitation for migration, invasion, and wound healing experiments to increase the clarity, and provide error bars for the quantitative results.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the quantification results with error bars on migration in addition to the invasion results in Figure 4 in the revised manuscript. The wound healing assay is a different approach to demonstrate the effect of TAp63γ on the migration ability of MIBC and NMIBC. We believe this method at best is semiquantitative. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the results obtained from the chamber migration method in which we have presented the proper quantified results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The statement 'It should be noted that the level of p63 expression in NMIBC cells, is higher than in HBEP and that NMIBC cells have a higher repair activity than HBEP cells.' (line 164-165) is not supported by Figure 2A; please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we presented the results which show that the expression of p63 in NMIBC is higher than in HBEP (Figure 2A) and that NMIBC cells have a higher repair activity than HBEP cells (Figure 1 E and 1 F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3 shows that TAp63γ does not change XPA expression in bladder cancers. Therefore, the association of XPA and TAp63γ in bladder patient samples (Figure S3) may not be due to the direct regulation of XPA by TAp63. This should be addressed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the reviewer that the relationship between XPA expression in the different BC grades and stages and p63 expression is not as straightforward as in established cell lines. The causes are unclear. It is possible other factors may regulate XPA expression. Since we have examined only few cases, the relationship between XPA and p63, more examples are needed to further establish the relationship between XPA and p63 in human BC tumor. We addressed this issue in the Discussion in the revised manuscript as reviewer suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please discuss and clarify the virtual absence of both NER and BER in the NMIBC cells. Is it because these cells are sickly and difficult to culture? These tumors should be extremely sensitive to DNA damaging agent, such as ionizing radiation.</p></disp-quote><p>NIMBC are proficient in both NER and BER. However, human bladder mucosa cells which are highly differentiated (95% of the expression of these cells are uroplakins) are deficient in both NER and BER (Supplementary S-Figure 4). We found that no DNA repair genes are expressed in these cells (Supplementary S-Figure 4). We have published these results (Lee et al., Oncotarget, 2015). However, in the established NMIBC and MIBC cells, which are derived from BC, and uroplakins are not expressed (Lee et al., Oncotarget, 2015). We found that while MIBC cells are deficient in NER and BER, NMIBC are proficient in both. Since MIBC cells are deficient in BER, we expect that these cells are sensitive to ionizing radiation as review suggested. However, determining the ionizing radiation induced cytotoxicity, which requires ionizing radiation sources is beyond the scope of this research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The high levels of unmutated (WT) p53 expression in NMIBC cells should lead to cell cycle arrest and possibly apoptosis unless a downstream protein is mutated or altered in expression. It is requested that the authors test whether the p53 damage response pathway is functional in these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We found that the level of p53 expression in NMIBC is similar to, but not higher than the p53 expression in the primary cultured normal human bladder urothelial progenitors (HBEP), both carry wilt type of p53 gene (Figure 2A). We added this information in the revised manuscript (Figure 2A). These results, led us to assume that there is no a priori reason that p53 in the NMIBC would induce different p53 damage response, such as apoptosis and cell cycle effect, from normal bladder urothelial cells. In other words, we believe p53 gene function “normally” in NMIBC the same as in normal bladder urothelial cells. Therefore, we did not investigate whether or not the p53 in NMIBC cells (wild type with normal expression level as in primary cultured bladder urothelial cells) induces unusual DNA damage responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Please discuss the potential role of low levels p63 in MIBC in double strand break repair.</p></disp-quote><p>The repair of DNA double strand break (DSB) mainly occurs via homologous DNA recombination and non-homologous end-to-end joint. The recognition and the process of DSB repair are independent from NER and BER, thus beyond the scope of our current focus. Since we do not have any relevant results on this aspect, we believe it would be highly speculative to discuss the role of p63 in DSB repair in this manuscript. However, we believe it is a distinct possibility that p63 may regulate genes that are involved in DSB repair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors state that the NMIBC cells are hyperactive for DNA repair but they seem to be normal. Please tone down this conclusion or clarify it with data or examples from the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we present results which show that DNA repair capacity in NMIBC (RT4) is significantly higher than in primary cultured normal human bladder urothelial progenitor (HBEP) cells (100% vs 29-38%) in Figure 1E and 1F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please explain why the two wavelengths of UV are used in the two assay in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Low mercury pressure germicidal lamp which emits 254 nm UVC (&gt;95%) is the only UV source used for irradiation in all experiments.
