certain epialleles has been observed but experimental evidence for selection of epigenetic variation independent of genetic variation is scarce. We extended an experiment simulating selection in response to herbivory in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> to assess a potential contribution of epigenetic variation to the selected phenotypes within three accessions. To minimize maternal effects, we grew offspring from replicate populations and their ancestors for two generations in a common environment and assessed the phenotypes in the second generation. We found weak evidence for the selection of epigenetic variation: bolting time differed significantly in one accession. Significant differences between maternal lines suggested random residual or novel genetic and/or epigenetic variation. Our results are in conflict with those of a recent study reporting that environment-induced heritable variation is common in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Reanalyzing the data from that study showed that the reported findings resulted from a mix-up of accessions and, thus, reflected genetic rather than epigenetic variation between accessions. To avoid future misinterpretations of studies investigating epigenetic inheritance, we provide guidelines to design experiments that clearly differentiate between epigenetic and genetic variation and distinguish standing variation from de novo variation acquired during an experiment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>epigenetic variation</kwd><kwd>selection</kwd><kwd>transgenerational inheritance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006447</institution-id><institution>University of Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grossniklaus</surname><given-names>Ueli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University Research Priority Program &quot;Evolution in Action&quot;</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmid</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name><name><surname>Grossniklaus</surname><given-names>Ueli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Strong selection by aphids only weakly affects epigenetic and phenotypic variation within three <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accessions, demonstrating limited potential for adaptation by epigenetic differentiation within genotypes in this model species.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Modifications of DNA and histones represent epigenetic marks associated with active or repressed gene expression and play an important role in a plant’s development and its responsiveness to the environment. Unlike in animals, plant germlines are not set aside early in development but form later, when somatic cells get committed to eventually form gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>). As a result, epigenetic marks affected by environmental conditions can potentially be inherited. Therefore, epigenetic marks may contribute to adaptive responses in changing environments. Furthermore, spontaneous changes in DNA methylation, a mark associated with some naturally arising heritable epialleles in the plant model <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soppe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 2018b</xref>), occur much more frequently than genetic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van der Graaf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johannes and Schmitz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hazarika et al., 2022</xref>). This suggests that the rates of epimutations might be sufficiently high, differentiating epigenetic from genetic variation, yet low enough to maintain a heritable response to selection.</p><p>The potential role of epigenetic variation in adaptation depends on several factors: the rate of spontaneous epimutations, the influence of environmental effects on epigenetic variation, the heritability of epimutations, and the impact of epigenetic variation on the phenotype. Importantly, to contribute to adaptation, epigenetic variation must be sufficiently stable, that is, heritable over several generations, so it can be subject to selection. In non-model species, DNA methylation patterns assessed with reduced representation sequencing methods were frequently found to be associated with distinct environments or treatments. However, epigenetic variation was generally correlated with genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Moorsel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mounger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boquete et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mounger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibañez et al., 2023</xref>). Likewise, high-resolution genome-wide studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have revealed extensive variation in DNA methylation patterns among different populations, but this variation was mostly associated with underlying genetic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawakatsu et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, studies on epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) suggest that epialleles can significantly contribute to phenotypic variation in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cortijo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kooke et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, while there are examples of pure epialleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paszkowski and Grossniklaus, 2011</xref> whose frequency is not related to genetic variation, the role of spontaneous epigenetic variation in adaptation remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jablonka and Raz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quadrana and Colot, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richards et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johannes and Schmitz, 2019</xref>). This is largely because, in most species, it is difficult to distinguish between epigenetic variation that results from genetic differences and pure epigenetic variation, which is independent of the genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richards, 2011</xref>). Disentangling genetic and epigenetic effects bears most promise in clonally reproducing species, such as dandelions or strawberries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Preite et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sammarco et al., 2024</xref>), or in highly inbred species, such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>In a previous experiment with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 2018b</xref>), we simulated selection in a rapidly changing environment. We compared phenotypic traits and epigenetic variation between populations grown for five generations under selection with their genetically identical ancestors in a common environment. Selected populations of two distinct genotypes exhibited significantly different flowering times and plant architectures when compared with their ancestral populations, and these differences persisted for at least three generations in a common environment. In parallel, we observed a reduction in both, epigenetic diversity and changes in DNA methylation patterns, some of which were associated with the observed phenotypic changes. These findings indicated that epigenetic variation was subject to selection. The genotypes used in the described experiment were recombinant inbred lines (RILs), formed by hybridizing two different accessions, followed by several generations of inbreeding. Therefore, most of the epigenetic variation in these RILs was likely retained as standing variation from the original hybridization event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greaves et al., 2015</xref>) and did not accumulate during the selection experiment through spontaneously occurring or environmentally induced epimutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>Here, to assess the potential for epigenetic differentiation between selection treatments, we used a similar approach using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions from a previous selection experiment that investigated the effects of aphid herbivores on plant defensive traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Züst et al., 2012</xref>). In this selection experiment, mixtures of genetically uniform <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions were grown for five generations in either insect-free cages (control) or cages inoculated with different aphid species or a mixture of these species. After five generations, genetic variation was significantly reduced, and populations were dominated by three accessions to various degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Züst et al., 2012</xref>). To examine whether epigenetic variation was also selected within these three accessions (Ma-0, Wei-0, Wil-3), we compared phenotypic traits of selected populations (i) to the original founder population, (ii) to the control population, and (iii) between two single-species aphid treatments. From each selection treatment, we used six independent replicate populations after five generations of selection and grew them together for two generations in a randomized planting pattern in a common environment. To minimize confounding maternal effects, we assessed the phenotypes only in the second generation. We further compared genome-wide DNA methylation states in a subset of mother plants used to set up the common-environment experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the original experimental design (top) and the current study (bottom).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106930-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We designed the experiment to detect effect sizes of 10% or more at the significance level of p&lt;0.05 with a statistical power of <italic>beta</italic>&gt;0.80. While we found highly significant differences between accessions, replicate populations, and across five experimental blocks (with plants generally growing worse in two blocks compared to the other three), we observed only few significant differences between selection regimes (control and the two different aphid treatments). These differences were weak, with the percentage sum of squares explained by the contrasts being less than 1% and p-values ranging between 0.05 and 0.01. We found minimal differences in DNA methylation patterns within accessions between plants from different selection regimes, with 0.009% of all tested cytosines showing significant differences after correction for multiple testing (false discovery rate [FDR]&lt;0.05). In contrast to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 2018b</xref>), there was no reduction in the amount of epigenetic variation in response to selection. In summary, we found evidence that some within-accession differences caused by the selection regimes persisted for two generations in the common environment. However, the extent of these differences was low. Thus, we conclude that the evidence for selection of epigenetic variation in this experiment is weak.</p><p>In strong contrast to our findings, a recent study claimed that environment-induced heritable variation is common in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2024</xref>). We were surprised about this finding because, in our experiment, the aphid treatments had a strong impact on plant fitness and survival but not on epigenetic differentiation. Thus, if environment-induced heritable variation was indeed so common in this model species, we would have expected to observe it, too. We noticed that the design of the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2024</xref> was elegant but susceptible to potential errors that confounded treatments with genetic variation at the beginning of the experiment. We used their RNA-seq data to assess whether the analyzed plants displayed any evidence of residual genetic variation that was potentially confounded with the treatments. Our analysis showed that about 10% of the plants that we could assess belonged to accessions differing from the ones they had been assigned to. This error did not occur at random but stemmed from a mix-up of two selection treatments. Thus, the large effects assigned to environment-induced heritable variation were very likely due to genetic differences between accessions.</p><p>In summary, while epialleles can be subject to selection and contribute to adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 2018b</xref>), the frequency of these events remains unclear, and epigenetic differentiation in response to selection seems to require standing epigenetic variation within accessions. In contrast, evidence for a role of environment-induced epigenetic changes in adaptation in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> remains weak.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Impact of selection treatments on phenotypic traits</title><p>As described above, mixtures of genetically uniform <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions were grown for five generations, either under control conditions or inoculated with different aphid species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Züst et al., 2012</xref>). Thereafter, the populations were dominated by the three accessions Ma-0, Wei-0, and Wil-3. Phenotypic differences within uniform genetic backgrounds that were subjected to different treatments would indicate the selection of epigenetic variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, to investigate whether the treatments led to phenotypic differences within the three dominant accessions, we tested whether the selection treatments had an impact on the time to bolting, the rosette diameter at bolting, the number of rosette leaves at bolting, the leaf blade area, and the trichome density (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Besides the selection treatment and its contrasts, the model also included the experimental blocks (n=5), the accessions (n=3), the populations (n=18 + 3 ancestrals), and maternal lines (‘mother’, n=261), along with interactions of the selection treatment contrasts with accessions. Additionally, we conducted analyses without the Wil-3 accession because this accession had low replication at the level of maternal lines. We also ran separate analyses for each accession.

The time to bolting was an exception because here the term ‘accession’ explained most of the variation (23.2%), followed by ‘population’ (8.8%), ‘mother’ (8.1%), and ‘block’ (6.5%). The terms ‘accession’ and ‘population’ were also consistently significant and explained a large fraction of phenotypic variation. Effects of ‘population’ were likely due to differences in composition because accessions were not balanced between populations. Accordingly, the interaction between ‘accession’ and ‘population’, which would indicate differences between populations within accessions, was rarely significant and explained less than 1% of all variance. Additionally, the term ‘mother’ was occasionally significant, accounting for 5–10% of the total phenotypic variance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>). Compared with these previous terms indicating environmental and genetic influences, the selection treatment and its contrasts – as well as their interactions with the previous terms – were rarely significant and explained less than 1% of the total phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Furthermore, the significant differences in rosette diameter between the control and aphid treatments and between the two aphid treatments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) disappeared when we excluded the accession Wil-3 (with low replication at the level of maternal lines) from the analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In this case, only the interaction between the two aphid treatments and the two accessions Ma-0 and Wei-0 remained significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Separate analyses for each accession revealed significant differences in bolting time between the control and the aphid treatments in Ma-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). We also observed a significant difference in trichome densities between the two aphid treatments in accession Wei-0; however, these were driven by some extreme values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We found several significant differences between selection treatments in accession Wil-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) but, again, considering the low level of replication at the level of maternal lines in this accession, these differences should be treated with caution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Limited impact of aphid treatments on DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic variation</title><p>To more directly assess whether epigenetic variation could be responsible for the phenotypic differences observed between ancestral and selection treatments, we characterized changes in the genome-wide methylomes, taking DNA methylation as a proxy for epigenetic variation. We investigated the methylome of a subset of Wei-0 maternal lines from generation G6 (n=34), providing a more direct readout of the aphid treatment than would be obtained with plants from generation G7. We assessed the DNA methylation patterns of these plants by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. In total, we tested 3,573,936 cytosines for differential methylation between ancestrals and the two aphid-selection treatments. The number of significantly differentially methylated cytosines was similar in all comparisons: it ranged from 101, when the two aphid treatments were compared, to 131, when the <italic>L. erysimi</italic> treatment was compared with the ancestrals. Overall, about 0.009% of all tested cytosines showed significant differences, and they were dispersed across the entire genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We also tested whether the variation of DNA methylation, that is the extent of epigenetic variation, was reduced by the selection treatments, an effect of selection that we had previously observed in a similar experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 2018b</xref>). However, we did not find any evidence for a reduction nor an expansion of variation in DNA methylation between ancestrals and the two aphid-selection treatments in any of the three contexts of DNA methylation: CG, CHG (H being A, T, or C), and CHH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Epigenetic differences between ancestral and selected populations using a subset of mothers from the accession Wei-0.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Location of the differentially methylated cytosines along the genome.

No overall and no pairwise p-value was smaller than 0.05. Boxplots were drawn with the function graphics::boxplot() in R. The box extends from the 25th to the 75th percentile.

The majority of DMCs was in the CG context (87.6%), and only a few were found in the CHG and CHH contexts (6.2% each). Considering all cytosines of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, about 13%, 15%, and 72% are found in the CG, CHG, and CHH contexts, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 2018b</xref>). Thus, there was a clear enrichment of DMCs in the CG context, similar to our finding in the previous selection experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 2018b</xref>) and consistent with the fact that methylation in the CG context shows the highest variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kartal et al., 2020</xref>). Almost all DMCs were located within or less than 2 kb away from genes (87.3%) or genes and transposable elements (98.1%). Together with the clear enrichment of the CG context, this suggests that most DMCs were related to differences in gene body methylation (gbM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bewick and Schmitz, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muyle et al., 2022</xref>). We tested whether genes with certain functions were enriched for DMCs using gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). There was an enrichment of several terms related to epigenetic regulation: ‘histone methylation’, ‘DNA methylation’, and ‘chromatin silencing’. The remaining terms could be associated with transport and growth in general, for example, ‘positive regulation of cell proliferation’, ‘secondary cell wall biogenesis’, and ‘organic substance transport’. In conclusion, although we identified only a few DMCs, they were preferentially found in genes associated with epigenetic regulation and transport and growth processes. However, the overall limited differentiation and the absence of reduced variation in DNA methylation suggest that there was only weak selection of specific DNA methylation sites.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment among genes mapped by differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs).</title><p>‘Found’ indicates the number of different genes with the term that were mapped by DMCs. ‘Expected’ refers to the number of genes that were expected to be mapped by DMCs if six DMCs were randomly distributed.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">GO.ID</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Term</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Found</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Expected</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">p-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:0070646</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Protein modification by small protein removal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.53</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.00083</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:0016571</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Histone methylation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.07</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.00101</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:0008284</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Positive regulation of cell proliferation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.00119</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:0042732</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">D-xylose metabolic process</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.00321</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:0006487</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Protein N-linked glycosylation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.03</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.0036</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:0071702</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Organic substance transport</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">25</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">11.89</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.00423</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:0015691</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cadmium ion transport</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.11</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.00455</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:0009834</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plant-type secondary cell wall biogenesis</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.35</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.00482</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:0006306</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DNA methylation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.09</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.00492</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:0006342</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chromatin silencing</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.86</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.00794</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:0071705</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nitrogen compound transport</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">23</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">11.74</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.00931</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:0050665</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hydrogen peroxide biosynthetic process</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.83</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.00945</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GO:1905039</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Carboxylic acid transmembrane transport</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.15</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.00945</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The large effects observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2024</xref> are not due to environment-induced heritable variation but due to differences in genotype</title><p>Compared with our study, which provided weak evidence for the selection of epigenetic variation, a recent report claimed that environment-induced heritable variation is common in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2024</xref>). We were surprised by this difference in the outcomes of the two experiments, which both aimed at investigating the potential role of epigenetic variation in adaptation in this model species.

Using their RNA-seq raw data of 190 out of a total of 4,032 plants, we searched for residual genetic variation within accessions. Their RNA-seq data supposedly included four accessions. We compared pairwise genetic distances and identified the accessions most closely related to the experimental plants. We used 10,000 randomly drawn genes for the analyses and were left with up to 13,418 variants after filtering for coverage between 10 and 1000 in at least four plants per treatment and accession. Visualizing pairwise genetic distances between all plants revealed that two presumed accessions, Abd-0 and TRE-1, were each represented by two genetically distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). When we visualized each accession separately, highlighting the treatments, we found that the genetically distinct groups had been associated with different selection treatments, leading to an unwanted confounding of selection treatments with accessions. Specifically, in the high Cd treatment, the plants labeled as Abd-0 were in fact from another accession, and the same happened in the drought treatment where plants labeled as TRE-1 came from another accession (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). When we compared the genomes of these experimental plants to those of publicly available accessions, we found that the genetically distinct plants from the high Cd treatment belonged to the accession Ws-2 and those from the drought treatment belonged to the accession Fei-0, both accessions that were otherwise included in the experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Notably, when we assigned the experimental plants to publicly available accessions, the distances to the closest accessions were between 0.0003 and 0.0034 (0.0019 on average), compared with distances to accessions Abd-0 and TRE-1, respectively, ranging from 0.358 to 0.451 (0.414 on average).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Genetic differentiation between some treatments in the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2024</xref>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Genetic distances between the 190 RNA-seq samples from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2024</xref>.

The former two should both yield values close to zero as plants within lineages and within accessions should be genetically (nearly) identical to each other, whereas distances between accessions can be substantial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). These expectations were not met with the original accession labels; instead, we found large distances in all three classes. In contrast, the same evaluation with the re-assigned accession labels Ws-2 (for Abd-0 in high Cd treatment) and Fei-0 (for TRE-1 in drought treatment) confirmed the expectations of close to zero distances in classes (i) and (ii), and large distances in class (iii). Thus, it appears that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2024</xref> inadvertently had mixed up accessions when assigning plants to the two mentioned treatments.</p><p>In summary, our analysis reassigned 20 out of 190 plants (~10.5%) to new accessions. This error did not occur at random but stemmed from the wrong treatment assignment of plants from two accessions. This misassignment explains the large effects interpreted as environment-induced heritable variation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2024</xref> that, as we show here, are really effects of genetic differences between accessions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated whether selection by different aphid species within genetically uniform <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions can lead to heritable phenotypic variation that is stable in the absence of selection for at least two generations, indicative of adaptation. Such (meta)stable phenotypic variation is expected to be predominantly epigenetic in nature, defined as a mitotically and/or meiotically heritable change in gene expression without a change in DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Russo et al., 1996</xref>). As <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is highly inbreeding, genetic variation within an accession is expected to be rare, while epigenetic differences, for example, in DNA methylation, are more common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmitz et al., 2011</xref>). We investigated epigenetic variation at multiple levels: differences between selection treatments within accessions would indicate epigenetic differentiation, while differences between replicate populations of these accessions could arise from either standing (epi)genetic variation at the beginning of the selection experiment or from de novo gained (epi)genetic variation developed during the experiment, with genetic variants expected to be extremely rare in the case of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>In our analyses, we found only weak evidence for epigenetic differentiation due to selection treatments, expected to manifest as significant phenotypic differences in the second generation in a common environment or as clear differences in the methylomes analyzed in our experiment. Except for one case, the differences were either limited to one accession with low replication at the level of mother plants or depended on the presence of a few extreme measurements. While differences between experimental blocks often explained the largest amount of the observed variation in phenotypes, this was different in the case of ‘time to bolting’. This finding is in line with the notion that flowering time in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has a strong genetic component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, we consistently observed strong differences between the accessions, again emphasizing the genetic component of trait variability in this model species.</p><p>While we found little evidence for differences between populations within accessions, we found significant differences between maternal lines. In genetically uniform accessions, there are three possible explanations for these maternal line effects: (i) maternal effects, (ii) initial genetic or epigenetic differences between maternal lines that resulted in founder effects, and/or (iii) a differential (but selection treatment-independent) gain of genetic or epigenetic variation between maternal lines during the five generations of the selection experiment.</p><p>Initial genetic (or epigenetic) differences between maternal lines (or populations) may have two reasons. First, seeds of single accessions obtained from NASC may not have been derived from homozygous, genetically uniform plants. Second, there could have been genotyping errors occurring during the identification of plants representing the accessions of interest. The latter case applied to the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2024</xref>, in which two presumed accessions, Abd-0 and TRE-1, were thought to show strong evidence of environment-induced heritable variation while the other two, Ang-0 and Tol-0, did not. Plants of the two accessions showing no effect were genetically very similar to each other and were found identical to their accessions using publicly available data from over 1000 accessions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://1001genomes.org/">1001genomes.org</ext-link>). However, plants from the presumed accessions with strong effects, Abd-0 and TRE-1, showed strong genetic differences between treatments, which results from a mix-up of accessions while preparing or conducting the experiment.</p><p>While experimental errors can only be addressed by verifying the material’s identity at each step (which can be costly and challenging), residual genetic variation and newly acquired (epi)genetic variation could be experimentally distinguished in certain setups. If plants of single accessions are split up into populations that are maintained throughout the experiment, it is important to grow and phenotype them in a common environment both at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. If phenotypic differences between replicate populations of single accessions already occurred before imposing the selection treatments, it would suggest that the populations were (epi)genetically distinct from each other. However, if phenotypic differences between replicate populations emerge after the treatment and are maintained in a common environment, then this indicates that variation was gained during the treatment. We note that differences between replicate populations due to founder effects or drift may be as relevant regarding evolutionary processes as are consistent differences between selection treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crow and Kimura, 1970</xref>).</p><p>We found weaker evidence for selection of epigenetic variation in this <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> experiment than we did in our previous study, in which we experimentally simulated selection in a rapidly changing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 2018b</xref>). The reason for this difference may be that, in the previous study, we used RILs that were generated by crossing two different accessions, followed by several generations of inbreeding. We hypothesized that the epialleles differing between selected and ancestral plants persisted for multiple generations in a state that did not match the underlying genotype but finally converged to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 2018b</xref>). This scenario was impossible in the present study because we used distinct accessions. In our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 2018b</xref>), we also noted some residual heterozygosity in one of the RILs, which might have contributed to our observations. Studies on a wide range of plant species that included genetically non-uniform populations consistently reported a significant correlation between genetic and epigenetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Moorsel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mounger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boquete et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mounger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibañez et al., 2023</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, there are very few studies in natural systems that demonstrate genetically independent, heritable – that is, ‘true’ epigenetic – variation in the absence of environmental triggers or after accounting for maternal effects. For example, maternal effects may explain the differences in flowering time between genetically identical apomictic dandelions collected in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilschut et al., 2016</xref>). One example of inheritance of true epigenetic variation has recently been shown in the clonally reproducing duckweed <italic>Lemna minor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Antro et al., 2023</xref>). The authors report an epigenetic memory effect of heat treatments with changes in DNA methylation in the CHG context. However, this might be due to differences in mitotic (i.e., clonal) vs. meiotic inheritance. While it has long been known that certain epigenetic states are faithfully inherited during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meins, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meins, 1986</xref>), recent evidence shows that meiosis is accompanied by epigenetic reprogramming in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slotkin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">She and Baroux, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">She and Baroux, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmid et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borg et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it may be interesting to study epigenetic inheritance in species that generally reproduce clonally through mitosis but distinguish between vegetative reproduction through multicellular meristems and apomictic reproduction through an unreduced, unrecombined egg cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schmid, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koltunow and Grossniklaus, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental background and material from a multigenerational selection experiment</title><p>The selection experiment from which the plants used in this study were derived was fully described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Züst et al., 2012</xref>. In brief, the experiment began with a collection of 27 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions. Seeds obtained from NASC were expected to represent genetically uniform accessions and were propagated for one generation. For the selection treatment, experimental populations with 20 seeds from each accession were planted in cages. 17 days after sowing, different aphid species or a mixture were released into the cages (none as a control). After 60 days, all plants in a cage were harvested and a population of 800 seeds was sown representing the next generation. Each population was maintained over five generations of selection, with six replicate populations per selection treatment. At the end of the selection experiment, the genetic composition of the populations was assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Züst et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental design</title><p>For the study in a common environment, we focused on three well-surviving accessions from the selection experiment: Ma-0, Wei-0, and Wil-3. The accessions Ma-0 and Wei-0 were chosen because they were the most frequent after the aphid selection treatments. Wil-3 was chosen because it is a trichome-less accession that persisted across all treatments. We further focused on three selection treatments: the two single-aphid treatments with <italic>Bravicoryne brassicae</italic> (BB) and <italic>Liphaphis erysimi</italic> (LE), and the control without aphid treatment. Additionally, we included offspring from the plants that were used to set up the original selection experiment, here referred to as ‘ancestrals’. All selected plants were grown together for one generation to minimize confounding maternal effects. For each treatment and accession, we planned to use five mother plants from each of the six populations per selection treatment. However, due to the rarity of some accessions in certain populations, we supplemented with mothers from other populations of the same selection treatment to fill up missing plants (360 maternal seed families were planned but ultimately only 261 were used). We accounted for this in our analysis by using population identity (n=6 replicates × 3 selection treatments + ancestrals = 19) and maternal plant identity (n=261 &lt; 5 mothers × 3 accessions × 18 populations for control and selection-treatment plants + 30 mothers × 3 accessions for ancestrals = 360) as random terms. The ancestrals did not stem from multiple populations, but we planned to use an equal amount of mother plants per accession (n=30). After the first generation of the present experiment (the sixth generation [G6] in reference to the selection experiment), between 5 (planned) and 150 (if there was only a single mother available) offspring of each mother were grown and phenotyped in the second (G7) generation (n=1,800). Both generations were grown in a common environment in a fully randomized block design. Hence, if there were differences between selection treatments, they would have been maintained for two generations in the absence of selection by aphids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>G6: Genotyping of offspring from the selection experiment</title><p>In the selection experiment, seeds were collected from all plants per cage (=population) at once.

Plates were transferred to an incubator with a day/night cycle of 18 h/6 h at a constant temperature of 22°C. Seven days after germination, we harvested leaves from seedlings resembling the Ma-0, Wei-0, or Wil-3 accession. Seedlings were genotyped as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Züst et al., 2012</xref>). Genotyped seedlings were transplanted onto soil 14 days after germination and were grown in a controlled climate chamber at 18°C under a day/night cycle of 16 h/8 h.

We accounted for these differences during statistical analyses by using a corresponding contrast term within the term blocks. Plants were transplanted onto soil 14 days after germination and grown in a controlled climate chamber at 18°C under a day/night cycle of 16 h/8 h. Plants were grown in five randomized blocks of 360 plants with offspring of each mother present in each block. Plants were not switched between blocks when transferred from agar to soil.

The factorial term of interest was the selection treatment (Selection, 4 levels), which we split into three orthogonal one-degree of freedom contrasts to compare (i) ancestral plants with plants from the selection experiment (AN), (ii) the control treatment with the two selection treatments (CO), and (iii) the two selection treatments with each other (SE). We used both the regular lm() function with specifying the appropriate statistical tests manually and lmer() that handles linear mixed models with random terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>).

Accession Wil-3 had only one LE and three BB mothers, meaning that the two selection treatments were poorly replicated for this accession.

These two samples were removed from the analysis (A18 and B26).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Data processing</title><p>Short reads were (quality) trimmed with fastp (version 0.20.0 with the options <monospace>--trim_front1 6 --trim_tail1 6 --trim_front2 6 --trim_tail2 6</monospace>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) and aligned to the reference genome with Bowtie2 (version 2.3.5.1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) in combination with Bismark (version 0.22.3 with the option <monospace>--dovetail</monospace>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krueger and Andrews, 2011</xref>).

Alignments were deduplicated with Bismark and methylation tables were extracted with MethylDackel (version 0.5.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/dpryan79/MethylDackel">github.com/dpryan79/MethylDackel</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_025850">SCR_025850</ext-link>). Files were merged and only cytosines with a coverage between 5 and 100 within at least two samples per group were kept (434,671; 479,201; and 2,669,064 in the CG, CHG, and CHH context, respectively; in total about 8.5% of all available cytosines). The three experimental groups (ancestrals and <italic>B. brassicae</italic> or <italic>L. erysimi</italic> aphid treatments) were compared to each other with the R package DSS (version 2.32.0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park and Wu, 2016</xref>), using the functions DMLfit.multiFactor(), DMLtest.multiFactor(), and callDMR(). The p-value threshold for the DMR calling was set to 0.01. Finally, all p-values were corrected for multiple testing and thereby converted to FDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the extent of epigenetic variation changed during the experiment, we compared variation within original replicate populations with at least four samples with the function betadisper() from the R-package vegan (version 2.5.7, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dixon, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mounger et al., 2021</xref>). The function was also used to extract the distances to the centroids. From the 32 samples, 28 were within original replicate populations with at least 4 samples: 7 ancestrals, 12 from the <italic>L. erysimi</italic> treatment (3 original replicate populations), and 9 from the <italic>B. brassicae</italic> treatment (2 original replicate populations). Epigenetic distances between samples were calculated as the average difference in percent methylation across all cytosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Moorsel et al., 2019</xref>) that passed the following filter: coverage between 5 and 100 in at least 5 individuals per treatment (n=901,843).</p><p>To functionally characterize the genes associated with DMCs, we tested for enrichment of GO terms using topGO 2.20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexa et al., 2006</xref>) in conjunction with the GO annotation available through biomaRt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durinck et al., 2009</xref>). Analysis was based on gene counts (genes with DMCs within 2 kb compared to all genes with one or more tested cytosines that had an average of at least 10% methylation, i.e., potential gbM genes) using the ‘weight’ algorithm with Fisher’s exact test (both implemented in topGO). A term was identified as significant within a given parameter combination if the p-value was below 0.01.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of genetic variation in the subset of 190 plants studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2024</xref></title><p>To assess whether there was any genetic variation associated with the treatments in the experiment described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2024</xref>, we used their RNA-seq data (PRJNA997595) on a subset of 190 plants that supposedly included four accessions. To obtain DNA sequence variant data from RNA-seq data, we followed, as far as possible (i.e., base recalibration required known sites that were not available), the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531192-RNAseq-short-variant-discovery-SNPs-Indels?id=3891">GATK-guidelines</ext-link>. In brief, short reads were (quality) trimmed with fastp (version 0.23.4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) and aligned to the reference genome with STAR (version 2.7.11a with the options <monospace>--alignIntronMax 10000 --alignMatesGapMax 10000 --outSAMstrandField intronMotif</monospace> and supplying the sample ID as read-group information; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Only unique alignments with a quality of at least 250 were kept. Read duplicates were marked with Picard tools (version 2.18.25; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard">broadinstitute.github.io/picard</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_006525">SCR_006525</ext-link>) and spliced reads were split with GATK SplitNCigarReads. Bam files were merged into a single file to reduce running time while calling variants. Data were subset to 10,000 randomly chosen genes. Variants were finally called with GATK HaplotypeCaller (with the options <monospace>--dont-use-soft-clipped-bases --standard-min-confidence-threshold-for-calling 20.0</monospace>) and filtered with GATK VariantFiltration (with the options <monospace>--window 35 --cluster 3 --filter-name &quot;FS&quot;</monospace><monospace>--filter &quot;FS&gt;30.0&quot; </monospace><monospace>--filter-name &quot;QD&quot; </monospace><monospace>--filter &quot;QD&lt;2.0&quot;</monospace>). The resulting VCF file was then filtered for variants with a coverage between 10 and 1,000 within at least four plants per accession and treatment. Variants with a minor allele frequency below 5% were removed. 13,418 variants passed this filter. We did not filter accessions separately when plotting them individually to maintain the distance values. Genetic pairwise distances were calculated as the fraction of alleles that differed between two individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmid et al., 2024</xref>). We visualized the distances as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmid et al., 2024</xref>). When we observed that some plants within two of the accessions were clearly distinct from each other, we used the data on more than 1000 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions available from 1001genomes.org (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://1001genomes.org/data/GMI-MPI/releases/v3.1/1001genomes_snp-short-indel_only_ACGTN.vcf.gz">https://1001genomes.org/data/GMI-MPI/releases/v3.1/1001genomes_snp-short-indel_only_ACGTN.vcf.gz</ext-link>). We intersected the two data sets (12,686 variants remained) and calculated all pairwise distances between the experimental plants and the publicly available accessions. Experimental plants were then assigned to the accession that was closest to it (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>is affiliated with MWSchmid GmbH</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Collection of workbooks with results from the different analyses.</title><p>The files are named as &lt;phenotype &gt; _&lt;data set&gt;.xlsx.

They find weak evidence for such adaptation and few differences in DNA methylation between experimental groups, which contrasts with another recent study (reference 26) that reported extensive heritable variation in response to the environment. The authors convincingly demonstrate that the conclusions of the previous study were caused by experimental error, so that standing genetic variation was mistaken for acquired (epigenetic) variation. Given the controversy surrounding the possible role of epigenetic variation in mediating phenotypic variation and adaptation, this is an important, clarifying contribution.</p><p>I have a few specific comments about the analysis of DNA methylation:</p><p>(1) The authors group their methylation analysis by sequence context (CG, CHG, CHH). I feel this is insufficient, because CG methylation can appear in two distinct forms: gene body methylation (gbM), which is CG-only methylation within genes, and transposable element (TE) and TE-like methylation (teM), which typically involves all sequence contexts and generally affects TEs, but can also be found within genes. GbM and teM have distinct epigenetic dynamics, and it is hard to know how methylation patterns are changing during the experiment if gbM and teM are mixed. This can also have downstream consequences (see point below).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for this suggestion. We usually separate the three contexts because they are set by different enzymes and not because of the general process or specific function. It would indeed be informative to group DMCs into gbM and teM, but as there are many regions with overlaps between genes and transposons, this also adds some complexity. Given that there were very few DMCs, we wanted to keep it simple. Therefore, we wrote that 87.3% of the DMCs were close to or within genes and that 98.1% were close to and within genes or transposons. Together with the clear overrepresentation of the CG context, this indicates that most of the DMCs were related to gbM. We updated the paragraph and specifically referred to gbM to make this point clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For GO analysis, the authors use all annotated genes as a control. However, most of the methylation differences they observe are likely gbM, and gbM genes are not representative of all genes. The authors' results might therefore be explained purely as a consequence of analyzing gbM genes, and not an enrichment of methylation changes in any particular GO group.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to Reviewer #2 for this suggestion. We updated the GO analysis and defined the background as genes with cytosines that we tested for differences in methylation and which also exhibited overall at least 10% methylation (i.e., one cytosine per gene was sufficient). This resulted in a decrease of the background gene set from 34'615 to 18'315 genes. We still detect enrichment of terms related to epigenetic regulation, transport and growth processes. We have updated the corresponding paragraph accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>This paper is very clearly written and could be published as-is. The writing could be improved in a few places, for example:</p><p>&quot;We realized that in this recent study (26), potential errors may have confounded treatments with genetic variation. This is because in that study, Lin and colleagues kept lineages 1-to-1 throughout the experiment by single-seed descent.&quot;</p><p>“This” in the second sentence seems to refer to the confounding, not your realization thereof.</p><p>I am sure there are more: just give the manuscript a good read-through.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out that some sentences may not be clear. We have edited the manuscript and focused on avoiding misleading or unclear wording.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors should distinguish gbM from teM and repeat the GO term analysis with an appropriate set of control genes.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to the public reviews above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors' experimental design should allow them to directly assess whether the rates of epigenetic change are affected by the selective environment. This would require comparison of methylation patterns of individual plants prior to treatment with their progeny (the progeny is what the authors have currently analyzed). This would entail gathering new data, and I don't feel that this analysis is essential, but given the question the authors are addressing (the extent to which a selective environment can induce heritable epigenetic variation), it seems important to test whether the rates of epigenetic change are at all affected by the selection treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>While this is a very valuable recommendation, we can currently not address it because the person who gathered the data works at a different university now. However, we keep this in mind for future projects.</p><p>Again, we would like to thank the reviewers for the constructive suggestions that help us to improve the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
