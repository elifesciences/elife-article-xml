Like-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase 1 (LARGE1) synthesizes and extends matriglycan on Î±-dystroglycan (Î±-DG) during skeletal muscle differentiation and regeneration; however, the mechanisms which regulate matriglycan elongation are unknown. Here, we show that Protein <italic>O</italic>-Mannose Kinase (POMK), which phosphorylates mannose of core M3 (GalNAc-Î²1,3-GlcNAc-Î²1,4-Man) preceding matriglycan synthesis, is required for LARGE1-mediated generation of full-length matriglycan on Î±-DG (~150 kDa). In the absence of <italic>Pomk</italic> gene expression in mouse skeletal muscle, LARGE1 synthesizes a very short matriglycan resulting in a ~ 90 kDa Î±-DG which binds laminin but cannot prevent eccentric contraction-induced force loss or muscle pathology. Solution NMR spectroscopy studies demonstrate that LARGE1 directly interacts with core M3 and binds preferentially to the phosphorylated form. Collectively, our study demonstrates that phosphorylation of core M3 by POMK enables LARGE1 to elongate matriglycan on Î±-DG, thereby preventing muscular dystrophy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dystroglycan</kwd><kwd>matriglycan</kwd><kwd>LARGE</kwd><kwd>POMK</kwd><kwd>laminin</kwd><kwd>muscular dystrophy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Paul D.

The heteropolysaccharide [-GlcA-Î²1,3-Xyl-Î±1,3-]<sub>n</sub> (called matriglycan) is a scaffold for ECM proteins containing laminin-G (LG) domains (e.g. laminin, agrin, and perlecan) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yoshida-Moriguchi and Campbell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hohenester, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michele et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohtsubo and Marth, 2006</xref>) and has the remarkable capacity to be tuned during skeletalÂ muscle development and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goddeeris et al., 2013</xref>). Over 18 genes are involved in the synthesis of the post-translational modification terminating in matriglycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and defects in this process cause dystroglycanopathies,Â i.e. congenital and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies that can be accompanied by brain and eye defects.

POMK phosphorylates the C6 hydroxyl of mannose after synthesis of core M3. The phosphorylated core M3 is further elongated in the Golgi by Fukutin (FKTN), FukutinÂ related protein (FKRP), Transmembrane Protein 5 (TMEM5), Î²1,4-GlucuronyltransferaseÂ 1 (B4GAT1), and Like-acetyl-glucosaminyltranseraseÂ 1 (LARGE1). Isoprenoid synthase domain-containing (ISPD) produces cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-ribitol in the cytosol, and this serves as a sugar donor for the reactions catalyzed by FKTN and FKRP.

Interestingly, unlike with other dystroglycanopathy genes there are patients with complete loss-of-function mutations in POMK who suffer from mild forms of dystroglycanopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Costanzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">von Renesse et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting some expression of matriglycan without POMK. Here, we have used a multidisciplinary approach to show that phosphorylation of core M3 by POMK is not necessary for the LARGE1-mediated synthesis of a short, non-extended form of matriglycan on Î±-DG (~90 kDa) with reduced laminin-binding capacity; however, POMK activity is required for LARGE1 to generate full-length matriglycan on Î±-DG (~150 kDa). In the absence of the phosphorylated core M3, the non-extended matriglycan onÂ ~90 kDa Î±-DG binds laminin and maintains specific force but cannot prevent eccentric contraction-induced force loss or skeletalÂ muscle pathology. Furthermore, solution NMR studies demonstrated that LARGE1 directly interacts with core M3, binding preferentially to the phosphorylated form. Therefore, our study shows that phosphorylation of core M3 by POMK enables LARGE1 to elongate matriglycan on Î±-DG. Collectively, our work demonstrates a requirement for POMK in the LARGE1-mediated synthesis of full-length matriglycan and proper skeletalÂ muscle function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To determine if matriglycan can be expressed in the absence of POMK function, and therefore better understand the role of POMK in matriglycan synthesis, we studied skeletal muscle from a patient (NH13-284) with a homozygousÂ POMK (D204N) mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) accompanied by structural brain malformations.

These findings indicate that LARGE1 requires phosphorylated core M3 to extend matriglycan on Î±-DG to its mature and high molecular weight forms.</p><p>To understand why phosphorylated core M3 is needed for LARGE1 to elongate matriglycan, we measured the binding affinity of LARGE1, as well as POMK, for the phosphorylated core M3 using solution NMR. We previously showed that the unphosphorylated core M3 binds to POMK with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). The mannose anomeric proton (Man H1) is well resolved and its intensity decreases only slightly with increasing POMK protein concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

LARGE1 is responsible for the synthesis of matriglycan, and addition of matriglycan enables Î±-DG to serve as a predominant ECM receptor in many tissues, in particular, skeletal muscle and brain. Over eighteen genes are implicated in matriglycan synthesis, and complete loss-of-function mutations in these genes abrogate synthesis of the <italic>O</italic>-mannose linked modification and preclude the addition of matriglycan, thereby leading to dystroglycanopathies, congenital and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies with or without structural brain and eye abnormalities. Here, we have used a multidisciplinary approach to show that the absence of POMK activity does not preclude addition of matriglycan. Instead, in the absence of core M3 phosphorylation by POMK, LARGE1 synthesizes a short, non-extended form of matriglycan on Î±-DG (~90 kDa). However, in order to generate full-length mature matriglycan on Î±-DG (~150 kDa), LARGE1 requires phosphorylation of core M3 by POMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2A and B</xref>).</p><p>Our study shows that the short form of matriglycan is able to bind to laminin with high affinity and thus enables Î±-DG(POMK) to function as an ECM receptor. Given the very small increase in apparent MW in Î±-DG(POMK) compared to Î±-DG from cells and muscle lacking LARGE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8âfigure supplement 3A</xref>), the short, non-extended form of matriglycan likely contains few Xyl-GlcA repeats. However, it can still bind laminin since only a single Xyl-GlcA repeat is needed for laminin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briggs et al., 2016</xref>), but it cannot function as an ECM scaffold. This short matriglycan likely attenuates muscular dystrophy in patient NH13-284 with a complete loss-of-function mutation in POMK, preventing the severe WWS phenotype that is observed in the complete absence of the other known dystroglycanopathy genes.</p><p>Muscle-specific POMK KO mice express the short, non-extended form of matriglycan onÂ ~90 kDa Î±-DG and develop a mild muscular dystrophy phenotype. Muscle physiology studies demonstrate that the short matriglycan expressed in the absence of POMK can maintain specific force but cannot prevent eccentric contraction-induced force loss or skeletalÂ muscle pathology. Interestingly, missense mutations in FKRP that cause LGMD2I also show reduced expression of matriglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yoshida-Moriguchi and Campbell, 2015</xref>) and exhibit a milder muscular dystrophy. Thus, M-POMK KO mice are an excellent model of milder forms of dystroglycanopathy in which short matriglycan is expressed and will be useful for future studies of these forms of dystroglycanopathy.</p><p>Î±-DG is composed of three domains: the DGN, which undergoes cleavage at arginine-312 by a furin-like convertase during Î±-DG post-translational processing, a central mucin-like domain, and a C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanagawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Singh et al., 2004</xref>). The natural C-terminal domain boundary of DGN, arginine-312 in humans, is proximal to three sites of matriglycan synthesis (threonines-317, 319, 379) within the mucin-like domain of Î±-DG. Biochemical studies using various <italic>POMK</italic> KO HAP1 cell lines demonstrated that the synthesis of the short, non-extended form of matriglycan occurs on threonine-317 of the mucin-like domain and, like full-length matriglycan, requires LARGE1, DGN, and CDP-ribitol. Cell biological experiments demonstrated that the DGN is necessary for synthesis of the short form of matriglycan. As the binding of LARGE1 to the DGN is essential for the synthesis of full-length matriglycan on Î±-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanagawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hara et al., 2011a</xref>), it is required for synthesis of the short form of matriglycan as well. Solution NMR studies revealed that LARGE1 binds to core M3, and the binding affinity increases in the presence of the mannose phosphate. The phosphorylated core M3, could, therefore serve to recruit DGN-bound LARGE1 to the proper residue during the initiation of full-length matriglycan synthesis. In the absence of the mannose phosphate, the DGN-bound LARGE1 may instead act only upon the matriglycan acceptor added to threonine-317, the threonine nearest to the DGN. Synthesis of full-length matriglycan may, therefore, proceed through a complex of DGN, LARGE1, and phosphorylated core M3. The phosphorylated core M3 may also serve to anchor LARGE1 to Î±-DG during matriglycan elongation. In the absence of POMK, the binding of LARGE1 to the DGN and the unphosphorylated core M3 may only be sufficient for synthesis of a short form of matriglycan. Further structural and biochemical studies will be required to understand the precise interactions between DGN, LARGE1, and the phosphorylated core M3. Taken together, our results indicate that LARGE1 requires DGN to synthesize the short, non-extended form of matriglycan but needs both the DGN and the phosphorylated core M3 to generate full-length matriglycan on Î±-DG.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that POMK is required for the synthesis of full-length and high-molecular weight forms of matriglycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). In the absence of POMK, LARGE1 generates a short, non-extended form of matriglycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Collectively, our work provides the first insights into the pathogenic mechanism behind POMK-deficient muscular dystrophy and better elucidates how full-length matriglycan is synthesized so it can act as a scaffold for ECM proteins, thereby enabling proper skeletalÂ muscle function and preventing muscular dystrophy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient information</title><p>Patient NH13-284 received a diagnosis of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) with brain malformations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation of <italic>Pomk<sup>LoxP/LoxP</sup></italic> mice</title><p>The <italic>Pomk</italic> gene consists of five exons, exons 1, 2, and 3, which are non-coding and exons 4 and 5, which are coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Costanzo et al., 2014</xref>).

This was done three times over five trials, with a one-minute break between each trial. The gram force was recorded per pull, and any pull where only one front limb or any hind limbs were used were discarded. If the mouse turned, the pull was also discarded. After 15 pulls (5 sets of 3 pulls), the mean of the three highest pulls of the 15 was calculated and reported. Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism eight software. Studentâs t-test was used (two-sided). Differences were considered significant at a p-value less than 0.05.

The bath was maintained at 25Â°C, and the solution was bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to stabilize pH at 7.4. The proximal tendon was clamped to a post and the distal tendon tied to a dual mode servomotor (Model 305C; Aurora Scientific, Aurora, ON, Canada). Optimal current and whole muscle length (L<sub>0</sub>) were determined by monitoring isometric twitch force. Optimal frequency and maximal isometric tetanic force (F<sub>0</sub>) were also determined. The muscle was then subjected to an eccentric contraction (ECC) protocol consisting of eight eccentric contractions (ECCs) at 3 min intervals. A fiber length L<sub>f</sub>-to-L<sub>0</sub> ratio of 0.45 was used to calculate L<sub>f</sub>. Each ECC consisted of an initial 100 millisecond isometric contraction at optimal frequency immediately followed by a stretch of L<sub>o</sub> to 30% of L<sub>f</sub> beyond L<sub>o</sub> at a velocity of 1 L<sub>f</sub>/s at optimal frequency. The muscle was then passively returned to L<sub>o</sub> at the same velocity. At 3, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after the ECC protocol, isometric tetanic force was measured. After the analysis of the contractile properties, the muscle was weighed. The CSA of muscle was determined by dividing the muscle mass by the product of L<sub>f</sub> and the density of mammalian skeletal muscle (1.06 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). The specific force was determined by dividing F<sub>o</sub> by the CSA (kN/mm<sup>2</sup>). 18â20-week-old male mice were used, and right and left EDL muscles from each mouse were employed whenever possible, with nÂ =Â 5 to 8 muscles used for each analysis.

text</title><boxed-text><p>We transduced <italic>POMK/DAG1</italic> KO HAP1 and <italic>POMK</italic> KO HAP1 cells with an adenovirus expressing wild-type DG (Ad-DG). We observed a return of the laminin binding at 90-100 kDa in <italic>POMK/DAG1</italic> KO HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7âfigure supplement 4A</xref>) and an increase in the corresponding IIH6 immunoreactivity and laminin binding in <italic>POMK</italic> KO HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7âfigure supplement 6A, B, C</xref>), further indicating that the glycoprotein responsible is Î±-DG.</p><p>The binding of a Xyl-GlcA acid repeat of matriglycan to the LG4 domain of laminin Î±1 is calcium-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hohenester, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briggs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yoshida-Moriguchi and Campbell, 2015</xref>). To test if the binding of the non-extended matriglycan is similarly calcium-dependent, we performed laminin overlays in the presence of 10 mM EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7âfigure supplement 6D, E</xref>). In both WT and <italic>POMK</italic> KO HAP1 cells, there was a complete absence of laminin binding in the presence of EDTA, indicating that laminin binding at 90-100 kDa is calcium-dependent and the glycan responsible is composed of Xyl-GlcA acid repeats.</p><p>Given the higher affinity of POMK for the unphosphorylated core M3 compared to the phosphorylated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), it is possible that POMK D204N, which is catalytically inactive, binds to GGM and increases the amount of core M3-modifed Î±-DG in the ER, thereby reducing the amount entering the Golgi. With a reduction in the amount of core M3-modified Î±-DG entering the Golgi, FKTN may be able to better modify GalNAc of the unphosphorylated core M3, thus enabling the formation of the matriglycan which enables laminin binding at 90-100 kDa in the patient's skeletal muscle. In <italic>POMK</italic> KO HAP1 cells alone, the non-extended matriglycan represents the amount formed when no POMK is present and transport of core M3-modified Î±-DG to the Golgi is not reduced. In support of this hypothesis, overexpression of POMK D204N in <italic>POMK</italic> KO HAP1 cells at a higher multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 leads to higher MW forms of matriglycan despite the catalytic inactivity of POMK D204N <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7âfigure supplement 6F</xref>). The higher MW of this form of matriglycan resembles that of the POMK D204N skeletal muscle. Alternatively, it is possible that POMK D204N remains attached to the unphosphorylated core M3 and this binary complex of POMK D204N and Î±-DG moves to the Golgi, where it can form a ternary complex with FKTN. The ternary complex composed of FKTN, POMK D204N, and Î±-DG enables FKTN to more efficiently elongate the core M3 leading to formation of the non-extended matriglycan. Further studies will be needed to determine the precise mechanism.</p><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Appendix 1âkey resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

matriglycan, and that LARGE1 requires DGN to synthesize the short, non-extended form of matriglycan but needs both the DGN and the phosphorylated core M3 to generate full-length matriglycan.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;POMK regulates dystroglycan function via LARGE-mediated elongation of matriglycan&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Adnan Halim (Reviewer #1); James Paulson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Both reviewers comment that the work is elegant and convincing in demonstrating the role of POMK in synthesis of matriglycan, the glycan polymer of Î±-dystroglycan (Î±-DG), and how its role in muscular dystrophy. Given that the number of comments/suggestions from reviewers is relatively few, we have opted to include them all in this decision letter, so that these can be addressed directly in revision, should you chose to revise the paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Walimbe et al. aims to investigate the role of POMK in relation to matriglycan biosynthesis on core M3 <italic>O</italic>-Man glycans found on Î±-dystroglycan. Using cell lines, muscle specific <italic>Pomk</italic> KO mice, and patient muscle samples, the authors demonstrate convincingly that POMK driven mannose influences length of [GlcA-Xyl]<sub>n</sub> repeats, as shown by Western blotting techniques. Furthermore, the authors characterize muscle physiology in mice with muscle specific KO of <italic>Pomk</italic>. Finally, binding affinities of Man/Man-6-P variants of core M3 to POMK and LARGE enzymes are determined, providing mechanistic details to support of their data. Collectively, this elegant study provides important insight into the role of POMK in matriglycan biosynthesis.</p><p>The synthesis the extended glycan polymer on Î±-DG, matriglycan, is controlled by over a dozen genes, and deficiencies in each lead to muscular dystrophies, illustrating the importance of the glycan as a scaffold in the muscle extracellular matrix, and the highly coordinated biosynthetic machinery involving each of these gene products needed to produce fully active matriglycan.</p><p>While the role of POMK was previously known to attach phosphate to the mannose of the trisaccharide core that bridges matriglycan to Î±-DG (-GalNAcÎ²1-3GlcNAcÎ²1-4Man-Î±DG), why the absence of this phosphate impacted the maturation of matriglycan was not known.</p><p>Through characterization of Î±-DG in a patient with POMK deficiency, and detailed biochemical and genetic experiments the authors show that the P-Man product is required for polymerization of matriglycan, even though the P-ManÎ±Thr/Ser product is remote from the action of the polymerase (LARGE) that adds the repeating disaccharide of matriglycan (-GlcAÎ²1-3XylÎ±1-3-)<sub>n</sub>. Here they clearly show that without POMK the matriglycan chains are short, resulting in Î±-DG of ~90 kDa, and with functional POMK, the extended matriglycan chains results in Î±-DG of ~150 kDa. A critical experiment is showing by NMR titration that LARGE binds to the tetrasaccharide core to initiate synthesis of the polymer, and that the phosphate product of POMK increases affinity of LARGE by an order of magnitude.</p><p>Overall the results are compelling, and the design of the experiments, and clear presentation of results and conclusions are very well done. The synthesis of matriglycan is arguably the most intricate post-translational modification in human biology, and the additional insights in the role of POMK represent a significant advance to the understanding of its role, and how its deficiency produces a mild form of muscular dystrophy.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewers did not have specific required revisions.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) The authors consistently observe a band at ~250 kDa in their laminin overlays (Fig 1D, 2B, 6C, 7A, 7D) but do not explain or comment as to why this reactivity is observed. It would be of general interest to know if this is unspecific binding, perhaps with a reference to a study or data to support this claim. Alternatively, if the authors consider the reactivity as specific, they could perhaps comment on the possibility that proteins other than Î±-dystroglycan could harbor laminin binding [GlcA-Xyl]<sub>n</sub> repeats.</p><p>2) Annotation of genetic background of engineered cells is difficult to understand unless main text and figure legends are read in parallel. The authors should consider editing the annotation to make it clearer and uniform so that figures can be understood without necessarily having to read main text. For example, <italic>Pomk<sup>LoxP/LoxP</sup></italic> (Fig 3B) speaks for itself, however, it is difficult to understand what e.g. <italic>POMK/ISPD</italic> KO and KO + Ad-ISPD (Fig 7C).</p><p>3) There appears to be an inconsistency for the size of Î±-dystroglycan/matriglycan reactivity in laminin overlays. For example, comparing Fig 5B and 5D, the majority of reactivity in 5B appears to be slightly below the 150 kDa marker - however, in 5D, the majority of reactivity is seen at-and-slightly-above 150 kDa. For HAP1 cells, reactivity is clearly below 150 kDa.</p><p>4) It is unclear why Î±-DG reactivity is observed above 150 kDa in Fig 5A when IIH6 detects Î±-aDG at &lt;150 kDa.</p><p>5) Fig 6D-E, mass spectrometry: The authors should include Y-axis to allow the reader to see relative abundances of annotated <italic>O</italic>-glycans. The authors should also annotate all peaks (at-and-above the intensity of m/z 873.5) with their m/z values, including the abundant peaks that have been cropped. MALDI-TOF does not allow the authors to determine anomeric or epimeric configuration of annotated <italic>O</italic>-glycans (color coded), the authors should therefore consider including a sentence in figure legend to clarify this limitation to the reader.</p><p>6) Subsection âPOMK assayâ: It is unclear to me why the authors perform WGA enrichment of POMK from HAP1 and fibroblast cells, but not from mouse and human skeletal muscle.</p><p>7) Subsection âMass Spectrometryâ â Permethylation: Methyl Iodine (500 mL) seems excessive?</p><p>8) Subsection âMass Spectrometryâ â âPermethylation: Permethylated glycans where purified on C18 Sep-pak columns and eluted in different fractions, however, it is unclear which fractions where analyzed by MALDI-TOF.</p><p>9) Subsection âData Availabilityâ: Raw mass spectrometry data is not made available for readership. Will authors deposit their MALDI-TOF data in a public repository?</p><p>10) There should be a better discussion of the binding of LARGE to DGN and the P-Man core. For example, how far is the DGN binding site from the glycan chains in the middle of Î±-DG. Do the authors envision that LARGE forms a complex with simultaneous binding to both DGN and a and P-Man, or that DGN binding recruits LARGE, and it dissociates to bind P-Man and while bound to extend matriglycan? At a minimum, it would be helpful to the reader to better describe the physical relationships between DGN and the sites of attachment of the glycan cores to Î±-DG.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61388.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Since there were only minor comments/suggestions for the author to address in revision there is no accompanying author response.</p></body></sub-article></article>
