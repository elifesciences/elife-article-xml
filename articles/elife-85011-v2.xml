DA release from NAc axons can be controlled by at least two distinct mechanisms: (1) action potentials propagating from DA cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and (2) activation of β2* nicotinic receptors by local cholinergic interneurons (CINs). How CIN activity contributes to NAc DA dynamics in behaving animals is not well understood. We monitored DA release in the NAc Core of awake, unrestrained rats using the DA sensor RdLight1, while simultaneously monitoring or manipulating CIN activity at the same location. CIN stimulation rapidly evoked DA release, and in contrast to slice preparations, this DA release showed no indication of short-term depression or receptor desensitization. The sound of unexpected food delivery evoked a brief joint increase in CIN population activity and DA release, with a second joint increase as rats approached the food. In an operant task, we observed fast ramps in CIN activity during approach behaviors, either to start the trial or to collect rewards. These CIN ramps co-occurred with DA release ramps, without corresponding changes in the firing of lateral VTA DA neurons. Finally, we examined the effects of blocking CIN influence over DA release through local NAc infusion of DHβE, a selective antagonist of β2* nicotinic receptors. DHβE dose-dependently interfered with motivated approach decisions, mimicking the effects of a DA antagonist. Our results support a key influence of CINs over motivated behavior via the local regulation of DA release.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motivation</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>approach</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA045783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berke</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS123516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berke</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS116626</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berke</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AA027157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berke</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01MH126223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohebi</surname><given-names>Ali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NARSAD YIA 29361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohebi</surname><given-names>Ali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In awake behaving rats, cholinergic interneurons in the nucleus accumbens drive dopamine release via nicotinic receptors, boosting motivation to work.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obtaining rewards typically takes work: time-consuming sequences of unrewarded actions before the reward is reached. Deciding when such work is worthwhile is an essential aspect of adaptive behavior. Dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a critical modulator of such motivated decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salamone and Correa, 2012</xref>), especially choices to approach potential rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ikemoto and Panksepp, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicola, 2010</xref>). Yet how NAc DA release is itself dynamically regulated to achieve appropriate motivation is not well understood.</p><p>Some features of DA release mirror the spiking of DA cell bodies. Burst firing (or strong artificial stimulation) of ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA cell bodies is accompanied by a corresponding pulse of NAc DA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phillips et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suaud-Chagny et al., 1992</xref>). This pulse can encode reward prediction error (RPE), an important learning signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). Other aspects of DA release appear to be dissociated from spiking. Enhancing motivation by increasing reward availability does not change VTA DA cell firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>), but does boost NAc Core DA levels, as measured on a time scale of minutes by microdialysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCullough and Salamone, 1992</xref>). On faster time scales (seconds), many groups have reported ramps in NAc DA as animals approach rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roitman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wassum et al., 2012</xref>). These ramps may reflect discounted estimates of future reward (value), a useful motivational signal. Yet we found no evidence for corresponding ramps in spiking rate among identified DA cells in the lateral VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>), which provide the major DA input to NAc Core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breton et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>An alternative means of controlling DA release involves local circuit components within the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sulzer et al., 2016</xref>). Prominent among these are cholinergic interneurons (CINs) which, despite constituting only 1–2% of striatal neurons, provide a very dense network of fibers releasing acetylcholine (ACh) intermeshed with the DA axon network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Descarries et al., 1996</xref>). DA axons possess nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) that specifically contain the β2 subunit (β2*; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2002</xref>). Activation of nAChRs is sufficient to locally evoke action potentials in DA axons, and consequent DA release, even in the absence of DA cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cachope and Cheer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Yet how CINs contribute to NAc DA dynamics in behaving animals is largely unknown. Slice studies suggest that DA release is evoked only by highly synchronous activation of multiple CINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>), as might occur in response to a salient cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimura et al., 1984</xref>). Furthermore, DA release in slices shows a lack of summation to repetitive CIN stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>) and strong paired-pulse depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cachope et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). This is apparently due to rapid desensitization of nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giniatullin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quick and Lester, 2002</xref>) and feedback inhibition of CINs via DA D2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shin et al., 2017</xref>). These features might limit the ability of CINs to sculpt motivation-related DA release, including ramping. Furthermore, results on CIN contributions to motivation are mixed. Suppression of CINs has been reported to produce a depression-like state in some behavioral tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warner-Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>) but to boost motivation in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We examined the relationships between CIN activity, DA release, and motivation. We took advantage of recent advances in optical DA sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patriarchi et al., 2020</xref>) and a specific operant task in which we previously found a dissociation between DA spiking and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). We report that CINs can indeed control DA release in awake behaving animals, but with quite distinct temporal characteristics compared to slices. We find that CIN population activity ramps up during approach behaviors in parallel with DA ramps. Furthermore, selective pharmacological blockade of NAc β2* nAChRs interferes with motivated approach, as does blockade of DA receptors. Our results provide convergent evidence supporting the possibility that CINs are a key mechanism regulating motivation via local control of DA release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ACh reliably drives DA release in NAc, without rapid depression</title><p>To study the rapid influence of CINs over striatal DA release in freely moving animals, we employed an all-optical approach. We expressed the excitatory opsin ChR2 in NAc CINs, using ChAT-Cre rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Witten et al., 2011</xref>) and Cre-dependent expression from a virus (AAV5::DIO::EF1a::ChR2::eYFP). In the same region, we expressed the red-shifted DA sensor RdLight1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patriarchi et al., 2020</xref>) using another virus (AAV-DJ::CAG::RdLight1). We recorded DA release dynamics by fiber photometry while driving CINs through the same fiber, in awake unrestrained rats not performing any particular task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). CIN stimulation immediately increased the DA signal, and this increase was maintained as long as stimulation was applied (up to 4 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). In contrast to results in slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>), the amplitude of DA release scaled with the duration and frequency of laser pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>). CIN-evoked DA release remained robust to the second of a pair of pulses across a range of inter-pulse intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), indicating that neither the directly evoked ACh release nor the consequent DA release show rapid synaptic depression in behaving animals (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2019</xref> for related results with choline measurements). To assess short-term plasticity at higher stimulation frequencies, we conducted an additional quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koester and Sakmann, 2000</xref>; ). We compared the observed DA response to four CIN stimulation pulses to that predicted by linearly summating the response to a single pulse, four times. Regardless of stimulation frequency, the ratio between observed and predicted peak response remained close to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming the absence of short-term depression in CIN-evoked DA release.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cholinergic interneuron (CIN) stimulation drives dopamine (DA) release in freely moving rats.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Rat brain atlas section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paxinos and Watson, 2006</xref>) showing the approximate location of fiber tips.

Rewarded trials are made apparent by a hopper click, after which rats approach the food port to collect the pellets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>In an operant task, cholinergic interneuron (CIN) activity and dopamine (DA) release ramp up without corresponding increases in ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA cell firing.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Illustration at top: trial initiation involves an approach to an illuminated center port.

We compared these to previously obtained data of VTA DA cell firing and NAc DA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). To help disentangle signals related to sensory cue onset versus approach behavior, we examined trials in which light-on and center-in are more than 1 s apart (i.e., ‘latency’ &gt; 1 s). We measured ramping as the slope of the signal in the last 0.5 s before approach completion. We compared these slopes to a 95% confidence interval generated by measuring slopes at random times during the task (1000 shuffles). None of the optogenetically identified lateral VTA DA cells (0/29) showed significant ramps preceding center-in, but ramps were reliably observed in both DA release (10/10 fiber placements in seven rats) and CIN GCaMP (7/8 fiber placements, five rats). Repeating the same analysis for the food-port-in event produced significant ramping up for none of the 29 DA cells (one ramped down instead), but virtually all recordings of DA release (9/10) and CIN GCaMP (8/8) recordings. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that ramps in NAc DA release are sculpted via CIN activity rather than DA cell firing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Motivated approach relies on NAc β<sub>2</sub>-containing nicotinic receptors</title><p>If NAc CINs directly act upon nearby axons to boost DA release and thereby enhance approach behaviors, such behavior should be sensitive to the blockade of the relevant nAChRs. We tested this in the trial-and-error task, using local drug infusions into the NAc Core (bilaterally, volume 0.5 µl/side). On consecutive days, rats received either aCSF (vehicle), DHβE (selective antagonist of β2* nAChRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Changeux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Picciotto et al., 2012</xref>]; 15 or 30 µg/side), or flupenthixol, a non-selective D1 and D2 DA receptor antagonist (FLU; 10 µg/side), 10 min before beginning the task.

Both FLU and the higher dose of DHβE increased the latency to initiate a trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Specifically, both the higher dose of DHβE and FLU decreased the instantaneous likelihood (hazard rate) of decisions to approach the center port, shortly after the center port became illuminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). These observations are consistent with our prior finding that bidirectional optogenetic manipulations of dopamine affect approach hazard rates during the same period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>) and support the hypothesis that nAChR-mediated DA release in NAc is involved in the motivation to work.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Blocking nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine or β<sub>2</sub>* nicotinic receptors diminishes motivation to work in the operant task.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Placement of infusion cannula tips (circles) in NAc Core, based on postmortem histology.

However, how this influence shapes DA signals in vivo has remained obscure. As a result, cholinergic modulation of DA release has not typically been incorporated into functional accounts of DA dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berke, 2018</xref>), which have instead emphasized the faithful transmission of RPEs encoded in DA cell spiking. An accurate characterization of local modulation of NAc DA in behaving animals is essential not simply for understanding the neural control of motivation, but also altered physiological states evoked by disorders or abused drugs (notably, nicotine).</p><p>Seminal slice studies reported that while CINs can profoundly influence DA release via β2* nicotinic receptors, this effect shows strong short-term depression that can take minutes to recover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cachope et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>). If these desensitizing mechanisms apply in the awake behaving case, we might expect little functional contribution of CINs to DA signaling, and that stimulating CINs would not evoke appreciable extra DA release. Our results clearly demonstrate otherwise: stimulating CINs evoked strong DA release in a frequency-dependent manner, with no evidence of depression. This result both confirms the presence of powerful ACh modulation of DA release under physiological conditions and demonstrates that this modulation has the dynamic range to be a major, continuing influence over behaviorally relevant DA signals.</p><p>What can explain the discrepancy between ex vivo and in vivo experiments? One possibility involves the very different conditions for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme that provides critical constraints over ACh signaling dynamics. AChE functions very rapidly, almost approaching the rate of ACh diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dvir et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quinn, 1987</xref>), but this rate will be slower at the lower temperature of slice experiments compared to whole animals. Furthermore, AChE is soluble in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sirviö et al., 1989</xref>), and so can be partly washed away in the slice preparation. Taken together, released ACh in the slice may escape degradation in the synaptic space for longer than normal, and thereby provoke desensitization of a larger proportion of nAChRs.</p><p>One of the most prominent reported features of striatal CINs is a reliable pause in response to reward-predicting cues, in contrast to DA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morris et al., 2004</xref>). However, at least in NAc we found that both DA release and CIN activity increase rapidly in response to such cues (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atallah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howe et al., 2019</xref>). Of course, bulk CIN GCaMP signals are at best an incomplete readout of either CIN firing or the spatiotemporal dynamics of ACh release. In particular, imaging of CINs GCaMP in the dorsal striatum found a mismatch between signals at cell bodies and the rest of the field of view (considered to be neuropil; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rehani et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding whether control of DA release via nAChRs directly reflects CIN firing will require more experiments adding either optogenetic tagging of CINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duhne, 2022</xref>) or high-resolution voltage imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piatkevich et al., 2019</xref>). One related important direction for future studies is to understand why some transient fluctuations in CIN activity evoke DA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) but others do not (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>In animals performing an operant task, we demonstrated a correspondence between increasing ramps in NAc DA release during motivated approach and increasing NAc CIN activity (measured with GCaMP), at times when VTA DA cell firing is not increasing. This observation supports the idea that CINs can drive behaviorally relevant DA release even in the absence of DA firing changes. We further showed that, in the same task, interfering with NAc β2* nAChRs reduces the likelihood that rats perform the motivated approach behavior. However, one limitation of this study is that we did not causally establish that CINs are <italic>directly</italic> driving DA release, via β2* nAChRs, at the <italic>specific</italic> moments of DA ramping during approach. In subsequent studies, we hope to do this through combined local pharmacology, optogenetics, and photometry in behaving animals, as technical advances permit. Designing a conclusive manipulation experiment is not trivial; for example, if CINs tonically promote DA release, simple suppression of CINs could interfere with DA ramps during approach, even if CINs do not normally drive ramping.</p><p>Given that ACh can promote NAc DA release and thereby motivation, a continuing conundrum is to explain long-standing evidence for <italic>opposing</italic> roles for striatal DA and ACh in behavioral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mcgeer et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hikida et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2019</xref>). One potentially relevant behavioral dimension is whether actions are prompted by external events versus being ‘self-initiated.’ Increases in both (presumed) CIN activity and striatal DA release have been reported in conjunction with self-timed actions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamilos et al., 2021</xref>). This seems consistent with our observation of prominent joint DA and CIN activity ramps in longer-latency trials in our operant task, where rats are not simply reacting to the trial start light, but rather approaching at a variable time after its onset. However, if CIN control of NAc DA release is always important for self-initiated, motivated behavior, DHβE should suppress the hazard rate of approach across a wide range of delays after the light onset. In fact, both DHβE and FLU particularly depressed approach behavior in the 1–3 s range after light onset, with the hazard rate returning to control levels by ~4 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). This suggests that the NAc joint ACh-DA mechanisms investigated here may be particularly involved in deciding whether it is worthwhile reorganizing ongoing behavior to respond to an external cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blazquez et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Finally, if CINs do indeed help locally sculpt motivational aspects of DA release, a natural question becomes how relevant CIN signals are themselves generated. CINs receive inputs from a wide range of areas that can supply motivational information and influence DA release, including the basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Floresco et al., 1998</xref>), parafascicular thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradfield et al., 2013</xref>), frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kosillo et al., 2016</xref>), and long-range GABAergic subpopulations in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Hasani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2012</xref>). They also sample the state of surrounding networks of striatal projection cells, allowing them to potentially extract useful decision variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franklin and Frank, 2015</xref>). Resolving how motivational signals are computed remains an ongoing challenge, but monitoring and manipulating each of these various circuit components within the same behavioral context is a promising approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (LE rats, both male and female)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ChAT-Cre, Long-Evans (male and female rats)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRRC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Long-Evans-Tg(ChAT-Cre)5.1Deis</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV5-EF1a-DIO- ChR2-eYFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 20298-AAV5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAAV.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 100833-AAV5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV-CAG-RdLight1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patriarchi et al., 2020</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DHβE</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tocris Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 2349</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Flupenthixol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAS# 51529-01-2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MathWorks, Inc.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LabView</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">National Instruments</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>In the conduct of this study, the animals involved were accommodated at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Animal Research Facility, which is accredited by AAALAC (#001084).

transmitter release from dopaminergic axons in the nucleus accumbens of behaving animals. The authors propose that CIN activity facilitates dopamine release through activation of DA varicosities, and enhances the motivation to obtain a reward. This study represents an important step forward in our understanding of how dopamine release regulates behavior in concert with acetylcholine signaling, and more broadly how dopamine terminals modulate behavior independently from activity at cell bodies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85011.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Cheer</surname><given-names>Joseph F</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04rq5mt64</institution-id><institution>University of Maryland School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.06.515335">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.06.515335v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Taffe as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although there is significance to the paper, all reviewers are of the mindset that the authors need to show that, at physiologically relevant patterns of activity, CINs drive DA release in a behaviorally-relevant manner (manipulating CIN activity while at the same time measuring behaviorally evoked DA fluorescence, for example). This experiment is crucial in light of recent papers showing a disconnect between the two processes in behaving animals (the recent work of the Sabatini and Tritsch labs).</p><p>2) It is also very important for the authors to show that optically evoked DA fluorescence is indeed dependent on a4b2 receptors (see Mateo et al., 2017).</p><p>3) Please thoroughly explain the observation of a lack of frequency-dependent depression, which greatly contrasts with previously published reports (Cachope et al., 2012; Threlfell et al., 2012).</p><p>4) Please clarify whether independent single-unit VTA DA neuron data was collected for this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Detailed comments follow below.</p><p>– Figure 1 shows that synchronous optogenetic activation of CINs induces DA release in vivo. These results confirm those obtained in previous slice experiments, although the lack of frequency-dependent depression is intriguing. The authors discuss potential reasons such as the different ACH-E dynamics in slices vs in vivo, temperature effects, and more. Could this difference also be due to the methods used to measure DA release (voltammetry vs optical)?</p><p>– The dual wavelength imaging presented in figures 2-3 shows a high similarity between the DA signal and CIN activity in response to auditory stimuli and approach to the reward port. Are the simultaneous measurements completely independent? No chance of &quot;cross talk&quot; between the channels? Would the results hold if the imaging of CIN calcium activity and DA release were measured separately in different animals, or simultaneously but in different hemispheres?</p><p>– It is also not completely clear if the spiking data was obtained simultaneously or if it is actually the data from a previous paper by the lab. It says in the figure legend that the spiking activity of DA neurons during this task was previously reported, but does this mean that only the imaging data was acquired simultaneously while the spiking data are from different animals?</p><p>– Figure 3 indeed shows that the ramping in DA release is not accompanied by ramping in VTA cell spiking but with a ramping of CIN activity. While this does not contradict the potential involvement of CINs in mediating the DA ramp, it does not prove it.</p><p>– One open question regarding the local DA release vs spiking activity is whether CIN-induced release generates spikes that backpropagate to the cell bodies. Using the experimental setup presented in figure 3, the authors are positioned to answer this question by optogenetically activating CINs and recording backpropagating spikes in VTA cells.</p><p>– The last figure (4) shows a decrease in performance in the operant task following the application of DHBE in the NAc. The impact of the DA agonist FLU was clearly larger, and the DHBE application was effective only in higher concentrations. The changes in behavioral performance are clear in both FLU and DHBE-30ug applications. This does not, however, prove that the impact of DHBE is mediated via DA release. Such a strong manipulation of nicotinic receptor-mediated transmission would affect other cells in the NAc, including several types of GABAergic interneurons (See papers by Assous 2021, 2022). It is therefore not clear that the data presented in Fig, 4 adds to our understanding of CIN-mediated DA release.</p><p>– This leads me to the main concern, that the role of CINs in mediating DA release is not directly shown. It is shown that synchronous optogenetic activation of CINs indeed causes DA release (Figure 1). It is also shown that CIN and DA release are often correlated, such as in approach-related ramping and sensory responses. However, whether CIN-induced DA release underlies these correlated activities is not proven. This could be done by suppressing CIN activity and showing the impact on DA release. Will the ramping be affected? Will the sensory responses decrease? Manipulation of CIN activity can be done by optogenetic or chemogenetic inhibition while imaging DA release.</p><p>– Two recent studies by the Sabatini and Tritsch labs address similar questions regarding the interactions between CINs and DA release. Although the striatal regions tested are not the same as in this study, a common claim is that there is little impact of CINs on DA release in behaving mice and that to a large degree their fluctuations are negatively correlated. It would be important to discuss the discrepancies between these recent studies, in addition to the comparison with older slice studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The data presented here suggests that &quot;ramp&quot; increases in spiking do not occur. However, this stands in contrast to data from the Witten lab showing that ramping does occur in somatic spiking. Could a difference in recording region or experimental approach account for this difference?</p><p>– The authors mention in the discussion that &quot;stimulating CINs evoked strong DA release…&quot;. Strong relative to what? The signals in this study are reported as normalized values or presented as z-scores in nearly all instances. The authors should provide clearer justification based on absolute data values for why they think the CIN-evoked DA signals are strong.</p><p>– In the final paragraph of the results, flupenthixol is probably more accurately described as a &quot;non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist.&quot;</p><p>– It would be helpful to give readers an idea of where electrical VTA DA neurons were made (lateral, medial, etc).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cholinergic Interneurons Drive Motivation by Promoting Dopamine Release in the Nucleus Accumbens&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Michael Taffe (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers find that your rebuttal is fine on all points, except for the key experiment showing that cholinergic interneurons causally drive motivation by promoting dopamine release. In light of the fact that you could not complete the required experiments, this needs to be thoroughly addressed as a limitation in the discussion. All reviewers suggest toning down the message in the title and in the introduction (lines 86-88), to claim that the results support the possibility of CINs sculpting DA release, as this is not directly and unambiguously demonstrated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85011.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Detailed comments follow below.</p><p>– Figure 1 shows that synchronous optogenetic activation of CINs induces DA release in vivo.

When used appropriately both methods are capable of following sub-second DA dynamics, and have sufficient dynamic range to examine both facilitating and depressing effects. As just one example, Rice and Cragg (2004) used voltammetry in slices and observed short-term depression of DA release to multiple electrical pulses. However this depression was not an artifact of the recording method, as it was alleviated in the presence of nicotine. In our in vivo photometry experiments we carefully selected stimulation parameters to evoke transients that are comparable to naturally occurring DA transients, and we are not aware of any reason to think that we would have not seen depression of this response if it were present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The dual wavelength imaging presented in figures 2-3 shows a high similarity between the DA signal and CIN activity in response to auditory stimuli and approach to the reward port.

In each case we observe concurrent ramps in CIN GCaMP6f and RdLight1 signals during motivated approach behaviors. In contrast, at other times (reward delivery at Side-In, Figure 3b) we see a large increase in DA release <italic>without</italic> a corresponding large change in CIN GCaMP signal. DA release at that time instead mirrors a large increase in DA cell firing, consistent with the idea that DA release can be controlled in multiple ways in behaving animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is also not completely clear if the spiking data was obtained simultaneously or if it is actually the data from a previous paper by the lab. It says in the figure legend that the spiking activity of DA neurons during this task was previously reported, but does this mean that only the imaging data was acquired simultaneously while the spiking data are from different animals?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified in the text that for the operant task (Figure 3), we used three separate cohorts of rats to record (1) spiking of DA cells, (2) photometry of dLight, and (3) photometry of CIN activity, and clarified that data from the first two cohorts was previously reported in Mohebi et al. 2019.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3 indeed shows that the ramping in DA release is not accompanied by ramping in VTA cell spiking but with a ramping of CIN activity. While this does not contradict the potential involvement of CINs in mediating the DA ramp, it does not prove it.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that our current study has significant limitations in definitively establishing that CIN activity drives behavior-linked DA ramps. In principle, a helpful experiment would be to simultaneously monitor DA release while antagonizing the nAChRs on DA terminals, during behaviors when DA ramps normally occur. Such an experiment is not within our current technical capabilities. Furthermore, even this experiment might not be conclusive: for example, if there is “baseline” DA release evoked by CINs, then suppressing CINs could interfere with observed ramping even if CINs do not normally drive ramping. For these reasons we believe it is appropriate to proceed with the current data set, while acknowledging its limitations (which we do in the revised Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– One open question regarding the local DA release vs spiking activity is whether CIN-induced release generates spikes that backpropagate to the cell bodies. Using the experimental setup presented in figure 3, the authors are positioned to answer this question by optogenetically activating CINs and recording backpropagating spikes in VTA cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Whether CIN-induced DA release causes DA spikes that backpropagate all the way back to cell bodies is a very interesting question, but it is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. To date we have not performed experiments in which we record DA cell spiking while optogenetically activating CINs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The last figure (4) shows a decrease in performance in the operant task following the application of DHBE in the NAc.

Observing that we <italic>do</italic> see such an effect is therefore useful support for our hypothesis. However we agree that it is certainly possible that more indirect effects are involved instead, and we have updated the Discussion section to reflect this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– This leads me to the main concern, that the role of CINs in mediating DA release is not directly shown.

There are established differences between CIN-DA interactions in dorsal vs. ventral striatum that we suspect are relevant here. But given the rapid pace of developments in this subfield, we prefer not to speculate too much at this point and instead review the overall body of work once it is published.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The data presented here suggests that &quot;ramp&quot; increases in spiking do not occur. However, this stands in contrast to data from the Witten lab showing that ramping does occur in somatic spiking. Could a difference in recording region or experimental approach account for this difference?</p></disp-quote><p>These are both possibilities. In particular we note that the ramps reported by the Witten lab are actually ramps in the calcium activity of DA cells, monitored using GCaMP6, which has different dynamics and may signal distinct processes compared to spiking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors mention in the discussion that &quot;stimulating CINs evoked strong DA release…&quot;.

In the specific place you flagged we now state that our results merely support the possibility that CINs regulate motivation via local control of DA.</p><p>– Amended the Discussion. We now have both an explicit statement describing the limitation of this experiment in not combining causal manipulations together with DA sensing, together with a line noting that designing an interpretable experiment along these lines is not as simple as it might seem.</p></body></sub-article></article>
