Key cell-surface molecules to control Dpp morphogen gradient formation and signaling are heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). In the wing disc, two HSPGs, the glypicans Division abnormally delayed (Dally) and Dally-like (Dlp) have been suggested to act redundantly to control these processes through direct interaction of their heparan sulfate (HS) chains with Dpp. Based on this assumption, a number of models on how glypicans control Dpp gradient formation and signaling have been proposed, including facilitating or hindering Dpp spreading, stabilizing Dpp on the cell surface, or recycling Dpp. However, how distinct HSPGs act remains largely unknown. Here, we generate genome-engineering platforms for the two glypicans and find that only Dally is critical for Dpp gradient formation and signaling through interaction of its core protein with Dpp. We also find that this interaction is not sufficient and that the HS chains of Dally are essential for these functions largely without interacting with Dpp. We provide evidence that the HS chains of Dally are not essential for spreading or recycling of Dpp but for stabilizing Dpp on the cell surface by antagonizing receptor-mediated Dpp internalization. These results provide new insights into how distinct HSPGs control morphogen gradient formation and signaling during development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>morphogen</kwd><kwd>Dpp/BMP</kwd><kwd>glypican</kwd><kwd>Dally</kwd><kwd>wing disc</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ambizione grant (PZ00P3_180019)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>Shinya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008375</institution-id><institution>Universität Basel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Fund Junior Researchers</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>Shinya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Germany's Excellence Strategy (EXC-2189-Project ID 390939984)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pyrowolakis</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The heparan sulfate chains of the glypican Dally stabilizes morphogen Dpp on the cell surface by antagonizing receptor-mediated Dpp internalization largely independent of direct interaction with Dpp.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Morphogens are signaling molecules secreted from localized source cells to control cell fates in a concentration dependent manner during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stapornwongkul and Vincent, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tabata, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashe and Briscoe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rogers and Schier, 2011</xref>). Amongst them, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), the vertebrate BMP2/4 homolog is the first validated secreted morphogen identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Since its discovery, the role of Dpp signaling in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc (the larval precursor of the adult wing) has served as an excellent model to investigate how morphogen gradients form and act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Affolter and Basler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsuda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kicheva and González-Gaitán, 2008</xref>). In the wing disc, Dpp is expressed in an anterior stripe of cells along the anterior-posterior compartment boundary to control nested target gene expression and tissue growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Dpp binds to the BMP type I receptor Tkv and the BMP type II receptor Punt to induce the phosphorylation of the transcription factor Mad. Phosphorylated Mad (pMad) forms a complex with the co-Smad (Medea) to accumulate into the nucleus and activate or inhibit target gene transcription. Interestingly, the majority of Dpp target genes are repressed by the transcriptional repressor Brinker (Brk), while pMad directly represses <italic>brk</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Tomlinson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaźwińska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Minami et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, the pMad gradient regulates nested target gene expression mainly through generating an inverse gradient of Brk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Müller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The nested target gene expression patterns are thought to position the future adult wing veins such as L2 and L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sturtevant et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition to patterning, Dpp signaling controls growth of the wing through repressing Brk as the strong proliferation defects of <italic>dpp</italic> mutant wing discs can be reversed by removing <italic>brk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Tomlinson, 1999</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwank et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distinct models on the roles of HSPGs on Dpp/BMP gradient formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic view of the wing pouch (future wing tissue) and adult wing tissue.

A class of molecules that control gradient formation of various morphogens are glypicans, GPI-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) consisting of a core protein and covalently attached heparan sulfate (HS) chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin and Perrimon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nybakken and Perrimon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan and Lin, 2009</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, two glypicans, Division abnormally delayed (Dally; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakato et al., 1995</xref>) and Dally-like protein (Dlp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khare and Baumgartner, 2000</xref>) are thought to redundantly act as co-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuo et al., 2010</xref>), regulate Dpp morphogen gradient formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belenkaya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujise et al., 2003</xref>), and control scaling of Dpp gradient with tissue size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Romanova-Michaelides et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The role of glypicans in Dpp signaling is dependent on HS chains. A variety of genes required for HS chain biosynthesis such as <italic>sulfateless</italic> (<italic>sfl</italic>) and a family of Ext genes <italic>sister of tout-velu</italic> (<italic>sotv</italic>), <italic>brother of tout-velu</italic> (<italic>botv</italic>), and <italic>tout-velu</italic> (<italic>ttv</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bornemann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takei et al., 2004</xref>) have been shown to be involved in Dpp distribution and signaling. Given that Dpp binds to heparin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2008</xref>), the interaction of the HS chains of glypicans with Dpp is thought to be essential for their function.</p><p>Several, not necessarily mutually exclusive, models have been proposed on how glypicans control Dpp morphogen gradient formation. First, glypicans are suggested to be essential for Dpp spreading by handing it over from one cell to the next cell in a ‘bucket brigade’ manner (‘facilitated diffusion’ model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kerszberg and Wolpert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistently, FRAP assays using overexpression of GFP-Dpp revealed a low diffusion coefficient of Dpp (D=0.1 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kicheva et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, pMad signal and Dpp distribution have been shown to be reduced not only in glypican mutant clones but also in wild type cells located adjacent to the clone and distally to the Dpp source (so-called ‘shadow’ effect), indicating that Dpp spreading requires glypicans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belenkaya et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Second, and in contrast to the first model, glypicans have been proposed to interfere with Dpp spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Müller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The ‘hindered diffusion’ model postulates that Dpp spreads freely and transient interaction of Dpp with cell surface molecules such as glypicans hinders effective Dpp spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Müller et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Third, glypicans have been proposed to stabilize Dpp on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A previous study showed that Dpp lacking the N-terminal HS binding site is less stable than wild type Dpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2008</xref>) indicating that Dally regulates Dpp stability through interactions of HS chains with Dpp. Genetic analyses indicated that Dally competes with Tkv for Dpp binding to antagonize Tkv-mediated Dpp internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, glypicans are proposed to control recycling and re-secretion of Dpp, which is critical for extracellular Dpp gradient scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Romanova-Michaelides et al., 2022</xref>), a phenomenon in which the Dpp gradient expands to match the growing wing disc size during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Surprisingly, although receptor-mediated endocytosis is thought to be a mechanism to clear morphogens from the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the same study showed that Dpp internalization was not affected in <italic>tkv</italic> mutant clones, indicating that Dally, but not Tkv, mediates Dpp internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Romanova-Michaelides et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Finally, a recent attempt to create a synthetic morphogen system using free diffusing GFP as a morphogen raises alternative possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stapornwongkul et al., 2020</xref>). When <italic>dpp</italic> was replaced with GFP, and anti-GFP nanobodies fused to Tkv and Punt that can activate pMad signal upon GFP binding were introduced, rescue of severe <italic>dpp</italic> mutant phenotypes was not perfect but improved by further introducing GPI-anchored non-signaling receptors (corresponding to glypicans). Supported by mathematical modeling, this study suggests that glypicans may contribute to morphogen gradient formation by blocking morphogen leakage and assisting morphogen spreading likely via their GPI-anchors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stapornwongkul et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we generated a platform to introduce epitope tags and/or mutations in the <italic>dpp</italic> locus and protein binder tools to directly manipulate endogenous Dpp spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsuda et al., 2021</xref>). By visualizing and manipulating the endogenous Dpp morphogen gradient, we found that Dpp spreading is critical for posterior patterning and growth but largely dispensable for anterior patterning and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsuda et al., 2021</xref>). Although the requirements for Dpp spreading were thus less important than previously thought, the endogenous Dpp gradient was easily visualized in the wing discs and Dpp spreading was still critical for posterior patterning and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsuda et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, wing imaginal discs serve as an excellent model to study Dpp dispersal-mediated morphogen gradient formation at physiological conditions.</p><p>In this study, to better understand how glypicans control Dpp morphogen gradient formation and signaling, we generated genome-engineering platforms to manipulate both <italic>Drosophila</italic> glypicans, Dally and Dlp. Although the two glypicans are thought to act redundantly, we first find that only Dally is critical for Dpp gradient formation through interaction of its core protein with Dpp. Surprisingly, we found that, although the HS chains of Dally are essential for Dally’s function, <italic>dpp</italic> mutants that lack the ability to interact with HS chains display only minor phenotypes, indicating that a direct interaction of HS chains of Dally with Dpp is largely dispensable for Dpp gradient formation and signaling. We provide evidence that the HS chains of Dally are not essential for Dpp internalization or spreading but rather stabilize Dpp on the cell surface by antagonizing Tkv-mediated internalization of Dpp. These results provide new insights into how glypicans control dispersal and signaling of distinct morphogens during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dally but not Dlp interacts with Dpp</title><p>Previous genetic studies suggested that both Dally and Dlp are involved in extracellular Dpp distribution and signaling through the interaction of Dpp with their HS chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belenkaya et al., 2004</xref>). However, the relative contribution of each glypican remained unclear. To address this, we first expressed <italic>dally</italic> or <italic>dlp</italic> in the dorsal compartment of the wing disc using <italic>ap</italic>-Gal4 to compare their ability to interact with endogenous Dpp and activate pMad signal in vivo. To visualize endogenous extracellular Dpp distribution, we utilized a functional <italic>Ollas-dpp</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bauer et al., 2023</xref>). Since Dpp distribution and pMad signal are similar between the dorsal and ventral compartments in <italic>Ollas-dpp</italic> discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), the ventral compartment serves as an internal control in this assay. We found that expression of <italic>dally</italic> in the dorsal compartment increased HS chain levels, and expanded the extracellular Dpp distribution and pMad gradient compared to the control ventral compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B, E and F</xref>). Interestingly, despite the broad extracellular <italic>Ollas-Dpp</italic> accumulation, the pMad signal dropped to background levels at the lateral regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>), indicating that Dpp signal activation by Dally is inefficient likely due to sequestration of Dpp by overexpressed Dally. In contrast, expression of <italic>dlp</italic> using <italic>ap</italic>-Gal4 increased HS chain levels but rather reduced extracellular <italic>Ollas-Dpp</italic> distribution and pMad gradient in the dorsal compartment compared to the control ventral compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D, G and H</xref>), likely because ectopic Dlp expression sequestered HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and blocked HS modification of Dally. Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2005</xref>), Dlp expression in the dorsal compartment efficiently expanded extracellular Wg distribution compared to Dally expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The interaction of the HS chains of glypicans with Dpp is thought to be essential for their function. However, our data suggest that, while important for proper Dpp distribution and signaling, HS chains have a minor contribution to the binding of Dpp. To address whether a direct interaction of the HS chains of Dally and Dpp is critical, we sought to generate a Dpp variant that lacks HS-binding properties. A previous study showed that seven basic amino acids at the N-terminus of the Dpp mature domain are crucial for the interaction with heparin but dispensable for interaction with receptors to activate downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2008</xref>).

We found that the <italic>dpp<sup>ΔN</sup></italic> allele is embryonic lethal, likely because the basic amino acids overlap with a collagen binding site and the Dpp-Collagen IV interaction is important for Dpp gradient formation in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). To bypass this embryonic lethality without affecting wing disc development, we utilized a previously reported transgene called JAX, which contains the genomic region of <italic>dpp</italic> (JAX) critical for the early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffmann and Goodman, 1987</xref>) but does not rescue the wing phenotypes of <italic>dpp</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, the early lethality of homozygous <italic>HA-dpp<sup>ΔN</sup></italic> was greatly rescued in the presence of this transgene (<italic>JAX; HA-dpp<sup>ΔN</sup></italic>), thus allowing to investigate the requirement of the interaction of Dpp with the HS chains of Dally in later stages.</p><p>To test if Dpp<sup>ΔN</sup> lacks interaction with HS chains of Dally, we expressed <italic>dally</italic> or <italic>dally<sup>ΔHS</sup></italic> in <italic>JAX;dpp<sup>ΔN</sup></italic> using <italic>ap</italic>-Gal4 and compared their ability to interact with Dpp<sup>ΔN</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).

How can we explain the discrepancy?</p><p>If Tkv is involved in internalization of Dpp, internalized Dpp should decrease upon loss of <italic>tkv</italic>. Romanova-Michaelides et al. applied a nanobody internalization assay to visualize internalized Dpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Romanova-Michaelides et al., 2022</xref>). In this assay, extracellular GFP-Dpp was first labeled using fluorophore conjugated anti-GFP nanobodies under endocytosis-restricted condition. After allowing internalization of the labelled GFP-Dpp, extracellular anti-GFP nanobodies were then stripped away by acid wash to follow only the internalized Dpp. Using this assay, Romanova-Michaelides et al. surprisingly found that internalization of GFP-Dpp was not affected in <italic>tkv</italic> mutant clones. However, the experiment was performed under overexpression of GFP-Dpp from the anterior stripe of cells, in which the authors estimate 400 times higher expression than the physiological level. Under such unphysiological conditions, Dpp internalization through other Dpp binding factors can easily mask the impact of Tkv on Dpp internalization. Consistently, we found that Dpp binds to the cell surface without Tkv and Dally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>If Tkv is involved in Dpp internalization, extracellular Dpp should increase upon loss of <italic>tkv</italic>. Romanova-Michaelides et al. used the observation that extracellular GFP-Dpp did not increase in <italic>tkv</italic> mutant clones upon GFP-Dpp expression from the anterior stripe of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schwank et al., 2011</xref>) to further support Tkv-independent Dpp internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Romanova-Michaelides et al., 2022</xref>). However, under 400 times higher expression levels of GFP-Dpp than the physiological level, it is not surprising that an increase of extracellular Dpp can be missed. Indeed, we find that endogenous extracellular Dpp indeed increased upon <italic>tkv</italic> depletion, indicating that Dpp is internalized through Tkv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

In contrast, our results suggest that Dally rather antagonizes internalization of Dpp by blocking Tkv-mediated internalization of Dpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). How can Dpp internalization be reduced in <italic>dally</italic> mutants if Dally antagonizes internalization of Dpp? We found that extracellular Dpp distribution is severely reduced in <italic>dally</italic> mutants due to Tkv-mediated internalization of Dpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that the amount of extracellular Dpp available for labeling with nanobody is reduced in <italic>dally</italic> mutants. Thus, we speculate that the reduced internalization of Dpp in <italic>dally</italic> mutants revealed by the nanobody internalization assay simply reflects the reduced extracellular Dpp rather than reduced ability to internalize Dpp.</p><p>Our results do not thus support Dally-mediated internalization and recycling of Dpp as a mechanism of Dpp gradient scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Romanova-Michaelides et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), although recycling of Dpp through other factors may contribute to Dpp gradient scaling. It would be interesting to test if the Dally-mediated Dpp stabilization on the cell surface is involved in the Dpp gradient scaling. Consistent with this, decrease of Dpp degradation rates has previously been proposed as a mechanism for Dpp gradient scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, previous pulse-chase experiments showed that, similar to Dally, Pentagone (Pent), a secreted feedback factor required for Dpp gradient scaling, is required for Dpp stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</xref>).

Additionally, they use an OLLAS-tag Dpp (OLLAS being an epitope tag against which extremely high affinity antibodies exist). They examine <italic>OLLAS-Dpp</italic> or HA-Dpp distribution, phospho-Mad staining, adult wing size.</p><p>They find that over-expressed Dally - but not Dlp - expands Dpp distribution in the larval wing disc. They find that the Dally[KO] allele behaves like a Dally strong hypomorph Dally[MH32]. The Dally[KO] - but not the Dlp[KO] - caused reduced pMad in both anterior and posterior domains and reduced adult wing size (particularly in the Anterior-Posterior axis). These defects can be substantially corrected by supplying an endogenously tagged YFP-tagged Dally. By contrast, they were not rescued when a 3xHA Dlp was inserted in the Dally locus. These results support their conclusion that Dpp interacts with Dally but not Dlp.</p><p>They next wanted to determine the relative contributions of the Dally core or the HS chains to the Dpp distribution. To test this, they over-expressed UAS-Dally or UAS-Dally[deltaHS] (lacking the HS chains) in the dorsal wing. Dally[deltaHS] over-expression increased the distribution of <italic>OLLAS-Dpp</italic> but caused a reduction in pMad. They do a critical experiment, making the Dally[deltaHS] allele, they find that loss of the HS chains is nearly as severe as total loss of Dally (i.e., Dally[KO]). These results indicate that the HS are critical for Dally's role in Dpp distribution and signaling.</p><p>Prior work has shown that a stretch of 7 amino acids in the Dpp N-terminal domain is required to interact with heparin but not with Dpp receptors (Akiyama, 2008). The authors generated an HA-tagged Dpp allele lacking these residues (HA-dpp[deltaN]). It is an embryonic lethal allele, but they can get some animals to survive to larval stages if they also supply a transgene called &quot;JAK&quot; containing dpp regulatory sequences. In the JAK; HA-dpp[deltaN] mutant background, they find that the distribution and signaling of this Dpp molecule is largely normal. While over-expressed Dally can increase the distribution of HA-dpp[deltaN], over-expression of Dally[deltaHS] cannot. These latter results support the model that the HS chains in Dally are required for Dpp function but not because of a direct interaction with Dpp.</p><p>In the last part of the results, they attempt to determine if the Dpp receptor Thickveins (Tkv) is required for Dally-HS chains interaction. The 2008 (Akiyama) model posits that Tkv activates pMad downstream of Dpp and also internalizes and degrades Dpp. A 2022 (Romanova-Michaelides) model proposes that Dally (not Tkv) internalizes Dpp. To distinguish between these models, the authors deplete Tkv from the dorsal compartment of the wing disc and found that extracellular Dpp increased and expanded in that domain. These results support the model that Tkv is required to internalize Dpp. They then tested the model that Dally antagonizes Tkv-mediated Dpp internalization by determining whether the defective extracellular Dpp distribution in Dally[KO] mutants could be rescued by depleting Tkv. Extracellular Dpp did increase in the D vs V compartment, potentially providing some support for their model. The results are statistically significant but the statistics are buried in an excel file without a read-me page. The code for the statistics is available from Github. These p values should be made more readily accessible and/or intelligible to the reader.</p><p>Strengthens:</p><p>1.

These p values should be made more readily accessible to the reader.</p><p>An appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions.</p><p>The authors' model is that Dally (not Dlp) is required for Dpp distribution and signaling but that this is not due to a direct interaction with Dpp. Rather, they posit that Dally-HS antagonize Tkv-mediated Dpp internalization. Currently the results of the experiments could be considered consistent with their model. Finally, their results support the idea that one or more as-yet unidentified proteins interact with Dally-HS chains to control Dpp distribution and signaling in the wing disc.</p><p>There is much debate and controversy in the Dpp morphogen field. The generation of new, high quality alleles in this study will be useful to <italic>Drosophila</italic> community, and the results of this study support the concept that Tkv but not Dally regulate Dpp internalization. Thus the work could be impactful and fuel new debates among the morphogen researchers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86663.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Niklas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Biozentrum, University of Basel</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Basel</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Safyan</surname><given-names>Abu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute for Biology I, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Freiberg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pyrowolakis</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute for Biology I, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Freiburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>Shinya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Biozentrum, University of Basel</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Basel</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the statistics are buried in a dense excel file without a read-me page.

The authors provide solid genetic evidence that, surprisingly, the core domain of Dally appears to suffice to trap Dpp at the cell surface. They conclude with a model according to which Dally modulates the range of Dpp signaling by interfering with Dpp's internalization by the Dpp receptor Thickveins.</p><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>How morphogens spread within tissues remains an important question in developmental biology. Here the authors revisit the role of glypicans in the formation of the Dpp gradient in wing imaginal discs of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They first use sophisticated genome engineering to demonstrate that the two glypicans of <italic>Drosophila</italic> are not equivalent despite being redundant for viability. They show that Dally is the relevant glypican for Dpp gradient formation. They then provide genetic evidence that, surprisingly, the core domain of Dally suffices to trap Dpp at the cell surface (suggesting a minor role for GAGs). They conclude with a model that Dally modulates the range of Dpp signaling by interfering with Dpp's degradation by Tkv. These are important conclusions, but more independent (biochemical/cell biological) evidence is needed.</p><p>As indicated above, the genetic evidence for the predominant role of Dally in Dpp protein/signalling gradient formation is strong. In passing, the authors could discuss why overexpressed Dlp has a negative effect on signaling, especially in the anterior compartment. The authors then move on to determine the role of GAG (=HS) chains of Dally. They find that in an overexpression assay, Dally lacking GAGs traps Dpp at the cell surface and, counterintuitively, suppresses signaling (fig 4 C, F). Both findings are unexpected and therefore require further validation and clarification, as outlined in a and b below.</p><p>a. In loss of function experiments (dallyDeltaHS replacing endogenous dally), Dpp protein is markedly reduced (fig 4R), as much as in the KO (panel Q), suggesting that GAG chains do contribute to trapping Dpp at the cell surface. This is all the more significant that, according to the overexpression essays, DallyDeltaHS seems more stable than WT Dally (by the way, this difference should also be assessed in the knock-ins, which is possible since they are YFP-tagged). The authors acknowledge that HS chains of Dally are critical for Dpp distribution (and signaling) under physiological conditions. If this is true, one can wonder why overexpressed dally core 'binds' Dpp and whether this is a physiologically relevant activity.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the overexpression assay, DallyDeltaHS seems more stable than WT Dally (Fig. 4B’, E’, 5A’, B’). As the reviewer suggested, we addressed the difference using the two knock-in alleles and found that DallyDeltaHS is more stable than WT Dally (Fig.4 L, M inset), further emphasizing the insufficient role of core protein of Dally for extracellular Dpp distribution.</p><p>In summary, we showed that, although Dally interacts with Dpp mainly through its core protein from the overexpression assay (Fig. 4E, I), HS chains are essential for extracellular Dpp distribution (Fig. 4R). Thus, the core protein of Dally alone is not sufficient for extracellular Dpp distribution under physiological conditions. These results raise a question about whether the interaction of core protein of Dally with Dpp is physiologically relevant. Since the increase of HS upon dally expression but not upon dlp expression resulted in the accumulation of extracellular Dpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and this accumulation was mainly through the core protein of Dally (Fig. 4E, I), we speculate that the interaction of the core protein of Dally with Dpp gives ligand specificity to Dally under physiological conditions.</p><p>To understand the importance of the interaction of core protein of Dally with Dpp under physiological conditions, it is important to identify a region responsible for the interaction. Our preliminary results overexpressing a dally mutant lacking the majority of core protein (but keeping the HS modified region intact) showed that HS chains modification was also lost. Although this is consistent with our results that enzymes adding HS chains also interact with the core protein of Dally (Fig. 4D), the dally mutant allele lacking the core protein would hamper us from distinguishing the role of core protein of Dally from HS chains.</p><p>Nevertheless, we can infer the importance of the interaction of core protein of Dally with Dpp using dally[3xHA-dlp, attP] allele, where dlp is expressed in dally expressing cells. Since Dally-like is modified by HS chains but does not interact with Dpp (Fig. 2, 4), dally[3xHA-dlp, attP] allele mimics a dally allele where HS chains are properly added but interaction of core protein with Dpp is lost. As we showed in Fig.3O, S, the allele could not rescue dallyKO phenotypes, consistent with the idea that interaction of core protein of Dally with Dpp is essential for Dpp distribution and signaling and HS chain alone is not sufficient for Dpp distribution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Although the authors' inference that dallycore (at least if overexpressed) can bind Dpp. This assertion needs independent validation by a biochemical assay, ideally with surface plasmon resonance or similar so that an affinity can be estimated. I understand that this will require a method that is outside the authors' core expertise but there is no reason why they could not approach a collaborator for such a common technique. In vitro binding data is, in my view, essential.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a biochemical assay such as SPR helps us characterize the interaction of core protein of Dally and Dpp (if the interaction is direct), although the biochemical assay also would not demonstrate the interaction under the physiological conditions.</p><p>However, SPR has never been applied in the case of Dpp, probably because purifying functional refolded Dpp dimer from bacteria has previously been found to be stable only in low pH and be precipitated in normal pH buffer (Groppe J, et al., 1998)(Matsuda et al., 2021). As the reviewer suggests, collaborating with experts is an important step in the future.</p><p>Nevertheless, SPR was applied for the interaction between BMP4 and Dally (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006), probably because BMP4 is more stable in the normal buffer. Although the binding affinity was not calculated, SPR showed that BMP4 directly binds to Dally and this interaction was only partially inhibited by molar excess of exogenous HS, suggesting that BMP4 can interact with core protein of Dally as well as its HS chains. In addition, the same study applied Co-IP experiments using lysis of S2 cells and showed that Dpp and core protein of Dally are co-immunoprecipitated, although it does not demonstrate if the interaction is direct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In a subsequent set of experiments, the authors assess the activity of a form of Dpp that is expected not to bind GAGs (DppDeltaN). Overexpression assays show that this protein is trapped by DallyWT but not dallyDeltaHS. This is a good first step validation of the deltaN mutation, although, as before, an invitro binding assay would be preferable.</p></disp-quote><p>Our overexpression assays actually showed that DppDeltaN is trapped by DallyWT and by dallyDeltaHS at similar levels (Fig. 5C), indicating that interaction of DppDeltaN and HS chains of Dally is largely lost but DppDeltaN can still interact with core protein of Dally.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggesting the in vitro experiment. Although we decided not to develop biophysical experiments such as SPR for Dpp in this study due to the reasons discussed above, we would like to point out that our result is consistent with a previous Co-IP experiment using S2 cells showing that DppDeltaN loses interaction with heparin (Akiyama2008).</p><p>However, in contrast to our results, the same study also proposed by Co-IP experiments using S2 cells that DppDeltaN loses interaction with Dally (Akiyama2008). Although it is hard to conclude since western blotting was too saturated without loading controls and normalization (Fig. 1C in Akiyama 2008), and negative in vitro experiments do not necessarily demonstrate the lack of interaction in vivo. One explanation why the interaction was missed in the previous study is that some factors required for the interaction of DppDeltaN with core protein of Dally are missing in S2 cells. In this case, in vivo interaction assay we used in this study has an advantage to robustly detect the interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nevertheless, the authors show that DppDeltaN is surprisingly active in a knock-in strain. At face value (assuming that DeltaN fully abrogates binding to GAGs), this suggests that interaction of Dpp with the GAG chains of Dally is not required for signaling activity. This leads to authors to suggest (as shown in their final model) that GAG chains could be involved in mediating the interactions of Dally with Tkv and not with Dpp. This is an interesting idea, which would need to be reconciled with the observation that the distribution of Dpp is affected in dallyDeltaHS knock-ins (item a above). It would also be strengthened by biochemical data (although more technically challenging than the experiments suggested above). In an attempt to determine the role of Dally (GAGs in particular) in the signaling gradient, the paper next addresses its relation to Tkv. They first show that reducing Tkv leads to Dpp accumulation at the cell surface, a clear indication that Tkv normally contributes to the degradation of Dpp. From this they suggest that Tkv could be required for Dpp internalisation although this is not shown directly. The authors then show that a Dpp gradient still forms upon double knockdown (Dally and Tkv). This intriguing observation shows that Dally is not strictly required for the spread of Dpp, an important conclusion that is compatible with early work by Lander suggesting that Dpp spreads by free diffusion. These result show that Dally is required for gradient formation only when Tkv is present. They suggest therefore that Dally prevents Tkv-mediated internalisation of Dpp. Although this is a reasonable inference, internalisation assays (e.g. with anti-Ollas or anti-HA Ab) would strengthen the authors' conclusions especially because they contradict a recent paper from the Gonzalez-Gaitan lab.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for suggesting the internalization assay. As we discussed in the discussion, our results suggest that extracellular Dpp distribution is severely reduced in dally mutants due to Tkv mediated internalization of Dpp (Fig. 6). Thus, extracellular Dpp available for labelling with nanobody is severely reduced in dally mutants, which can explain the reduced internalization of Dpp in dally mutants in the internalization assay. Therefore, we think that the nanobody internalization assay would not distinguish the two contradicting possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper ends with a model suggesting that HS chains have a dual function of suppressing Tkv internalisation and stimulating signaling. This constitutes a novel view of a glypican's mode of action and possibly an important contribution of this paper. As indicated above, further experiments could considerably strengthen the conclusion. Speculation on how the authors imagine that GAG chains have these activities would also be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors are trying to distinguish between four models of the role of glypicans (HSPGs) on the Dpp/BMP gradient in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing, schematized in Fig. 1: (1) &quot;Restricted diffusion&quot; (HSPGs transport Dpp via repetitive interaction of HS chains with Dpp); (2) &quot;Hindered diffusion&quot; (HSPGs hinder Dpp spreading via reversible interaction of HS chains with Dpp); (3) &quot;Stabilization&quot; (HSPGs stabilize Dpp on the cell surface via reversible interaction of HS chains with Dpp that antagonizes Tkv-mediated Dpp internalization); and (4) &quot;Recycling&quot; (HSPGs internalize and recycle Dpp).</p><p>To distinguish between these models, the authors generate new alleles for the glypicans Dally and Dally-like protein (Dlp) and for Dpp: a Dally knock-out allele, a Dally YFP-tagged allele, a Dally knock-out allele with 3HA-Dlp, a Dlp knock-out allele, a Dlp allele containing 3-HA tags, and a Dpp lacking the HS-interacting domain. Additionally, they use an OLLAS-tag Dpp (OLLAS being an epitope tag against which extremely high affinity antibodies exist). They examine <italic>OLLAS-Dpp</italic> or HA-Dpp distribution, phospho-Mad staining, adult wing size.</p><p>They find that over-expressed Dally - but not Dlp - expands Dpp distribution in the larval wing disc. They find that the Dally[KO] allele behaves like a Dally strong hypomorph Dally[MH32]. The Dally[KO] - but not the Dlp[KO] - caused reduced pMad in both anterior and posterior domains and reduced adult wing size (particularly in the Anterior-Posterior axis). These defects can be substantially corrected by supplying an endogenously tagged YFP-tagged Dally. By contrast, they were not rescued when a 3xHA Dlp was inserted in the Dally locus. These results support their conclusion that Dpp interacts with Dally but not Dlp.</p><p>They next wanted to determine the relative contributions of the Dally core or the HS chains to the Dpp distribution. To test this, they over-expressed UAS-Dally or UAS-Dally[deltaHS] (lacking the HS chains) in the dorsal wing. Dally[deltaHS] over-expression increased the distribution of <italic>OLLAS-Dpp</italic> but caused a reduction in pMad. Then they write that after they normalize for expression levels, they find that Dally[deltaHS] only mildly reduces pMad and this result indicates a major contribution of the Dally core protein to Dpp stability.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. We actually showed that compared with Dally overexpression, Dally[deltaHS] overexpression only mildly reduces extracellular Dpp accumulation (Fig. 4I). This indicates a major contribution of the Dally core protein to interaction with Dpp, although the interaction is not sufficient to sustain extracellular Dpp distribution and signaling gradient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The &quot;normalization&quot; is a key part of this model and is not mentioned how the normalization was done. When they do the critical experiment, making the Dally[deltaHS] allele, they find that loss of the HS chains is nearly as severe as total loss of Dally (i.e., Dally[KO]). Additionally, experimental approaches are needed here to prove the role of the Dally core.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the expression level of Dally[deltaHS] is higher than Dally when overexpressed, we normalized extracellular Dpp distribution (a-Ollas staining) against GFP fluorescent signal (Dally or Dally[deltaHS]). To do this, we first extracted both signal along the A-P axis from the same ROI in the previous version. The ratio was calculated by dividing the intensity of a-Ollas staining with the intensity of GFP fluorescent signal at a given position x. The average profile from each normalized profile was generated and plotted using the script described in the method (wingdisc_comparison.py) as other pMad or extracellular staining profiles.</p><p>Although this analysis provides normalized extracellular Dpp accumulation at different positions along the A-P axis, we are more interested in the total amount of Dpp or DppDeltaN accumulation upon Dally or dallyDeltaHS expression. Therefore, in the revised ms, we decided to normalize total amount of extracellular Dpp against the level of Dally or Dally[deltaHS] by dividing total signal intensity of extracellular Dpp staining (ExOllas staining) by total GFP fluorescent signal (Dally or Dally[deltaHS]) around the Dpp producing cells in each wing disc. Statistical analysis showed that accumulation of extracellular Dpp is only slightly reduced without HS chains (Fig.4I), indicating that Dally interacts with Dpp mainly through its core protein.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that additional experimental approaches are needed to address the role of the core protein of Dally. As we discussed in the response to the reviewer1, to understand the importance of the interaction of core protein of Dally with Dpp, it is important to identify a region responsible for the interaction. Our preliminary results overexpressing a dally mutant lacking the majority of core protein (but keeping the HS modified region intact) showed that HS chains modification was also lost. Although this is consistent with our results that enzymes adding HS chains also interact with the core protein of Dally (Fig. 4D), the dally mutant allele lacking the core protein would hamper us from distinguishing the role of the core protein of Dally from HS chains.</p><p>Nevertheless, we can infer the importance of the interaction of core protein of Dally with Dpp using dally[3xHA-dlp, attP] allele, where dlp is expressed in dally expressing cells. Since Dally-like is modified by HS chains but does not interact with Dpp (Fig. 2, 4), dally[3xHA-dlp, attP] allele mimics a dally allele where HS chains are properly added but interaction of core protein with Dpp is lost. As we showed in Fig.3O, S, the allele could not rescue dallyKO phenotypes, consistent with the idea that interaction of core protein of Dally with Dpp is essential for Dpp distribution and signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Prior work has shown that a stretch of 7 amino acids in the Dpp N-terminal domain is required to interact with heparin but not with Dpp receptors (Akiyama, 2008). The authors generated an HA-tagged Dpp allele lacking these residues (HA-dpp[deltaN]). It is an embryonic lethal allele, but they can get some animals to survive to larval stages if they also supply a transgene called “JAX” containing dpp regulatory sequences. In the JAX; HA-dpp[deltaN] mutant background, they find that the distribution and signaling of this Dpp molecule is largely normal. While over-expressed Dally can increase the distribution of HA-dpp[deltaN], over-expression of Dally[deltaHS] cannot. These latter results support the model that the HS chains in Dally are required for Dpp function but not because of a direct interaction with Dpp.</p></disp-quote><p>Our overexpression assays actually showed that both Dally and Dally[deltaHS] can accumulate Dpp upon overexpression and the accumulation of Dpp is comparable after normalization (Fig. 5C), consistent with the idea that interaction of DppdeltaN and HS chains are largely lost. As the reviewer pointed out, these results support the model that the HS chains in Dally are required for Dpp function but not because of a direct interaction with Dpp.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the last part of the results, they attempt to determine if the Dpp receptor Thickveins (Tkv) is required for Dally-HS chains interaction. The 2008 (Akiyama) model posits that Tkv activates pMad downstream of Dpp and also internalizes and degrades Dpp. A 2022 (Romanova-Michaelides) model proposes that Dally (not Tkv) internalizes Dpp.</p><p>To distinguish between these models, the authors deplete Tkv from the dorsal compartment of the wing disc and found that extracellular Dpp increased and expanded in that domain. These results support the model that Tkv is required to internalize Dpp.</p><p>They then tested the model that Dally antagonizes Tkv-mediated Dpp internalization by determining whether the defective extracellular Dpp distribution in Dally[KO] mutants could be rescued by depleting Tkv. Extracellular Dpp did increase in the D vs V compartment, potentially providing some support for their model. However, there are no statistics performed, which is needed for full confidence in the results. The lack of statistics is particularly problematic (1) when they state that extracellular Dpp does not rise in ap&gt;tkv RNAi vs ap&gt;tkv RNAi, dally[KO] wing discs (Fig. 6E) or (2) when they state that extracellular Dpp gradient expanded in the dorsal compartment when tkv was dorsally depleted in dally[deltaHS] mutants (Fig. 6I). These last two experiments are important for their model but the differences are assessed only visually. In fact, extracellular Dpp in ap&gt;tkv RNAi, dally[KO] (Fig. 6B) appears to be lower than extracellular Dpp in ap&gt;tkv RNAi (Fig. 6A) and the histogram of Dpp in ap&gt;tkv RNAi, dally[KO] is actually a bit lower than Dpp in ap&gt;tkv RNAi, But the author claim that there is no difference between the two. Their conclusion would be strengthened by statistical analyses of the two lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We provided statistics for all the quantifications for pMad and extracellular Dpp distribution as supplementary data. In the previous version, we argued that extracellular Dpp level in ap&gt;tkvRNAi, dallyKO (Fig.6B) does not increase compared with that in ap&gt;tkvRNAi (Fig.6A). Statistical analysis (t-test) showed that the extracellular Dpp level in Fig. 6B is similar to or lower than that in Fig. 6A (Fig. 6E), confirming our conclusion. Statistical analysis (t-test) also confirmed that extracellular Dpp distribution expanded when tkv was knocked down in dallyHS mutants (Fig. 6I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>1.

Confusing discussion regarding the Dally core vs HS in Dpp stability. They don't provide any measurements or information on how they &quot;normalize&quot; for the level of Dally vs Dally[deltaHS]? This is important part of their model that currently is not supported by any measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We explained how we normalized in the above section and updated the method section in the revised ms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Lacking quantifications and statistical analyses:</p><p>a. Why are statistical significance for histograms (pMad and Dpp distribution) not supplied? These histograms provide the key results supporting the authors' conclusions but no statistical tests/results are presented. This is a pervasive shortcoming in the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We provided t-test analyses together with the raw data as supplementary data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. dpp[deltaN] with JAX transgene - it would strengthen the study to supply quantitative data on the percent survival/lethal stage of dpp[deltaN] mutants with or without the JAK transgene</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we are interested in the role of dpp[deltaN] during the wing disc development. Therefore, we decided not to perform the detailed analysis on the percent survival/lethal stage of dpp[deltaN] mutants with or without the JAX transgene in the current study. Nevertheless, the fact that dpp[deltaN] allele is maintained with a balanced stock and JAX;dpp[deltaN] allele can be maintained as homozygous stock indicates that the lethality of dpp[deltaN] allele comes from the early stages. Indeed, our preliminary results showed that pMad signal is severely lost in the dpp[deltaN] embryo without JAX (data not shown), indicating that the allele is lethal at early embryonic stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c.

The sizes of histograms and graphs in each figure should be increased so that the reader can properly assess them. Currently, they are very small.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We changed the sizes in the current ms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors' model is that Dally (not Dlp) is required for Dpp distribution and signaling but that this is not due to a direct interaction with Dpp. Rather, they posit that Dally-HS antagonize Tkv-mediated Dpp internalization. Currently the results of the experiments could be considered consistent with their model, but as noted above, the lack of statistical analyses of some parameters is a weakness.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We now performed and provided the statistical analyses in the revised ms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One problematic part of their result for me is the role of the Dally core protein (Fig. 7B). There is a mis-match between the over-expression results and Dally allele lacking HS (but containing the core). Finally, their results support the idea that one or more as-yet unidentified proteins interact with Dally-HS chains to control Dpp distribution and signaling in the wing disc.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results simply suggest that Dpp can interact with Dally mainly through core protein but this interaction is not sufficient to sustain extracellular Dpp gradient formation under physiological conditions (dallyDeltaHS) (Fig. 4Q). We find that the mis-match is not problematic if the role of Dally is not simply mediated through interaction with Dpp. We speculate that interaction of Dpp and core protein of Dally is transient and not sufficient to sustain the Dpp gradient without HS chains of Dally stabilizing extracellular Dpp distribution by blocking Tkv-mediated Dpp internalization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is much debate and controversy in the Dpp morphogen field. The generation of new, high quality alleles in this study will be useful to <italic>Drosophila</italic> community, and the results of this study support the concept that Tkv but not Dally regulate Dpp internalization. Thus the work could be impactful and fuel new debates among morphogen researchers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript is currently written in a manner that really is only accessible to researchers who work on the Dpp gradient. It would be very helpful for the authors to re-write the manuscript and carefully explain in each section of the results (1) the exact question that will be asked, (2) the prior work on the topic, (3) the precise experiment that will be done, and (4) the predicted results. This would make the study more accessible to developmental biologists outside of the morphogen gradient and <italic>Drosophila</italic> communities.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We modified texts and changed the order of Fig.5. We hope that the changes make this study more accessible to developmental biologists outside of the field.</p></body></sub-article></article>
