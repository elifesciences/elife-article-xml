such as cancer. Migration as a coherent group requires the maintenance of cell–cell interactions, while contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), a local repulsive force, can propel the group forward. Here we show that the cell–cell interaction molecule, N-cadherin, regulates both adhesion and repulsion processes during Schwann cell (SC) collective migration, which is required for peripheral nerve regeneration. However, distinct from its role in cell–cell adhesion, the repulsion process is independent of N-cadherin <italic>trans</italic>-homodimerisation and the associated adherens junction complex. Rather, the extracellular domain of N-cadherin is required to present the repulsive Slit2/Slit3 signal at the cell surface. Inhibiting Slit2/Slit3 signalling inhibits CIL and subsequently collective SC migration, resulting in adherent, nonmigratory cell clusters. Moreover, analysis of ex vivo explants from mice following sciatic nerve injury showed that inhibition of Slit2 decreased SC collective migration and increased clustering of SCs within the nerve bridge. These findings provide insight into how opposing signals can mediate collective cell migration and how CIL pathways are promising targets for inhibiting pathological cell migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>collective cell migration</kwd><kwd>contact inhibition of locomotion</kwd><kwd>cell–cell interactions</kwd><kwd>nerve regneration</kwd><kwd>Schwann cells</kwd><kwd>N-cadherin</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>Slit-Robo signalling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C378/A4308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lloyd</surname><given-names>Alison C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoving</surname><given-names>Julian JA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>N-cadherin and Slit2/3/Robo interactions provide the outward force to drive collective Schwann cell migration during nerve regeneration, identifying a dual role for N-cadherin in both adhesion and repulsion processes during Schwann cell collective migration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue and organ morphogenesis requires the orchestration of the movement of large numbers of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klämbt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scarpa and Mayor, 2016</xref>). In the adult, cell migration is less frequent but is important for aspects of tissue renewal and immune surveillance and can be activated following an injury to contribute to wound healing and tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shaw and Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Worbs et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, these modes of migration are frequently recapitulated during pathologies such as cancer, allowing tumour cells to spread from their original site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Madsen and Sahai, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reymond et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Peripheral nerve is one of the few tissues in the mammalian adult that retains the ability to regenerate following an injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Poss, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zochodne, 2012</xref>). We have previously shown that the successful regeneration of a transected nerve requires the collective migration of cords of Schwann cells (SCs) that transport re-growing axons across the injury site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stierli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stierli et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, SC cords gain directionality across the wound by migrating along a newly formed polarised vasculature, which develops prior to SC migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cattin and Lloyd, 2016</xref>). However, the collective migration of SCs as cords is an adaptive process, as SCs cultured alone exhibit contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2010</xref>), a process in which two cells repulse each other upon contact, resulting in the separation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abercrombie and Heaysman, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abercrombie and Heaysman, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carmona-Fontaine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 2015</xref>). Following an injury, however, SC collective migration is triggered following interactions with fibroblasts that come into contact with SCs as they enter the wound site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2010</xref>). This heterotypic interaction with fibroblasts transforms SC behaviour from repulsive to attractive, a process mediated by ephrinB/EphB2 signalling inducing a Sox2-mediated re-localisation of N-cadherin to the site of cell–cell junctions, which results in SCs migrating as cellular cords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Recently, CIL has been shown to play a role in the dispersal of cells during development, with CIL promoting the spread of cells through tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Villar-Cerviño et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, CIL is also important for providing an outward force during collective cell migration, in that CIL regulates the polarisation of cells by inhibiting local protrusions at the site of cell–cell contact and inducing protrusion formation at the free edge, thus promoting outward migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abercrombie and Heaysman, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abercrombie and Heaysman, 1954</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carmona-Fontaine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scarpa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Theveneau et al., 2010</xref>). This implies that collective migration requires the maintenance of a CIL signal in the presence of a stronger adhesive signal, but how this can be achieved is poorly understood.</p><p>Here we show that N-cadherin mediates both the adhesive and repulsive forces required for collective SC migration but via two distinct mechanisms; with adhesion dependent on the Sox2-stabilised, N-cadherin adherens junction complex, while repulsion is the result of N-cadherin presenting a Slit2 and Slit3-repulsive signal. Moreover, because of this dual role, inhibiting the CIL signal results in the formation of tight clusters of non-migratory cells. Consistent with this, in ex vivo slices from mice that had undergone sciatic nerve injury, inhibition of the Slit2-repulsive signal impaired collective SC migration, resulting in cell clusters that appeared to lack directionality. The ability of N-cadherin to simultaneously regulate adhesion and CIL shows how these opposing processes can be coordinated to achieve outward collective migration and that CIL signals may present an attractive target for inhibiting unwanted collective cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>N-cadherin is required for contact inhibition of locomotion between Schwann cells</title><p>We previously showed that EphB2 activation of Sox2 results in the clustering of SCs, but video analysis indicated that these clustered cells maintain CIL as the cells appeared to be repulsing each other within the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2010</xref>). This is consistent with the migration of SC cords during nerve regeneration, which would be predicted to require a force, such as CIL, to drive migration forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carmona-Fontaine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haeger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roycroft et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Theveneau et al., 2010</xref>). N-cadherin has been implicated in CIL in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scarpa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Theveneau et al., 2010</xref>), so we addressed whether N-cadherin was also required for the regulation of SC collective migration. To do this, we initially blocked N-cadherin expression using two independent siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>) and performed a scratch assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–e</xref>). Time-lapse microscopy showed that while scrambled control siRNA-treated cells migrated in a directional manner to efficiently close the gap, N-cadherin-knockdown cells closed the gap more slowly as they migrated in multiple directions over each other and with a lack of persistent migration towards the gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–d</xref>). This difference was not due to a defect in migration speed as individual N-cadherin-knockdown cells migrated more rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), suggesting that N-cadherin was required for the cell-contact-dependent process driving outward migration. Consistent with this, confluent control SCs form a monolayer and stable junctions, whereas N-cadherin knockdown cells were unable to form junctions and grew on top of each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>). This indicated N-cadherin knockdown cells had lost the ability to recognise each other, and that the loss of contact-dependent outward migration observed in the collective migration assay may be due to loss of CIL.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>N-cadherin is required for contact inhibition of locomotion between Schwann cells (SCs).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative still images comparing the collective migration of siRNA Scrambled Control or N-cadherin (N-Cad) KD SCs in a wound healing assay.

To quantify this, we looked at single-cell interactions and determined three different responses of the protrusions after the initial contact was made: <italic>retraction,</italic> SCs retract their protrusions and change direction of migration; <italic>no retraction</italic>, SCs interact for longer than 5 hr and do not change their direction or migrate away following contact; and <italic>overlapping,</italic> SCs continue to migrate following contact with their protrusions or cell bodies migrating on top of each other.</p><p>Live imaging of siRNA scrambled control SCs showed that SCs migrate in multiple directions, making frequent, seemingly random, protrusions and retractions in multiple directions. However, upon contact with another SC, the SC nearly always retracts the contacting protrusion, appears repulsed, and changes its direction of migration (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), behaviours that are features of CIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abercrombie and Heaysman, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abercrombie and Heaysman, 1954</xref>) and is consistent with what we observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, while free-moving N-cadherin knockdown cells continued to make random protrusions and frequently changed direction, upon contact they behaved very differently to control cells, in that they continued to move forward upon contact and migrated on top of each other, a behaviour we termed overlapping. We did still observe retractions in the N-cadherin knockdown cells; however, we interpret this as background behaviour of cells that frequently change direction, even in the absence of contact. In contrast, the overlapping behaviour was rarely seen in control cells, showing that N-cadherin knockdown cells show no apparent recognition of each other and no CIL.</p><p>To confirm these results, we performed an additional quantification, which determines whether a cell changes its direction of movement following contact, compared to free-moving cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paddock and Dunn, 1986</xref>). In control cells, a significant difference between the displacement of free-moving and cells in contact was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>) as control cells change direction after contact. In contrast, in N-cadherin knockdown cells, no difference was observed between free-moving and colliding cells, indicating that the cellular repulsion signal has been lost in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>).

We therefore tested whether α-catenin and p120-catenin, which are known to physically connect N-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton and regulate the stability of the N-cadherin adherens complex, are required for CIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buckley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peglion and Etienne-Manneville, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peglion et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pokutta and Weis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rimm et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). Time-lapse microscopy showed that efficient knockdown of α-catenin in SCs had no effect on CIL as the cells still repulsed each other despite an increase in cell velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e and f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>). However, consistent with previous reports, the connection of N-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton appeared to be disrupted, as shown by the more cortical appearance of the actin cytoskeleton at N-cadherin cell–cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Similarly, SCs depleted of p120 catenin still repulsed each other upon contact, although there was a slight but significant decrease in repulsive events in cells treated with siRNA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g and h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d and e</xref>).

However, this was greater in cells treated with the more efficient siRNA2, making it likely that a decrease in N-cadherin at the cell surface was responsible for the small effect on CIL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g and h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d and e</xref>).

Consistent with our earlier results, N-cadherin knockdown cells were repulsed by an N-cadherin expressing cell. As expected, while N-cadherin knockdown cells migrated over each other, they were repulsed upon contact with cells rescued with full-length N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), confirming that loss of CIL is specific to N-cadherin. In contrast, CIL was not rescued by SCs expressing the intracellular domain of N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>). Strikingly, CIL was fully rescued by SCs expressing the extracellular domain of N-cadherin showing that intracellular signalling by N-cadherin is not required to mediate CIL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>). This result is consistent with our findings that the adherens junction complex is not required for N-cadherin mediated CIL, and together with our findings that N-cadherin is only required to present a repulsion signal, suggests that an additional co-repulsion signal may be required to mediate CIL in SCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Glypican-4 and Slit2/Slit3 are required for CIL</title><p>We have previously shown that SCs are repulsed by fibroblasts in an ephrinB/EphB2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2010</xref>), which induces cell clustering via activation of Sox2-dependent re-localisation of N-cadherin to cell–cell junctions. We thus reasoned that ephrinB/EphB2 was unlikely to be responsible for the homotypic CIL between SCs and this was confirmed in knockdown experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>To identify the homotypic CIL signal, we performed a series of proteomic screens using N-cadherin or the extracellular domain of N-cadherin as bait, followed by co-immunoprecipitation and qualitative mass spectrometry analysis. In these analyses, peptides of Glypican-4, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked heparan sulphate proteoglycan, were detected in N-cadherin pull-down samples. Glypicans have previously been shown to play a role in axonal guidance and collective cell migration, so although not previously implicated in CIL, Glypican-4 was an interesting candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanchette et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Venero Galanternik et al., 2015</xref>). To test if Glypican-4 was required for mediating repulsive signals between SCs, we knocked down Glypican-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and performed a CIL assay. Intriguingly, Glypican-4 knockdown cells did not repulse upon contact, nor did they invade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Instead, upon contact it appeared that the cells adhered to each other and formed clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>), with cell velocity prior to cluster formation unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

Moreover, the cell clusters appeared to behave differently to the clusters resulting from Sox-2 overexpression, with repulsive forces not evident between Glypican-4 knockdown cells upon contact, resulting in ‘quieter’ clusters that were no longer polarised towards outward migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1 fig4video2">Figure 4—videos 1 and 2</xref>). Consistent with this finding, N-cadherin was still present at the membrane in Glypican-4 knockdown cells with confocal images showing that N-cadherin accumulated at the cell–cell contacts, forming more pronounced junctions compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). This suggested that Glypican-4 is involved in the N-cadherin-dependent CIL signal and that in its absence SCs form more stable homotypic junctions, resulting in quieter clusters of cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, double knockdown of both Glypican-4 and N-cadherin resulted in cells that grew on top of each other, mimicking the N-cadherin knockdown phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d and e</xref>), highlighting the role for N-cadherin in presenting the repulsive signal, that is independent of its role at cell:cell junctions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Glypican-4 and Slit2/Slit3 are required for contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Quantification of a CIL assay, showing control or Glypican-4 knockdown cells, treated with siRNA1 or siRNA2, that are repulsed or not repulsed upon contact respectively (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>).

However, they are not thought to act as ligands themselves, indicating another signal may be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sarrazin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ypsilanti et al., 2010</xref>). Of particular interest were the Slit/Robo signalling pathways, whose repulsive signals are known to play a role in axonal guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brose et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaneko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ypsilanti et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies have shown that of the three Slit genes, Slit2 and Slit3 are predominately expressed by SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). We first confirmed this finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>) and then performed knockdowns of both Slit2 and Slit3 in SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1g</xref>) and performed CIL assays. Initial studies showed a small loss of CIL with individual siRNAs, but the phenotype was not as strong as seen with Glypican-4, possibly because of compensation between the two molecules (data not shown). We therefore performed a double knockdown of Slit2 and Slit3 and found that Slit2/Slit3 knockdown cells behaved similarly to Glypican-4 cells in that they no longer repulsed upon contact, showing instead, increased levels of adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>), resulting in the formation of cell clusters with increased N-cadherin-mediated junctions compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>).</p><p>To induce signalling, Slits can bind to Roundabout (Robo) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ronca et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>), which have been shown to mediate Slit-repulsive signals during neuronal development. Expression analysis showed that SCs express Robo 1,2, and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>), consistent with previous findings that Robo1 is expressed by SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carr et al., 2017</xref>). To determine whether Slit acts via the Robo receptors, we performed knockdown experiments for Robo1 and Robo2 in SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1h</xref>) and assessed their ability to form clusters. Similarly, to the Slit2/Slit3 KDs, loss of either the Robo1 or Robo2 receptor in SCs resulted in a strong increase in cluster formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g and h</xref>), which resembled the quieter, round clusters observed with Slit2/Slit3 and Glypican-4 KDs. Together these results indicate that Slit2/Slit3 mediates the CIL signal through interactions with Robo1/2 and Glypican-4.</p><p>Following nerve injury, we have previously shown that SCs migrate collectively in polarised cords via activation of Sox2 and the resulting stabilisation of N-cadherin at the cell–cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2010</xref>). To compare the difference between these migratory SC clusters and the clusters induced by loss of Slit2/Slit3, we overexpressed Sox2 in SCs and compared them to Slit2/Slit3 KD SCs. Overexpression of Sox2 resulted in polarised clusters of SCs with increased N-cadherin at the cell–cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). In contrast, the clusters associated with Slit2/Slit3 knockdown had a very different morphology, consisting of more ‘rounded’ SCs, which lacked polarity, suggesting that the absence of Slit2/Slit3 signals between the cells results in cell clusters that lack an outward force to drive collective migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1i</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Loss of N-cadherin alters Slit2/Slit3 localisation at the cell surface</title><p>We have shown that both N-cadherin and Slit2/Slit3 are required for CIL between SCs. We hypothesised that this could be due to the loss of the repulsive Slit2/Slit3 signal in cells lacking N-cadherin. However, following N-cadherin knockdown, little change was detected in total Slit2 and Slit3 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>) and mRNA levels of Slit2/3 and Glypican-4 were also not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>), indicating a post-translational mechanism was involved. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Slit2 could be pulled down by N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and live imaging of SCs expressing tagged N-cadherin revealed that N-cadherin is a highly dynamic protein arriving in waves towards the cell’s moving front, suggesting that perhaps a pool of N-cadherin was interacting with Slit2/Slit3 to facilitate its transport to the cell surface to mediate CIL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). To test this, we performed immunostaining of control and N-cadherin knockdown cells. Consistent with mRNA and protein analysis, total levels of Slit2 and Slit3 staining were unchanged following N-cadherin knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e–g</xref>). Confocal images of control SCs showed that Slit2 and Slit3 were localised at the membrane in both free-moving cells and cells in contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and could be detected at lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–d</xref>). Moreover, both ligands could be detected in numerous vesicles throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, in N-cadherin knockdown cells, Slit2 and Slit3 were no longer observable at the cell surface but rather were sequestered in the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and c</xref> and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b and d</xref>). Importantly, Slit2 and Slit3 localisation could be restored by expression of the extracellular domain of N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and g</xref> and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f and h</xref>). In contrast, Slit2 and Slit3 were still observed at the cell surface in Glypican-4 knockdown cells, suggesting that Glypican-4 does not appear to be involved in trafficking Slit2/Slit3 to the cell surface but more likely has a role in stabilising the cell surface presentation, as indicated by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ronca et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together these results show that a pool of N-cadherin, via its extracellular domain, is required to facilitate Slit2 and Slit3 localisation at the cell surface, where, together with Glypican-4, they mediate CIL.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>N-cadherin is required for the trafficking of Slit2/Slit3 to the cell surface.</title><p>(<bold>a–d</bold>) Representative confocal images of control or N-cadherin (N-Cad) knockdown Schwann cells (SCs).

To test if the Slit CIL signal is important for the collective migration of SCs, we performed a collective migration assay with Slit2/Slit3 KD SCs and found this was sufficient to decrease the collective migration of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). The ability to inhibit the CIL signal whilst maintaining cell:cell contacts has therapeutic potential in that rather than producing overlapping cells (N-cadherin inhibition) it should result in the formation of more tightly clustered, less migratory cells. Recombinant Slit2 (rSlit2) has been reported to induce a repulsive signal associated with a collapse of protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), and thus could potentially act in a dominant-negative manner by providing a uniform signal around cells. To test this, we initially analysed the effect of rSlit2 on CIL in low-density cultures and found that rSlit2 inhibited Slit-mediated repulsion signalling, as rSlit2-treated SCs no longer repulsed each other and instead formed clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>), similar to that observed when Slit signalling was inhibited using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Next, we performed a collective migration chamber assay in cells treated with rSlit2 and found that similar to the Slit2/Slit3 knockdowns, cells treated with rSlit2 migrated less efficiently than controls, with a slower closure of the gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video3">Figure 6—video 3</xref>). By tracking the individual cells, we observed this behaviour was distinct from N-cadherin knockdown cells in that the cells migrated a shorter distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e and f</xref>) and appeared to adhere to each other, which prevented them from migrating forward, consistent with the loss of repulsion signal observed when Slit2/Slit3 signalling is inhibited at low density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6b and c,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4d and e</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The Slit-repulsive signal is required for the efficient collective migration of Schwann cells (SCs) during nerve regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Quantification of the collective migration of control compared to Slit2/Slit3 knockdown SCs at 6 hr using a chamber assay (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>).

Loss of the CIL signal should therefore maintain these junctions while blocking the outward force required for collective migration. Consistent with this, we found that the addition of rSlit2 to Sox2-induced SC clusters resulted in clusters with a distinct morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>), in that the clusters were rounder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d and e</xref>), and that the cells within the cluster lacked polarisation away from the cluster, as measured by both cell roundness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>) and nuclear alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>), suggesting a lack of repulsion between the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astin et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, loss of Slit2/Slit3 in Sox2-induced SC clusters resulted in a similarly profound change in cluster morphology with the formation of large, round, clusters that lacked polarity in contrast to the polarised clusters of cells that form in response to Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1f and g</xref>). Together these findings indicate that the outward force provided by Slit/Robo signalling is required for SC collective migration and that inhibiting this signal results in the formation of non-polarised clusters of cells with limited migratory ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6l</xref>).</p><p>To confirm these findings within the context of the nerve environment, we developed a novel ex vivo explant system which allowed live visualisation of SC migration within the regenerating bridge region, following injury. This involved the use of transgenic mice in which eGFP is expressed in SCs (PLP-eGFP), allowing the visualisation of SCs within the complex environment of the nerve bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mallon et al., 2002</xref>). Nerves were removed at day 5 following a transection injury, at which point SC cords are migrating into the new tissue formed at the injury site (the nerve bridge). The nerves were removed and embedded in buffered agarose. Sections (150 μm) of the bridge were then cut on a vibratome and placed into defined medium that allows the survival of the cells within the nerve bridge ex vivo for up to 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Nerves were imaged prior to treatment (0 hr), before slices were incubated overnight with PBS or rSlit2. The following day (24 hr), slices were fixed and imaged to compare the effect of inhibition of Slit2 on migration. We observed that the structure of the injured nerve was maintained ex vivo, with the bridge comprising of densely packed nuclei, with regrowing axons migrating with SC cords along the newly formed vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>), indicating that this is a powerful model in which we can visualise nerve regeneration ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The Slit-repulsive signal is required for the efficient collective migration of Schwann cells (SCs) in the ex vivo nerve bridge.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic showing ex vivo migration protocol.

Moreover, at 24 hr, the polarised cords of SCs had further migrated across the bridge in the PBS-treated explants, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>). In contrast, treatment with rSlit2 resulted in an impairment of the collective migration of SCs, as evidenced by a decrease in the area of SC migration at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c and d</xref>). Moreover, within rSlit2-treated nerves, the SCs exhibited a distinct morphology in that there were significantly fewer SCs in polarised cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>) with the SCs instead, found in clusters, comparable in phenotype to those seen in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>). Further analysis of the SCs within the bridge, using Imaris to define the individual shape of the cells, showed that those treated with rSlit2 displayed a more rounded phenotype when compared to controls, consistent with the loss of CIL between the SCs, resulting in a loss of polarisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h and i</xref>). As an additional measurement of persistence of directionality, we measured the alignment of the following cells to the leader cell and found increased alignment in the control cells, consistent with polarised collective migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7j</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Moreover, we also found the control cords were more aligned as they migrated across the wound site, whereas the rSlit2-treated explants appeared to lose this directionality, resulting in SCs migrating in more random directions into the bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7k</xref>). Together, these findings confirm the importance of the Slit2-mediated CIL signal for the effective migration of SC cords, which are essential for nerve regeneration. Moreover, these studies explain the apparently opposing dual roles for N-cadherin in the collective migration of SC during nerve regeneration, in that N-cadherin acts at SC cell:cell junctions to mediate the formation of migratory SC cords, whilst acting as a mediator of the repulsive Slit/Robo CIL signal to provide the force required to drive the outward migration of the SC cords that ensures successful nerve repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7l</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>SCs migrate collectively as cellular cords following the severing of a peripheral nerve, guiding regrowing axons back to their targets, and thereby promoting peripheral nerve regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cattin and Lloyd, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stierli et al., 2018</xref>). Collective migration is a complex and continuously adapting process that requires the incorporation of multiple and opposing intercellular signals between individual cells within the group, as well as signals from the local environment such as chemotactic factors, which guide and induce migration, while repulsion signals from surrounding cells prevent the migrating cells invading tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haeger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayor and Etienne-Manneville, 2016</xref>). During migration, intercellular-repulsive signals direct the migration of the cluster forward, whilst adhesive interactions are needed to maintain a cohesive group. How these seemingly opposing forces are coordinated to achieve collective migration remains mostly unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haeger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayor and Etienne-Manneville, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that, similarly to other cell types such as astrocytes and neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Etienne-Manneville, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peglion et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Theveneau et al., 2010</xref>), the adherens junction molecule N-cadherin is required for SC collective migration by mediating the clustering of the SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we show that N-cadherin is also required for the repulsion signal, which provides an outward force for collective SC migration. N-cadherin has previously been shown to mediate the repulsion signal important for the collective migration of neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scarpa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Theveneau et al., 2010</xref>). However, despite neural crest cells and SCs belonging to the same lineage, we find that N-cadherin acts by a different mechanism to regulate CIL in SCs; CIL between neural crest cells was reported to require the <italic>trans</italic>-homodimerisation of N-cadherin that acted to inhibit local protrusion formation at cell–cell contacts via the adherens complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scarpa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Theveneau et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, in SCs, while cell–cell adhesion is mediated by N-cadherin homodimers linked to the actin cytoskeleton via the adherens junction complex, N-cadherin mediates CIL by a distinct mechanism. This does not require <italic>trans</italic>-homodimerisation, is independent of the adherens junction complex, and only requires the extracellular domain. Instead, N-cadherin is required for the Slit2/Slit3 repulsion signal to be present at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref>). The reasons for these differences remain unclear but could reflect that whereas SCs migrate in cordlike structures, neural crest cells migrate in much looser clusters, which appears to involve a co-attraction mechanism to maintain a migratory cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carmona-Fontaine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shellard and Mayor, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Slits are secreted axonal guidance molecules that are crucial for the development of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blockus and Chédotal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brose et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gonda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ypsilanti et al., 2010</xref>). However, while secreted, accumulating evidence suggests that the secreted forms can remain associated with the plasma membrane which would allow the local cell–cell signalling required for CIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blockus and Chedotal, 2016</xref>); indeed, it has been reported that CIL between fibroblasts involves Slit2/Robo4 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fritz et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show that Slit2/Slit3 signalling is responsible for the homotypic CIL signal between SCs and that this signal is required for the efficient directional collective SC migration that is required for nerve repair. This is consistent with reports that Slit2, Slit3, and Robo1 are expressed by myelinating and non-myelinating SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) and that a Slit2 signal can repulse a SC in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). The ability of a secreted Slit signal to act as a repellent over both longer and short distances likely requires cell-specific mechanisms that regulate whether the Slit molecules remain tethered to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simpson et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simpson et al., 2000b</xref>). Our work shows that Slit-dependent CIL between SCs requires both the extracellular domain of N-cadherin and Glypican-4, and it therefore appears likely that this complex is important for the localisation and retention of Slit2/Slit3 at the cell surface. This is consistent with previous reports in which Glypican and other heparan sulphate proteoglycans appear to be important for local Slit signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Piper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ronca et al., 2001</xref>). We show that Slit2/Slit3 protein localisation is dependent on N-cadherin, indicating a role for N-cadherin in the presentation of Slit2/3 at the cell membrane. Interestingly, we did not detect an obvious difference in Slit2 membrane staining between SCs in contact and free-moving SCs, which might suggest Slit2 is constantly presented at the cell surface, although this remains to be fully established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1g</xref>). The absence of Slit2/Slit3 in vesicles following N-cadherin knockdown would suggest N-cadherin is required for Slit2/Slit3 delivery to the membrane, rather than effects on recycling, but further work is required to establish the precise mechanism by which N-cadherin mediates the localisation of Slit2/Slit3 at the cell surface. Interestingly, Robo1/2 localisation does not appear to be dependent on N-cadherin expression as our mixing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>) show that N-cadherin knockdown cells are still repulsed by a control cell, implying that Robo1/2 are still capable of enacting a repulsion signal in the absence of N-cadherin.</p><p>Further complexities of the role of CIL in cell behaviour are indicated by the distinct mechanisms used to regulate heterotypic and homotypic CIL and how these signals can change the migratory behaviour of cells. SCs show complex migratory behaviours influenced by the microenvironment; SCs alone exhibit CIL, which we now show is a N-cadherin/Glypican4/Slit2/Slit3/Robo1/2-dependent process that repulse SCs from each other, which is perhaps important for the distribution of SCs along axons. Following an injury, however, SCs come into contact with fibroblasts at the injury site and the fibroblasts repulse SCs by an ephrinB/EphB2–dependent signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, this signal also changes the behaviour of N-cadherin, resulting in the formation of more stable N-cadherin junctions via Sox2. Critical to this interaction is the dual role of N-cadherin in SC migration, with Sox2-mediated stabilisation of N-cadherin at the cell–cell contacts found to act dominantly over the CIL signal, resulting in the formation of cellular cords. However, within the cords, the Slit2/Slit3-dependent repulsion signal remains active, providing an outward force to drive the collective migration of these cells. While both N-cadherin and Slit2/Slit3 are important for the collective migration of cells, inhibition of these proteins has very distinct effects on the migration of SCs. So, whereas loss of N-cadherin results in the production of overlapping, highly migratory cells that lack collective behaviour, inhibition of Slit2/Slit3 results in the formation of tighter clusters of cells associated with enhanced N-cadherin junctions in which migration is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k</xref>). This might suggest targeting of CIL signals would be a promising approach for inhibiting unwanted collective migration. Consistent with this, we showed that exogenous recombinant Slit2 (rSlit2) acts to inhibit SC CIL and inhibits the collective migration of these cells. Moreover, this effect could be reproduced in a powerful new ex vivo explant model, where we observed a similar phenotype with the failure to form cell cords associated with decreased migration, showing the Slit CIL signal is required for efficient SC migration within the regenerating nerve environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b and c</xref>). This failure to form polarised cords is consistent with reports that collective cell migration relies on the polarisation of the cell group in the direction of migration and the transmission of forces between the cell–cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capuana et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Etienne-Manneville and Arkowitz, 2020</xref>). The crucial role of collective migration has been well established in tumour cell migration and metastasis, with a role proposed for CIL in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abercrombie, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jahedi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paddock and Dunn, 1986</xref>). Characterisation of CIL signals in distinct tumour types may therefore be a promising approach to identify new targets for inhibiting the invasion and spread of tumours.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal work was performed in accordance with the UK Home Office legislation.

Finally, the beads were resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10 min at 95°C.</p><p>To identify the homotypic CIL signal, we performed a series of proteomic screens using N-cadherin or the extracellular domain of N-cadherin as bait, followed by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. To do this, cells which displayed repulsion and overlapping behaviours were used to identify a signal that was only present in the repulsing cells. The co-IP was performed on one sample per condition using 1 mg protein as input, and the proteins eluted from the beads using Laemmli buffer. The proteins were then separated on a gel, extracted, digested with trypsin, and analysed using the LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro Mass-spec systems (Performed by Proteomics Facility, University of Dundee). The obtained data was analysed using the Mascot search engine using the UniProt DB with rat as the taxonomic filter (performed by the Proteomics Facility, University of Dundee).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA extraction and qPCR</title><p>RNA extraction was performed using Tri-Reagent according to the manufacture’s protocol. RNA concentration was determined using Nanodrop and 500–1000 ng of RNA was used to synthesise complementary DNA using Superscript II kit (Invitrogen). For RT-qPCR, the MESA Blue qPCR MasterMix Plus kit was used (Eurogentec).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Migration assays</title><sec id="s4-15-1"><title>Contact inhibition of locomotion assays</title><p>For repulsion assays, 8 × 10<sup>3</sup> or 4 × 10<sup>3</sup> control or siRNA-treated SCs were seeded onto PLL and laminin coated 6-well plates or 12-well plates, respectively. Cells were allowed to adhere for a minimum of 6 hr and then time-lapse microscopy was performed. Live imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope or the Nikon GFP3 at 37°C with 5–10% CO<sub>2</sub>. Images were taken every 10 min for up to 72 hr.</p><p>To analyse interactions between control and N-cadherin knockdown cells, cells were treated with 10 μM Cell Tracker Red CMTPX Dye or Green CMFDA dye (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37°C and washed once with SC medium. Following 1 hr incubation with Cell Tracker, 4 × 10<sup>3</sup> control cells were mixed with 4 × 10<sup>3</sup> N-cadherin knockdown cells and incubated for 16 hr before time-lapse microscopy.</p><p>Volocity or FIJI software was used to quantify repulsion. Single cells that were not dividing were tracked until contact with another cell and the initial response upon contact recorded. Three types of events were defined: <italic>retraction</italic>, cells retract protrusions and change direction of migration; <italic>n-retraction</italic>, cells interact for longer than 5 hr and do not change the direction of migration; <italic>overlapping</italic>, cell migrate on top of another cell with their protrusion and/or cell bodies.</p><p>For mixing experiments, the response of control-treated cells was quantified upon contact with N-cadherin knockdown cells and vice versa. Similarly, for rescue experiments only the response of N-cadherin knockdown cells was quantified upon contact with a cell expressing either GFP, full-length N-cadherin, the extracellular domain of N-cadherin, or the intracellular domain of N-cadherin. To quantify the displacement of a cell after contact, vector analysis was used to analyse interactions between migrating cells. Videos were opened in FIJI and the displacement of a migrating cell 15 min prior to (Vector A) and following a collision (Vector B) calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paddock and Dunn, 1986</xref>). The difference in displacement between the vectors (Vector B-A) was calculated to analyse the difference between how far the cell has progressed and how far it would have migrated had it not encountered another cell. Free-moving cells which did not collide with other cells were also analysed over the same duration. Cells exhibiting CIL have a negative value indicating that the cell has changed direction following collision.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-2"><title>Rescue experiments</title><p>Rescue experiments were performed in a two-step protocol; first, siRNA transfection was performed using 1 nM of N-cadherin siRNA1 as described above and incubated overnight. The following morning, the complexes were removed, and 4 hr later full-length N-cadherin, the extracellular domain of N-cadherin, or the intracellular domain of N-cadherin were transfected using Attractene (QIAGEN). Complexes were incubated with control or N-cadherin knockdown cells for 2 hr at 37°C. The following day, cells were seeded for repulsion assays and immunofluorescence.</p><p>Time-lapse microscopy was performed approximately 6 hr after seeding for 24 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-3"><title>Collective migration assays</title><p>For collective migration assays, two approaches were taken. Either (i) 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded onto laminin-coated plates and the following day, siRNA transfection was performed as described above. A scratch was then induced with a sterile tip, 48 hr after knockdown. The cells were gently washed twice with medium to remove any debris followed by time-lapse microscopy of the leading edges for 24 hr. Or (ii) 1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> control or knockdown cells were seeded into the separate compartments of dual-chamber inserts (Ibidi), 24 hr after siRNA transfection. The following morning, each compartment was treated with CellTracker-Green or Cell Tracker Red CMTPX Dye, for 30 min. Subsequently, the chamber was removed, and cell migration imaged using time-lapse microscopy for 24 hr on the Nikon GFP3 at 37°C, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. In order to quantify collective migration, the area of cells was drawn using FIJI at 0, 6, or 24 hr on stills from time-lapse microscopy.

Cells were then permeabilised with 0.3% Triton PBS for 10 min and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin-PBS (BSA) for 1 hr at RT and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The following day, coverslips were washed with PBS, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 hr at RT, and washed with PBS before mounting onto microscope slides using fluoromount-g (Southern Biotech). For labelling of Slit2 and Slit3, cells were fixed in 2% PFA supplemented with 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and blocked in 3% BSA.

change in direction of cell migration leading to cell dispersion and Schwann cell migration has been shown to be essential for nerve repair. In this study, Hoving and colleagues demonstrate that CIL is an important driver of collective Schwann cell migration by using live cell imaging, cell migration assays and an ex vivo model of nerve injury and repair. They show that Slit2/3/Robo signaling is required to induce local cell repulsion between colliding Schwann cells, in an N-cadherin-dependent manner and further demonstrate the importance of an N-cadherin-glypican-4-Slit signaling axis during CIL. This study convincingly describes a new and important molecular mechanism of CIL in adult tissues and in the context of wound repair and is likely to be of interest to a broad range of biologists given the importance of both CIL and N-cadherin to a number of cellular and developmental processes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88872.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Applewhite</surname><given-names>Derek A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00a6ram87</institution-id><institution>Reed College</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Applewhite</surname><given-names>Derek A</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00a6ram87</institution-id><institution>Reed College</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Hogan</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03kk7td41</institution-id><institution>Cardiff University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/549030">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/549030v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen byJonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1. Why does the Ncad/Ncad condition still have a high level of repulsion? Circa 60%? This is more than when looking at ctl+Ncad cells (below 40% repulsion Figure 2b). This does not seem logical. If none of the cells has Ncad to present slit how is repulsion triggered? According to the authors' model, cells should not be able to be repelled and not be able to form stable junctions. Can Glypican-4 present slit in absence of Ncad? Along these lines, each of the single knockdown (N-cad Figure 1g, slit Figure 4d, Gly Figure 4a) still leads to a relatively high rate of repulsion in cell collision assays, circa 40-50% compared to 60-70% in controls. This seems to suggest that these molecules may act in parallel and not only through one pathway. Even if they are all in the same pathway, the reduction of repulsion remains modest. That would mean that other signals may contribute to repulsion but this is not discussed.</p><p>2. In Figure 2, the authors score cell repulsion events between Schwann cells expressing siRNA against N-cadherin and control cells. The data in this figure show that cell repulsion occurs only when N-cadherin is present on one or both colliding cells. The graph in Figure 2b is not intuitive. Are the legends on the x-axis reflecting the cell which was tracked meeting a similar/different cell? E.g., N-Cad:Control implies N-cad cell was tracked until it meets a control cell etc and the bars reflect the cell response of the tracked cell. This is important to know to fully understand the data because the N-Cad:control versus Control:N-cad show different data, suggesting different responses depending on which cell was tracked. Otherwise, the data should be the same here to support the conclusion that N-cadherin presents a repulsive cue but is not required to respond to repulsive cue.</p><p>3. Following on from this, what happens to Robo/Slit2/3 localisation (and expression) at the site of collision? Can you see this by immunofluorescence with or without N-cadherin expression? You show very nicely that Slit2/3 protein localisation is dependent on N-cadherin; however, not at collision sites (also see comment below). The data suggest that N-cadherin is presenting Slit2/3 ligand at the membrane and subsequently to colliding cells. Alternatively, Slit2/3 and Robo localisation are both regulated by N-cadherin. One could speculate that presentation of ligand at the membrane is changing with respect to N-cadherin, whereas Robo levels/localisation remains unchanged, regardless of N-cadherin expression.</p><p>4. The authors show Slit2/3 localises in vesicles that move to the edge of cell in an N-cadherin-dependent manner. Western blots suggest protein expression is unchanged; however, immunofluorescence images suggest protein levels are also changing. Can you clarify on this? The descriptions used indicate the staining reflects cell surface protein; however, this would not match protein in vesicles. My interpretation is that Slit ligands are recycling in cells and trafficked to cell-cell contacts following N-cadherin-based cell-cell contacts (See comment 2 above). Do you see Slit ligands in endosomes/recycling endosomes and is this dependent on N-cadherin expression and/or engagement/collision of cells?</p><p>5. Glycipan-4 data is interesting. Is it possible that glycipan-4 is required for N-cadherin turnover/recycling? Do you see N-cadherin localisation/expression change in glycipan-4 depleted cells? Equally, glycipan-4 may regulate recycling of Slit2/3 ligands. Analysis of N-cadherin and Slit2/3 ligand expression/localisation in glycipan-4 depleted cells with/without cell collision would help here. The proposed physical cooperation between Glypican4 and N-cad is solely based on the proteomics analysis identifying Glypican-4 peptides following N-cad pull-down. If these two proteins act through the same pathway the double knockdown should be as strong as their single knockdown. Such double knockdown should be performed. In addition, an alternative method to study colocalization should be used to strengthen the physical interaction hypothesis. As I understand it the authors do not have a working antibody against Gly4. Is that Correct? If so, can an exogenous myc-tagged Glypican-4 be used to pull-down N-cad? Is a GFP-tagged Glypican-4 colocalized with the immunodetection of endogenous N-cad. The authors can decide and what is technically feasible in their system to address this point.</p><p>6. Authors describe how CIL propels cells to migrate as a collective and loss of Slit2/3/Robo signalling leads to a loss of cell repulsion. This conclusion is supported by the data; however the mechanism is missing. While I understand that mechanisms underpinning change in cell polarity would require additional experiments outside the scope of this study, I wondered whether the authors could reframe some of the analysis in terms of persistence of migrating cells, especially in the ex vivo model. One would expect cells migrating as cords to show persistence with directionality; whereas those treated with rSlit2 would lose this persistence. This could be analysed with regards to front/back polarity relative to the leading cell.</p><p>7. I could not find any controls for efficiency and/or specificity for the siRNAs against Robo1/2. Please provide such controls or refer to publication(s) that used the same siRNA in which proper controls were performed. In absence of controls, data from the use of these siRNA should be removed.</p><p>8. The statements about polarity under various experimental conditions should be confirmed by a proper analysis of cell polarity for instance using an anti-Rac1-GTP staining or a golgi staining and plotting the golgi/Nucleus axis or any other alternative that the authors find suitable. If not such statement should either be removed or significantly toned down. On example is the comparison between <italic>Sox2</italic> + rSlit2 and siRNA slit (Figure 6). In rSlit 2 contrary to what the authors say polarity seems to be present with area of flat membrane at the free edge suggesting that cells are still polarized according to cell-cell contact whereas in siSlit no such flat membranes are seen at the edge of cells.</p><p>9. Statistics. Authors have used t-test (or equivalent) to compare percentages across multiple experimental conditions. However, to my (limited) knowledge, t-tests are not designed to compare proportions. I think alternative methods need to be used or a precise argumentation as to why such tests can be applied here should be provided.</p><p>10. SiRNA Ncad seems to have no effect on slit expression and protein level on western blot but by IF the slit signal is almost lost. Is Ncad loss of function having an effect on slit protein levels or not? These two datasets are at odds with one another. Also these data are used to conclude that N-cad is required for Slit to be at the cell surface but neither of these techniques is designed to study that. If authors wish to study the Slit trafficking outside the cell or bound at the surface they need to use techniques such as Halo-tag and perform a pulse-chase assay with a short exposure of cells to a fluorescently tagged version of the Halo-tag and see what happens to slit2/3 in controls vs siN-cad conditions. Or any alternative method designed to monitor Slit at the cell surface (i.e. detection of slit in the enriched medium of control vs siNcad cells or immunodetection of slit without detergent to avoid entry of the anti-slit antibody inside the cells). Also it is not clear if the authors wish to say that N-cad allows slit to reach the membrane or to stay presented at the membrane.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88872.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1.

These concerns relate to the apparent residual repulsive activity in Ncadherin and Glypican-4 knock-down cells, which might reflect an additional repulsive signal is present. However, these results need to be considered in the overall context of how SCs migrate. If one watches the videos, it is apparent that even without any cell:cell contacts, SCs put out and retract multiple protrusions around the cell, and appear to change direction randomly. What this means is that there is a background level of retraction seen when the cells make contact. In earlier drafts of the manuscript, we included a more detailed description of this behaviour, which explained these caveats. We apologise for removing this section, as it is clear that this has led to confusion. Instead, the measurement which is more meaningful in this assay is the increase in “overlapping” or “no retraction” behaviours, which are seen rarely in control cells. For example, in the videos, it can clearly be observed that protrusions in N-cadherin knockdown cells, frequently cross over an encountered cell whereas this is rarely seen in control cells. Importantly, all N-cadherin knockdown cells show no apparent recognition of an encountered cell, in that they do not change direction but instead migrate over the surface of the encountered cell.</p><p>To help clarify the behaviour of these cells and that knockdown of N-cadherin eliminates repulsive behaviour between SCs, we have made three changes to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Provided more text to better explain repulsive SC behaviour and the nature of the assay (Page 5, Line 17).</p><p>Changed the nomenclature for this specific assay describing the behaviour of specific protrusions, so that (i) repulsion is changed to retraction (ii) adhesive to no retraction, and (iii) invasive to overlapping.</p><p>To further clarify this issue, we have performed a different quantification of the CIL assay, which determines whether the cell changes its direction of movement following an encounter. This measurement uses vector analysis to analyse interactions between migrating cells, by calculating the displacement of a migrating cell prior to (Vector A) and following a collision (Vector B) (Paddock and Dunn, 1986). The difference in displacement between the vectors (Vector B-A) represents the difference between how far the cell has progressed and how far it would have migrated had it not encountered another cell. Free moving cells which did not collide with other cells were also analysed over the same duration. Cells exhibiting CIL have a negative value indicating that the cell has changed direction following collision.</p><p>Using this assay, it can clearly be observed that the cellular repulsion signal is lost in Ncadherin K/D cells, with the movement of these cells after contact indistinguishable from free moving cells (new Figure 1h). In control cells, a significant difference between free moving and colliding cells is observed, as control cells show a change in direction following a collision. This is also clearly seen by observation of the videos (Video 1) and the representative still images in Figure 1f. These results more clearly demonstrate that there is no residual repulsive signal present in the N-cadherin knockdown cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have also included a cartoon for clarity (new Figure 2c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Following on from this, what happens to Robo/Slit2/3 localisation (and expression) at the site of collision? Can you see this by immunofluorescence with or without N-cadherin expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, without N-cadherin, we do not observe Slit2/3 at contact sites as upon Ncadherin knockdown, we no longer observe Slit2/3 in the protrusions (Figure 5a,c). Secondly, it is hard to address the dynamics of Slit2/3 localisation at cell contacts prior to and after CIL in fixed cells and we currently do not have the technologies available to visualise Slit2/3 localisation by live-imaging. However, we do observe Slit2/3 at collision sites as well as on the membrane of cells not in contact, which might indicate that the localisation remains unchanged. We have included new Figures to show this is the case (new Supplementary Figure 5h).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>You show very nicely that Slit2/3 protein localisation is dependent on N-cadherin; however, not at collision sites (also see comment below). The data suggest that N-cadherin is presenting Slit2/3 ligand at the membrane and subsequently to colliding cells. Alternatively, Slit2/3 and Robo localisation are both regulated by N-cadherin. One could speculate that presentation of ligand at the membrane is changing with respect to N-cadherin, whereas Robo levels/localisation remains unchanged, regardless of N-cadherin expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Using available antibodies, we have been unable to convincingly detect Robo by immunofluorescence. However, our mixing experiments showed that cells are still repulsed when N-cadherin is knocked-down, which would imply the Robo receptor is still capable of enacting a repulsion signal (Figure 2a-b). We have clarified this point in the manuscript (Page 17, Line 18).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors show Slit2/3 localises in vesicles that move to the edge of cell in an N-cadherin-dependent manner. Western blots suggest protein expression is unchanged; however, immunofluorescence images suggest protein levels are also changing. Can you clarify on this?</p></disp-quote><p>It is the case we show that following loss of N-cadherin, overall Slit2/3 protein and mRNA levels are unaltered as measured by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis (Supplementary Figure 5a-b). We also showed by immunostaining that N-cadherin KD results in a change in Slit2/3 localisation (Figure 5a-d), with Slit2/3 becoming restricted to the perinuclear area and no longer reaching the cell protrusions. We agree the original selected images were slightly misleading, as although they showed nicely that Slit2/3 is lost from protrusions in N-cadherin knockdown cells, the expression in the rest of the cell was not clearly visible. We have now changed and included new images to show more clearly the overall staining (Supplementary Figure 5g) and quantified the expression from immunostaining images, which also show no changes in overall expression levels (new Supplementary Figure 5e-f).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The descriptions used indicate the staining reflects cell surface protein; however, this would not match protein in vesicles.</p></disp-quote><p>It is well characterised that Slit2/3 function at the cell surface as repulsive molecules (Brose et al., 1999) (De Bellard et al., 2003). We also now include new images in which we can more clearly observe Slit2/3 at the cell surface (new Supplementary Figure 5h). It is also the case that Slit2/3 are detected within vesicles, which are presumably trafficking Slit2/3 to and from the cell-surface. This dynamic behaviour would be consistent with our findings that N-Cadherin is a highly dynamic protein, arriving in continual waves to the cell surface and junctions (Supplementary Figure 5d, Video 6), which would fit with the requirement for N-cadherin to traffic Slit2/3 to the plasma membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My interpretation is that Slit ligands are recycling in cells and trafficked to cell-cell contacts following N-cadherin-based cell-cell contacts (See comment 2 above). Do you see Slit ligands in endosomes/recycling endosomes and is this dependent on N-cadherin expression and/or engagement/collision of cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot rule this out this interpretation, but our observations do not detect an obvious difference in the levels of Slit2/3 at the surface of protrusions of cells in contact with other cells compared to the protrusions of freely-moving cells (new Supplementary Figure 5h). Further work needs to establish the exact mechanism for how N-cadherin is required to traffic Slit2/3 towards the protrusions but we believe this is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we have now added this speculation to the Discussion section (Page 17, Line 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Glycipan-4 data is interesting. Is it possible that glycipan-4 is required for N-cadherin turnover/recycling? Do you see N-cadherin localisation/expression change in glycipan-4 depleted cells? Equally, glycipan-4 may regulate recycling of Slit2/3 ligands. Analysis of N-cadherin and Slit2/3 ligand expression/localisation in glycipan-4 depleted cells with/without cell collision would help here.</p></disp-quote><p>We show that upon Glypican-4 KD, increased N-cadherin is observed at cell contacts. (Figure 4b). We interpreted this as a strengthening of the N-cadherin junctions over-time in the absence of a repulsive signal. It is possible that Glypican-4 could control Ncadherin turnover, however it should be noted that we see a similar increase in Ncadherin junctions when we deplete Slit2/3 or Robo1 and 2, which suggests ours is the correct interpretation.</p><p>We have now analysed the effects of Glypican-4 depletion on Slit2/3 expression and the K/D does not mimic N-cadherin KD in that we still observe Slit2/3 in vesicles within the protrusions (New Supplementary Figure 5i). This result is consistent with the suggested role for Glypicans in presenting the secreted Slit ligand on the cell-surface (Ronca et al., 2001). Further work would be required, with reagents which currently don’t exist, to address this possibility, which we think is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The proposed physical cooperation between Glypican4 and N-cad is solely based on the proteomics analysis identifying Glypican-4 peptides following N-cad pull-down.

We also tested several antibodies, none of which were convincing enough to use for a pull down or worked in western blot assays or immunostaining, using knockdown Glypican-4 cells as controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

This could be analysed with regards to front/back polarity relative to the leading cell.</p></disp-quote><p>To measure persistent migration in the cords in the ex-vivo model, we have taken several approaches. Firstly, the original quantifications showed increased migration of the control cells compared to those treated with rSlit2 (Figure 7c-d). Secondly, we showed that the control SCs are found in cords, whereas those treated with rSlit2 are more commonly found in clusters (Figures7e-g). Together these results indicate persistent, collective migration of the cords that is lost in cells treated with rSlit2. However, to analyse persistent migration more directly, we have now done the following: (i) As suggested by the Reviewers, we have quantified the polarity of following cells relative to the leading cell using the nucleus, as an indicator of persistent, polarised migration (new Figure 7j and Supplementary 7d), (ii) We have also quantified the directionality of the SC groups and find a higher level of directionality of the control cells, as they migrate across the wound site, as predicted (New figure 7k).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

On example is the comparison between Sox2 + rSlit2 and siRNA slit (Figure 6).</p></disp-quote><p>We are unable to use conventional polarity analysis such as the Golgi/Nucleus axis, as we don’t observe that the Golgi aligns with the polarisation of the nucleus in control Schwann cells, when they migrate in a directional manner, as has also been found for other cell types (Uetrecht and Bear, 2009) (Pouthas et al., 2008) (Vaidžiulytė et al., 2022). However, as the nucleus polarises beautifully in migrating Schwann cells, we have instead quantified the alignment of the nuclei in each cluster to complement our original analysis (new Supplementary Figure 6d). As expected, in <italic>Sox2</italic> control cells, the nuclei are aligned in a manner indicative of the attempted outward migration of these cells, whereas the nuclei are more randomly aligned in the <italic>Sox2</italic> rSlit2-treated cells (new Figure 6i) and Slit2/3 KD cells (new Supplementary Figure 6g) consistent with the loss of the repulsion signal resulting in a failure of these cells to polarise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In rSlit 2 contrary to what the authors say polarity seems to be present with area of flat membrane at the free edge suggesting that cells are still polarized according to cell-cell contact whereas in siSlit no such flat membranes are seen at the edge of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We do still see some flat membrane at the free edges of the clusters in both rSlit2 and siSlit-treated cells, although it varies between the clusters. However, what is consistent between both groups is the decreased polarisation of the cells. This was measured in the original submission by comparing the roundness of the cells within the clusters. As discussed above, we have now extended this analysis to show the polarisation of the clusters by measuring the alignment of the cells within the clusters. To do this we have used the nuclear axis as a measure of each cells individual polarisation and compared this to the group (new Figures 6i and Supplementary Figure 6g) as well as quantifying the overall cluster shape (new Supplementary Figure 6e-f). These data clearly show, consistent with the videos, that Slits mediate the polarisation of the clusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Statistics. Authors have used t-test (or equivalent) to compare percentages across multiple experimental conditions. However, to my (limited) knowledge, t-tests are not designed to compare proportions. I think alternative methods need to be used or a precise argumentation as to why such tests can be applied here should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We have now presented the data as the total number of events in each condition rather than as a proportion and have performed the appropriate statistics for each experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. SiRNA Ncad seems to have no effect on slit expression and protein level on western blot but by IF the slit signal is almost lost. Is Ncad loss of function having an effect on slit protein levels or not? These two datasets are at odds with one another. Also these data are used to conclude that N-cad is required for Slit to be at the cell surface but neither of these techniques is designed to study that. If authors wish to study the Slit trafficking outside the cell or bound at the surface they need to use techniques such as Halo-tag and perform a pulse-chase assay with a short exposure of cells to a fluorescently tagged version of the Halo-tag and see what happens to slit2/3 in controls vs siN-cad conditions. Or any alternative method designed to monitor Slit at the cell surface (i.e. detection of slit in the enriched medium of control vs siNcad cells or immunodetection of slit without detergent to avoid entry of the anti-slit antibody inside the cells). Also it is not clear if the authors wish to say that N-cad allows slit to reach the membrane or to stay presented at the membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed earlier, we now provide further data, which shows that overall Slit2/3 expression as detected by IF is not decreased by N-cadherin K/D, consistent with our western blot analysis (new Supplementary Figure 5e-f). Instead, our findings show that Slit2/3 is no longer present in vesicles that emanate towards the plasma membrane in K/D cells. We also now show further images that clearly show Slit2/3 at the plasma membrane (new Supplementary Figure 5h) and that this is lost in N-cadherin K/D cells (new Supplementary Figure 5g). Extensive prior literature has shown that Slit2/3 signal from the cell-surface (Blockus and Chedotal, 2016) (De Bellard et al., 2003) (Brose et al., 1999) and all our results are consistent with these findings. We are therefore confident of the interpretation of our results.</p><p>We have considered the suggested experiments but, in our hands, tagged-proteins do not localise appropriately and even the lightest fixation treatment, permeabilises our primary cells. We currently cannot formally distinguish between whether N-cad allows Slit2/3 to reach the membrane or reflects a failure to stay presented. However, the lack of Slit2/3 in vesicles in N-cadherin K/D cells would suggest that it is not being delivered, as a failure to remain presented would indicate faster turnover, which would be expected to result in the continued presence of Slit2/3 in vesicles. Therefore, we are comfortable with our conclusions but have attempted to further clarify the text (Page 17, Line 11).</p></body></sub-article></article>
