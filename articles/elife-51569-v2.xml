by stepping on actin filaments, executing a random diffusive search for actin binding sites at each step. A recent experiment suggests that the joint between the myosin lever arms may not rotate freely, as assumed in earlier studies, but instead has a preferred angle giving rise to structurally constrained diffusion. We address this controversy through comprehensive analytical and numerical modeling of myosin V diffusion and stepping. When the joint is constrained, our model reproduces the experimentally observed diffusion, allowing us to estimate bounds on the constraint energy. We also test the consistency between the constrained diffusion model and previous measurements of step size distributions and the load dependence of various observable quantities. The theory lets us address the biological significance of the constrained joint and provides testable predictions of new myosin behaviors, including the stomp distribution and the run length under off-axis force.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myosin V</kwd><kwd>motor protein</kwd><kwd>lever arm</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>diffusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1650441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hathcock</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CHE 19-00093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thirumalai</surname><given-names>Dave</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A theoretical model comprehensively describes the stepping dynamics of the motor protein myosin V, unraveling the significance of a recently discovered structural constraint on the angle between its lever arms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Molecular motors are cellular machines that function by converting chemical energy into mechanical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schliwa and Woehlke, 2003</xref>). Motors play key roles in many intracellular biological processes, including signaling and the transport of cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun and Goldman, 2011</xref>). Members of the myosin superfamily, one class of molecular motors, perform these functions by binding to actin filaments and generating energy through ATP hydrolysis. Myosin V, a dimeric transport motor, is composed of two stiff polymer chains joined at a pivot with an actin-binding head at the end of each chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reck-Peterson et al., 2000</xref>). The motor walks forward along the actin, stepping hand-over-hand, by alternating head detachment, with the free head performing a diffusive search for actin binding sites during each step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shiroguchi and Kinosita, 2007</xref>). Such unidirectional motility requires coordination between the two heads with preferential detachment of the rear head, the so called ‘gating’ mechanism, which is regulated by the strain within the lever arms while the heads are bound to actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Veigel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Veigel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Purcell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sakamoto et al., 2008</xref>). Myosin V propels itself toward the plus (barbed) end of the actin using two changes in the lever arm orientation. The power stroke, executed by an actin-bound head, swings the lever arm forward, while the recovery stroke, executed during diffusion, returns the lever to its original orientation, which favors binding to forward actin sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shiroguchi et al., 2011</xref>). Most frequently, myosin V takes ≈ 74 nm steps, roughly equal in length to the actin helical pitch, but shorter and longer steps also occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yildiz et al., 2003</xref>). The near correspondence of the step size with the pitch, as well as the narrow step distribution, allows myosin V to approximately maintain its azimuthal orientation with respect to the actin over multiple steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun and Goldman, 2011</xref>). Mutant myosins with altered lever arms show a linear relation between mean step size and arm length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakamoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oke et al., 2010</xref>). Under moderate backward force myosin V remains highly processive, up to a stall force ≈ 1.9 - 3 pN, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mehta et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Veigel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uemura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cappello et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebhardt et al., 2006</xref>), at which the mean velocity of the motor goes to zero.</p><p>While myosin V is one of the most extensively studied motors, new functional features continue to be discovered as the spatiotemporal resolution of experimental imaging improves. Most recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrecka et al. (2015)</xref> achieved simultaneous millisecond temporal and nanometer spatial resolution with interferometric scattering microscopy in which the position of the gold nanoparticle attached to one of the motor heads was used to track the diffusion of the free head during its step. This measurement and recent electron micrographs of freely floating myosin taken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takagi et al. (2014)</xref> indicate that the joint between the myosin V lever arms does not rotate freely, but instead has structural constraints giving rise to a preferred inter-arm joint angle. The presence of a joint constraint seems to contradict previous diffusion measurements by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn and Spudich (2007)</xref> and other experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shiroguchi and Kinosita, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beausang et al., 2013</xref>) which indicated a freely rotating joint. Further, a number of theoretical and numerical studies based on free diffusion models have been remarkably successful in quantitatively describing various aspects of myosin V motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinczewski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Craig and Linke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mukherjee et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To address these apparent conflicts, we extend a minimal model of myosin V previously introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinczewski et al. (2013)</xref>, incorporating a constraint on the relative orientation of the two lever arms. The model combines a coarse-grained polymeric description of the diffusive search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thirumalai and Ha, 1998</xref>) with the reaction network of discrete states taken by the motor heads during the mechanochemical stepping cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vilfan, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bierbaum and Lipowsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sumi, 2017</xref>). The large persistence length of the myosin V lever arms allows us to derive an approximate but accurate semi-analytical expression for the equilibrium distribution of positions occupied by the free head during the diffusive search. The kinetic network accounts for not only forward steps, but also foot stomps (the head reattaching near the site of detachment) and backward steps which have been observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kodera et al., 2010</xref>) and become more prominent as the resistive force increases. In contrast to the simplified model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinczewski et al. (2013)</xref>, here we include the full set of available binding sites on the double-helical actin filaments, enabling a description of the distributions of steps and stomps taken by myosin V. The backward force applied by the load induces conformational changes in the lever arms, altering the diffusive search for binding sites and the associated binding probabilities. The effects of the magnitude of the resistive force and direction are easily incorporated into the theory. We supplement the analytical theory with Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of myosin stepping dynamics, the results of which largely concur with analytical predictions. In addition to addressing the constrained diffusion hypothesis, our model provides the most comprehensive accounting to date of the full range of sub-stall experimental data, including step-size distributions and the load dependence of several physical observables.</p><p>The polymer model gives direct insights into the connection between structural features of myosin V, including the inter-arm joint constraint, and both the diffusive search and kinetics of the motor. With a joint constraint, our model predicts diffusion profiles similar to that observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrecka et al. (2015)</xref>. By computing the changes in diffusion as the constraint strength is varied, we estimate upper and lower bounds on the constraint energy. Fitting the model to experimental measurements of myosin V step distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yildiz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakamoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oke et al., 2010</xref>) and the force dependence of the backward-to-forward step ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kad et al., 2008</xref>) and mean run length/velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mehta et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uemura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clemen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebhardt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kad et al., 2008</xref>), we confirm the consistency of the constrained diffusion picture with previous experimental data on myosin V. Interestingly, while the joint constraint considerably alters the diffusive search space, it has relatively small influence on the myosin V step size and force response. A free diffusion model, for instance, produces similar kinetic behaviors. Our model allows us to address questions related to the biological significance of the joint constraint. We find, for example, that the constraint does not necessarily speed up the binding time, despite narrowing the space of the diffusive search. However it does narrow the width of the forward step distributions on actin, allowing the head to more consistently target the actin binding sites at half-helical length intervals. Finally, the model provides testable predictions of new quantities yet to be probed by experiments, including the stomp distribution near the stall regime and the robust run length under off-axis forces.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Theoretical model for myosin V dynamics</title><p>In the following sections we describe the main features of our polymer structural model for myosin V, the actin filament geometry, and how the model allows us to predict diffusion and stepping behavior, including the probabilities of various kinetic pathways.

We will denote each polymer chain as a ‘leg’ of the motor (consisting of the combined head and lever arm domains), and refer to trailing or leading legs depending on whether a given leg is further away from or closer to the barbed (plus) end of actin, respectively. Several experiments measuring myosin step distributions and other properties have been carried out comparing wild-type myosin V to mutants where the lever arm length is altered through addition or deletion of IQ motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yildiz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakamoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oke et al., 2010</xref>).

For instance, the myosin heads are unlikely to be found in close proximity due to steric repulsion. Such exclusion interactions apply not only to the myosin heads, but also to the legs, which have to be brought close together in order to accommodate small head separations.

In the simulations, myosin V is treated as two connected and interacting polymer chains. The Hamiltonian that prescribes the interactions and the resulting structural features like the persistence length, is outlined in Appendix 2. A BD trajectory begins with the trailing lever arm unbinding from actin (mimicking the effect of ATP binding). A power stroke moves the unbound head quickly forward, after which it executes a diffusive search until it finds an energetically favorable actin binding site. As in the analytical model, the actin binding sites are given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>. We trace the diffusive search and record the binding locations. The reported data is averaged over 200 randomized trajectories. The simulations allow us to include the finite sizes of the lever arms, the effect of the volume excluded by actin, and a glass cover-slip that is used in certain experimental setups. Additionally we can test different functional forms for the binding criterion and power stroke execution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Kinetic pathways</title><p>Myosin V can exhibit a wide range of behaviors, shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, including steps and stomps involving each polymer leg. Before following a particular kinetic pathway, Myosin V starts in a waiting state where both legs are strongly bound to the actin and each head has an associated ADP molecule. Each leg is in the post-power stroke orientation, pointed toward the plus end of the actin, and the leading leg is bent backward under tension. The motor then goes through one of many kinetic pathways, which can be broken into the five categories described below.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Myosin V kinetic pathways.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51569-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Forward steps</title><p>The myosin sits in the waiting state until the ADP molecule unbinds from the trailing head, allowing an ATP molecule to take its place. With the bound ATP, the trailing leg is only weakly associated to the actin and therefore quickly detaches. We assume (except for modeling one run velocity experiment described below) that the ATP concentration is near saturation levels, so that ATP binding occurs rapidly.

Finally, in addition to requiring close proximity of the free head to an actin binding site, the detached myosin head must also be in the correct orientation for binding to occur (the full details of this binding criterion are described in the section ‘First Passage Times and the Binding Acceptance Region’ below.)</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Trailing leg stomps</title><p>This kinetic pathway starts identically to the forward steps described above, namely the trailing leg dissociation is followed by ATP binding and hydrolysis.

Instead of executing a hand-over-hand step, the myosin stomps and the heads remain in the same relative order on the actin, with a comparably small change in the center of mass position of the myosin.

After a forward step, the lever arm points toward the minus end of the actin in a relaxed pre-power stroke state. To bind to sites behind the bound leg, however, the free lever arm must bend and point toward the plus end of the actin despite its pre-power stroke orientation with respect to the head. This unnatural configuration puts the free leg under additional strain, so that there is an energy barrier to binding at backward actin sites. We model this effective barrier by reducing the probability of binding when the free head reaches a radius <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf93"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> of actin sites with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf94"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

The reduced binding probability, a consequence of the recovery stroke, increases the relative probability that the myosin will step forward, contributing to the biased motion along the actin filament.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Backward steps</title><p>The other possible kinetic pathways start with the leading head detaching from the actin, in contrast to the trailing head detachment which initiates forward steps and trailing leg stomps. After the power stroke, the leading lever arm is under considerable backward tension. This tension dramatically suppresses the release of ADP from the leading head by a factor of 50–70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kodera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rosenfeld and Sweeney, 2004</xref>). Since these events are very rare, an alternative detachment pathway is dominant: the leading head dissociates from the actin but retains the associated ADP molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kodera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Purcell et al., 2005</xref>).

Note that the bound leg is in the post-power stroke state, so the diffusion is statistically identical to that which occurs during forward steps and trailing leg stomps. In this case, however, the free head has an associated ADP molecule immediately after detachment, so the free leg can rebind without undergoing ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, because ATP hydrolysis is not executed, the free head remains in the post-power stroke state orientation which favors binding to backward sites.

This binding, which involves the interaction of a specific region of the head with a corresponding region on the actin subunit, is mimicked in our coarse-grained model through an angular criterion: we require that the angle between the free leg and the outward pointing normal (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf137"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐫</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐳</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) at the target actin site be smaller than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf138"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>ac</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which defines a conical acceptance region in which binding is allowed.

In constrast, the experimental distribution is asymmetric, with the peak closer to the actin about 1.5 times higher than the one further away from the actin. While we cannot rule out that some aspect of this asymmetry may be due to additional structural features not present in the model, it is also likely to be at least in part an artifact of the finite time resolution of the experiment and possibly consequences of attaching a gold nanoparticle to infer the motility of the detached motor head. The peak region further away from actin is the one that is initially visited after detachment of the trailing head. If one cannot resolve the precise moment of detachment, one might not be able to fully capture this portion of the distribution in the experimental data. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrecka et al.

(2015)</xref> require a glass cover-slip which excludes half the space available for the myosin diffusive search. They report no evidence of interactions between the myosin and the surface. However, entropic forces due to volume exclusion do influence the diffusion. While it is unlikely these effects would induce a multi-peaked diffusion contour, we explicitly check this by adding a potential barrier excluding half of space in Brownian dynamics simulations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). Our results rule out the appearance of a multi-peaked distribution due solely to volume exclusion and confirm the cover-slip only slightly changes the shape of the diffusion contours.</p><p>The discrepancy between the single-peaked distribution of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn and Spudich (2007)</xref> experiment and the the multi-peaked distribution of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrecka et al. (2015)</xref> remains a controversy, but as noted in the latter work it can be partially resolved by adding localization noise and re-binning their data, accounting for the differences in gold nanoparticle size and the associated measurement precision between the two experiments. The fact that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn and Spudich (2007)</xref> attached their gold nanoparticle labels on the lever arm closer to the joint may also have contributed to concealing the constrained diffusion: the closer the label is to the joint, the closer together the two peaks appear in the distribution, and the harder it becomes to distinguish one from two peaks given finite experimental spatial resolution.</p><p>In the following sections, we use our model to test the constrained diffusion hypothesis against the large body of existing experimental data on myosin V. In the <italic>Discussion</italic>, we compare the constrained and free diffusion models and suggest further experiments to more conclusively discern between these competing myosin V diffusion hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Constrained diffusion model predicts zero force step distributions</title><p>The spatial fluctuations of motor proteins, among them distributions of step sizes, have long been an intriguing aspect of their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das and Kolomeisky, 2008</xref>). Let us first consider the step size distribution under zero backward force, one of the most commonly measured aspects of myosin V dynamics. The classic experiment by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yildiz et al. (2003)</xref> measured one of the first myosin step distributions using fluorescence imaging with one nanometer accuracy (FIONA). Later experiments using FIONA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakamoto et al., 2005</xref>) and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oke et al., 2010</xref>) determined step distributions for both wild-type myosin as well as 4IQ and 8IQ mutants. The FIONA experiments measure the distance travelled by the trailing head while executing a forward step, while the electron micrographs were used to directly determine the number of actin sites separating legs while bound. These experiments qualitatively agree, with the wild-type distribution peaked at the half-helical site (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf272"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 36 nm) and an approximately linear relation between step size and lever arm length, though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakamoto et al. (2005)</xref> measured slightly shorter 4IQ steps than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oke et al. (2010)</xref>. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakamoto et al. (2005)</xref> found that, due to the longer leg length, 8IQ mutants can reach the full helical actin sites (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf273"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 72 nm), giving rise to multi-peaked step distributions. This effect was not observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oke et al.

Informed by these fits, we choose a set of parameters for which agreement between theory and experiment is excellent for all distributions.

These and all the other parameter values in the model are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.

The azimuthal constraint <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf302"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>ac</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> corresponds to an acceptance region of ∼111°, which plays a key role in restricting binding too far from the half-helical and full-helical actin sites. Step distributions and direct measurements of the azimuthal trajectory of myosin indicate steps with large azimuthal rotations are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewis et al., 2012</xref>), likely due to orientational binding constraints.</p><p>The theoretical head separation distributions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, row 1 alongside data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oke et al. (2010)</xref> while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, row 2 we plot the full convolved step distributions. Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oke et al. (2010)</xref> were not able to resolve large head separations for 8IQ mutants, we compute an alternative ‘small steps’ distribution in which large head separation (&gt; 18 actin subunits) is not considered. The theoretical distribution peaks and width agree well with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oke et al. (2010)</xref>, especially for the 4IQ mutant. For 6IQ and 8IQ myosin V, the distributions are slightly broader, more similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakamoto et al. (2005)</xref>. In particular, we capture the multi-peaked 8IQ distribution, with peaks at about 78 nm, 110 nm, and 135 nm (indicated by arrows in panel F). The first peak comes from steps in which the free leg detaches from the half-helical site behind the bound leg and steps to the half-helical site ahead of the bound leg. Similarly, the second peak corresponds to steps with one head-to-head distance (during detachment or binding) being the full helical length and the other being the half-helical length. Finally, the third, smallest peak corresponds to the free leg starting and ending at the full helical distance. One might expect the rich stepping behavior of the 8IQ mutant to be inconsistent with the constrained diffusion hypothesis. If the joint does not freely rotate, can the myosin reach both the half- and full-helical actin subunits? Our model shows that a 5 K<sub>B</sub>T joint constraint energy is sufficiently weak to allow multi-peaked step distributions, but strong enough to considerably alter the diffusion (see previous section). We also tested large constraint energies and found that for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf303"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>12</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> we could no longer simultaneously fit the multi-peaked 8IQ step distribution and other step distributions.

Interestingly, even though forward steps are no longer kinetically dominant, the location and shape of their distribution remains robust, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (BD simulations show the same qualitative behavior, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The stall force is defined to be the force at which the expected run length of the myosin is zero. Our calculation shows that stall is due to the emergence of a backward step distribution identical to the that for forward steps. Thus, at stall force the myosin takes forward and backward steps with equal probability, making no progress along the actin. In this regime, however, the dominant kinetic pathway is trailing leg stomps which give rise to the large peak around 0 in the step/stomp distribution. Finally, increasing the force further eliminates all forward steps, increasing the prevalence of trailing stomps while shifting the backward step distribution by about one actin binding site.</p><p>An interesting prediction made by the model is the distribution of stomps, which is particularly apparent above stall force and has comparable width to the zero force step distribution. With ever improving imaging technology, it may soon be possible to reliably detect such variation in stomping experimentally. Because stomps are the dominant kinetic pathway in this force regime, many stomping events could be observed if sufficient imaging precision is achieved. Such measurements would provide further insights into how myosin V executes foot stomps. If the measured distribution significantly differs from our theoretical prediction, perhaps alternative mechanisms are involved in foot stomping. Since the leading head retains its ADP molecule after unbinding, it can in principle rebind quickly. Therefore, it is possible that leading foot stomps are dependent on non-equilibrium diffusion that occurs before the myosin legs relax to equilibrium. Further experiments are required to complete our understanding of myosin foot stomping.</p><p>The predictions made in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> will require optical trap experiments in which a load force is applied to a cargo. If the contours of the distribution of the free head are to be simultaneously measured then it becomes necessary to also attach a gold nanoparticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrecka et al., 2015</xref>). The analyses of the results of such experiments, which could test our predictions, might be complicated due to hydrodynamics effects of both the cargo and the gold nanoparticle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-14"><title>Probing the biological function of the joint constraint: effects on timing and consistency of stepping</title><p>In addition to making behavioral predictions, our model also provides insights into the potential biological function of the structural joint constraint. As discussed above, our computed diffusion contours and the measurements of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrecka et al. (2015)</xref> indicate that the joint constraint reduces the diffusion search space from fully three-dimensional to nearly one-dimensional, with the free head locations concentrated along a curve. How does this effect influence the stepping behavior of myosin V? One might expect that restricting the search space would affect both mean binding times and the step distributions.</p><p>Let us first consider the subject of binding times.

(2002)</xref> used an actin filament attached to beads in an optical trap, and studied the interactions between individual myosin V motors and the filament. By sinusoidally oscillating one bead (and hence the filament) they could use the amplitude of the resulting fluctuations to determine the stiffness of the motor-actin complex over time. Intervals of reduced stiffness were interpreted as times when only one head was bound, and hence the unbound head is undergoing a diffusive search. At low loads (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf389"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> pN) these intervals averaged around ∼18 ms, while at near-stall loads the intervals lasted for hundreds of milliseconds. This order of magnitude relative increase is consistent with our prediction for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf390"><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> as a function of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf391"><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, with the interpretation that what they were observing at high loads was primarily trailing head stomping. The absolute timescales in the experiment are larger than in the theory (for example the predicted <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf392"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 1.6 ms at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf393"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> versus the experimental value of ∼18 ms), but this is likely due to the fact that the sinusoidal forcing (at 75 Hz with peak-to-peak amplitude 250 nm) is a substantial perturbation to the system that makes it harder for the head to bind (hence increasing mean binding times). However the relative increase of the binding times with force is captured by our model. Other experiments, where a gold nanoparticle is attached to one of the motor legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn and Spudich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrecka et al., 2015</xref>), have found binding timescales on the order of tens of milliseconds in the low load regime. Here there is another experimental artifact in play: as discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinczewski et al.

Despite the fact that increasing <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf407"><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> restricts the search space (and hence potentially makes diffusion faster), we find that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf408"><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mtext>T</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf409"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> does not substantially decrease and can increase depending on the preferred inter-leg angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, dashed lines). While adding the constraint makes it easier to find a few target binding sites, it simultaneously makes it harder to find other sites, so that the overall change in binding time is small. Furthermore, we emphasize that head detachment (not the binding time) is the rate limiting action in the stepping cycle at low loads. Thus, the mean binding time only influences the motor dynamics indirectly, through determination of the mean number of steps taken before complete dissociation. To have any impact on motor performance, the mean binding time would have to decrease more substantially than we have found here.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Forward step distribution width (solid lines) and mean binding time after trailing leg detachment (dashed lines) for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf410"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> as a function of the inter-leg constraint strength <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf411"><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.</title><p>We carried out this calculation for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf412"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>83</mml:mn><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (the value used throughout this paper) as well as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf413"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>65</mml:mn><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf414"><mml:msup><mml:mn>95</mml:mn><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>.

In addition to fitting the drop to zero run length at the stall force, our model also captures the gradual decrease in run velocity at low forces (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf451"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≲</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>), which is due to small backward shifts in the step distribution under load. This effect is not seen in the previous simplified model in which only half-helical steps were considered. We also compare to the large force measurements of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebhardt et al. (2006)</xref>, which observed myosin V walking backward with velocity ≈ 90 nm/s under 3 pN backward force. This experiment was performed at 1 μM ATP concentration, which lowers the ATP binding rate and associated trailing leg dissociation rate. Therefore, for this comparison we set t<sub>d1</sub> = 2.2 s<sup>—1</sup> as estimated from experimental kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinczewski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebhardt et al., 2006</xref>). The low ATP run velocity is shown as the dashed curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>. The backward velocity under 3 pN force is comparable, though slightly smaller than the measured value. This small discrepancy, as well as disagreement with high force data (at 5 and 10 pN force), is likely due to additional kinetic pathways in the super-stall regime, such as the power stroke reversal discussed above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-16"><title>Robust procession under off axis loads</title><p>While we have focused on verifying the consistency of structurally constrained diffusion with the full range of experiments, our model also provides a fast analytical framework for studying complex behaviors of myosin V. As an example, we consider procession under off-axis load forces, which are not parallel to the axis of the actin filaments. Off-axis loads are likely especially relevant in vivo where the myosin navigates a crowded environment.</p><p>Experiments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oguchi et al. (2010)</xref> measured the distance myosin V walked against off-axis loads applied by a bead in an optical trap. To apply the off-axis force, the actin was attached to a glass stage which was shifted perpendicularly to the actin axis after the myosin had taken two steps. For forces that were approximately ±25° off-axis on average, the myosin walked slightly further (∼10 nm on average) than under backward force. The force at termination as well as the on-axis component of the termination force were also larger for off-axis loads. We emulated these experiments using Monte Carlo simulations, adjusting the load force after each step or stomp based on the distance from the starting location and shifting the force off axis after two steps. The average simulated run length and termination force each increased under off-axis loads (not shown), agreeing qualitatively with experiments.</p><p>We also directly compute the mean run length under a constant 1 pN load using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10">Equation 10</xref> for a large range of off-axis forces parameterized by the spherical angles <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf452"><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>F</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf453"><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>F</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.

The <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf467"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> diffusion contour produced by the constrained diffusion model closely resembles that measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrecka et al. (2015)</xref> and we find strong quantitative agreement between the model predictions and experimental data for zero force step distributions and force dependence of the step ratio, run length, and run velocity. While this evidence is convincing, we emphasize that with relatively minor parameters changes the free diffusion model also makes similarly accurate predictions, with the exception of the diffusion contours. As is particularly apparent from comparison of the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf468"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf469"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), free diffusion doesn’t produce multi-peaked distributions, implying that the freely rotating myosin explores the entire three dimensional space, contrary to the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrecka et al. (2015)</xref>. With respect to other experiments, however, the free diffusion model performs favorably, agreeing with step distribution and force dependence data nearly as well as the constrained diffusion model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The similarity between the predictions of the constrained and free diffusion models can be explained through further analysis of the diffusion contours close to the actin. While the global diffusion patterns are very different from one another, close to the actin they look quite similar. Therefore, both the one-dimensional path under constrained diffusion and the full three-dimensional exploration under free diffusion favor binding to similar actin sites, namely those near the half-helical length of actin. This means that the free diffusion model accurately describes both step distributions and force dependence behavior. Since the diffusion time scale is much smaller than the head detachment time, the run velocity as a function of force is also quite similar between models.</p><p>The similarity between the free and constrained diffusion model predictions for on-actin behavior indicates that experimental measurements of such quantities (step distributions, run length, etc.) cannot effectively discern the true structure of the myosin V joint. The diffusive search, however, is dramatically influenced even by a small joint structural constraint. Therefore, to further probe the presence and consequences of structural constraints, experiments should directly measure the free leg diffusion. In particular, the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf470"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> projection of the diffusion shows particularly stark contrast between the constrained and free diffusion models. This contour corresponds to imaging the myosin from the front along the axis of the actin.</p><p>While our analysis and the most recent experiments suggest that myosin V has structurally constrained diffusion, the free diffusion model is still useful as a simplified effective theory for stepping behavior on the actin filaments. The precise values of physical parameters likely cannot be accurately determined with the free diffusion model, but extrapolation from fits to existing experimental data allows for valuable behavioral predictions. Both the free and constrained diffusion models can contribute to our understanding of the function of myosin V in complicated environments, for instance with off-axis load forces (see above). In fact, previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinczewski et al., 2013</xref>), indicates that the force dependence of average quantities, such as the forward step probability, step ratio, or run length, are well described by a further simplified model that only allows steps to the half-helical actin sites. Such a model cannot describe step distributions, but does contribute to our understanding of myosin V’s resilience under backward force and robust motility under perturbations to structural parameters. Since our computed and simulated diffusion contours indicate a similarity between the constrained diffusion model and simplified free diffusion models near the actin, the latter remain quite useful for studying certain behaviors of myosin V.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have developed a comprehensive low-force model of myosin V, incorporating the polymeric nature of the lever arms, the joint angle preference which gives rise to a structurally constrained diffusive search, and the full set of kinetic pathways involving all actin binding sites. The analytical model allows us to compute bounds on the joint constraint energy and captures experimental results for step distributions and the force dependence of the step ratio, run length, and run velocity. While our results are largely in support of the constrained diffusion hypothesis, the theory also provides insight about how simplified models (eg. free diffusion) can provide a useful analytical description of some myosin V behaviors. Finally, using the model we can make predictions about experimentally measurable quantities including stomp distributions and robust run length under off-axis forces. To conclude we discuss limitations and potentially interesting extensions to the model for future studies.</p><p>Throughout the present study, we have assumed that myosin V walks along a single static actin filament. In reality, the many actin filaments within a cell can come together forming crossing and branching network structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pollard et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, bending and rotational fluctuations of the actin also occur and have been characterized experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Egelman et al., 1982</xref>). A recent study observed myosin V walking on actin rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2013</xref>), while fluctuations have been considered in previous theoretical work on step distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vilfan, 2005b</xref>). New actin geometries and fluctuations could be easily incorporated in our model by convolving the distribution of actin binding site locations with the distribution for the position of the free myosin head.</p><p>One regime in which our model fails is under very large super-stall loads. In particular, the large backward run velocity measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebhardt et al. (2006)</xref> at 5 pN and 10 pN backward force are not captured by the model. This alternative behavior is likely due to the power stroke reversal noted above and observed in experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sellers and Veigel, 2010</xref>), which would promote more frequent large backward steps. It is also likely that under such extreme forces the detachment rates of the myosin heads are altered. By adding new power stroke reversal kinetic pathways, we expect our model to better capture the large force behavior of myosin V.</p><p>Finally, our methods may be more broadly applied to the large class of processive molecular motors that operate through the combination of chemical reactions and a diffusive Brownian search. Of particular interest are myosins VI and X, which operate through a similar set of kinetic pathways, but have heterogenous lever arms with both stiff and flexible components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun and Goldman, 2011</xref>). Perhaps applying our approach can resolve the controversy over the conformation of the myosin VI lever arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spink et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mukherjea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thirumalai and Zhang, 2010</xref>). Beyond the myosin superfamily, we anticipate our approach may also prove useful for understanding kinesin and dynein motors as well as other biomolecules that can be suitably modeled by fluctuating polymer chains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The theoretical methods used above are fully described in Appendix 1, while the details of the Brownian dynamics simulations are in Appendix 2.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>DH was supported by the Presidential Life Science Fellowship from Cornell and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (DGE-1650441).

myosin V. In the first two sections, we define the actin geometry and solve the first passage problem for binding to sites along the actin double helix. From this we derive step distributions, the backward-forward step ratio, the mean run length, and the mean run velocity. This analysis is quite general: it applies to any actin-based motor with a similar mechanochemical cycle, assuming one can compute the equilibrium probability density for the positions of the free head during diffusion. In later sections, we compute this probability density for myosin V, incorporating effects of an inter-leg constraint potential, volume exclusion, orientation requirements for binding, and load force. The combined result gives a complete diffusion-informed kinetic description of myosin V.</p><sec id="s8" sec-type="appendix"><title>Actin geometry</title><p>The actin double helix is composed of two filaments each containing 13 actin monomers per helical rotation.

That paper suggested that, rather than function as a freely jointed swivel the junction between the two lever arms was relatively fixed and that the free head of myosin V did not explore random space while searching for a new, forward actin binding site. Rather, it occupied an off-actin dwell space from which it periodically explored the actin landscape. The new model introduces this structural constraint and examines the consequences in terms of free head localization, selection of forward actin monomer binding site, step size and step directionality. In addition, they examine the effect of modeled load on several parameters, including the effect of off axis load. The conclusion is that their new model predicts the experimental free head localization data obtained in Andrecka et al., 2015, as well as the kinetic and mechanical data found in many other myosin V papers. However, they add the comment that a freely diffusional model also fits most of the data in the literature with the exception of the discrete location for the dwell state.</p><p>This is a comprehensive theoretical work on uncovering mechanism of the motion of myosin-V motor proteins. The subject is very important, and this work makes a huge step in our understanding of this difficult problem. The paper is very nicely written and all the details are clearly explained. The authors are noted for their self-critical approach and for critically analyzing many experimental and theoretical results. For example, the discussion of asymmetry in diffusion contours is very honest and very objective. They combine computer simulations and analytical theory, the latter of which providing a better molecular understanding. This work should stimulate a lot of new experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The use of mean first-passage times as estimates for the binding reaction processes assumes that the reaction is taking place after a single collision (diffusion limit). While this might be the case, it is not proven in the case of motor proteins. I would add a caution at this point about the application of mean first-passage times. By the way, this might also be the reason why the theory does not work at large forces. Some discussion might be useful here. For example, authors should note that Dunn et al., 2007, Andrecka et al., 2015, and Veigel et al., 2002, all estimated the actual transit time from detachment of the trail head to its reattachment at a new forward position to be much greater than the theoretic first passage time.</p><p>2) Figure 5.

Could the authors comment on whether their model would predict such long lifetimes of single-headed attachment?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51569.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The use of mean first-passage times as estimates for the binding reaction processes assumes that the reaction is taking place after a single collision (diffusion limit).

Binding in our model is not simply diffusion-limited, but this was not discussed explicitly in the main text, and we did not show any binding time results. For that reason we have added a new section to the main text, “Probing the biological function of the joint constraint: effects on timing and consistency of stepping”. Part of this section is devoted to a detailed description of binding timescales, along with a new figure (Figure 6) that shows a comparison of diffusion, hydrolysis, and binding timescales as a function of load force. Quoting from that new section:</p><p>“As discussed above, binding in the model is more complex than just waiting for the head to diffuse within the capture radius <italic>a</italic> of a binding site on actin. […] Figure 6 shows <italic>t<sub>T</sub> </italic>versus <italic>t</italic><sub>diff</sub> as a function of applied force <italic>F</italic>, and we always see <italic>t<sub>T</sub> &gt; t</italic><sub>diff</sub>, as expected from the above constraints.”</p><p>The discussion of the experimental estimates for transit times is later in the same section, and we quote it in response to the next reviewer comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 5.
