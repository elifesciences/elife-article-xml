During this transformation, the tissues in the larvae change into the structures found in the adult. For example, the adult wings, flight muscles, and other structures needed for coordinated flight form from a pair of disc-like tissues called the wing imaginal discs.</p><p>For these structures to develop correctly, the cells in the wing imaginal discs need to receive coordinated instructions about what types of cells they need to become. Within the wing discs, finger-like projections called cytonemes link specific cells together to allow signal molecules to move between the cells; this controls the development of the wing disc itself as well as structures called dorsal air sacs, which supply oxygen to the flight muscles in the adult fly. However, it is not known if cytonemes allow the exchange of signal molecules between cells involved in the formation of other structures needed for flight.</p><p>Here, Huang and Kornberg investigated the role of cytonemes in the development of the flight muscles in fruit flies. The experiments reveal that cells called myoblasts—which will later become the flight muscle cells—form two sets of cytonemes with other cells. One set connects the myoblasts to cells in the developing air sac, which allows a signal protein called Delta to signal from the myoblasts into the air sac cells. The other set of cytonemes connects the myoblasts to wing disc cells. This enables another signal molecule called Wingless, which is produced in wing disc cells, to move into the myoblasts and block the production of Delta.</p><p>Huang and Kornberg's findings reveal a new role for cytonemes in coordinating the development of the flight muscles and the dorsal air sacs. A future challenge will be to understand how individual cytonemes are able to connect to specific cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06114.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06114.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cytoneme</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>Delta</kwd><kwd>Wingless</kwd><kwd>frizzled</kwd><kwd>diaphanous</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM105987</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kornberg</surname><given-names>Thomas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM030637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kornberg</surname><given-names>Thomas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cytonemes mediate, and are essential for, Wingless signaling from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc to disc-associated myoblasts and for Delta-Notch signaling from these myoblasts to the dorsal air sac primordium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flight muscles of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult drive the coordinated movements of the wings and thoracic cuticle to power flight, and many thin tubes (tracheoles) that emanate from the thoracic dorsal air sacs penetrate the muscles to oxygenate them. Thus, the functions of the muscles, wings, thoracic cuticle, and trachea are linked, and the physical associations are intimate. The progenitor cells that produce these tissues develop together in the wing imaginal disc. Previous studies from this lab showed that the air sac primordium (ASP), which is the progenitor of the dorsal air sacs, depends on Branchless/FGF (FGF) and Dpp signaling proteins that the wing disc produces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we describe two other signaling systems that coordinate the progenitors of the flight muscles with the wing disc and trachea.</p><p>The wing disc can be described as a flattened sac that juxtaposes the apical surfaces of two connected epithelial sheets across a narrow lumen. One of the sheets, called the columnar epithelium because its cells are highly elongated along their apical/basal axis, generates the wing blade and most of the notum, the dorsal cuticle of the thorax. The wing disc is encapsulated by a basement membrane, but a branch of the tracheal system (the transverse connective) penetrates the basement membrane at several sites in the dorsal region of the disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guha et al., 2009</xref>). Transverse connective that is within the basement membrane lies adjacent to the basal surface of the columnar epithelium, and during the third instar (L3), this segment of the transverse connective sprouts a tubular outgrowth—the ASP—in response to FGF expressed by a group of nearby columnar epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</xref>). Myoblasts that are the progenitors of the flight muscles are also at the basal surface of the columnar epithelium, underneath the basement membrane, and in the vicinity of the tracheal branches. They proliferate during L3 to extend over most of the dorsal part of the disc where the cells that will produce the notum cuticle grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sudarsan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Signaling proteins that contribute to the growth and diversification of the cells of the wing disc have been extensively characterized. Three that are relevant to the ASP and myoblasts are Notch, Dpp, and Wg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couso et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ng et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brennan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steneberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sudarsan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baena-Lopez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giraldez and Cohen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marois et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herranz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>). Notch signaling has essential roles at both the dorsal/ventral and anterior/posterior compartment borders of the disc, and although it has been shown to specify fusion cell fate and branch identity during formation of tracheal system in the embryo, a role in larval trachea has not been reported. Studies in several other contexts indicate that Notch signaling may be mediated by cytonemes that make direct contacts between signaling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Renaud and Simpson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Dpp-expressing cells line the anterior side of the anterior/posterior compartment border at all stages of L3 discs, and Dpp that is produced near the ASP activates Dpp signal transduction in the ASP that is necessary for its morphogenesis. ASP cells express the Dpp receptor but do not express Dpp. The mechanism by which Dpp signals from disc cells to the ASP involves exchange of Dpp between producing and receiving cells at synapses that form where cytonemes link ASP cells to Dpp-producing disc cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). ASP cytonemes that contain the Dpp receptor have been observed extending as far as 40 μm, crossing over approximately 15–20 disc cells to reach sources of Dpp. These cytonemes transport Dpp from producing cells to the ASP, and signal transduction is dependent on the contacts they make with the disc cells. Comparably long ASP cytonemes containing the FGF receptor have been observed reaching FGF-expressing disc cells, and in the wing disc, Hh dispersion is effected by a similar mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Callejo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>). In these contexts, the evidence that Dpp, FGF, and Hh paracrine signaling are mediated by cytonemes is strong.</p><p>Expression patterns of Wg change throughout the L3. In the wing blade primordium, Wg is expressed broadly in early L3 discs, but in late L3 discs, it is expressed in well-delineated bands both at the dorsal/ventral compartment border and around the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Phillips and Whittle, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couso et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strigini and Cohen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre et al., 2014</xref>). Wg-expressing cells at the dorsal/ventral border may function as a signaling center for the growth and diversification of the wing cells. Wg is also expressed in the notum primordium where it has a role in myoblast proliferation and diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sudarsan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which Wg signals from the disc cells to myoblasts has not been studied. In other contexts, it has been assumed that Wg is secreted and released by producing cells, and that it reaches target cells by passive diffusion, and models that describe its movement posit that its path may be restricted by structures it encounters, but that its hypothetical journey is similar to a ‘drunken sailor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muller et al., 2013</xref>). In wing discs, a mutant form of Wg that is tethered to the plasma membrane by a heterologous transmembrane domain is active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre et al., 2014</xref>), but it is not known how signaling by this tethered form is related to the normal processes that present wild type Wg to receiving cells. There is no experimental evidence that shows directly that Wg disperses by passive diffusion or that it signals in vivo as a soluble, free protein. The study reported here investigated signaling between disc cells, myoblasts, and the ASP. The Wg-Fz and Notch-Dl signaling systems were identified as important to ASP development, and two types of myoblast cytonemes were characterized that mediate exchange and transport of Wg and signaling by Dl.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Trachea and myoblasts in the third instar wing disc</title><p>To investigate the relative proximity of the myoblasts and trachea as they grow and develop during L3, we simultaneously expressed membrane-tethered mCherry in the trachea (with <italic>btl-LHG lexO-mCherry:CAAX</italic>, a tracheal-specific driver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shiga et al., 1996</xref>]) and membrane-tethered GFP in myoblasts (with <italic>1151-Gal4 UAS-CD8:GFP</italic>; a myoblast-specific driver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roy and VijayRaghavan, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">1998</xref>]), and monitored both fluorescent proteins in disc preparations. During L3, the myoblasts increase in number from approximately 250 to 2500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>), and the ASP buds from the transverse connective to grow posteriorly across the anterior compartment. Images of the mid-dorsal region of early, mid, and late L3 discs revealed the expansion of the myoblasts and growth of the ASP as well as the close proximity of the trachea and myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>).

In order to identify the signaling system that correlates with the contacts between myoblasts and cells in the ‘lower layer’ of the ASP, we examined the expression patterns of several candidate genes. We did not detect expression of Senseless, Vestigial, Cut, or Distal-less in the ASP, and although we detected expression of Escargot, Trachealess, and Pointed, there was no apparent difference in expression levels between the ‘upper’ and ‘lower layers’. In contrast, we found that both the intensity of staining with α-Hindsight (Hnt) antibody and the expression of Su(H)GBE-lacZ (Su(H)lacZ) were significantly greater in the ‘lower layer’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H′</xref>). Hnt and Su(H)lacZ are targets of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furriols and Bray, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun and Deng, 2007</xref>), suggesting that Notch signaling may be activated in the ASP and may be associated with contacts between myoblasts and the ASP.</p><p>To determine if Notch signaling has a role in tracheal development, we altered Notch signaling in several ways, including expressing dominant-negative Notch (Notch<sup>DN</sup>), constitutive active Notch (Notch<sup>CA</sup>), and Dl-RNAi. In comparison with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>), the ASP was reduced in size by tracheal expression of Notch<sup>DN</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and was misshapen and expanded following tracheal expression of Notch<sup>CA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These effects suggest that Notch activity is necessary for ASP development. To determine if Notch signaling in the ASP involves the disc-associated myoblasts, we over-expressed the pro-apoptotic cell death gene <italic>reaper</italic> (<italic>rpr</italic>) in myoblasts to reduce their number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M,N</xref>). ASP growth was impaired by the <italic>rpr</italic> over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

The number of myoblasts in early stage L3 discs is small, and we observed few of them directly overlayed Wg-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). During L3, the myoblasts proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>) to cover most of the dorsal disc by late L3, and we observed that the domain of Wg-expressing cells in the dorsal disc also expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C</xref>). However, the relative proximity of these Wg-expressing disc cells to the ASP decreased during the L3 period: although the most ventral Wg-expressing cells were within 5–10 μm of the ASP in early L3 discs, there were no Wg-expressing cells within 60–70 μm in late L3 discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–F</xref>). In order to determine whether myoblasts contact Wg-expressing cells and where such contacts are relative to the ASP, we applied the GRASP technique. The fluorescence of the reconstituted GFP revealed extensive contacts between myoblasts and Wg-expressing disc cells throughout L3, but these contacting myoblasts were adjacent to the ASP only at the early L3 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G–I</xref>). Wg-expressing disc cells did not contact the ASP or nearby tracheal cells at mid or late L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).

We analyzed preparations from larvae that expressed a Fz:Cherry protein fusion in myoblasts and whose cytonemes were marked with membrane-tethered GFP. Fz:Cherry was present in motile puncta, many of which localized to myoblast cytonemes and to cytoneme tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).

Whereas some interactions between the disc and ASP are direct, such as the signaling by disc-generated Dpp and FGF that activate signal transduction in the ASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roy et al., 2014</xref>), our results now show that disc-dependent regulation of Notch signaling in the ASP is indirect. We found that the myoblasts are intermediaries that relay Wg signaling from the disc to control Notch signal transduction in the ASP.</p><p>There are precedents for intermediaries that link signaling pathways in different cells. In the wing disc, for example, Hh produced in the posterior compartment induces Dpp expression in a spatially limited group of anterior compartment cells that are situated just across the anterior/posterior compartment border. These cells function as the anterior/posterior organizer, dispersing Dpp protein that induces the expression of various target genes by cells across the disc. The Dpp-expressing cells may thus be considered to be intermediaries that relay Hh signaling. This relay system transforms a pattern of binary expression (Hh on in the posterior compartment, off in the anterior compartment) to the more complex nested patterns of expression of Dpp target genes.</p><p>The function of the myoblast relay system is not clear, and in contrast to the Hh-Dpp system, it may not be related to spatial patterns of gene expression. Key differences between the systems that may be relevant are timing and physical proximity. Hh induces Dpp expression at the anterior/posterior compartment border in the embryo and appears to do so continuously until the late L3. Moreover, the spatial relationship between the Hh and Dpp-expressing cells remains essentially unchanged as the disc grows and matures. In contrast, Wg signaling in the myoblasts is required only in early L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) when the ASP and the Wg-expressing disc cells are relatively close (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Myoblasts in this region facilitate Wg signaling by extending Fz-containing cytonemes that take up Wg. At later L3 stages, the patterns of Wg expression in the disc are quite different and the distance between Wg-expressing disc cells and the ASP is much greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). At these stages, the myoblasts that contact the ASP with Dl-containing cytonemes are juxtaposed to the ASP, far from the myoblasts that contact the Wg-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig9 fig10">Figures 2, 9, 10</xref>). The ASP has no apparent requirement for Wg signaling at these stages.</p><p>The late L3 ASP is a tubular structure that has a lumen and morphologically distinct stalk, medial, and tip regions that define a proximal/distal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). An orthogonal dorsal/ventral axis in the ASP is defined by cells that have contrasting levels of Dpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roy et al., 2014</xref>) and Notch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) signal transduction in the ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ layers. These regional specializations materialize as the ASP grows during the mid and late L3 stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guha and Kornberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guha et al., 2009</xref>), but in early L3 when Wg signaling is needed, the ASP appears to be simply a small outgrowth with no discernable lumen or regional specializations. Our studies suggest that the myoblasts that activate Notch signaling in the lower layer cells of the late L3 ASP are defined by their prior exposure to Wg. We suggest that the myoblast relay system may accommodate the changing spatial relationship between the disc cells that express Wg and the ASP cells that require Notch signaling.</p><p>The framework for understanding the functions of homeotic genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has come from seminal studies that analyzed null mutants, temperature sensitive mutants, and somatic clones of mutant cells. The consistent finding that mutant cells respond similarly in the embryo and in the larval stages led to the general concept that homeotic genes are required continuously during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lawrence and Morata, 1994</xref>). Our observation here, that ASP requires Wg signaling only in early L3, is unusual in this context, but it is consistent with two prior reports. One described somatic clones in the wing disc that ectopically activated the Dpp pathway, and analyzed the expression of the Dpp target gene <italic>optomotor-blind</italic> (<italic>omb</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lecuit et al., 1996</xref>). Differences between <italic>omb</italic> expression in the clones and in normal discs led to the proposal that some <italic>omb</italic>-expressing cells in late L3 discs are not active for Dpp signal transduction but express <italic>omb</italic> because of their exposure to Dpp at an earlier stage. The second study analyzed the expression of Wg target genes in wing discs that expressed a form of Wg that is fused to a transmembrane domain of an unrelated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre et al., 2014</xref>). It reported that Wg is normally expressed in a pattern of well-defined stripes in late L3 discs and more broadly in younger discs, and to reconcile the apparent discrepancy in late L3 discs between the restricted distribution of the membrane-tethered Wg (detected by immunofluorescence) and the broader expression domains of the Wg targets (<italic>frizzled3</italic> and <italic>Distal-less</italic>), it proposed that target genes that are induced in cells at early stages continue to be expressed by descendants of these cells that are not active for Wg signal transduction. Neither study directly examined the temporal dependence of signaling on target gene expression or characterized thresholds for the identified phenotypes.</p><p>Wg and its family of related Wnt proteins have inductive signaling activities in many contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Willert and Nusse, 2012</xref>), and the long-standing assumption has been that it is released into the extracellular aqueous environment in order to travel from producing to target cells. A requirement for cofactors that enhance solubility in vitro and promote long range signaling in vivo is consistent with this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mulligan et al., 2012</xref>). However, the form of Wg that moves between pre- and post-synaptic cells at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction suggests a different mechanism. EM micrographs show that motoneurons secrete Wg in a vesicular form and that postsynaptic cells take up exosome-like vesicles that contain Wg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korkut et al., 2009</xref>). We have previously reported that Dpp and FGF signaling in the ASP is mediated by cytonemes that synapse with signal-producing wing disc cells, and that several genes that are required at neuronal synapses also have essential roles at cytoneme synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). We have also suggested that signaling at neuronal and cytoneme synapses is conceptually and structurally similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>). Although cytoneme synapses that link Wg-producing wing disc cells and myoblasts have not been imaged with EM resolution, the most parsimonious model posits that cytoneme-dependent Wg signaling between disc cells and myoblasts is similar to Wg signaling at the neuromuscular junction and is also vesicle-mediated. The idea is that synaptic transfer and transit in exosome-like vesicles may be universal to Wg signaling. This reasoning has implications for signaling by membrane-tethered Wg.</p><p>The discovery that flies that depend on membrane-tethered Wg are viable and morphologically normal was interpreted as evidence that juxtacrine signaling by the tethered Wg is sufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre et al., 2014</xref>). An alternative possibility is that membrane-tethered Wg localizes to exosome-like vesicles that traffic along cytonemes and activates signal transduction while membrane-bound. Previous studies indicate that Dpp, FGF, EGF, Hh, and Notch may be cytoneme-mediated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsiung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Callejo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Kornberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). The results reported here add Wg to this list and provide evidence that Delta-Notch signaling is cytoneme-dependent. Exchange of signals at synapses may be a universal mechanism of paracrine signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><p>Flies were reared on standard cornmeal and agar medium at 22–25°C, unless otherwise stated. <italic>btl-</italic>Gal4, <italic>btl-</italic>LHG, <italic>lexO-</italic>CD2-GFP, and <italic>UAS-</italic>CD8:GFP were described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>lexO-CD4-GFP</italic><sup><italic>11</italic></sup> and <italic>UAS-CD4-GFP</italic><sup><italic>1–10</italic></sup>, from K Scott; <italic>lexO</italic>-mCherry-CAAX, from K Basler; <italic>UAS-</italic>CD4:IFP2.0-T2A-HO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2014</xref>); <italic>Wg-Cherry</italic> knock-in, from JP Vincent; <italic>UAS-</italic>Notch<sup>DN</sup>, from N Perrimon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>), and <italic>UAS-</italic>Notch<sup>CA</sup>, from E Rulifson; <italic>wg-</italic>Gal4, from T Adachi-Yamada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takemura and Adachi-Yamada, 2011</xref>); <italic>wg-</italic>RNAi (II and III), from the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi Center stock center; Su(H)lacZ, from S Bray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furriols and Bray, 2001</xref>); <italic>1151</italic>-Gal4, from K VijayRaghavan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roy and VijayRaghavan, 1997</xref>); <italic>sal-Gal4, UAS-GFP/CyO; Gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>/TM6b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Immunohistochemistry and microscopy</title><p>Larvae were dissected in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

To quantify Hnt staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig10">Figures 5I, 10J</xref>), the mean intensity of 555 nm fluorescence was measured in an area (containing approximately 20 cells) of the lower layer of the ASP. The value (with background fluorescence subtracted) was normalized with respect to Hnt levels in an area containing approximately 10 cells at the dorsoventral boundary of the wing disc. For each experiment, comparisons were made to control genotypes that were prepared and analyzed together with experimental genotypes in order to control for differences in staining and changes to laser intensity. Statistical significance was calculated by t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Molecular cloning</title><p>The Frizzled coding sequence was amplified from a cDNA clone (from P Adler) with primers: Forward: 5′-TCGAGAATTCCCAAAATGTGGCGTCAAATCC-3′ and Reverse: 5′-CGTCGAATTCAAGACGTACGCCTGCGCC-3′.
