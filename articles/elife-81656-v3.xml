the bone marrow (BM) stroma. However, cellular identities and functions of the different BM stromal elements in humans remain poorly defined. Based on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), we systematically characterized the human non-hematopoietic BM stromal compartment and we investigated stromal cell regulation principles based on the RNA velocity analysis using scVelo and studied the interactions between the human BM stromal cells and hematopoietic cells based on ligand-receptor (LR) expression using CellPhoneDB. scRNAseq led to the identification of six transcriptionally and functionally distinct stromal cell populations. Stromal cell differentiation hierarchy was recapitulated based on RNA velocity analysis and in vitro proliferation capacities and differentiation potentials. Potential key factors that might govern the transition from stem and progenitor cells to fate-committed cells were identified. In situ localization analysis demonstrated that different stromal cells were localized in different niches in the bone marrow. In silico cell-cell communication analysis further predicted that different stromal cell types might regulate hematopoiesis through distinct mechanisms. These findings provide the basis for a comprehensive understanding of the cellular complexity of the human BM microenvironment and the intricate stroma-hematopoiesis crosstalk mechanisms, thus refining our current view on human hematopoietic niche organization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hematopoietic microenvironment</kwd><kwd>human bone marrow</kwd><kwd>stromal stem/progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>differentiation hierarchy</kwd><kwd>hematopoietic-stromal communication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012538</institution-id><institution>Swedish Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20-1163PjF 01H</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheding</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006313</institution-id><institution>Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PR2018-0078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheding</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006313</institution-id><institution>Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PR2021-0065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheding</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swedish Bloodcancer Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheding</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of human bone marrow non-hematopoietic cells provides the basis for a comprehensive understanding of the cellular complexity of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) microenvironment and the intricate stroma-hematopoiesis crosstalk mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone marrow (BM) is the principal site of hematopoiesis in adult humans.

Osteogenic differentiation markers were also expressed but at considerably lower levels compared to adipogenic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, cluster 5 was termed as highly adipocytic gene-expressing progenitors (HAGEPs). Cluster 16 on the other hand, showed similar expression levels of adipogenic and osteogenic markers and was therefore annotated as balanced progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). We observed a gradual increase of more mature osteogenic markers such as RUNX1, CDH11, EBF1, and EBF3 from cluster 5 to cluster 16 and to cluster 38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Accordingly, cluster 38 was denoted as pre-osteoblasts. Clusters 29 and 23 were characterized by prominent expression of osteochondrogenic markers including BGLAP, CHAD, SPP1(OPN), RUNX2, CDH11, CDH2, IBSP (BSP), and SPARC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hence, these two clusters were assigned as osteochondrogenic progenitors (OCs). While both adipogenic and osteogenic marker expression was detected in clusters 6, 37 and 8, they also expressed several hematopoiesis-related markers such as SRGN, CD52, CD37, CD48, and PTPRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and D). Furthermore, S100 genes, which encode a group of calcium-binding cytosolic proteins, were expressed almost exclusively in cluster 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and F</xref>), and the previously reported murine fibroblast markers, S100A4 and S100 A6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Słomnicki and Leśniak, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>) were highly expressed in all three clusters.

RNA velocity analysis predicted that the MSSC cluster has two main developmental directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A’</xref>) with the first originating from MSSCs (cluster 3) and moving towards HAGEPs (cluster 5), followed by OCs (cluster 29) and terminating at the pre-osteoblast cluster (cluster 38). The second main differentiation path, which also originated from MSSCs (cluster 3), was directed towards balanced progenitors and ended at either the pre-osteoblasts or the pre-fibroblasts stage. A small fraction within HAGEPs also showed development potential towards balanced progenitors and pre-osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and A’</xref>). Latent time analysis, which represents the cell’s internal clock and approximates the real time experienced by cells as they differentiate, also identified MSSCs as the root cell population and placed pre-osteoblasts close to the terminal state of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>To provide a more precise approximation of the main differentiation stages, we performed latent time and pseudotime analysis on only those clusters that formed a continuum of cellular differentiation states in UMAP, that is MSSCs, HAGEPs, balanced progenitors, OCs (cluster 29), pre-osteoblasts and one of the pre-fibroblast clusters (cluster 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thereby, disturbances of the data analysis by larger gaps in cellular state transitions between the clusters within the continuum and the outlying OCs (cluster 23) and pre-fibroblasts (clusters 8 and 37) were avoided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The results of these analyses using two different methods which are based on different mathematical algorithms further corroborated our initial conclusion that the MSSC cluster was at the apex of a differentiation hierarchy with downstream differentiation paths into HAGEPs, balanced progenitors, OCs and pre-osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Furthermore, generally high velocity confidences indicated that RNA velocity calculations were reliable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the identification of stromal differentiation directions and hierarchies, scVelo allowed us to detect potential key driver genes that govern cellular state transitions. Using likelihood-based computation, we instructed the program to identify the top 300 genes whose transcriptional dynamics correlated with cellular state transitions along the inferred latent time in the stromal continuum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). A group of genes, including CSTA, B2M, CXCL12, and COL1A2 was found to drive the gradual and subtle cellular state transitions within the MSSC cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Known adipogenic genes such as CEBPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 1991</xref>) together with LEPR, CTSC, LMNA, KLF6, and EGR1 were identified to play important roles in the transition from MSSCs to HAGEPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As exemplified by CEBPD, EGR1, and LMNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>), gene transcriptional activity and expression level gradually increased from the MSSCs to HAGEPs. Furthermore, both novel drivers (NFKBIA, RBM3, TUBA1A, and DDX24), as well as reported genes such as ANXA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Headland et al., 2015</xref>), were identified to serve as critical genes in the transition from HAGEPs to OCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). VCAN expression has been demonstrated to correlate with bone formation in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>). Accordingly, VCAN was identified as one of the crucial genes for the transition from MSSCs to balanced progenitors and even to the pre-osteoblasts. Other potential novel driver genes along this path included CHL1 and TXNIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and NEAT1 and EIF5 (not shown).

Group C cells expressed several surface molecules which are conventionally considered as hematopoietic markers (CD52, CD37, PTPRC, and CD48). Thus, the lack of expression of NCAM1, CD9 and group C-specific antigens could be used to identify group A cells, which could furthermore be separated into different subpopulations based on the differential expression of CD81.</p><p>Based on this, we designed FACS strategies for the isolation of group A (CD45<sup>low/-</sup>CD235a<sup>-</sup>CD71<sup>-</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup>NCAM1<sup>-</sup>CD52<sup>-</sup>), group B (CD45<sup>low/-</sup>CD235a<sup>-</sup>CD71<sup>-</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup>NCAM1<sup>+</sup>CD52<sup>-</sup>) and group C (CD45<sup>low/-</sup>CD235a<sup>-</sup>CD71<sup>-</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup>NCAM1<sup>-</sup>CD52<sup>+</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Group A cells (CD45<sup>low/-</sup>CD235a<sup>-</sup>CD71<sup>-</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup>NCAM1<sup>-</sup>CD52<sup>-</sup>) were further separated into four subpopulations (A1-A4) based on CD81 expression, which corresponded to MSSCs (A1: CD81<sup>++</sup>), HAGEPs (A2: CD81<sup>+</sup>), balanced progenitors (A3: CD81<sup>+/-</sup>), and pre-osteoblasts (A4: CD81<sup>-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Quantitative real-time PCR of sorted cells demonstrated that the expression levels of CD81 in A1 and A2 were higher than A3 and A4, indicating these four phenotypically defined subsets reflected the transcriptionally identified clusters in group A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Functional analysis of sorted cells showed that the MSSC population (A1: CD45<sup>low/-</sup>CD235a<sup>-</sup>CD71<sup>-</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup>NCAM1<sup>-</sup>CD52<sup>-</sup>CD81<sup>++</sup>) had the highest potential to form fibroblastic colonies (colony-forming units, fibroblast: CFU-F) and multi-lineage differentiation capacity toward osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although the CFU-F frequency of HAGEPs (A2: CD45<sup>low/-</sup>CD235a<sup>-</sup>CD71<sup>-</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup>NCAM1<sup>-</sup>CD52<sup>-</sup>CD81<sup>+</sup>) was lower compared to MSSCs, they still gave rise to a significant fraction of colonies and showed full in vitro differentiation capacities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Colony-forming capacities of balanced progenitors (A3: CD45<sup>low/-</sup>CD235a<sup>-</sup>CD71<sup>-</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup>NCAM1<sup>-</sup>CD52<sup>-</sup>CD81<sup>+-</sup>), pre-osteoblasts (A4: CD45<sup>low/-</sup>CD235a<sup>-</sup>CD71<sup>-</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup>NCAM1<sup>-</sup>CD52<sup>-</sup>CD81<sup>-</sup>) and OCs (B: CD45<sup>low/-</sup>CD235a<sup>-</sup>CD71<sup>-</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup>NCAM1<sup>+</sup>CD52<sup>-</sup>) were considerably lower in comparison with MSSCs and HAGEPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Pre-fibroblasts (group C) showed the lowest potential to form fibroblastic colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the adipogenic potential of pre-fibroblasts was markedly reduced and the pre-fibroblast-derived chondrocyte pellets were smaller compared to the other groups while osteogenic differentiation was normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), thus indicating a limited differentiation potential of this population. OCs (group B) demonstrated an enhanced capacity to differentiate towards osteoblasts and chondrocytes, however, at the expense of adipogenic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These findings suggest a skewed differentiation potential of OCs, which is consistent with the lower expression of adipogenic markers and elevated expression of osteochondrogenic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>). The in vitro differentiation capacities of balanced progenitors (A3) and pre-osteoblasts (A4) could not be assayed due to insufficient proliferation upon culture expansion.</p><p>Taken together, the data-driven FACS gating strategy allowed us to isolate distinct stromal subsets for functional investigation. Both MSSCs and HAGEPs demonstrated considerably higher in vitro colony-forming capacities in comparison with balanced progenitors, OCs, pre-osteoblasts, and pre-fibroblasts. While MSSCs and HAGEPs exhibited full multi-differentiation potentials, pre-fibroblasts had only limited differentiation potentials. OCs showed enhanced osteoblastic and chondrogenic differentiation capacities and compromised adipogenic potential, which is consistent with their differentiation marker expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>In-situ localization of stromal cell subpopulations</title><p>Based on the markers identified above, we used CD271 (NGFR), CD81, NCAM1, and CD45 to identify stromal cells (CD271<sup>+</sup>) and to investigate the in-situ localization of MSSCs (CD271<sup>+</sup>CD81<sup>++</sup>) as well as OCs (CD271<sup>+</sup>NCAM1<sup>+</sup>) using bone marrow biopsies from hematologically normal donors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>, CD271-expressing cells were found in perivascular regions, endosteal regions, and throughout the stroma. We observed that perivascular cells surrounding the capillary endothelium and larger vessels primarily expressed CD271 alone. The bone-lining cells proximal to the surface of trabecular bone showed expression of both CD271 and NCAM1, confirming the osteochondrogenic nature of OCs, which correlated very well with the predicted endosteal localizations of murine osteoblasts and chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccin et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to the CD271/NCAM1 double-positive cells, CD271/CD81 double-positive cells were localized in bone marrow stromal regions, including both peri-adipocytic and perivascular regions with a considerable fraction of CD271/CD81 cells being located in close proximity or encircling adipocytes. Co-staining with CD45 confirmed that perivascular, periadipocytic, and bone-lining cells were CD45 negative. The results from the stromal cell in situ localization analysis by scanning microscopy were confirmed by detailed confocal microscopy analysis as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s16">16</xref>. These results thus demonstrated the distinct anatomical localizations of MSSCs and OCs, which confirms and extends our previous findings on differently localized putative hematopoietic niche cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tormin et al., 2011</xref>) and point to possible divergent physiological functions of the different stromal subsets.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>In silico prediction of cell-cell interactions in the human bone marrow microenvironment</title><p>It has been proposed that different niches exist for different types of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

Interestingly, MDK, a neurite growth factor expressed by stromal cells, showed interactions with the HSPCs, lymphoid lineage progenitors (B, T, and NK), and monocytes through LRP1 or SORL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which has thus far only been described in mouse fetal liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, other cytokines known to be important for the maintenance of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPC cells include FLT3-ligand (FLT3LG) and thrombopoietin (THPO). However, whereas expression of FLT3 was detected in several hematopoietic cell types including HSPCs, dendritic cells and monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>), THPO and MPL expression were barely detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Interacting partners of SPP1-expressing OCs were erythroid cells, lymphoid progenitors (B, T, NK progenitors) and CD34-enriched HSPC cluster which expressed SPP1 binding partners such as CD44 and PTGER4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). SPP1-involving integrin alpha 4 beta 1 (a4b1) and alpha 9 beta 1 (a9b1) complexes could also play important roles in the interaction of OCs with a number of hematopoietic cells. Consistent with this, FACS analysis demonstrated that SPP1 expression was higher in OCs in comparison with MSSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Moreover, in situ staining demonstrated that SPP1-expressing cells were exclusively colocalized endosteally with NCAM1<sup>+</sup> OCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), pointing to a localization-specific regulation. Importantly, the CXCL12- and SPP1-mediated stromal cell type-specific interactions detected in our dataset were furthermore confirmed when performing R/L analysis of our stroma cell data with well-defined human BM hematopoietic stem and progenitor clusters obtained from a recently published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sommarin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data demonstrated that the most predominant interactions were CXCL12- and SPP1- mediated interactions for group A/C stromal cells and OCs, respectively, indicating that regulation of hematopoiesis is stromal group and location-specific.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-2"><title>Erythroid cell-specific interactions</title><p>Unlike the majority of the hematopoietic cells in our dataset, the interplay between erythroid cells and group A and C stromal cells was not dependent on CXCL12-involving interactions as indicated by lacking expression of CXCL12 receptors in erythroid clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). CellPhoneDB analysis demonstrated that while group A and C stromal cells had the potential to interact with the erythroid cells through VCAM1-, FN1-, TNC- and PLAUR- involving complexes, the interactions between OCs (group B) and erythroid cells were mainly mediated by SPP1-CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Furthermore, regulation was predicted to be bidirectional, that is stromal cells are regulated by hematopoietic cells through PDGF-, OSM-, and TGFB1-mediated signaling.

Recent landmark studies have illustrated the molecular complexity of the murine BM microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tikhonova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccin et al., 2020</xref>). However, the exact definition of the cell populations that form the BM stroma in humans remains elusive. In this study, based on single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we gained important insights into the stromal components of this important organ including their developmental and functional roles in hematopoiesis.</p><p>Several recent studies using scRNAseq approaches provided the first important insights into the complexity of the human BM and the potential functional roles of BM stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Jong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Triana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). A first overview of the cellular composition of the nonhematopoietic cells in human BM was provided by a recently published single-cell proteo-genomic reference map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Triana et al., 2021</xref>) and a single-cell transcriptomic map of non-hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Jong et al., 2021</xref>). However, due to the low frequencies of the stromal stem/progenitor cells, it has been difficult to investigate the potential heterogeneity of the human BM stromal cell compartment even when employing single cell approaches. Enrichment strategies represent a possible approach for a detailed analysis of the transcriptional diversity of BM stromal cells, as recently reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2021</xref>. However, in their study, CD271<sup>+</sup> cells from femoral shafts from old patients with osteoarthritis and osteoporosis were used, which might not reflect transcriptomic profiles of normal stroma cells from hematologically active bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Because of the extremely low frequency of stromal cells in human BM, we chose a sorting strategy that also included CD45<sup>low</sup> cells to ensure that no stromal cells were excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, we also added sorted CD271<sup>+</sup> cells, which are highly and exclusively enriched for stromal stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tormin et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, despite the expected presence of hematopoietic cells in our dataset, this approach ensured that stromal cell resolution was substantially increased.</p><p>Following exclusion of the hematopoietic clusters, we identified primarily nine stromal clusters which could further be assigned to six stromal cell types, that is MSSCs, HAGEPs, balanced progenitors, OCs, pre-osteoblasts, and pre-fibroblasts. Of note, corresponding murine stromal cell types have been reported for most of these cell types (MSSCs, HAGEPs, OCs, pre-osteoblasts, and pre-fibroblasts), whereas the cluster annotated as balanced progenitors has not been described either in mice or in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tikhonova et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we identified three non-hematopoietic cell clusters which contained KRT5- (cluster 0) and neuronal gene-expressing cells (cluster 39), respectively, as well as endothelial cells. KRT5 is a keratin family member and is widely used as a basal cell marker. However, KRT5 expression has also been reported for several immune cell types, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells and NK cells. As cells in our analysis did not express typical immune cell genes, further characterization of this cluster needs to be performed in future studies. Multiple genes indicating the presence of different cell types were identified in cluster 39. The genes identified with the highest fold changes included several neuronal markers (NEUROD1, CHGB, ELAVL2, ELAVL3, ELAVL4, STMN2, INSM1, ZIC2, NNAT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Due to the heterogeneity of this cell composition, this cluster was therefore annotated as neuronal cell-containing cluster.</p><p>Thus, this analysis allowed us to dissect the human bone marrow non-hematopoietic cell compartment at a thus far unreached molecular level, to resolve the stromal cell heterogeneity and generate a detailed transcriptional fingerprint of distinct stromal populations.</p><p>Furthermore, we were able to define phenotypically and functionally distinct stromal subsets, which were predicted to be organized in a hierarchical manner according to RNA velocity analysis. We identified MSSCs as the most primitive population, which is in accordance with published murine and human stromal stem cell studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wolock et al., 2019</xref>). Pre-fibroblasts, pre-osteoblasts, and OCs were placed downstream of MSSCs in the developmental hierarchy, thus confirming the reliability of the velocity analyses. By using a likelihood-based computation, we also detected potential key driver genes that are candidates to govern the transition between different cellular states. Identified genes included both novel and established transcription factors and certainly, these data provide the basis for future important mechanistic studies of the dynamic processes associated with cellular state transition and fate choices.</p><p>Self-renewing human skeletal stem cells (hSSC) with osteogenic and chondrogenic potential have been previously identified in human fetal and adult bones based on the phenotype PDPN<sup>+</sup>CD146<sup>-</sup>CD73<sup>+</sup>CD164<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2018</xref>). However, the identity of a tri-lineage multipotent stromal progenitor in adult human bone marrow was not reported. Herein, we were able to provide a phenotypical definition that allowed for the faithful identification and prospective isolation of molecularly defined stromal stem and progenitors from hematopoietically active adult bone marrow. These cells have thus far remained incompletely characterized and our data thus complement and extend reported phenotype definitions of MSCs from bone marrow and skeletal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Quirici et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gronthos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sacchetti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delorme et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2018</xref>). The phenotypic MSSCs defined in this study also showed expression of previously reported stromal surface markers such as CD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pinho and Frenette, 2019</xref>) and CD146 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tormin et al., 2011</xref>; data not shown). Besides these surface markers, scRNAseq also identified VCAN as a potentially important stromal gene based on its high expression in stromal clusters. However, as an extracellular matrix protein, FACS analysis of cellular VCAN expression can only be achieved based on its intracellular expression after fixation and permeabilization. Additionally, VCAN is also expressed by monocytes (cluster 36). Therefore, VCAN is not an optimal marker to isolate viable stromal cells.</p><p>Furthermore, we performed a preliminary analysis which indicated possible age- and gender-related stromal differences as also reported for murine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Singh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maryanovich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilar-Navarro et al., 2020</xref>). However, this potentially interesting finding needs to be confirmed by additional experimentation in forthcoming studies.</p><p>In mice, elegant studies using genetic approaches involving in-vivo labelling of cell types and ablation of candidate niche cells and niche factors have provided detailed insight into the functional roles of stromal cells in regulating hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pinho and Frenette, 2019</xref>). Comparable studies in human are impossible to perform and analysis of human stromal cells function has been limited to in-vitro models. We therefore investigated cellular interactions based on ligand-receptor interactions and found a broad and complicated crosstalk network, which is likely to reflect – at least in part – the in-situ situation as data were generated with directly isolated cells. We found that stromal cells generally showed hematopoiesis supporting potential, which is consistent with previously published in-vitro coculture data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2020</xref>) and which we confirmed in co-cultures with BM CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and MSSC- or OC-derived stromal feeder cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Furthermore, whereas all stromal cell groups showed the potential to interact with almost all hematopoietic cells, cell-cell interaction mechanisms differed considerably between different groups of stromal cell groups, that is between group A/C cells which included the MSSCs and group B cells (OCs). Whereas the former demonstrated the potential to interact with hematopoiesis through cytokines such as CXCL12, IL7, KITLG, MDK, and TF as well as adhesion molecules providing direct cell-to-cell contact (e.g. VCAM1), SPP1-mediated interactions were predicted to be the main pathways for the latter. Although we have not formally examined the expression of the receptors for CXCL12 and SPP1 on hematopoietic cells in the current study, expressions of CXCR4 (CXCL12 receptor) and CD44 (SPP1 receptor) on human BM hematopoietic cells has been demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishii et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AbuSamra et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>These results thus indicated that hematopoietic cells were maintained by different stromal populations through diverse but nevertheless stromal cell-specific pathways. Taking furthermore into account that SPP1-expressing OCs were located endosteally and that CD271 single positive stromal cells including MSSCs were localized in the perivascular and stromal regions, respectively, suggested the possibility that different stromal cells provide specialized niches for hematopoietic cells in different locations. Our data thus confirm and extend previous reports describing that endosteal and perivascular niches exist in human BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tormin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinho et al., 2013</xref>), and conceptually support a model where different hematopoietic cell types are differentially regulated by distinct niche milieus which are composed of specific cytokine-producing stromal cells. Finally, in silico ligand-receptor interaction predictions suggested that endothelial cells and stromal cells showed the potential to communicate with hematopoiesis through different mechanisms, which is certainly an interesting finding that needs to be further addressed in future studies.</p><p>In this study, we used human BM aspiration samples in which bone-lining or bone-attaching cells are most likely underrepresented. Our experiments could therefore ideally be complemented by studies on fresh bone marrow biopsy samples from healthy individuals, which however were not available to us, and which might be difficult to acquire because of ethical considerations. In our study, tri-lineage differentiation capacities of stromal clusters were evaluated using standard in-vitro assays, which may not necessarily reflect the bona fide stromal cell potentials. Thus, these data need to be complemented in follow-up studies by in vivo differentiation studies, for example using humanized BM ossicles. The potential key genes that govern the stromal cell fate commitment were predicted using likelihood-based computation and the stroma-hematopoiesis crosstalk mechanisms were inferred based on ligand-receptor interactions. The identified key genes and interactions will need to be validated in future experiments, for example using in vitro engineered human BM models or in vivo humanized BM ossicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dupard et al., 2020</xref>). While the CellPhoneDB analysis predicted the communication networks between stromal and hematopoietic cells, this approach infers potential interactions using transcriptomics data without considering the spatial proximity of the cells and functional relevance of the interaction. A more comprehensive overview of cellular communication is anticipated when combined with spatial localization analysis and functional assays in future studies. Despite these limitations, we believe that our results provide the basis for a better understanding of the cellular complexity of the human BM microenvironment and put a new light on the current concept that specialized niches exist for distinct types of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morrison and Scadden, 2014</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human bone marrow (BM) cells were collected at the Hematology Department, Skåne University Hospital Lund, Sweden, from consenting healthy donors.

bone marrow cells by scRNA-seq, which predicts their potential lineage relationships and possible interactions with mature and immature hematopoietic cells. Transcriptionally-different stromal cell subsets are identified convincingly, and their lineage relationships, cell-cell interactions and possible specialized functions are predicted from in-silico studies, paving the way for future necessary functional validation studies. This resource significantly adds to the current understanding of human non-hematopoietic bone marrow stromal cells and their hematopoietic regulatory functions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81656.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Méndez-Ferrer</surname><given-names>Simón</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/013meh722</institution-id><institution>University of Cambridge</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Strunk</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03z3mg085</institution-id><institution>PMU Salzburg</institution></institution-wrap><country>Austria</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Oostendorp</surname><given-names>Robert AJ</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02kkvpp62</institution-id><institution>Klinikum rechts der Isar der Technischen Universität München</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.01.26.477664">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.26.477664v3">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dirk Strunk (Reviewer #1); Robert A. J. Oostendorp (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Collectively, the reviewers agree that your study is an important scRNAseq resource and appreciate the potential interest of your predictions about different cell populations, their lineage relationships, and how they might interact with hematopoietic cells. While functional validations are outside the scope of this inherently descriptive large dataset and would not allow timely publication, the conclusions regarding cell populations and lineage relationships should be toned down and presented as possible suggestions, pending future validations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide a glossary containing the abbreviations used to facilitate accessibility.</p><p>2) Tone down conclusive statements about predictions, to avoid over-interpretation of the data.</p><p>3) Re-analyze or present some of the data to facilitate viewing of the relevant cell-cell interactions or the cell populations identified using candidate markers (specific comments or guidelines are provided by the reviewers in their review).</p><p>4) Clarify the conflicting results of adipo/osteogenic commitment inferred from transcriptomic and in vitro differentiation studies.</p><p>5) Incorporate textual revisions explained by the reviewers in their detailed comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Please report the frequency/numbers of sorted CD45low/-CDa-/CD271+ cells and their enriched CXCL subfraction if available.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– A glossary with all the different abbreviations would be helpful, as some of them are used prior to their definition/description in the text (for instance MSSC).</p><p>– Several of the statements in this manuscript are about predictions, speculations, or hypotheses, which appear to be over-interpretions of the data. Thus, these statements should be toned down, unless the authors can provide clear experimental evidence confirming these statements.</p><p>– One such statement is in the abstract and mentions specific BM regions &quot;using&quot; CXCL12 or SPP1. This should reformulate, as hard evidence to support this statement is not provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81656.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide a glossary containing the abbreviations used to facilitate accessibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and a list of abbreviations is now provided on page 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Tone down conclusive statements about predictions, to avoid over-interpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. Being aware that we have not provided final experimental proof that validates the potential key drivers of stromal cell fate and the predicted ligand-receptor interactions and functional roles in the current study, we have toned down the corresponding statements as suggested by the reviewer (page 3, lines 11-12; page 18, lines 5-7; page 26, lines 16-21; page 29, lines 18-20; page 31, lines 19-23; page 32, lines 2-5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Re-analyze or present some of the data to facilitate viewing of the relevant cell-cell interactions or the cell populations identified using candidate markers (specific comments or guidelines are provided by the reviewers in their review).</p></disp-quote><p>For the cell-cell interaction analysis, reviewer 2 suggested to re-analyze the data to show the specificity of the interactions. However, as shown in our original Figure 5B-C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, interactions between MSSC/OC with hematopoietic clusters and the CXCL12- and SPP1-mediated stromal cell type-specific interactions were already presented. Therefore and as outlined in detail in the response to the reviewer, we feel that a re-analysis of the data at this point would not further facilitate viewing of the relevant cellcell interactions.</p><p>Reviewer 2 also suggested in the detailed comment that we should describe the possible interactions between non-hematopoietic cells. These interactions were already shown in our original Figure 7A and Figure 5—figure supplement 3B. For the stromal cells, both inter- and intra-stromal interactions were identified to be operative between different stromal subsets as well as within the same stromal cell population (Figure 5—figure supplement 3B). We also analyzed and presented the interaction pattern between endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells (Figure 7A) and a couple of endothelial-specific interactions were detected (SELLSELPLG and ICAM3-aLb2 complex). Therefore, we do not think that additional analysis regarding these interactions is needed.</p><p>With regard to the scRNAseq analysis, reviewer 2 suggested in the detailed comments that we should highlight the expression of CD45, CD235a, and CD271 in different analyses and restrict the analyses accordingly. According to this comment, we have modified the figures which are presented in the new Figure R5. However, because the inclusion of these markers in the figures did not provide substantial novel information and because there is a risk of excluding important stromal cells from the analysis, we chose to not make changes to the original figure (Figure 1D, 2B-F and 4A).</p><p>Please see also our response to the reviewers’ comments for a detailed discussion of these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Clarify the conflicting results of adipo/osteogenic commitment inferred from transcriptomic and in vitro differentiation studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor and the reviewer for this comment. Cluster 5 was initially annotated as “adipo-primed” cluster based on the higher expression of adipogenic differentiation markers as well as a group of stress-related transcription factors (FOS, FOSB, JUNB, EGR1) (Figure 2B-C, Figure 2—figure supplement 1C), some of which had been reported to mark bone marrow adipogenic progenitors<sup>1</sup>. Although at considerably lower levels compared to adipogenic genes, osteogenic genes were also expressed in cluster 5 cells (Figure 2B and D), which indicated a potentially broader differentiation potential of this cluster. As correctly noticed by the reviewers, the initial annotation of this cluster as “adipo-primed progenitors” unfortunately did not reflect this fact correctly. Therefore we have renamed these cells as ‘highly adipocytic gene-expressing progenitors (HAGEPs)” in the revised version of the manuscript. This new name does also more correctly reflect the results from the differentiation studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Incorporate textual revisions explained by the reviewers in their detailed comments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the manuscript according to the reviewers’ comments.
