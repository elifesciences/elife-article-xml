progenitors contribute to the same cell type. During this convergent differentiation, it is unknown if cells ‘remember’ their origins transcriptionally or whether this influences cell behavior. Most coronary blood vessels of the heart develop from two different progenitor sources—the endocardium (Endo) and sinus venosus (SV)—but whether transcriptional or functional differences related to origin are retained is unknown. We addressed this by combining lineage tracing with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in embryonic and adult mouse hearts. Shortly after coronary development begins, capillary endothelial cells (ECs) transcriptionally segregated into two states that retained progenitor-specific gene expression. Later in development, when the coronary vasculature is well established but still remodeling, capillary ECs again segregated into two populations, but transcriptional differences were primarily related to tissue localization rather than lineage. Specifically, ECs in the heart septum expressed genes indicative of increased local hypoxia and decreased blood flow. Adult capillary ECs were more homogeneous with respect to both lineage and location. In agreement, SV- and Endo-derived ECs in adult hearts displayed similar responses to injury. Finally, scRNAseq of developing human coronary vessels indicated that the human heart followed similar principles. Thus, over the course of development, transcriptional heterogeneity in coronary ECs is first influenced by lineage, then by location, until heterogeneity declines in the homeostatic adult heart. These results highlight the plasticity of ECs during development, and the validity of the mouse as a model for human coronary development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>convergent differentiation</kwd><kwd>vascular development</kwd><kwd>heart development</kwd><kwd>human mouse comparison</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL128503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Red-Horse</surname><given-names>Kristy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phansalkar</surname><given-names>Ragini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Biohub</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Funding for sequencing</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Red-Horse</surname><given-names>Kristy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endothelial cells from separate cardiac lineages start off in distinct transcriptional states, but over the course of development converge into transcriptional and functional states which are unrelated to lineage and which are conserved between mouse and human.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During embryonic development, progenitor tissue sources produce new cell types through shifts in epigenetic and transcriptional states. Much research addresses how new cell types form, yet there is less focus on how the transcriptional or chromatin states of progenitor cells relate to gene expression in their descendants, that is, what do mature cells ‘remember’ about their history? This question is particularly intriguing in cases where multiple progenitor sources contribute to the same cell type, since different origins could result in different behaviors or responses to injury and disease. Such lineage merging is referred to as ‘convergent differentiation’ and occurs in hematopoietic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sathe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weinreb et al., 2020</xref>), oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marques et al., 2018</xref>), olfactory projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>), coronary blood vessels of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konstantinides et al., 2018</xref>). Recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analyses have suggested that the resulting cell types can converge transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>), but in some cases maintain molecular signatures of their progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weinreb et al., 2020</xref>). However, there is no information on how convergent differentiation influences coronary blood vessels of the heart or how this might affect cardiac injury responses.</p><p>In this study, we investigated gene expression patterns in two lineage trajectories that form the coronary vasculature in mice and compared these with data from human fetal hearts. The major progenitor sources for coronary endothelial cells (ECs) in mice are the sinus venosus (SV), the venous inflow tract of the developing heart, and the endocardium (Endo), the inner lining of the heart ventricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Red-Horse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su et al., 2018</xref>). ECs begin to migrate from both these sources at embryonic day 11.5. They form an immature capillary plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zeini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Red-Horse et al., 2010</xref>) by populating the heart with vessels from the outside-in (SV) or the inside-out (Endo). These two sources eventually localize to largely complimentary regions in adults: the SV contributes vessels to the outer myocardial wall and the Endo contributes vessels to the inner myocardial wall and the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Red-Horse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). Initial angiogenesis from the SV or Endo is guided by different signaling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Payne et al., 2019</xref>). However, in circumstances where SV angiogenesis is stunted, Endo-derived vasculature can expand into the outer wall to compensate for the vessel loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the well-characterized spatial differences between Endo and SV angiogenesis, there have been no comparisons of transcriptional states between Endo- and SV-derived coronary vessels in development or in adulthood. In addition, there is little information on whether coronary ECs in humans are also derived from these sources, or whether the transcriptional and functional states that human coronary ECs pass through during development match those in the mouse. Understanding any lineage-specific or species-specific traits would have important implications for approaches that reactivate developmental pathways to increase angiogenesis in injured or diseased human hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smart, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Payne et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used scRNAseq of lineage-traced ECs from mouse hearts at various stages of development to show that while SV- and Endo-derived capillary cells initially retained some source-specific gene expression patterns, these differences were only present at an early stage of development. Later, these lineages mixed into two capillary subtypes, which were correlated with different locations in the heart. By adult stages, SV- and Endo-derived capillary cells had converged into similar gene expression patterns, and differing lineage did not result in differential proliferation in response to ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced injury. Finally, scRNAseq on human fetal hearts indicated that human development closely matched that in mice, and provided additional insights into human coronary artery development. Based on our results, we propose a model in which the transcriptional state of non-proliferative coronary ECs is initially influenced by their lineage, then by regional differences in environmental factors, until both of these signatures fade in adulthood. These findings highlight the importance of environmental factors in influencing EC behavior and validate mice as a representative model for human coronary development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ScRNAseq in lineage-labeled coronary ECs</title><p>To compare Endo- and SV-derived ECs during development and in adult hearts, we combined scRNAseq with lineage-specific fluorescent labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

The absence of venous ECs and the higher numbers of SV-enriched cells present at this stage are also consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Red-Horse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su et al., 2018</xref>). Separating plots by sample revealed that Cap2 was exclusively from the SV-enriched sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Consistent with this was its increased expression of <italic>Aplnr</italic> (<italic>Apj</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), which we previously demonstrated to be enriched in SV-derived vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). All but one of the Endo-enriched capillary cells were in Cap1, but Cap1 also contained cells from the SV-enriched sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Although recombination rates in the Endo were very high (Materials and methods), we cannot exclude the possibility that a small number of Endo-derived ECs are <italic>tdTomato</italic>-negative due to some un-recombined Endo ECs. These data show that shortly after coronary development is initiated, lineage is correlated with transcriptionally distinct capillary populations within the immature capillary plexus.</p><p>To test whether this phenomenon persists into late development, we similarly analyzed coronary ECs at e17.5. A larger number of coronary ECs were captured due to the increase in cardiac vasculature by this stage. EC clusters in this sample included two artery (Art1 and Art2), one vein, and two capillary (Cap1 and Cap2) clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). If Cap1 and Cap2 continued to reflect different lineages, we would expect at least one cluster to contain only Endo- or SV-enriched ECs. There was skewed contribution with a higher percentage of Endo-enriched cells in Cap1 and a higher percentage of SV-enriched cells in Cap2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>), but no cluster was lineage exclusive, suggesting that additional factors were driving transcriptional heterogeneity. Veins were much more represented in the SV-enriched sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), which is expected since most veins reside on the surface of the heart and SV angiogenesis progresses outside-in while Endo angiogenesis is in the opposite direction. We also considered the e17.5 dataset with cycling cells included, but with cell cycle effects regressed out, in order to evaluate whether there are differences in proliferation between Endo- and SV-enriched cells, and to rule this out as a cause for the difference in cluster distribution between the two lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). This analysis showed that cycling capillary cells also segregate into the Cap1 and Cap2 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>), and that their distribution into these clusters is biased by lineage, similar to non-cycling cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Additionally, there is no difference in proliferation between Cap1 and Cap2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>).</p><p>We next performed the same analyses on adult coronary ECs. Similar to e17.5, clustering revealed one vein and two artery clusters. It additionally revealed three capillary clusters, Cap1, Cap2 and Cap3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), which were distinguishable by expression of unique gene markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). While Cap1 contained the majority of capillary cells, Cap2 was distinguished by expression of pro-angiogenic genes including <italic>Apln</italic> and <italic>Adm</italic>, and Cap3 was distinguished by expression of interferon-induced genes such as <italic>Ifit3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Both of these clusters have been reported previously in adult hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kalucka et al., 2020</xref>). However, unlike the clusters at earlier stages, there was a similar distribution of cells into each of these clusters in both the Endo- and SV-enriched samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j–k</xref>), and there were no appreciable gene expression differences between the samples. This observation is consistent with another lineage-specific adult scRNAseq dataset we produced with Smart-seq2 (unpublished results). Thus, we concluded that there is no lineage-based heterogeneity in adult coronary ECs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Coronary heterogeneity is first related to lineage and then to location</title><p>We next investigated the genes driving coronary ECs into two capillary cell states at the different stages of development. One hypothesis was that cells retained gene expression patterns from their progenitors. To test this, a list of genes defining the progenitor states (the Endo and SV) was compiled by directly comparing gene expression in the Endo and the SV at e12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and using differentially expressed genes (DEGs) passing significance thresholds described in the Materials and methods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The expression of these genes was then assessed in capillary clusters. At e12, Cap1 cells expressed higher levels of Endo-specific genes, while Cap2 cells expressed higher levels of SV-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Indeed, 40% of Cap1 genes and 3% of Cap2 genes overlapped with the Endo, while 47% of Cap2 genes and 1% of Cap1 genes overlapped with the SV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

There was no clear pattern between e17.5 Cap1 and Cap2 in the expression of SV- and Endo-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and there was little to no overlap between Cap1 and Cap2 differential genes and SV or Endo genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Although it may appear on the heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> that there is a lineage-based distinction in Cap1 for a small subset of the genes at e17.5, this is not the case. As we will demonstrate later in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, the data indicated that these results were primarily due to Cap1 containing septum ECs, which are mostly derived from the Endo, and the septum imparting a location-specific effect on transcription. Furthermore, the minimal overlap between the e12 and e17.5 Cap1- and Cap2-defining genes is consistent with e17.5 coronary ECs not retaining the progenitor-type genes enriched in e12 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Calculating Pearson correlations using Endo and SV genes revealed that e12 coronary ECs were similar to their progenitor sources while e17.5 coronary ECs were much less so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We also calculated Pearson correlations as a function of lineage at e12. As expected, <italic>tdTomato</italic>-positive cells were highly similar to the Endo while <italic>tdTomato</italic>-negative cells in Cap2 were more similar to the SV than to the Endo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>tdTomato</italic>-negative cells in Cap1 were more similar to the Endo than to the SV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This could result from a number of reasons that we cannot currently distinguish including: (1) SV-derived cells migrating close to the Endo take on Endo-type gene expression or (2) there is a rare Endo population that does not express <italic>Bmx</italic>. Point 2 is supported over point 1 due to the observation that Cap2-like cells are present in a previous scRNAseq dataset of SV-derived ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su et al., 2018</xref>), while Cap1 cells are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-E</xref>). In total, these data indicate that e17.5 capillary heterogeneity is not a remnant of the heterogeneity present at e12, and lineage-related differences are not apparent in adults.</p><p>Further analyses provided additional evidence that the differences between e17.5 Cap1 and Cap2 are not primarily due to lineage. With the prediction that significant lineage-related heterogeneity would be accompanied by substantial differences in gene expression, we compared the DEGs between e17.5 Cap1 and Cap2 to the DEGs between Endo- and SV-enriched capillary cells. There were 202 DEGs between e17.5 Cap1 and Cap2, but only 24 DEGs between all Endo-enriched and SV-enriched capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Inspecting DEG identities provided further support that lineage is not retained. Eighteen of the DEGs between all Endo- and SV-enriched cells were also DEGs between Cap1 and Cap2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). If the differential patterns of these genes were due to a lineage effect, we would expect a greater log-fold change in the all Endo- versus SV-enriched comparison than in the Cap1 versus Cap2 comparison. However, 16 of the 18 genes have a greater log-fold change in the Cap1 versus Cap2 comparison (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These data indicate that differential expression between the Endo- and SV-enriched capillaries mostly stems from the differential contribution of the Endo and SV lineages to Cap1 and Cap2.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Differentially expressed genes between all endocardium (Endo)-enriched and all sinus venosus (SV)-enriched

Erg-positive ECs expressing Car4 were located mainly in the right and left ventricle-free walls and dorsal side while ECs in the septum and ventral wall were mostly Car4-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This indicated that Cap1 localizes primarily to the septum and ventral wall and Cap2 to the remaining walls of the ventricle. The <italic>Kcne3</italic> pattern provided further support for this localization because it was specific to Cap1, and in situ hybridization revealed specific septal and ventral expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). <italic>Car4</italic> analysis revealed a further segregation of Cap1 into septum and non-septum regions on the UMAP. Specifically, one side of the Cap1 cluster was almost completely devoid of <italic>Car4</italic> and comprised almost all Endo-enriched cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which are two features specific to the septum as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>. Additionally, these cells have lower expression of <italic>Aplnr</italic> compared to the non-septal cells of Cap1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), which is also characteristic of the septum (unpublished observations). Although unbiased clustering did not distinguish this group of cells as a separate cluster, this could be because we used a combination of gene expression, protein staining, and lineage information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–G</xref>), which the clustering algorithms do not take into account. Interestingly, this proposed septum region is where gene expression indicates both decreased blood flow and local hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the former of which would cause the latter. Thus, the coronary vasculature in the septum (and where the rest of Cap1 localizes) may not receive full blood flow at this late stage in development.</p><p>With the knowledge that half of Cap1 was almost completely represented by Endo-derived cells from the septum, we revisited the issue of lineage-based heterogeneity by manually searching for genes enriched in the proposed septum and analyzing whether they were correlated with lineage. A few of the Endo-specific genes from the heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> were expressed at a higher level in the septum while a few SV-specific genes were expressed at a lower level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). If this is due to retention of lineage information, we would expect to see the Endo-specific genes expressed in higher percentages of Endo-enriched cells compared to SV-enriched cells both inside and outside the septum. However, there was generally a decrease in the expression of these genes in both Endo- and SV-enriched cells outside of the septum, supporting the location, but not the lineage, hypothesis. Only two genes somewhat followed a pattern indicating lineage retention—<italic>Gucy1b3</italic> and <italic>Hand2</italic>— but these differences did not pass our pre-set significance thresholds (Materials and methods) and were expressed in a low percentage of cells (&lt;20% outside the septum) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>We performed additional analysis comparing the number of DEGs between Endo- and SV-enriched cells within different capillary subgroups defined by transcriptional states (i.e. clustering) and in different locations, specifically, the proposed septal and non-septal cells of Cap1 and Cap2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). If lineage was a major contributor to e17.5 heterogeneity, we would expect to see a substantial number of DEGs between Endo- and SV-enriched cells within a specific location. Instead, once the effect of location was removed by only comparing Endo- and SV-enriched cells either inside or outside of the septum, there were only six DEGs between the lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Further supporting the impact of location in transcription, the second largest number of DEGs was between the septum and non-septum cells of Cap1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, although we cannot exclude that a few genes retain lineage information in a small number of cells, the overwhelming evidence of this analysis supports that location has a greater effect on cell state at e17.5, with little to no contribution by lineage.</p><p>To probe whether the septal portion of Cap1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, dotted line) segregates based on cell-autonomous, lineage-specific features of Endo-derived ECs or regional environments, we took advantage of the fact that some Endo-lineage-labeled cells migrate into SV-biased territories during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Cell-autonomous lineage differences would be supported if these cells remained Car4-negative in the ventricular walls. However, the opposite was true. Endo-lineage cells outside the septum were more likely to express Car4 than those in the septum (on average, 23% outside septum versus 4% inside septum) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Endo-derived ECs in SV-biased territories such as the dorsal side of the heart start to express Car4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, arrows), and they can exist in the Cap2 state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, arrow). In addition, the rates of Car4 positivity in both Endo- and SV-enriched ECs correlate similarly with location in the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, the combination of lineage labeling, scRNAseq, and histology allowed us to ascertain that Endo-lineage ECs are biased toward a separate cell state based on their preferential location in hypoxic regions. However, due to the strong association between EC lineage and location, we cannot rule out that some minor degree of lineage-based heterogeneity exists at e17.5.</p><p>Since regional hypoxia would be incompatible with adult heart function, we predicted that the absence of strong heterogeneity in adult capillary ECs could be explained by a resolution of regional environmental differences after development. To test this, we examined <italic>Car4</italic> in the adult dataset, and found that it is broadly expressed in all adult capillary populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Additionally, immunostaining confirmed that septum ECs had become positive for Car4 in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Altogether, our data support the following model—that over the course of development, transcriptional heterogeneity in coronary ECs is first influenced by lineage, then by location, until both lineage- and location-based heterogeneity disappear in the static adult heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Ratio of Erg+ Car4+/Erg+ cells in adult mouse hearts.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"> </th><th align="left" valign="bottom">LV</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Septum</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">heart1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.874</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.853</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">heart2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.864</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.819</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Lineage does not change response to IR injury</title><p>Although Endo- and SV-derived capillary ECs were transcriptionally very similar in normal adult hearts, they could behave differently when challenged with hypoxia or other injury.

Observing overall EdU incorporation revealed the site of injury, which was prominent in the mid-myocardial region between the inner and outer wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Approximately 69% of large arteries (n = 32) identified in the injured regions that we analyzed (as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) contained at least one EdU-positive EC, and there was a significantly higher rate of EdU-positive ECs in the arteries of injured compared to uninjured hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). This observation could be due either to proliferating capillary cells which transitioned into artery cells but retained EdU or to artery ECs which began proliferating in response to the injury.

ScRNAseq was performed using Smart-seq2 on PECAM1-positive ECs sorted from human fetal hearts at 11, 14, and 22 weeks of gestation. In addition, a capillary-specific marker, CD36, allowed for enrichment of PECAM1+ CD36- arterial ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2019</xref>). After initial filtering, 2339 high-quality, high-coverage single EC transcriptomes were obtained, of which 713 were arterial.

Similar to mouse, the data contained one vein and two capillary clusters, but in contrast to mouse, there was an additional arterial cluster for a total of three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). There was approximately equal representation of the clusters in the PECAM1-positive fraction at each gestational age, consistent with the data being from later stages (mouse equivalent of e15.5–18.5)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>) when the developing heart is growing in size rather than producing new coronary cell subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We performed in situ hybridization for <italic>TINAGL1</italic>, a gene which is enriched in human Cap2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This revealed a statistically significant difference in the amount of <italic>TINAGL1</italic> RNA detection between the septum and the heart walls in both an 18-week and a 20-week gestational heart, with the septum having dramatically lower expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>). This difference was especially pronounced between the septum and the right ventricular free wall, similar to the Car4 pattern in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast to mouse Car4, there was no difference in <italic>TINAGL1</italic> detection between the ventral and dorsal walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Thus, in situ hybridization with <italic>TINAGL1</italic> supports a bias in the localization of human Cap1 to the septum and human Cap2 to the ventricular wall. Since lineage data and in situ immunofluorescence confirmed a subset of mouse Cap1 as containing the Endo-derived cells present in the septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), the human expression data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–K</xref> suggested that human Cap1 may also represent an enrichment of septal cells with less blood flow and could also be biased toward the Endo lineage, although the latter cannot be confirmed with gene expression alone. When using the Label Transfer workflow to specifically map the putative mouse septal ECs to the human data, a higher percentage of human Cap1 than Cap2 cells matched to this septal EC group (35% of Cap1 cells versus 14% of Cap2 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We concluded that similar developmental environments and EC states exist between mouse and human capillaries, including those unique to the septum.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Characterization of the capillary-to-artery transition in human coronary ECs</title><p>Because unbiased clustering produced three artery clusters in human but only two in mouse, we next investigated whether human hearts contained an artery cell state not present in mouse. This could occur because mouse and human arteries have some structural differences, for example, large conducting arteries in humans are on the surface rather than within the myocardium as in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wessels and Sedmera, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sorop et al., 2020</xref>). If these differences translated into an artery transcriptional state unique to human, we would expect one of the human artery clusters to not be represented in the mouse mapping. Instead, mouse cells mapped to all three human artery clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). There was also evidence indicating that human Art3 cells were in a less mature arterial state compared to human Art1 and Art2. This is because: (1) Art3 was unique among the human artery clusters in that a high proportion of Art3 cells matched mouse capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). (2) Trajectory analysis with RNA velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">La Manno et al., 2018</xref>), Slingshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Street et al., 2018</xref>), and partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>) indicated a transition from human Art3 -&gt; Art2 -&gt; Art1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). (3) Comparing the fetal dataset with a publicly available adult dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Litviňuková et al., 2020</xref>) showed that almost no adult human artery ECs mapped to Art3, which would be predicted if Art3 were an immature developmental state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The direction of the arterial trajectory was determined by the arrows from the RNA velocity analysis, which provides this directional information as a consequence of comparing spliced (mature) to unspliced (immature) transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">La Manno et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, this trajectory is supported by previous lineage analyses in mouse of a trajectory from capillaries to <italic>Gja5</italic>- arteries to <italic>Gja5</italic>+ arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these data suggest that human hearts do not contain a dramatically unique artery transcriptional state when compared to mouse, but they do have an immature state (Art3) that matures into Art1 and Art2 in adults.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Trajectory analysis of developing human coronary arteries.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reference mapping showed that e17.5 mouse endothelial cells (ECs) from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref> were assigned to all three human artery subsets.

The small percentage of adult human coronary ECs mapping to the fetal Cap1 cluster<bold>,</bold> as well as the spatial overlap between cells mapping to Cap1 and Cap2 in the adult UMAP reduction, indicates that these developmental states related to flow and oxygenation also converge in humans.</p><p>We next performed trajectory analysis to investigate whether arteries develop through the differentiation of capillary ECs, which is the developmental pathway in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Red-Horse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su et al., 2018</xref>).

RNA velocity suggested directionality going from the capillaries into arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These two predicted capillary to artery transitions suggested that Cap1/Art3 and Cap2/Art2 may be differentiation trajectories occurring in two different locations in the heart, that is, septum versus ventricle walls. This is supported by the observation that several genes are specifically co-expressed in Cap1 and Art3 (including <italic>CXCR7</italic>, <italic>MCAM</italic>, and <italic>TNFAIP8L1</italic>, <italic>PGF</italic>) or in Cap2 and Art2 (including <italic>TINAGL1</italic>, <italic>SLC9A3R2</italic>, <italic>SGK1</italic>, <italic>THBD</italic>, <italic>LIMS2</italic>, <italic>CALCRL)</italic>, some of which were shared with mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). From these data, we propose a model where, in both mouse and human, two distinct subtypes of capillary cells at different locations in the developing heart initially produce two subtypes of artery cells, one of which eventually matures into the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Characterization of human artery EC subpopulations</title><p>Since coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death and developmental information could suggest regenerative pathways, we next focused on the gene pathways present in developing human coronary arteries.

Interestingly, the <italic>IRF6</italic> regulon was specific to the most mature population suggesting a potential role in artery maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). All of these regulons were similarly enriched in mouse artery cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). We also identified several genes with strong expression patterns in human artery ECs that were not found in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, these included a GABA receptor, <italic>GABBR2</italic>, which was enriched in Art2, and a Glutamate receptor, <italic>GRIA2</italic>, which was is enriched in Art1.

Although the spatial arrangement of these two lineages in the developing and adult mouse heart has been well characterized, it was previously unknown if either the distinct origin or localization of Endo- and SV-derived cells results in transcriptional or functional differences. Here, we used scRNAseq of lineage-traced ECs to address this question. At e12, when coronary vessels are just beginning to form, ECs transcriptionally segregated into two groups which are correlated with either Endo- or SV-specific expression patterns, and one of which is composed of only SV-lineage cells. However, at e17.5, during a phase of rapid growth and vascular remodeling, ECs segregated primarily based on being localized to either the septum or ventricular walls, the former of which expressed a genetic signature of experiencing low oxygen and blood flow. There was also differential gene expression between the dorsal and ventral walls of the developing heart. This could be due to differences in the timing and degree of their vascularization. We previously showed that coronary vessels are more numerous and provide more coverage on the dorsal side of the heart compared to the ventral side, at least until e15.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Red-Horse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, whatever environmental variables related to blood supply (including flow and hypoxia) distinguish the septum and the dorsal wall at e17.5 likely also cause the differences between the ventral and dorsal walls show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>. In adult hearts, Endo- and SV-derived ECs cannot be distinguished either by gene expression or by their level of proliferation in response to IR injury. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that over the course of embryonic and post-natal development, coronary ECs from separate lineages converge both transcriptionally and functionally.</p><p>This result is relevant to future studies aiming to use developmental pathways to enhance regeneration in adult hearts. For example, it implies that approaches to stimulate regrowth of the vasculature after myocardial injury will affect all cells equally with regard to lineage, and that achieving vascular remodeling in adults may require replicating specific environmental cues and signals (especially those related to hypoxia and flow). The transcriptional similarity of adult Endo- and SV-derived cells helps explain the prior observation that mutant embryos whose coronary vasculature was derived primarily from the Endo due to compensation for loss of SV sprouting grew into phenotypically normal adults despite developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). It also raises additional questions for investigation, namely, how is it that coronary ECs can over time lose the signatures both of their progenitors (between e12 and e17.5) and of their developmental ‘home’ (between e17.5 and adult)? Additional approaches, including ATAC-seq, could aid in addressing this question. The unexpected plasticity of these embryonic cells in their ability to become completely transcriptionally identical represents a potential model for efforts to stimulate faithful differentiation of very specific cell types from induced pluripotent stem cells or non-canonical progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamanaka, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Another outstanding question addressed by this study is the degree of transcriptional similarity between developing mouse and human coronary ECs. Several groups have recently used scRNAseq to profile cell types in the fetal human heart, and identified individual genes that are enriched in either mouse or human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suryawanshi et al., 2020</xref>). Here, our experiments enriched for ECs to enable a high-resolution comparison of this cellular compartment. The data showed that mouse transcriptional clusters specifically enriched in either septal or free wall cells are reproduced in our 11-, 14-, and 22-week human scRNAseq datasets, and many of the defining genes are conserved. Unlike in mouse, there is no apparent difference between ventral and dorsal gene expression patterns, indicating that the timing of vascularization might be more consistent throughout the developing human heart. Furthermore, the observation that adult human capillary ECs almost completely map to developmental Cap2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) indicates that the hypoxic and low flow Cap1 is also resolved in adult human hearts as shown in mice. Although it is not possible to definitively identify the origins of human heart ECs using scRNAseq alone, the presence of similar cell states between mouse and human at these time points, as well as the convergence of adult capillary cells in both, lends confidence to the notion that coronary development generally follows the same progression in these two species.</p><p>Despite overall similarities in cell types, the scRNAseq analysis did reveal some interesting differences in gene expression between mouse and human, some of which may explain the anatomical differences in their vasculature. For instance, human Art1 and Art2 specifically expressed the glutamate receptor <italic>GRIA2</italic> and the GABA receptor <italic>GABBR2</italic>, respectively. It was previously demonstrated that exposure of ECs to GABA in vitro led to a reduction in response to inflammatory stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sen et al., 2016</xref>), and that mutations in brain ECs of a different GABA receptor, <italic>Gabrb3</italic>, resulted in defects in neuronal development in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2018</xref>). These genes were not present in human adult coronary artery ECs. Further investigation may reveal an important role for GABA and glutamate signaling in human coronary development.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that in both mouse and human, phenotypically distinct lineage- and location-based cell states of coronary ECs converge in adults, and that embryonic lineage does not influence injury responses. This is a demonstration of the significant plasticity of the vasculature and the influence environmental factors have in shaping heterogeneity, as well as the strength of mice as a model organism for human heart development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Either early in the day on e12, or midday on e17.5, embryos were removed and placed in cold, sterile PBS. Forty-two Cre+ e12 embryos and 9 Cre+ e17.5 embryos were identified by their fluorescent signal and used for single-cell isolation. Five Cre+ adult males were identified by Cre amplification and used for single-cell isolation. Hearts were isolated and dissected to remove the atria and outflow tract, keeping the ventricles, SV, and valves (e12 and e17.5) or to remove the atria, outflow tract, and valves, keeping the ventricles (adult). Hearts were then dissociated in a 600 μl mix consisting of 500 U/ml collagenase IV (Worthington #LS004186), 1.2 U/ml dispase (Worthington #LS02100), 32 U/ml DNase I (Worthington #LS002007), and sterile DPBS with Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 37 degrees for 45 min and resuspended by pipetting every 5 min. Once digestion was complete, 5 ml of a cold 5% FBS in PBS mixture was added and the suspension was filtered through a 40 µm strainer. After further rinsing the strainer with 5 ml of 5% FBS/PBS, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 400 g at 4°C for 5 min. The cells were washed and resuspended once more in 1 ml 5% FBS/PBS. The following antibodies were added at the concentration of 1:50 and incubated on ice for 45 min: APC/Cy7 Cd45 (Biolegend #103116), APC Pecam1 (Biolegend #102410), APC/Cy7 Ter-119 (Biolegend #116223). DAPI (1.1 μM) was added to the cells immediately before FACS. Once stained, the cells were sorted on a Aria II SORP machine into 1.5 ml tubes. The gates were set up to sort cells with low DAPI, low Cd45 (hematopoietic cells), low Ter119 (erythroid cells), high Pecam1 (endothelial marker), and either high or low PE-Texas Red (<italic>tdTomato</italic> positive or negative). Compensation controls were set up for each single channel (PE-Texas Red, APC, APC/Cy7) before sorting the final cells. The samples were then submitted to the Stanford Genome Sequencing Service Center for 10× single-cell v3.1 3’ library preparation.

Genes were only retained if they had a 1:1 mapping between human and mouse. The raw counts matrix for the human fetal data (all three sages pooled) was then filtered to include only these genes, and only the cells used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, and a new Seurat object was created from this count matrix. Similarly the raw count matrix for the e17.5 mouse data was filtered to include only these genes, and only the cells used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and A</xref>, and a new Seurat object was created from this count matrix. Standard normalization and scaling was performed in Seurat.

The label transfer method employed is described in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>. Briefly, diagonalized canonical correlation analysis is used for dimensionality reduction of both datasets, followed by L2 normalization. Then, a mutual nearest neighbors approach is used to identify pairs of cells (‘anchors’) between the two datasets that represent a similar biological state. Every cell in the query dataset is assigned an anchor in the reference dataset (with an associated anchor score), and the cluster label of the reference cell is assigned to the query cell.</p><p>The major limitation of this method as we applied it is that it is being used to compare datasets from different species that were generated using different methods (Smart-seq2 and 10×) and different sequencing depths. These differences as well as limitations associated with these methods impact the accuracy of the label transfer. For example, most of the mouse vein cells match to human Cap2 rather than human veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>), likely because there are so few human vein cells while cells in the larger Cap2 population have a larger local neighborhood to strengthen their anchor score. In addition, the matching is limited to the clusters that are pre-annotated in each dataset (i.e., each human cell will match to its closest mouse cluster, even if there is not a true biological correlate). Finally, genes used in the mapping were limited to those that had a 1:1 homology mapping between mouse and human, meaning that some information was eliminated before label transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>Trajectory analysis</title><p>Trajectory analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref> and were performed with PAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>) (filtered for edge weight greater than or equal to 0.14), RNA velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">La Manno et al., 2018</xref>) (using the python function <italic>veloctyto run-smartseq2</italic>, followed by the R package velocyto.R with the function <italic>show.velocity.on.embedding.cor</italic> with fit.quantile = 0.05, grid.n = 20, scale = ‘sqrt’, arrow.scale = 3, and n = 50–100), and Slingshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Street et al., 2018</xref>) (using the <italic>slingshot</italic> function with Cap2 as the starting cluster and stretch = 1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Transcription factor enrichment</title><p>Transcription factor enrichment was performed with SCENIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>) using the <italic>pyscenic</italic> functions and the recommended pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van de Sande et al., 2020</xref>).

additional analyses and extensive revisions. By employing scRNA-seq analyses, they elegantly have dissected the endothelial cell (EC) heterogeneity of cardiac blood vessels across development in mouse and human. They convincingly demonstrate that the EC heterogeneities of cardiac blood vessels are sequentially governed by the progenitor sources and environmental cues during initial and late development. Moreover, they show that these ECs become homogeneous in adult. They also claim that human fetal hearts take on generally a similar path for establishment of cardiac blood vessels.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Gou Young Koh as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Edward Morrisey as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Victoria L Bautch (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In the light of the comments made by the reviewers, we decided to offer a &quot;revision&quot; prior to publishing your manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The comments of all three reviewers are in good agreement. While the reviewers found this study is novel and interesting, they raised concerns about the immature interpretations by under-clustering or superficial clustering in the substantial parts of sc-RNA data. The authors are required to carefully address the comments point-by-point in a data-driven manner or with further analyses or discussions. Specifically, the authors are encouraged to pay attention to the major comments 1-3 of reviewer 1 and comments 1-3 of reviewer 3. If necessary, please provide the reasons for not implementing the suggested changes.</p><p>I believe the authors could revise the manuscript successfully given their expertise, but please let us know if it will take more than 3 months.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The resolution of clustering of e17.5 dataset is ambiguous. It seems there are significant differences between septal and non-septal Cap1 ECs, but it is unclear why they were clustered into a single Cap1 cluster. Likewise, it seems there is a significant lineage-based distinction within Cap1 ECs in the heatmap (Figure 2a), all of which could be caused by under-clustering. Please provide an adequate rationale for the cluster identification on the e17.5 dataset.</p><p>2. The results shown in Figure S9 and Figure 3c-e and the interpretations in line 247-267 are insufficient to support the author's claim regarding the source of heterogeneity in e17.5 Caps. Authors need to provide more definitive evidence to exclude possible lineage-based contribution for heterogeneity in the e17.5 caps.</p><p>3. In Figure 1i-k, authors claim that Cap ECs of adult heart are relatively homogeneous. If so, how were they identified as distinct clusters? On the other hand, analysis of a previous study (Kalucka et al., Cell 2020) showed clear distinction between Cap1 and Cap2. Please describe the procedures for cluster identification in detail and explain the discrepancies between two datasets.</p><p>4. The authors are required to describe in detail about the label transfer method and its limitations to follow up. It was employed for the comparison of human and mouse datasets, but this method could raise a biased characterization of the cell types. Therefore, the authors are strongly recommended to confirm the EC heterogeneity in human fetal hearts by IHC or ISH.</p><p>5. The inference of developmental pathway using the trajectory analysis is not straightforward. In Figure 6b, the trajectory analysis predicts development from Art3 to Art2 and Art1, which does not match with their localizations as shown in Figure 7f-g. Authors need to describe how they made the direction of the flow in the trajectory analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this is a very rigorous and complete study of the expression and functional potential of the two lineages that contribute to coronary EC. The range of the work is impressive, with scRNA seq data complemented by spatial localization and injury model, and by cross-referencing with new human scRNA seq datasets. Good use was made of publicly available datasets as well. The conclusion that coronary EC have transcriptional profiles that reflect location rather than original source is well-supported, as is the finding that they do not appear to have functional differences in response to injury. The data analysis of regulons is interesting; it would also be interesting to consider whether there might be an epigenetic memory of lineage source – perhaps this could be part of the discussion, now that the initial gene expression lineage differences are so well-documented in this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors claim is well supported by their data. scRNAseq and histological examination clearly support their idea &quot;convergent differentiation&quot; of coronary ECs, although the results shown in the present study are descriptive. There are several points that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>1. According to the previous reports by several groups including the authors' group, the SV-derived cells and the Endo-derived cells contribute to the vessels in the outer myocardial wall and inner myocardial wall. Now it is striking difference of the gene expression of ECs between ventral and dorsal wall of myocardium (Figure 3). Neither blood flow nor ischemia might not account for this regional difference at e17.5. If possible, the authors are encouraged to explain or discuss the difference of dorsal and ventral wall, although both are outer layer of myocardium.</p><p>2. To compare the gene expression of ECs between mouse and human, the authors used the Seurat label Transfer workflow to reference map each human cell to its closest mouse cluster (Figure 5e-g). Indeed, human Cap1 might be a cluster enriched of septal cells with less blood flow. Therefore, the authors claim that similar environment (ischemia and flow) between mouse and human contributes to clustering of coronary ECs.</p><p>Given the methods described for human heart sections (line 707-711), human tissues are available for examining expression of genes listed in Figure S10c or 10d as that of mice (Kcne3) was examined in Figure 3f. Histological examination of gene or protein expression using human hearts to investigate where genes liste in Figure S10 would support the authors' claim.</p><p>3. Related to 1 and 2, the distinct gene expression between inner and outer myocardial wall and between dorsal and ventral wall found in mouse hearts could be examined by immunohistochemical or in situ hybridization analyses using human embryonic hearts.

It seems there are significant differences between septal and non-septal Cap1 ECs, but it is unclear why they were clustered into a single Cap1 cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is best to have a standardized and clear rationale for choosing clustering resolution. We therefore reanalyzed all data choosing a standard criteria aimed at guarding against over-clustering into biologically less meaningful groups. Specifically, we increased the resolution until the additional clusters emerging no longer expressed unique genes, but instead separated out merely due to small differences in the levels of a few genes. For instance, when comparing expression patterns of top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between e17.5 Cap1 and Cap2 derived from a resolution of 0.4 to the DEGs between additional clusters that emerged at higher resolution (0.5 and above), we observe a shift from distinctive expression differences to gradients of expression (Author response image a). Note that re-analyzing with this criteria did not change our original clustering. We clarified our use of this criterion for selecting resolution at page 10, lines 131-132 in the text and page 59, lines 686-688 in the <italic>Methods</italic>.</p><p>To address the specific comment on Cap1 not separating into two clusters at resolution 0.4 due to low resolution clustering, we observed clusters in 7 additional resolutions up to 1.1. In all cases, no clusters overlapping the gene expression patterns we proposed were septum vs. non-septum emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) . We do not know why the clustering algorithms do not pull out the septal cluster, but it could be because we used a combination of gene expression, protein staining, and lineage information, (Figure 3b-f, Figure 3—figure supplement 2), which the clustering algorithms do not take into account.

Please provide an adequate rationale for the cluster identification on the e17.5 dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there does look like a lineage distinction on the heatmap in Cap1. However, examining these genes on the UMAP revealed that this was because Cap1 happened to contain the septum cells, which are mostly from the Endo (Chen et al., 2014) (Figure 3c), and the data in subsequent analyses (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) indicated that the septum imparts a location-specific effect on transcription. Thus, what looks like a lineage difference on the heatmap on further inspection was actually a difference of location because most septal cells are from the endocardium.</p><p>The key to concluding that the septal gene expression patterns were due to location rather than lineage was that the Endo cells outside the septum tended to downregulate these genes and the SV cells inside the septum upregulated them. To demonstrate this point, we revised Figure 3—figure supplement 2 to show gene expression plots of selected Endo-specific genes from Figure 2a split into Endo- and SV-derived samples. We quantified the percentage of cells expressing these genes in: 1. Endo-derived cells in the septum, 2. SV-derived cells in the septum, 3. Endo-derived cells outside the septum, and 4. SV-derived cells outside the septum (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 2b). If the expression of these genes was primarily influenced by lineage, we would expect to see them in high percentages of Endo-derived cells both inside and outside the septum. Conversely, if expression was primarily influenced by location, we would expect to see them in high percentages of both Endo- and SV-derived cells in the septum, but lower outside the septum. For example see .<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref></p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70246-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The overriding patterns of the genes appearing enriched in Cap1 Endo-CVs in Figure 2a were: 1. None of the genes were expressed in high enough percentages to pass our significance threshold (between 0-35% of cells), and 2. There was a decreased expression in Endo- <italic>and</italic> SV-derived cells outside of the septum, supporting the location hypothesis (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 2b). Only two genes had a pattern reminiscent of a predicted lineage effect—<italic>Gucy1b3</italic> and <italic>Hand2</italic>— (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 2b) but they were expressed in such a low percentage of cells. We therefore concluded that our data supported a model where there was a heavy influence of location, but a potentially minor retention of two genes from the progenitor state in a small subset of cells. We noted this in the text at pages 27-29, lines 274-283.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The results shown in Figure S9 and Figure 3c-e and the interpretations in line 247-267 are insufficient to support the author's claim regarding the source of heterogeneity in e17.5 Caps. Authors need to provide more definitive evidence to exclude possible lineage-based contribution for heterogeneity in the e17.5 caps.</p></disp-quote><p>At the onset of our study, we predicted that if lineage information was retained in developing CVs, it would be a source of transcriptional heterogeneity and result in cell clustering that correlated with lineage or a retention of a significant number of lineage-specific genes. We observed this pattern at e12. However, our data led us to conclude that location, and not lineage, is the predominant source of heterogeneity in e17.5 capillaries because: (1) The differences between Cap1 and Cap2 are the major axis of heterogeneity based on unbiased clustering, and these two clusters contain many cells of both lineages, and (2) The Cap2 marker, <italic>Car4</italic>, localized Cap1 and Cap2 to distinct regions of the heart, but was expressed to a similar degree in Endo- and SV-derived cells at any particular location. We included a clearer, less complicated presentation of this second point in revised Figure 3e (the original panel from Figure 3e was moved to Figure 3—figure supplement 1b). Our understanding is that the reviewer suggests more data beyond these results, which we included and which are described below.</p><p>We performed additional analyses with the prediction that significant lineage-related heterogeneity would be accompanied by a substantial number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We compared the number of DEGs between Endo- and SV-enriched cells within different capillary sub-groups defined by either transcriptional states (i.e. clustering) or in different spatial locations, specifically, the proposed septal and non-septal cells of Cap1 and Cap2 (revised Figure 2g). If lineage was a major contributor to e17.5 heterogeneity, we would expect to see a substantial number of DEGs between Endo- and SV-enriched cells within a specific location. Instead, the results showed that the largest distinction is by far between Cap1 and Cap2 (202 DEGs) while comparing all Endo- vs. SV-derived cells identified only 24 DEGs. Importantly, once the effect of location was removed by only comparing Endo- and SV-enriched cells either inside or outside of the septum, there were only 6 DEGs between the lineages. Further supporting the impact of location on transcription, the second largest number of DEGs was between the septum and non-septum cells of Cap1, regardless of lineage. This is discussed in the text (page 29, lines 285-296).</p><p>Inspecting the DEG identities provided further support for the conclusion that Cap1 and Cap2 do not represent lineage-based heterogeneity. There are 202 DEGs between e17.5 Cap1 and Cap2 as compared to 24 DEGs between all e17.5 Endo- and SV-enriched capillaries. The latter genes are shown in revised Table 2.18 of these genes are also DEGs between Cap1 and Cap2. If the differential patterns of these genes were due to a lineage effect, we would expect them to have a greater log-fold change in the comparison between Endo and SV than in the comparison between Cap1 and Cap2. However, 16 of the 18 genes have a greater log fold change between Cap1 and Cap2 than between Endo- and SV-enriched (Table 2). This indicates that differential expression between the Endo- and SV-enriched capillaries mostly stems from the differential contribution of the Endo and SV lineages to Cap1 and Cap2. This observation was added to the text at pages 20-23, lines 221-233.</p><p>In total, we concluded that our analyses provided strong support that location is the predominant source of heterogeneity at e17.5. However, it does not ex­clude the possibility that there is a very small amount of lineage-based heterogeneity, born out in a small number of genes in a small number of cells that are not enough to contribute statistically significant effects on transcription. Therefore, we have changed the text throughout the paper to indicate this point and that we do not rule out that some minor degree of lineage-based heterogeneity exists at e17.5 (page 30, lines 309-311). We also discuss in the text that other experimental methods, such as ATACseq could reveal differences not detectable with scRNAseq (page 48, lines 517-518).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 1i-k, authors claim that Cap ECs of adult heart are relatively homogeneous. If so, how were they identified as distinct clusters? On the other hand, analysis of a previous study (Kalucka et al., Cell 2020) showed clear distinction between Cap1 and Cap2. Please describe the procedures for cluster identification in detail and explain the discrepancies between two datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>Since our adult dataset was processed using Smart-seq2 with greater sequencing depth but far fewer cells, which could have led to the discrepancies mentioned by the reviewer, we decided to sequence another <italic>Bmx<sup>CreER</sup></italic>-lineage labeled adult dataset with many more cells using the 10X platform. Details are described below, but the main take away is that our conclusions remains the same—there is no transcriptional indication of lineage-based heterogeneity in adult ECs. To shorten the paper and avoid extraneous figures, we removed both the Smartseq2 data and our re-analysis of Kalucka et al., data (original Figure S5) from the re-submission, leaving only the new 10X data and a mention in the text regarding other datasets supporting our same findings on lineage (pages 12-15, lines 177-178).</p><p>The new 10x dataset contains ECs from <italic>Bmx<sup>CreER</sup></italic> lineage-labeled adult mice (revised Figure 1i-k, Figure 1—figure supplement 1e, Figure 1—figure supplement 3c, Figure 1—figure supplement 5a, Figure 3h). Using the above-described criteria to set cluster resolution (major comment 1.1), this dataset revealed 3 clusters of capillary cells, one major cluster and two smaller clusters—one being marked by <italic>Apln</italic> and the other with interferon response genes, both of which were detected in Kalucka et al., (revised Figure 1i-k and Figure 1—figure supplement 5a). However, there was a similar distribution of cells into each of these clusters in both the Endo- and SV-enriched samples (Figure 1j-k), consistent with a convergence of EC lineages in the adult heart. This demonstrates that while some heterogeneity still exists among adult capillary cells, the cells from the Endo and SV lineages are transcriptionally equivalent. We have added these new results to the text at page 12, lines 168-177 and changed the wording throughout the text to indicate that while there is no heterogeneity between adult ECs from separate lineages, there is overall still heterogeneity among ECs in adult hearts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors are required to describe in detail about the label transfer method and its limitations to follow up. It was employed for the comparison of human and mouse datasets, but this method could raise a biased characterization of the cell types. Therefore, the authors are strongly recommended to confirm the EC heterogeneity in human fetal hearts by IHC or ISH.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion to validate the EC heterogeneity seen in the human fetal heart and investigate whether this heterogeneity is correlated with location, as it is in the mouse. To examine whether human Cap1 and Cap2 represent cells in different locations, we performed in situ hybridization for <italic>TINAGL1</italic>, a gene which is enriched in human Cap2 (revised Figure 5i). This revealed a statistically significant difference in the amount of <italic>TINAGL1</italic> RNA detection between the septum and the heart walls in both an 18 week and a 20 week gestational heart, with the septum having dramatically lower expression (revised Figure 5j-k). This difference was especially pronounced between the septum and the right ventricular free wall, similar to the Car4 pattern in mouse (Figure 3e and Figure 3—figure supplement 1b). Thus, in situ hybridization with <italic>TINAGL1</italic> supports a bias in the localization of human Cap1 to the septum and human Cap2 to the ventricular wall. This data in combination with the shared transcriptional patterns between mouse and human, especially in the expression of hypoxia-induced genes (Figure 5f-h and Figure 1—figure supplement 1d), allowed us to conclude that the location-based transcriptional effects present during mouse development are likely also present during human development. These results were added to the text at page 40, lines 388-398.</p><p>In regards to describing the label transfer method, it is described in detail by Stuart et al., (Stuart et al., 2019). Briefly, diagonalized canonical correlation analysis is used for dimensionality reduction of both datasets, followed by L2 normalization. Then, a mutual nearest neighbors approach is used to identify pairs of cells (“anchors”) between the two datasets that represent a similar biological state. Every cell in the query dataset is assigned an anchor in the reference dataset (with an associated anchor score), and the cluster label of the reference cell is assigned to the query cell.</p><p>The major limitation of this method as we applied it is that it compares datasets from different species that were generated using different methods (Smart-seq2 and 10x) and different sequencing depths. These differences, as well as limitations associated with these methods, impact accuracy. For example, most of the mouse vein cells match to human Cap2 rather than human veins (Figure 5g), likely because there are so few human vein cells while cells in the larger Cap2 population have a larger local neighborhood to strengthen their anchor score. In addition, the matching is limited to the clusters that are pre-annotated in each dataset (i.e., each human cell will match to its closest mouse cluster, even if there is not a true biological correlate). Finally, genes used in the mapping were limited to those that had a 1:1 homology mapping between mouse and human, meaning that some information was eliminated before label transfer. Despite these limitations, we provided evidence strengthening the correspondence between the human and mouse capillary clusters by: 1. the observation of shared patterns of gene expression (Figure 5h and Figure 5—figure supplement 1d) and 2. In situ validation of select genes (Figure 3b-g and 5i-k). Description of the method and its limitations are discussed in the <italic>Methods</italic> at pages 61-62, lines 732-750.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The inference of developmental pathway using the trajectory analysis is not straightforward. In Figure 6b, the trajectory analysis predicts development from Art3 to Art2 and Art1, which does not match with their localizations as shown in Figure 7f-g. Authors need to describe how they made the direction of the flow in the trajectory analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>The direction of the arterial trajectory was determined by the arrows from the RNA velocity analysis, which provides this directional information as a consequence of comparing spliced (mature) to unspliced (immature) transcripts (La Manno et al., 2018). Additionally, this trajectory is supported by previous lineage analyses in mouse of a trajectory from capillaries to <italic>Gja5</italic>- arteries to <italic>Gja5</italic>+ arteries (Su et al., 2018). This trajectory is also consistent with the localization showed in Figure 7f-g, which shows that <italic>GJA5</italic>+ arteries in human are larger and more proximal than <italic>GJA5</italic>- arteries, as they are in mice. Finally, the interpretation of Art3 being a less mature artery population is supported by its disappearance in the adult human (Figure 6c). Two explanations for this are that: (1) less mature artery cells coalesce or migrate into larger arteries and take on a more mature phenotype, or (2) vessels composed of less mature artery cells stay the same size but eventually get exposed to more flow or some other factors which induces maturation. A more clear explanation is now included at page 41, lines 426-430 and page 44, lines 479-481.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors claim is well supported by their data. scRNAseq and histological examination clearly support their idea &quot;convergent differentiation&quot; of coronary ECs, although the results shown in the present study are descriptive. There are several points that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>1. According to the previous reports by several groups including the authors' group, the SV-derived cells and the Endo-derived cells contribute to the vessels in the outer myocardial wall and inner myocardial wall. Now it is striking difference of the gene expression of ECs between ventral and dorsal wall of myocardium (Figure 3). Neither blood flow nor ischemia might not account for this regional difference at e17.5. If possible, the authors are encouraged to explain or discuss the difference of dorsal and ventral wall, although both are outer layer of myocardium.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous reports by our lab and Dr. Bin Zhou at the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology reveal a slightly more nuanced picture that just outer and inner myocardial wall distinction. First, there is an invasion of ECs into the dorsal wall derived from the SV. Then, the Endo invades the septum to produce vessels that subsequently migrate heavily towards the ventral wall. Thus, during development, there is a large lineage distinction between the dorsal and ventral sides (even though there is some mixing, Tian et al., 2015). After birth, these two sources expand in a way that leads to a final contribution where SV-derived vessels are skewed to the outer wall while Endo-derived vessels are skewed to the inner wall around the entire heart, although there are some differences in the extent of skewing at different locations.</p><p>We hypothesize that blood flow could account for differences between the dorsal and ventral walls because of the timing and degree of vascularization that occurs during development, particularly since the precise timing of Endo-derived vessels integrating into the patent coronary circulation has not been formally demonstrated. As described above, we previously showed that SV-derived coronary vessels are more numerous and provide more coverage on the dorsal side of the heart compared to the ventral side at least until e15.5 (Red-Horse et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2014). Therefore, whatever environmental variables related to blood supply (including flow and hypoxia) distinguish the septum and the dorsal wall at e17.5 likely also cause the differences between the ventral and dorsal walls show in Figure 3d-g. At this stage in development, the anatomic similarity of both dorsal and ventral being outer myocardium during development may be less significant physiologically than the timing and degree of their vascularization. This interpretation was added to the text at page 47, lines 494-501.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To compare the gene expression of ECs between mouse and human, the authors used the Seurat label Transfer workflow to reference map each human cell to its closest mouse cluster (Figure 5e-g). Indeed, human Cap1 might be a cluster enriched of septal cells with less blood flow. Therefore, the authors claim that similar environment (ischemia and flow) between mouse and human contributes to clustering of coronary ECs.</p><p>Given the methods described for human heart sections (line 707-711), human tissues are available for examining expression of genes listed in Figure S10c or 10d as that of mice (Kcne3) was examined in Figure 3f. Histological examination of gene or protein expression using human hearts to investigate where genes liste in Figure S10 would support the authors' claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion to validate the EC heterogeneity seen in the human fetal heart and investigate whether this heterogeneity is correlated with location, as it is in the mouse.

These results were added to the text at page 40, lines 388-398.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Related to 1 and 2, the distinct gene expression between inner and outer myocardial wall and between dorsal and ventral wall found in mouse hearts could be examined by immunohistochemical or in situ hybridization analyses using human embryonic hearts. These experiments strengthen the conclusion of comparable &quot;convergent differentiation of coronary Cap ECs&quot; between mouse and human.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we observed the expression of <italic>TINAGL1</italic>, a marker gene distinguishing human capillary clusters, in different regions of the human fetal heart. In contrast to mouse Car4, there was no difference in <italic>TINAGL1</italic> detection between the ventral and dorsal walls at 18 and 20 weeks (Figure 5k). One possible explanation for this is that the ventral and dorsal walls in human have similar environmental conditions at this stage, and thus a similar distribution of cells in the Cap1 and Cap2 state. Since the dorsal-ventral differences in mouse are likely due to the mismatched timelines of angiogenesis from the, SV and Endo, the lack of an apparent difference between ventral and dorsal gene expression patterns in human could indicate that the timing of vascularization is more consistent throughout the developing human heart. This interpretation was added to the text at page 48, lines 530-533.</p></body></sub-article></article>
