associative synaptic plasticity often results in impaired rather than enhanced learning. Previously, we proposed that such learning impairments can result from saturation of the plasticity mechanism (Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017), or, more generally, from a history-dependent change in the threshold for plasticity. This hypothesis was based on experimental results from mice lacking two class I major histocompatibility molecules, MHCI H2-K<sup>b</sup> and H2-D<sup>b</sup> (MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup>), which have enhanced associative long-term depression at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum (PF-Purkinje cell LTD). Here, we extend this work by testing predictions of the threshold metaplasticity hypothesis in a second mouse line with enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD, the <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Mice lacking <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene expression in cerebellar Purkinje cells (L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO) were selectively impaired on two oculomotor learning tasks in which PF-Purkinje cell LTD has been implicated, with no impairment on LTD-independent oculomotor learning tasks. Consistent with the threshold metaplasticity hypothesis, behavioral pre-training designed to reverse LTD at the PF-Purkinje cell synapses eliminated the oculomotor learning deficit in the L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, as previously reported in MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup>mice. In addition, diazepam treatment to suppress neural activity and thereby limit the induction of associative LTD during the pre-training period also eliminated the learning deficits in L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. These results support the hypothesis that cerebellar LTD-dependent learning is governed by an experience-dependent sliding threshold for plasticity. An increased threshold for LTD in response to elevated neural activity would tend to oppose firing rate stability, but could serve to stabilize synaptic weights and recently acquired memories. The metaplasticity perspective could inform the development of new clinical approaches for addressing learning impairments in autism and other disorders of the nervous system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metaplasticity</kwd><kwd>LTD</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cells</kwd><kwd>Fragile X syndrome</kwd><kwd>associative plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC004154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS072406</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>543031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005492</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dean's Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shakhawat</surname><given-names>Amin MD</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY031972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The capacity for new cerebellum-dependent learning is influenced by the recent history of neural activity in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome, suggesting a role for metaplasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since its discovery, long-term synaptic plasticity has been of great interest to neuroscientists as a therapeutic target for brain disorders, especially disorders affecting learning and memory. Scientific and technological advances have provided an array of tools for enhancing synaptic plasticity. In some cases, experimental manipulations that augment plasticity have succeeded in augmenting learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van Praag et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee and Silva, 2009</xref>). However, in many cases, manipulations that augment plasticity have impaired learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Migaud et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Uetani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rutten et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Navakkode et al., 2022</xref>). Surprisingly, there have been few attempts to reconcile these conflicting findings with a mechanistic explanation for why enhancing synaptic plasticity can have opposite effects on learning. Such mechanistic insight about how enhanced synaptic plasticity functions in vivo could facilitate the development of this approach as a viable clinical intervention for learning disorders, recovery from stroke or brain injury, dementia, addiction, and other neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p><p>Recently, we proposed a testable hypothesis about what can go wrong with augmented plasticity in vivo, based on experimental and theoretical analysis of learning in mice with enhanced associative synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017</xref>). Associative LTD at the cerebellar PF-Purkinje cell synapses (PF-Purkinje cell LTD) has been implicated in certain cerebellum-dependent learning tasks and not others, based in part on the observation of selective learning impairments in mouse lines with impaired PF-Purkinje cell LTD (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raymond and Medina, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Zeeuw et al., 2021</xref>). Initially, we expected that mice with enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD would exhibit the exact opposite behavioral phenotype as mice with impaired PF-Purkinje LTD, that is, enhancement of learning on the same behavioral tasks in which mice with impaired PF-Purkinje cell LTD exhibit impaired learning. Contrary to this expectation, double knockout of the major histocompatibility class I molecules MHCI H2-K<sup>b</sup> and H2-D<sup>b</sup> (MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup>), which enhances PF-Purkinje cell LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McConnell et al., 2009</xref>), results in the very same, specific oculomotor learning impairment as observed in mice with impaired PF-Purkinje cell LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017</xref>). To explain the puzzling observation that the enhancement of a plasticity mechanism could yield the same behavioral phenotype as its impairment, we hypothesized that enhanced LTD prevents learning by allowing spontaneous activity in the circuit to aberrantly recruit and saturate this form of plasticity, making it unavailable at the specific synapses where it is needed to support learning. Two key predictions of this hypothesis were confirmed experimentally by previous work: optogenetic stimulation of the circuit designed to induce PF-Purkinje cell LTD before training recapitulated in WT mice the same, specific oculomotor learning deficit observed in the MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup> mice with enhanced LTD; and a behavioral manipulation designed to reverse PF-Purkinje cell LTD before oculomotor training reversed the learning deficit in MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we further tested the hypothesis that the enhancement of PF-Purkinje cell LTD can result in its aberrant recruitment by ongoing neural activity and consequent increased threshold for its induction and reduced availability to support learning. First, we replicated key behavioral findings in a different line of mice with enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD. Purkinje cell-specific knock out of the Fragile X gene <italic>Fmr1</italic> enhances PF-Purkinje cell LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koekkoek et al., 2005</xref>). We show that these L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice are selectively impaired on LTD-dependent oculomotor learning tasks, and that their learning deficit can be reversed with behavioral pre-training designed to reverse PF-Purkinje cell LTD, as previously reported in the MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup> mice with enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD. We then test a new prediction about a pharmacological treatment to reverse the learning deficit in mice with enhanced associative synaptic plasticity. The experimental results support and extend the influential concept of a history-dependent sliding threshold for synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bienenstock et al., 1982</xref>) as a regulator of learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selective learning impairment in mice with enhanced associative long-term depression in the cerebellum</title><p>We assessed oculomotor learning in mice lacking expression of the Fragile X gene <italic>Fmr1</italic> in cerebellar Purkinje cells, which have been shown to have enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koekkoek et al., 2005</xref>).

We tested the ability of these L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice to adaptively modify their eye movement responses to vestibular and visual stimuli, and compared their performance on different oculomotor learning tasks that have previously been shown to have different sensitivity to perturbations of PF-Purkinje cell LTD.</p><p>We first assessed adaptive modification of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The VOR stabilizes images on the retina by using the vestibular sensory input caused by a head movement to drive an oppositely directed eye movement response. Learning can adjust the amplitude of this oculomotor reflex to improve the stabilization of visual images on the retina for successful navigation in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonshor and Jones, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 1974a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miles and Fuller, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broussard and Kassardjian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gittis and du Lac, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cullen, 2023</xref>). Mice were trained to adaptively increase or decrease their VOR amplitude using two types of vestibular-visual stimulus pairings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyden and Raymond, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2004</xref>).

Accordingly, the L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice with enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD were selectively and profoundly impaired on VOR-increase learning.

One potential explanation is that the enhancement of LTD allows the spontaneous activity in the cerebellar circuit to aberrantly recruit this mechanism and increase the threshold for its further recruitment, reducing its availability to support new LTD-dependent learning. If this is the case, then manipulations that prevent or reverse excessive PF-Purkinje cell LTD before training should reset the circuit to a state compatible with new LTD-dependent learning, and thereby improve VOR-increase learning in the L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.

Since PF-Purkinje cell LTD is driven by co-activation of cerebellar parallel fibers and climbing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ito and Kano, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ito, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Linden and Connor, 1995</xref>), pharmacological suppression of neural activity should also prevent the induction and increase in the threshold for LTD during the pre-training period, and restore the capacity for subsequent LTD-dependent learning in mice with enhanced LTD. We tested this prediction by administering the benzodiazepine diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA">GABAA</ext-link> receptors, to enhance inhibition and suppress neural activity in the L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice during the period preceding VOR-increase training.

One hypothesis is that a lower threshold for the induction of plasticity might cause it to be over-recruited during training, at synapses that should not have undergone plasticity in addition to synapses where it would support adaptive behavioral changes, thereby corrupting the memory trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Migaud et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koekkoek et al., 2005</xref>). An alternative hypothesis is that the enhancement of plasticity might allow spontaneous activity in the circuit to aberrantly recruit the plasticity mechanism even before training begins, and thereby reduce its availability during training to support new learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017</xref> described this reduced availability as saturation of plasticity, but more generally, the reduced availability could reflect an increased threshold for the induction plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bienenstock et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leet et al., 2022</xref>). This threshold metaplasticity hypothesis differs from the over-recruitment hypothesis by suggesting that the enhanced plasticity mechanism is under- rather than over- recruited during training. It also differs by suggesting that the problem with enhanced plasticity arises because of what it does to the circuit before training, rather than how it functions during training, and therefore more readily accounts for effects of pre-training manipulations on learning in mice with enhanced plasticity. The current findings thus bolster the evidence from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017</xref> suggesting threshold metaplasticity rather than over-recruitment as the cause of impaired learning in mice with enhanced associative LTD at the cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Metaplasticity hypothesis for how enhanced plasticity could impair learning.</title><p><italic>Top,</italic> In naïve wild type mice, synapses have a normal threshold for associative LTD, and undergo LTD (<italic>dark violet</italic>) in response to training, thereby supporting normal learning. <italic>Bottom,</italic> In mice with enhanced LTD, such as L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO (<italic>pink</italic>) and MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup> (<italic>green</italic>), the lower threshold for induction of LTD allows it to be aberrantly recruited by spontaneous activity in the circuit (<italic>light violet</italic>), thereby increasing the threshold for additional LTD induction. This prevents the recruitment of LTD during training at the synapses where it is needed to support learning (<italic>grey box</italic>), which impairs learning. Behavioral pre-training or drugs that reduce neural activity can suppress LTD induction and reset the threshold for LTD to normal (<italic>upward purple arrow</italic>), restoring the capacity for LTD-dependent learning.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92543-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We found that L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice with enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD exhibit impaired rather than enhanced learning on oculomotor learning tasks in which PF-Purkinje cell LTD has been implicated, as previously shown for MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup> mice. In both mouse lines, behavioral manipulations designed to prevent or reverse the induction of PF-Purkinje cell LTD during the period before training reversed the learning impairment. The additional finding that pharmacological suppression of neural activity with diazepam can enhance subsequent learning in mice with enhanced associative LTD provides new evidence that these mice are not incapable of LTD-dependent learning. Rather, the interaction of the ongoing neural activity in the circuit with the enhanced plasticity appears to create a state in which LTD is unavailable to support learning. However, this state of reduced availability can be reversed when the patterns of neural activity that create it are eliminated. The capacity for PF-Purkinje cell LTD-dependent learning is dynamically regulated by the recent history of activity.</p><p>Comparison across closely related cerebellum-dependent learning tasks reveals the specific behavioral consequences of enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD. Although it was the main candidate mechanism of cerebellum-dependent learning for many decades, there is growing evidence that PF-Purkinje cell LTD contributes selectively to certain cerebellum-dependent learning tasks, and not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shibuki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Zeeuw et al., 2021</xref>). Oculomotor learning is particularly advantageous for analyzing the function of PF-Purkinje cell LTD during learning because this plasticity mechanism is thought to contribute differentially to a set of closely related oculomotor learning tasks that all depend on the same vestibular, visual and motor signaling pathways through the cerebellar flocculus. Despite the shared cerebellar and extra-cerebellar circuitry, a number of experimental approaches, including ex vivo slice physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Inoshita and Hirano, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shim et al., 2022</xref>), optogenetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kimpo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) and studies of oculomotor learning in mice with impaired LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kakegawa et al., 2018</xref>) have suggested a selective contribution of PF-Purkinje cell LTD to OKR adaptation and VOR-increase learning induced by high-frequency (≥1 Hz) vestibular and visual stimuli, with less or no contribution to VOR-decrease learning or VOR-increase learning induced with lower frequency vestibular and visual stimuli.</p><p>In both the L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup> mice with enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD, the learning impairments and the enhancement of learning by behavioral or pharmacological pre-training manipulations were remarkably selective for the oculomotor learning tasks in which PF-Purkinje cell LTD has been most strongly implicated. Both lines of mice were profoundly impaired on high-frequency VOR-increase learning and OKR adaptation. The effects of behavioral and pharmacological pre-training were strikingly specific for the same oculomotor learning tasks. Moreover, pre-training only enhanced learning in the L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup> mice, and not WT mice, consistent with the pre-training selectively reversing limitations caused by enhanced LTD, rather than generally enhancing cerebellum-dependent learning. In the L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, low-frequency as well as high-frequency VOR-increase learning was impaired. However, the behavioral and diazepam pre-treatments designed to prevent or reverse LTD during the period before training only improved the high-frequency and not the low-frequency VOR-increase learning in the L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, suggesting different mechanistic underpinnings of the low- and high-frequency impairments. In other words, the deletion of <italic>Fmr1</italic> from Purkinje cells may have two distinct effects: enhancement of PF-Purkinje cell LTD, which recapitulates the high-frequency VOR-increase learning phenotypes observed in the MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup> mice with enhanced LTD, plus disruption of an additional cellular mechanism that contributes to low-frequency VOR-increase learning. Overall, in the two lines of mice with enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD, both the learning impairments and the effects of manipulations designed to reverse or prevent LTD before training were remarkably selective for the specific oculomotor learning tasks with the strongest evidence for a contribution of PF-Purkinje cell LTD. This oculomotor learning task specificity strengthens the evidence that the behavioral phenotypes in the L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup> mice are a reflection of the enhanced LTD at PF-Purkinje cell synapses rather than other functional properties of the Purkinje cells, their synapses, or other cells or plasticity mechanisms within the same circuit.</p><p>The very similar behavioral phenotypes observed when PF-Purkinje cell LTD is enhanced by manipulating different molecular cascades further strengthens the evidence that their shared effect of enhancing LTD is responsible for their shared learning impairments, rather than other, off-target effects of the molecular manipulations. MHCI H2- <italic>D<sup>b</sup></italic> acts on MAP kinase and integrin via interaction with immune receptors such as PirB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shatz, 2009</xref>), whereas <italic>Fmr1</italic> acts by inhibiting mGluR-dependent dendritic protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huber et al., 2002</xref>). Cell-type-specific manipulations localize the site where loss of expression of MHCI H2-<italic>D<sup>b</sup></italic> or <italic>Fmr1</italic> yields the oculomotor learning deficits to the Purkinje cells. Each yields enhancement of PF-Purkinje cell LTD, as measured by the ability of protocols that fail to induce LTD in slices from WT mice to induce LTD in slices from MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McConnell et al., 2009</xref>) and L7<italic>-Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koekkoek et al., 2005</xref>). Along with this shared effect of enhancing PF-Purkinje cell LTD, loss of MHCI H2-<italic>D<sup>b</sup></italic> or <italic>Fmr1</italic> expression from the Purkinje cells may each have additional effects on the intrinsic and synaptic properties of Purkinje cells, which are likely to be different for the two molecules. These latter, ‘off-target’ effects may contribute to the impairment of L7<italic>-Fmr1</italic> KO mice on low-frequency VOR-increase learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which was not observed in MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017</xref>). Off-target effects also might have contributed to the different cerebellar learning phenotypes reported previously in the two lines of mice – enhanced rotorod learning in the MHCI <italic>K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McConnell et al., 2009</xref>), but impaired eyeblink conditioning in the L7<italic>-Fmr1</italic> KO mice, global <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice and Fragile X patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koekkoek et al., 2005</xref>). However, the behavioral tasks used in those previous studies were also different, and our current results highlight the importance of the specific choice of behavioral task for assessing cerebellar learning, and the differential dependence of different cerebellar learning tasks on specific molecular and cellular processes within the cerebellum.</p><p>The current findings and the metaplasticity conceptual framework could guide the development of new clinical approaches for Fragile X syndrome and a range of other neurological and psychiatric conditions with enhanced associative plasticity. Pre-treatment with the FDA-approved drug diazepam restored the capacity for high-frequency VOR-increase learning and OKR adaptation in the L7-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice without compromising other forms of oculomotor learning or baseline oculomotor performance. This was true even for VOR-decrease learning, which may depend on LTP of the same population of PF-Purkinje cell synapses that undergo LTD during VOR-increase learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shim et al., 2022</xref>). In other words, diazepam pre-treatment fully rescued the learning impairments with no apparent side effects on other, closely related functions of the same neural circuitry. This specificity enhances its therapeutic potential. At the same time, this approach of suppressing neural activity during a pre-training period may be generally applicable to any learning task, motor or cognitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rochefort et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashburn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frontera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stoodley and Tsai, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2022</xref>), that is impaired by enhanced associative LTD. Pharmacological suppression of neural activity should suppress PF-Purkinje cell LTD throughout the cerebellum, and hence may have the general effect of restoring all regions of the cerebellum to a state compatible with new LTD-dependent learning. This generality of the pharmacological approach stands in contrast to the behavioral pre-training approach, which would require extensive additional knowledge and experimentation to design the appropriate behavioral pre-treatment to reset each functional region of the cerebellum to a state compatible with LTD-dependent learning, and different behavioral pre-treatments would be required to target each of the many functional regions supporting the myriad motor and cognitive functions of the cerebellum. Thus, from a practical standpoint, pharmacological pre-treatment to prevent or reverse the recruitment of LTD before training and thereby lower the threshold for its subsequent recruitment during training is a more feasible and general approach to restoring the capacity for PF-Purkinje cell LTD-dependent learning. Such an approach could be tested even when the specific plasticity mechanism responsible for a learning deficit has not been identified, because lower activity should reduce induction of most associative plasticity mechanisms. Thus, the approach of limiting neural activity during a period before training to reset elevated thresholds for plasticity may be broadly applicable throughout the brain for resetting neural circuits to a state compatible with adaptive plasticity and new learning. Consistent with this, suppression of neural activity in the retina has been successfully employed to reset the visual circuitry and enable recovery from amblyopia in adult mice and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fong et al., 2021</xref>). The suppression of neural activity may be an especially useful approach if plasticity is pathologically enhanced in areas like the cerebellum or basal ganglia, with a high level of spontaneous spiking activity.</p><p>The results predict history-dependent changes in the availability of PF-Purkinje cell LTD to support learning due to activity-dependent changes in the threshold for LTD. Threshold metaplasticity has not been directly documented at these synapses, however several factors that influence climbing fiber-induced calcium influx or the probability of LTD induction have been identified (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zang and De Schutter, 2019</xref>), which could provide the mechanistic substrate for threshold metaplasticity. These include plasticity of the climbing fiber synapse onto the Purkinje cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansel and Linden, 2000</xref>), plasticity of Purkinje cell dendritic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ohtsuki et al., 2012</xref>), changes in the number of spikes in a climbing fiber burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mathy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</xref>), changes in short-term plasticity mechanisms at the PF-Purkinje cell synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hunley et al., 2023</xref>), and plasticity of inhibitory synapses onto the Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kano et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawaguchi and Hirano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rowan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The concept of experience-dependent changes in the threshold for synaptic plasticity has been highly influential in theoretical and computational neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Bear, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benusková et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper and Bear, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hulme et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee, 2022</xref>), since the foundational work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bienenstock et al., 1982</xref>. However, experimental evidence for whether and how such threshold metaplasticity supports the function of neural circuits has been limited, and derived largely from studies of the effects of sensory deprivation on the functional connectivity of circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mioche and Singer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kirkwood et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Philpot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yee et al., 2017</xref>) rather than studies of learning per se. Analysis of threshold metaplasticity in the context of cerebellum-dependent learning and associative LTD offers a new perspective on the Bienenstock, Cooper,and Munro (BCM) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bienenstock et al., 1982</xref>). Most fundamentally, the present results predict threshold metaplasticity at synapses where the plasticity is not Hebbian. A sliding threshold for plasticity has been conceived as a mechanism for countering an instability inherent in Hebbian LTP whereby correlated pre- and post-synaptic activity strengthens a synapse, which leads to an increase in correlated activity, which in turn leads to further strengthening. An increased threshold for LTP in response to an increase in neural activity would counter this instability and provide a mechanism to stabilize firing rates and synaptic weights within a desired range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van Rossum et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Toyoizumi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yger and Gilson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zenke et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, plasticity at the cerebellar PF-Purkinje cell synapse is described as ‘anti-Hebbian’ because the associative form of plasticity is LTD. Associative LTD lacks the instability inherent in Hebbian LTP. Moreover, an increased threshold for LTD in response to an increase in neural activity or a decreased threshold for LTD in response to decreased neural activity would tend to oppose rather than support the stability of firing rates of the postsynaptic Purkinje cells. Yet, the present results provide evidence for these activity-dependent changes in the threshold for cerebellar LTD. Thus, rather than supporting homeostatic control of firing rates, the central function of threshold metaplasticity at these synapses may be to limit the amount of plasticity. In addition, the finding that manipulations of neural activity during the pre-training period had different effects in the mice with enhanced LTD than in WT mice suggests that changes in the threshold for plasticity may be driven, not directly by firing rates, but by the recent history of activity-dependent induction of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Montgomery and Madison, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lev-Ram et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hunley et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abraham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martin and Kosik, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Redondo and Morris, 2011</xref>) A plasticity-driven increase in the threshold for further plasticity could serve to protect newly acquired memories from being overwritten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fusi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benna and Fusi, 2016</xref>). A second potential function would be to separate memories acquired in close succession onto the synapses of different Purkinje cells, in contrast to findings in the amygdala, where there is evidence that a plasticity-driven decrease in the threshold for further plasticity supports the allocation of memories acquired in close succession to the same neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benna and Fusi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rashid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lau et al., 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We leveraged the relatively simple and well understood physiology and function of the cerebellum and oculomotor system to develop and test a new hypothesis to explain why enhanced plasticity often impairs rather than enhances learning. The current results, along with the previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017</xref>, provide convergent evidence that a lower threshold for synaptic plasticity can result in its aberrant recruitment by ongoing activity in a circuit, resulting in an increased threshold for its subsequent induction and hence the impairment of learning. This threshold metaplasticity perspective may be useful in considering the impact of enhanced plasticity not only in the cerebellum, but in other brain areas as well, and for developing new clinical approaches for reversing maladaptive plasticity and resetting neural circuits to a state compatible with adaptive plasticity and new learning. More generally, the present results highlight the principle that synaptic properties do not control learning in isolation but interact with the patterns of neural activity in the corresponding circuits to control the capacity for new learning. The implication is that learning deficits associated with abnormal plasticity are not necessarily permanent, but in some cases can be remedied with appropriate reset of the circuit, opening up the possibility for therapeutic approaches targeting neural activity as well as the plasticity mechanisms themselves.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC protocol # 9143) at Stanford University.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice with the <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene knocked out selectively from cerebellar Purkinje cells were generated through the following breeding strategy.

Each 50 s block of training was followed by 10 s in darkness.</p><p>Prior to some experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), mice received a single IP injection of 0.4, 0.5, or 2.5 mg/kg diazepam (in saline) or saline control. After diazepam or saline administration, mice were returned to the home cage, and then behavioral testing was performed either 2 hr, 18–24 hr, and/or 1 week later.</p><p>Each mouse underwent multiple behavioral experiments, with at least two days between successive experiments. The same cohort of mice was used for the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, with the order of the experiments randomized. A subset of the same cohort was then used for the diazepam experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. A separate cohort of mice was used for the low-frequency training experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, with the order of randomized for the behavioral pre-training conditions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (no pretraining, VOR-decrease pre-training and Vestibular only pre-training) followed by the diazepam pre-treatment experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, with randomized order for drug and saline conditions. Another separate cohort of mice was used for the OKR adaptation experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The order of experiments with diazepam and saline treatment was pseudorandomized. The experimenters collecting behavioral data were blinded to the genotype and the diazepam versus saline treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of eye movement measurements</title><p>Signals from the magnetic sensor related to eye position were fourth-order low-pass (15 Hz) Butterworth filtered and then digitally differentiated to obtain eye velocity using a windowed (30 ms) Savitzky-Golay filter. Eye velocity data from each VOR test or OKR block were fit with a 1 Hz or 0.5 Hz sinusoid. Values deviating from the sinusoidal fit by more than 31°/s were identified as saccades or movement artifacts and excluded, along with data from 50 ms before and after. Segments of data less than 10ms in duration were also excluded. The entire 45 s VOR or 50 s OKR test was excluded if more than 45% of the data points were excluded, Subsequently, the remaining eye velocity data underwent a second round of fitting using sinusoids at frequencies of either 1 Hz or 0.5 Hz. The amplitude of this second sinusoidal fit provided the measure of the amplitude of the eye movement response, Values from the three VOR tests in a block were averaged. VOR learning (ΔVOR) was calculated as the percentage change in the VOR amplitude following each 10 min block of training relative to the baseline VOR amplitude measured before training. For OKR, values from the first three 50 s OKR blocks were averaged to obtain the pre-training baseline, and values from the last three blocks (58–60 min) were averaged to obtain the post-training OKR measure. OKR learning (ΔOKR) was calculated as the percentage change in the OKR amplitude post- vs. pre-training. Learned changes in the OKR relative to pre-training are also reported for blocks 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. Eye movement gain was calculated as the ratio of eye movement amplitude to either vestibular (VOR) or visual (OKR) stimulus amplitude.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed with a Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, followed by a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA with posthoc Tukey or by a two-sample or paired sample t-test, executed in OriginPro 2022 software. A value of p less than 0.05 was considered significant. Data are plotted as mean ± SEM.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC protocol # 9143) at Stanford University.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-92543-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All code used for data acquisition (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RaymondLab/Code/tree/Master/Experiment%20Protocols">https://github.com/RaymondLab/Code/tree/Master/Experiment%20Protocols</ext-link>) and analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RaymondLab/Code/tree/Master/Tools/VOR_Analysis">https://github.com/RaymondLab/Code/tree/Master/Tools/VOR_Analysis</ext-link>) is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RaymondLab/Code">https://github.com/RaymondLab/Code</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">RaymondLab, 2024</xref>).

In preparing this manuscript, we made a conscious effort to address citation bias. Following the approach outlined in Dworkin et al., 2020, we used open source code to assess the gender balance of our citations based on the first names of the first and last authors (Zhou et al., 2020). Excluding self-citations, our article includes citations as follows: 56.98% man/man, 9.30% man/woman, 23.26% woman/man, and 10.47% woman/woman citations. For comparison, the proportions obtained from articles in the top five neuroscience journals (Dworkin et al., 2020) are as follows: 58.4% man/man, 9.4% man/woman, 25.5% woman/man, and 6.7% woman/woman. Our references also contain 21.96% author of color (first)/author of color(last), 18.55% white author/author of color, 21.03% author of color/white author, and 38.46% white author/white author.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abraham</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name><name><surname>Bear</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="1996">1996</year><article-title>Metaplasticity: the plasticity of synaptic plasticity</article-title><source>Trends in Neurosciences</source><volume>19</volume><fpage>126</fpage><lpage>130</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/s0166-2236(96)80018-x</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8658594</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abraham</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2008">2008</year><article-title>Metaplasticity: tuning synapses and networks for plasticity</article-title><source>Nature Reviews.

The central hypothesis is that such impairments arise due to saturation of synaptic plasticity, such that the synaptic plasticity required for learning can no longer be induced. A prior study provided evidence for this hypothesis using transgenic mice that lack major histocompatibility class 1 molecules and show enhanced long-term depression (LTD) at synapses between granule cells and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. The study found that a form of LTD-dependent motor learning-increasing the gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)-is impaired in these mice and can be rescued by manipulations designed to &quot;unsaturate&quot; LTD. The present study extends this line of investigation to another transgenic mouse line with enhanced LTD, namely, mice with the Fragile X gene knocked out. The main findings are that VOR gain increase learning is selectively impaired in these mice but can be rescued by specific manipulations of visuomotor experience known to reverse cerebellar LTD. Additionally, the authors show that a transient global enhancement of neuronal inhibition also selectively rescues gain increase learning. This latter finding has potential clinical relevance since the drug used to boost inhibition, diazepam, is FDA-approved and commonly used in the clinic. The evidence provided for the saturation is somewhat indirect because directly measuring synaptic strength in vivo is technically difficult. Nevertheless, the experimental results are solid. In particular, the specificity of the effects to forms of plasticity previously shown to require LTD is remarkable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92543.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shakhawat</surname><given-names>Amin MD</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Foltz</surname><given-names>Jacqueline G</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nance</surname><given-names>Adam B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bhateja</surname><given-names>Jaydev</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This important manuscript follows up on previous findings from the same lab supporting the idea that deficits in learning due to enhanced synaptic plasticity are due to saturation effects.

However, as recognized by Reviewer 2, the implications are much broader than that: “the finding that a previously FDA-approved therapeutic can rescue learning could provide important new insights for biologists, psychologists, and others studying learning and neurodevelopment.” We have substantially revised the Discussion section of the manuscript to more explicitly lay out how the central idea of our manuscript-- that the capacity for learning at any given moment is powerfully influenced by dynamic, activity- and plasticity-dependent changes in the threshold for synaptic plasticity over short timescales of tens of minutes to hours <monospace>--has</monospace> implications for scientific thinking and experiments on plasticity and learning throughout the brain, as well as clinical practice for a wide array of brain disorders associated with altered plasticity and learning impairment.</p><p>To emphasize the broad conceptual implications of our research, we have reframed our conclusions in terms of metaplasticity rather than saturation of plasticity throughout the revised manuscript. In our previous submission, we had used the “saturation “ terminology for continuity with our previous NguyenVu et al 2017 eLife paper, and mentioned the related idea of threshold metaplasticity in a single sentence: “Similarly, the aberrant recruitment of LTD before training may lead, not to its saturation per se, but to some other kind of reduced availability, such as an increased threshold for its induction (Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro, 1982; Leet, Bear, and Gaier, 2022).” However, we now appreciate that metaplasticity is a more general conceptual framework for our findings, and therefore emphasize this concept in the revised manuscript, while still making the conceptual link with the “saturation” idea presented in NguyenVu et al 2017 (lines 236-238).</p><p>The concept of a sliding threshold for synaptic plasticity (threshold metaplasticity) was proposed four decades ago by Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro (1982) as a mechanism for countering an instability inherent in Hebbian plasticity whereby correlated pre- and post-synaptic activity strengthens a synapse, which leads to an increase in correlated activity, which in turn leads to further strengthening. To counter this, BCM proposed a sliding threshold whereby increases in neural activity increase the threshold for LTP and decreases in activity decrease the threshold for LTP, thereby providing a mechanism for stabilizing firing rates and synaptic weights. This BCM sliding threshold model has been highly influential in theoretical and computational neuroscience, but experimental evidence for whether and how such a mechanism functions in vivo has been quite limited.</p><p>Our work extends the previous, limited experimental evidence for a BCM-like sliding threshold in vivo in several significant ways, which we now discuss in the revised manuscript:</p><p>First, we analyze threshold metaplasticity at synapses where the plasticity is not Hebbian and lacks the inherent instability that inspired the BCM model. The synapses onto cerebellar Purkinje cells have been described as “anti-Hebbian” because the associative form of plasticity is synaptic LTD of excitatory inputs. This anti-Hebbian associative plasticity lacks the instability inherent in Hebbian plasticity. Moreover, a BCM-like sliding threshold that increases the threshold for associative LTD with increased firing rates and decreases threshold for LTD with decreased firing rates would tend to oppose rather than support the stability of firing rates, nevertheless we find evidence for this in our experimental results. Thus, for cerebellar LTD, the central function of the sliding threshold may not be the stabilization of firing rates, but rather to limit plasticity in order to suppress the overwrite of new memories or to allocate different memories to the synapses of different Purkinje cells.</p><p>Second, we analyze the influence of a BCM-like sliding threshold for plasticity on behavioral learning. Most previous evidence for the BCM model in vivo has derived from studies of the effects of sensory deprivation (e.g., monocular occlusion) on the functional connectivity of sensory circuits (Kirkwood et al., 1996; Desai et al. 2002; Fong et al., 2021) rather than on learning per se.</p><p>Third, our results provide evidence for major changes in the threshold for plasticity over short time scales and with more subtle manipulations of neural activity than used in previous studies, with practical implications for clinical application. Previously, metaplasticity has been demonstrated with sensory deprivation over multiple days (Kirkwood et al., 1996; Desai et al. 2002) or with drastic changes in neural activity, such as with TTX in the retina (Fong et al, 2021), TMS (Hamada et al 2008), or high frequency electrical stimulation in vitro (Holland &amp; Wagner 1998; Montgomery &amp; Madison 2002) or in vivo (Abraham et al 2001). In contrast, we provide evidence for metaplasticity induced by 30 min of behavioral manipulation (pre-training) and by the relatively subtle pharmacological manipulation of activity with systemic administration of diazepam, a drug approved for humans. Thus, our work contributes not only conceptually to understanding the function of threshold metaplasticity in vivo, but also offers practical observations that could pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Fourth, whereas efforts to enhance plasticity and learning have largely focused on increasing the excitability of neurons during learning to help cross the threshold for plasticity (e.g., Albergaria et al., 2018; Yamaguchi et al., 2020; Le Friec et al., 2017), we take the opposite, somewhat counterintuitive approach of inhibiting the excitability of neurons during a period before learning to reset the threshold for plasticity to a state compatible with new learning. To our knowledge, the only other application of such an approach in an animal model of a brain disorder has been inhibiting peripheral (retinal) activity with TTX for treatment of amblyopia (Fong et al, 2021). Our findings from CNS inhibition with a single systemic dose of diazepam greatly expands the potential applications, which could readily be tested in other mouse models of human disorders, and other learning deficits. Even in cases where the specific synaptic impairments and circuitry are less fully understood, the impact of suppressing neural activity during a period before training to reduce the threshold for plasticity could be empirically tested.</p><p>Fifth, our work extends the consideration of a BCM-like sliding threshold for plasticity to the cerebellum, whereas previous work has focused on models and experimental studies of forebrain circuits. Currently there is a surge of interest in the contribution of the cerebellum to functions and brain disorders previously ascribed to forebrain, hence we anticipate broad interest in this work.</p><p>Sixth, our results suggest that the history of plasticity rather than the history of firing rates may be the homeostat controlling the threshold for plasticity, at least at the synapses under consideration. Diazepam pre-treatment only enhanced learning in the L7-Fmr1 KO mice with a low “baseline” threshold for plasticity, as measured in vitro, and not WT mice. This suggests it is not the neural activity per se that drives the change in threshold for plasticity, but the interaction of activity with the plasticity mechanism.</p><p>In the revised Discussion, we make all of the above points, to make the implications more clear to readers.</p><p>The broad interest in this topic is illustrated by two concrete examples. First, an abstract of this work was honored with selection for oral presentation at the November 2023 Symposium of the Molecular and Cellular Cognition Society, a conceptually wide-ranging organization with thousands of members worldwide. Second, the most closely related published work on activity-dependent metaplasticity in vivo, the Fong et al 2021 eLife paper demonstrating reversal of amblyopia by suppression of activity in the retina by TTX, attracted such broad interest, not just of professional scientists, but also the general public, as to be reported on National Public Radio’s All Things Considered, with an audience of 11.9 million people worldwide.</p><p>In considering the potential of this work for widespread influence, it is important to note that activitydriven changes in the threshold for plasticity could very well be a general property of most if not all synapses, yet very little is known about its function in vivo, especially during learning. Therefore, the seminal conceptual and practical advances described above have the potential for profound implications throughout neuroscience, psychiatry, neurology and computer science/AI, the eLife criterion for designation as “landmark” in significance. We respectfully request that the reviewers and editor reassess the significance of our findings in light of our much-improved discussion of the broad significance of the work.</p><p>eLife assessment, Strength of support</p><p>Convincing evidence is presented that behavioral learning deficits associated with enhanced synaptic plasticity in a transgenic mouse model can be rescued by manipulations designed to reverse the saturation of synaptic plasticity. In particular, the finding that a previously FDA-approved therapeutic can rescue learning could provide important new insights for biologists, psychologists, and others studying learning and neurodevelopment.</p><p>The designation of “Convincing” indicates “methodology in line with current state-of the-art.” In the revised Discussion, we more clearly highlight that our evidence is “more rigorous than current state-ofthe-art” in several respects, thereby meeting the eLife criterion for “Compelling”:</p><p>(1) Comparison of learning deficits and effects of behavioral and pharmacological pretreatment across five closely related oculomotor learning tasks, which all depend on the same region of the cerebellum (the flocculus), but which previous work has found to vary in their dependence on LTD at the cerebellar parallel fiber-to-Purkinje cell synapses.</p><p>The “state-of-the-art” behavioral standard in the field of learning is assessment of a single learning task that depends on a given brain area, with the implicit or explicit assumption that the task chosen is representative of “cerebellum-dependent learning” or hippocampus-, amygdala-, basal ganglia-, cortex- dependent learning, etc. Sometimes there is a no-learning behavioral control.</p><p>Our study exceeds this standard by comparing across many different closely related learning tasks, which all depend on the cerebellar flocculus and other shared vestibular, visual, and oculomotor circuitry, but vary in their dependence on LTD at the cerebellar parallel fiber-to-Purkinje cell synapses. In the original submission, we reported results for high-frequency VOR-increase learning that were dramatically different than for three other VOR learning tasks for which there is less evidence for a role of LTD. Reviewer 2 noted, “the specificity of the effects to forms of plasticity previously shown to require LTD is remarkable.” In the revised manuscript, we provide new data for a second oculomotor learning task in which LTD has been implicated, OKR adaptation, with very similar results as for high-frequency VORincrease learning. The remarkable specificity of both the learning deficits and the effects of pre-training manipulations, in two different lines of mice, for the two specific learning tasks in which LTD has been most strongly implicated, and not the other three oculomotor learning tasks, substantially strengthens the evidence for the conclusion that the learning deficits and effects of pre-training are related specifically to the lower threshold for LTD, rather than the result of some other effect of the gene KO or pre-treatment on the cerebellar or oculomotor circuitry (discussed on lines 270-290 of revised manuscript).</p><p>(2) Replication of findings in more than one line of mice, targeting distinct signaling pathways, with a common impact of enhancing LTD at the cerebellar PF-Purkinje cell synapses.</p><p>State-of-the-art is to report the effects of one specific molecular signaling pathway on behavior.</p><p>In the first part of this Research Advance, we replicate the findings of Nguyen-Vu et al 2017 for a completely different line of mice with enhanced LTD at the parallel fiber-to-Purkinje cell synapses. Like the comparison across LTD-dependent and LTD-independent oculomotor learning tasks, the comparison across completely different lines of mice with enhanced LTD strengthens the evidence that the shared behavioral phenotypes are a reflection of the state of LTD rather than other “off-target” effects of each mutation (discussed on lines 291-309 of revised manuscript).</p><p>(3) Reversal of learning impairments with more than one type of treatment.</p><p>State-of-the-art is to be able to reverse a learning deficit or other functional impairment in an animal model of a brain disorder with a single treatment; indeed, success in this respect is viewed as wildly exciting, as evidenced by the reception by the scientific and lay communities of the Fong et al, 2021 eLife report of reversal of amblyopia by TTX treatment of the retina.</p><p>In the current work, we demonstrate reversal of learning deficits with two different types of treatment during the period before training, one behavioral and one pharmacological. The current diazepam pretreatment results provide a fundamentally new type of evidence for the hypothesis that the threshold for LTD and LTD-dependent learning varies with the recent history of activity in the circuit, complementing the evidence from behavioral and optogenetic pre-training approaches used previously in Nguyen-Vu et al, 2017 (discussed on lines 151-158 and 246-255 of revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Shakhawat et al., investigated how enhancement of plasticity and impairment could result in the same behavioral phenotype.

This study would have benefited from a direct analysis of LTD in the cerebellar cortex in the proposed circuits.</p></disp-quote><p>Our current experiments were motivated by the direct analysis of cerebellar LTD in Fmr1 knock out mice that was already published (Koekkoek et al., 2005). In that previous work, LTD was analyzed in both Purkinje cell selective L7-Fmr1 KO mice (Koekkoek et al., 2005; Fig. 4D), as used in our study, and global Fmr1 knock out mice (Koekkoek et al., 2005; Fig. 4B). Both lines were found to have enhanced LTD, as cited in the Introduction of our manuscript (lines 48-51, 63-64). The goal of our current study was to build on this previous work by analyzing the behavioral correlates of the findings from this previous, direct analysis of LTD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Diazepam was shown to rescue learning in L7-Fmr1 KO mice, but this drug is a benzodiazepine and can cause a physical dependence. While the concentrations used in this study were quite low and animals were dosed acutely, potential side-effects of the drug were not examined, including any possible withdrawal.</p></disp-quote><p>In humans, diazepam (valium) is one of the most frequently prescribed drugs in the world, and the side effects and withdrawal symptoms have been extensively studied and documented.1 Withdrawal symptoms are generally not observed with treatments of less than 2 weeks (Brett and Murnion, 2015). After longterm treatments tapering of the dosage is recommended to mitigate withdrawal (Brett and Murnion, 2015 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/valium-treatment/withdrawal-duration">https://americanaddictioncenters.org/valium-treatment/withdrawal-duration</ext-link>). The extensive data on the safety of diazepam in humans lowers the barrier to potential clinical translation of our basic science findings, although we emphasize that our own expertise is scientific, and translation to Fragile X patients or other patient groups will require additional development of the research by clinicians.</p><p>Given the extensive history of research on this drug, we focused on looking for side effects that would reflect an adverse effect of diazepam on the function of the same oculomotor neural circuitry whose ability to support certain oculomotor learning tasks was improved after diazepam. In other words, we assessed whether the pharmacological manipulation was enhancing certain functions of a given circuit at the expense of others. As we note (line 164), “The acute effect of diazepam administration [measured 2 hours after administration] was to impair learning” in both WT and L7-Fmr1 KO mice. One could consider this a side effect. More importantly, we also tested extensively for oculomotor side-effects during the therapeutic period when learning impairments were eliminated in the L7-Fmr1 KOs, 18-24 hours post-administration, and have a full section of the Results describing our findings about this, titled “Specificity of pre-training effects on learning.” As described in the Results and Discussion (lines 184195, 312-318, Figure 3, figure 3-supplement1; figure 4B; figure 5-supplement 1), we found no such adverse side-effects, which is again encouraging with respect to the translational potential of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This drug is not specific to Purkinje cells or cerebellar circuits, so the action of the drug on cerebellar circuitry is not well understood for the study presented.</p></disp-quote><p>The effects of diazepam are indeed not specific to Purkinje cells, but rather are known to be widespread. Diazepam is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, which are found throughout the brain, including the cerebellum. When delivered systemically, as we did in our experiments, diazepam will suppress neural activity throughout the brain by facilitating inhibition, as documented by decades of previous research with this and related benzodiazepines, including dozens of studies of the effects of diazepam in the cerebellum.</p><p>To our knowledge, there is currently no drug that can specifically inhibit Purkinje cells, especially one that can be given systemically to cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, if such a drug did exist, we would not predict it to have the same effect as diazepam in reversing the learning deficits of the L7-Fmr1 KO mice, because the latter presumably depends on suppression of activity in the cerebellar granule cells and neurons of the inferior olive, whose axons form the parallel fibers and climbing fibers, and whose correlated activity controls LTD at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses.</p><p>We have revised the text to clarify the key point that despite its widespread action on the brain, the effects of diazepam on cerebellum-dependent learning were remarkably specific (lines 184-195, 210-228, 312318). During the period 18-24 hours after a single dose of diazepam, the learning deficits of L7-Fmr1 KO mice on two LTD-dependent oculomotor learning tasks were completely reversed, with no effects on the same tasks in WT mice, and no effects (“side-effects”) in L7-Fmr1 KO mice or WT mice on other, LTDindependent oculomotor learning tasks that depend on the same region of the cerebellum, and no effects on baseline performance of visually or vestibularly driven eye movements.</p><p>As described in the revised Discussion (lines 318-323), the non-specific mild suppression of neural activity throughout the brain by diazepam makes it a potentially generalizable approach for inducing BCM-like shifts in the threshold for associative plasticity to facilitate subsequent learning. More specifically, diazepam-mediated reduction of activity throughout the brain has the potential to lower any aberrantly high thresholds for associative plasticity at synapses throughout the brain, and thereby reverse any learning deficits associated with such aberrantly high plasticity thresholds. This approach might even be useful in cases where the neural circuitry supporting a given behavior is not well characterized and the specific synapses responsible for the learning deficit are unknown. On lines 323-327 we compare this generalizable approach with the challenges of designing task- and circuit-specific approaches to reset the threshold for plasticity, particularly in circuits that are less well characterized than the oculomotor circuit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It was not mentioned if L7-Fmr1 KO mice have behavior impairments that worsen with age or if Purkinje cells and the cerebellar microcircuit are intact throughout the lifespan.</p></disp-quote><p>At the adult ages used in our study (8-22 weeks), the oculomotor circuitry, including the Fmr1-deficient Purkinje cells, appears to be functionally intact because all of the oculomotor performance and learning tasks we tested were either normal, or could be restored to normal with brief behavioral and/or pharmacological pre-treatment.</p><p>Any degeneration of the Fmr1-deficient Purkinje cells or cerebellar microcircuit or additional behavioral impairments at older ages, if they should exist, would not alter our interpretation of the results from 8-22 week old adults regarding history- and activity-dependent changes in the capacity for LTD-dependent learning. Therefore, we leave the question of changes throughout the lifespan to investigators with an interest and expertise in development and/or aging.</p><p>Only a small handful of the scores of previous studies of the Fmr1 KO mouse model have investigated age-dependent effects; the reviewer may be interested in papers such as Tang et al., 2015 (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1502258112) or Martin et al., 2016 (doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhv031).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Connections between Purkinje cells and interneurons could also influence the behavior results found.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is repeated below in a more general form (Reviewer 1, second to last comment)—please see our response there and lines 270-309 of the revised manuscript for a discussion of how concerns about “off-target” effects are mitigated by the high degree of specificity of the learning deficits and effects of pre-training for the specific learning tasks in which LTD has been previously implicated, and the very similar findings in two different lines of mice with enhanced LTD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While males and females were both used for the current study, only 7 of each sex were analyzed, which could be underpowered. While it might be justified to combine sexes for this particular study, it would be worth understanding this model in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional analyses to address the question of whether there might be sex differences that were not detected because of the sample size.</p><p>(1) In a new figure, Fig. 1-figure supplement 1, we break out the results for male and female mice in separate plots, and show that all of the effects of both the KO of Fmr1 from the Purkinje cells and of pretreatment with diazepam that are observed in the full cohort are also statistically significant in just the subset of male mice, and just the subset of female mice (see Fig. 1-figure supplement 1 legend for statistics). In other words, qualitatively, there are no sex differences, and all of the conclusions of our manuscript are statistically valid in both male and female mice. This strengthens the justification for combining sexes for the specific scientific purposes of our study.</p><p>(2) We performed a power analysis to determine how many mice would be needed to determine whether the very, very small quantitative differences between male and female mice are significant. The analysis indicates that this would require upwards of 70 mice of each sex for WT mice (Cohen’s d, 0.6162; power 0.95) and upwards of 2500 mice of each sex for L7-Fmr1 KO mice (Cohen’s d, 0.0989; power 0.95). Since the very small quantitative sex differences observed in our cohorts would not alter our scientific conclusions or the possibility for clinical application to patients of both sexes, even if the small quantitative differences turned out to be significant, the very large number of animals needed did not seem warranted for the current scientific purposes. Researchers focused on sex differences may find a motivation to pursue this issue further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Training was only shown up to 30 minutes and learning did not seem to plateau in most cases. What would happen if training continued beyond the 30 minutes? Would L7-Fmr1 KO mice catch-up to WT littermates? Nguyen-Vu</p></disp-quote><p>(1) For VOR learning, we used a 30 min training time because in our past (e.g., Boyden et al., 2003; Kimpo and Raymond, 2007; Nguyen-Vu et al., 2013; Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017) and current results, we find that VOR learning does plateau quite rapidly, with little or no additional adaptive change in the VOR observed between the tests of learning after 30 min vs 20 min of VOR-increase training, in WT or L7Fmr1 KO mice (Fig. 1A; WT, p=0.917; L7-Fmr1 KO, p=0.861; 20 vs. 30 min; Tukey). In the L7-Fmr1 KO mice, there is no significant high-frequency VOR-increase learning after 30 min training, and the mean VOR gain is even slightly lower on average (not significant) than before training (Fig. 1A, red). Therefore, we have no reason to expect that the L7-Fmr1 KO mice would catch up to WT after additional VOR-increase training.</p><p>(2) We have added new data on OKR adaptation, induced with 60 min of training (Fig. 5). The L7-Fmr1 KO mice exhibited impaired OKR adaptation, even with 60 min of training (p = 1.27x10-4, Tukey). In our experience, restraint for longer than 60 min produces a behavioral state that is not conducive to learning, as also reported by (Katoh and Yamagiwa, 2018), therefore longer training times were not attempted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The pathway discussed as the main focus for VOR in this learning paradigm was connections between parallel fibers (PF) and Purkinje cells, but the possibility of other local or downstream circuitry being involved was not discussed. PF-Purkinje cell circuits were not directly analyzed, which makes this claim difficult to assess.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript (lines 299-309), we have expanded our discussion of the possibility that loss of expression of Fmr1 from Purkinje cells in the Purkinje cell-specific L7-Fmr1 KO mice might influence other synapses or intrinsic properties of the Purkinje cells (including synapses from interneurons, as raised in this reviewer’s comment above), in addition to enhancing associative LTD at the parallel fiberPurkinje cell synapses.</p><p>It is a very general limitation of all perturbation studies, even cell-type specific perturbation studies as in the current case, that it is never possible to completely rule out “off-target” effects of the manipulation. Because of this, causality cannot be definitively concluded from correlations (e.g., between the effects of a perturbation observed at the cellular and behavioral level), and therefore we make no such claim in our manuscript. Rather, we conclude that our results “provide evidence for,” “support,” “predict,” or “are consistent with” the hypothesis of a history- and activity-dependent change in the threshold for associative LTD at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cells.</p><p>That said, perturbation is still one of the major tools in the experimental toolbox, and there are approaches for mitigating concern about off-target effects. We highlight three aspects of our experimental design that accomplish this (lines 184-228, 256-309). First, we show nearly identical learning impairments and effects of behavioral pretreatment in lines of mice with two completely different molecular manipulations that have the common effect of enhancing PF-Purkinje cell LTD, but are likely to have different off-target cellular effects on the Purkinje cells and their synapses. Second, we show that the learning impairments were highly specific to oculomotor learning tasks in which PF-Purkinje cell LTD was previously implicated, with no such effects on three other oculomotor learning tasks that depend on the same region of the cerebellum and oculomotor circuitry. In the original submission, we provided data for one LTDdependent oculomotor learning task, high-frequency VOR-increase learning; in the revised manuscript we provide new data for a second LTD-dependent oculomotor learning task, optokinetic reflex adaptation, with nearly identical results (Fig. 5). Third, we show that the effects of diazepam pre-treatment were highly specific to the same two LTD-dependent oculomotor learning tasks and also highly specific to the L7-Fmr1 KO mice with enhanced LTD and not WT mice. These three features of the experimental design are not common in studies of learning, especially in combination. On lines 256-309, we provide an expanded discussion of how together, these three features of the design strengthen the evidence that the learning impairments and effects of diazepam pre-treatment on learning are related to LTD at the PF-Pk synapses, while acknowledging the possibility of other effects on the circuit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors mostly achieved their aim and the results support their conclusion and proposed hypothesis. This work will be impactful on the field as it uses a new Purkinje-cell specific mouse model to study a classic cerebellar task. The use of diazepam could be further analyzed in other genetic models of neurodevelopmental disorders to understand if effects on LTD can rescue other pathways and behavior outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the present findings are potentially relevant for a very wide array of behavioral tasks, disease models, and brain areas beyond the specific ones in our study, and we make this point on lines 310-338 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript explores the seemingly paradoxical observation that enhanced synaptic plasticity impairs (rather than enhances) certain forms of learning and memory. The central hypothesis is that such impairments arise due to saturation of synaptic plasticity, such that the synaptic plasticity required for learning can no longer be induced. A prior study provided evidence for this hypothesis using transgenic mice that lack major histocompatibility class 1 molecules and show enhanced long-term depression (LTD) at synapses between granule cells and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. The study found that a form of LTD-dependent motor learning-increasing the gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)-is impaired in these mice and can be rescued by manipulations designed to &quot;unsaturate&quot; LTD. The present study extends this line of investigation to another transgenic mouse line with enhanced LTD, namely, mice with the Fragile X gene knocked out. The main findings are that VOR gain increased learning is selectively impaired in these mice but can be rescued by specific manipulations of visuomotor experience known to reverse cerebellar LTD. Additionally, the authors show that a transient global enhancement of neuronal inhibition also selectively rescues gain increases learning. This latter finding has potential clinical relevance since the drug used to boost inhibition, diazepam, is FDA-approved and commonly used in the clinic. The evidence provided for the saturation is somewhat indirect because directly measuring synaptic strength in vivo is technically difficult. Nevertheless, the experimental results are solid. In particular, the specificity of the effects to forms of plasticity previously shown to require LTD is remarkable. The authors should consider including a brief discussion of some of the important untested assumptions of the saturation hypothesis, including the requirement that cerebellar LTD depends not only on pre- and postsynaptic activity (as is typically assumed) but also on the prior history of synaptic activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this exceptionally clear and concise assessment of the findings and strengths of the manuscript.</p><p>We agree that one of the most “remarkable” aspects of our findings is the specificity of the effects for oculomotor learning tasks for which there is the strongest previous evidence for a role of PF-Purkinje cell LTD. In the original manuscript, we tested just one LTD-dependent oculomotor learning task, highfrequency VOR increase learning; in the revised manuscript, we strengthen the case for LTD-dependent task specificity by adding new data (Fig. 5) showing the same effects for OKR adaptation, an additional LTD-dependent oculomotor learning task.</p><p>The reviewer’s suggestion to include discussion of “untested assumptions”, “including the requirement that cerebellar LTD depends not only on pre- and postsynaptic activity (as is typically assumed) but also on the prior history of synaptic activation” prompted us to more deeply consider the broader implications of our results, and extensively revise the Discussion accordingly. We clarify that we consider historydependent changes in the threshold for LTD to be a prediction of the behavioral and pharmacological findings (lines 339-347, 356) rather than an assumption. In addition, we highlight the broader implications of the results by putting them in the context of work in other brain areas on historydependent changes in the threshold for plasticity, i.e., metaplasticity, going back to the seminal Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM; year) theory (lines 348-378).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>The text and figures are very clear to read, but there are a couple of questions that remain:</p><p>The concentrations chosen for diazepam are not well described and it is unclear why the concentrations jump from 2.5 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg. Please add an explanation for these concentrations and if any additional behavior outcomes were observed.</p></disp-quote><p>Our choice of diazepam concentrations was guided by the concentrations reported in the literature to be effective in mice, which suggest that a higher dose (2 mg/kg) can have additional effects not observed with a lower effective dose (0.5 mg/kg) (Pádua-Reis et al, 2021). Since we did not know how much enhancement of inhibition/suppression of activity might be necessary to substantially reduce the induction of PF-Purkinje cell LTD, we did pilot experiments to test concentrations at the low and high ends of the doses typically used in mice. These pilot experiments revealed that a lower dose of 0.4 or 0.5 mg/kg was comparable to the higher dose of 2.5 mg/kg in suppressing VOR-increase learning 2 hours after administration (Fig. 3 – figure supplement 2). Anecdotally, we observed higher levels of locomotor activity and other abnormal cage behavior during the period immediately after administration of the higher compared to the lower dose. To limit these side effects and any possibility of dependence, we used only the lower dose in all subsequent experiments. We clarify this rationale for using a lower dose in the legend of Fig. 3 – figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 describes low-frequency VOR, but the paragraph discussing these results (line 191) mentions high-frequency VOR-increase learning.

We think this has greatly improved the manuscript, and will substantially increase its appeal to a broad segment of the neuroscience research community, including computational neuroscientists as well as those interested in synaptic physiology, learning and memory, or plasticity-related brain disorders including autism.</p><p>Note that we consider the idea that ”LTD depends not only on pre- and post- synaptic activity but also on the prior history of synaptic activation” to be the central prediction of the threshold metaplasticity hypothesis rather than an assumption, and in the revised manuscript we explicitly refer to this as a prediction (line 339, 356). We also added a discussion of multiple known cellular phenomena in the Purkinje cells and their synapses that can regulate LTD and thus represent candidate mechanisms for LTD threshold metaplasticity (lines 339-347).
