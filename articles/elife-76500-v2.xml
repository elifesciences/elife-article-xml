populations. However, it remains difficult to predict precisely the effect of any given sequence variant on enhancer function due to the complexity of DNA sequence motifs that determine transcription factor (TF) binding to enhancers in their native genomic context. Using F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid cells derived from crosses between distantly related inbred strains of mice, we identified thousands of enhancers with allele-specific TF binding and/or activity. We find that genetic variants located within the central region of enhancers are most likely to alter TF binding and enhancer activity. We observe that the AP-1 family of TFs (Fos/Jun) are frequently required for binding of TEAD TFs and for enhancer function. However, many sequence variants outside of core motifs for AP-1 and TEAD also impact enhancer function, including sequences flanking core TF motifs and AP-1 half sites. Taken together, these data represent one of the most comprehensive assessments of allele-specific TF binding and enhancer function to date and reveal how sequence changes at enhancers alter their function across evolutionary timescales.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>There are hundreds of different types of cells in the body. Each one performs a unique role, but they all share the same genes. Sequences of the genetic code called enhancers decide which genes each cell uses. Enhancers work like genetic switches: to turn a gene on, proteins called transcription factors assemble on an enhancer. Each transcription factor recognises a short sequence on the enhancer, and several distinct transcription factors work together to promote the activatation of a gene.</p><p>The relationship between transcription factors, enhancers, and gene activation is complex. The specific genetic sequences of enhancers differ between species, changing the way these genetic switches work. But scientists are not yet able to reliably predict the effects of small changes in the DNA sequence of an enhancer. One way to tackle this problem is to look at different versions of the same enhancers side by side to see how small mutations change their behaviour.</p><p>Mammalian cells generally carry two copies of each chromosome (the molecules that contain the genetic code), one inherited from each parent. Each of the two copies carries the same genes and enhancers, but there are many small differences in the DNA sequences of enhancers between the chromosomes inherited from each parent, which can potentially alter their function</p><p>Yang, Ling et al. generated cells from mice that come from different inbred strains, which are similar to purebred dogs. By breeding two distinct inbred mouse strains together that are very different from one another, they generated a panel of hybrid mouse cell lines that have a relatively large number of differences in their DNA sequence between the maternal and paternal chromosomes.</p><p>Looking at the different versions of each enhancer side-by-side revealed thousands of single letter changes in the DNA sequence of enhancers that changed how they work. Mutations affecting the binding site of one transcription factor within an enhancer can indirectly affect the binding of other types of transcription factors. Yang, Ling et al. found that if a transcription factor could no longer find its place on an enhancer, it stopped others from binding even if their own places had not changed. Sometimes, mutations on either side of the binding sequences also affected transcription factor binding. This suggests a more complex relationship than previously thought may exist between the DNA sequence of an enhancer and the transcription factors that bind to it.</p><p>Spotting the differences caused by mutations could help further the efforts of scientists to read and write the genetic code. This could have many benefits. It would allow scientists to control natural or artificial genes, and to predict the effects of genetic changes that are identified in humans with genetic diseases. This might improve genetic experiments, medical screening, gene therapy, and our understanding of evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32EY00711030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Marty G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AG000222</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Marty G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE0946799</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ling</surname><given-names>Emi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE1144152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ling</surname><given-names>Emi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS115965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenberg</surname><given-names>Michael E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Large-scale, allele-resolved mapping of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory function in F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid mice reveals sequence determinants that control transcription factor binding and enhancer activity in native chromatin context.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome sequencing efforts have uncovered large numbers of sequence variants associated with phenotypic variation in complex traits in human populations. A significant proportion of these genetic variants occur within the ~2–3 x 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (CREs) predicted across the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carroll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Maurano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Pickrell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>). The majority of these CREs are thought to be gene-distal enhancers that potentiate gene transcription in a cell type- or cell state-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Keilwagen et al., 2019</xref>). However, pinpointing the specific sequence changes in CREs that impact expression of linked genes, and downstream molecular and cellular phenotypes, remains a critical challenge in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Farh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Nasser et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lappalainen and MacArthur, 2021</xref>). More specifically, it is difficult to reliably distinguish functional sequence variants at CREs among a large excess of neutral variants. As a result, functional assays, such as plasmid-based reporters, have typically been used to assess the impact of individual sequence variants within enhancers. Since these experiments can be laborious to perform and subject to experimental artifacts, a better method for defining sequence-to-function relationships for enhancers in their endogenous genomic context could have a transformative effect on our ability to identify functional sequence variants in CREs in human genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Klein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Levo and Segal, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Enhancers are typically bound by ~4–5 TFs that recognize short sequence motifs (~6–12 nucleotides; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bilu and Barkai, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Meuleman et al., 2020</xref>). TFs function as adaptor proteins to recruit transcriptional regulatory complexes to enhancers, leading to potentiation of transcription at associated gene promoters. Enhancer activity is highly cell type-specific, and this specificity of function is encoded by the type and arrangement (also known as regulatory grammar) of TF-binding motifs within each enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zeitlinger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jindal and Farley, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Long et al., 2016</xref>). Enhancers that control transcription in specific cell types are often bound by combinations of TFs that occur uniquely in that cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). This complicates efforts to identify generalizable features that can be used to prioritize enhancer sequence variants <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kasowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ding et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tehranchi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although enhancers cannot be defined by a singular set of sequence features, they do exhibit stereotyped chromatin features that can be measured genome-wide, such as chromatin accessibility (controlled by TF and co-factor binding), histone post-translational modifications (e.g. H3K4me1/2 and H3K27ac), and bi-directional transcription of short enhancer RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>). These chromatin signatures have been used extensively to identify millions of putative enhancers in a wide range of cell types and across different stages of organismal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kundaje et al., 2015</xref>). While mapping genomic regions that function as enhancers has facilitated the identification of DNA-binding motifs enriched at enhancers in different cell types, these data have not proven to be sufficient to generate quantitative, predictive models for TF binding and enhancer function from available databases of enhancer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deplancke et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Sequence variants that disrupt TF binding can be highly informative for identifying sequences critical for the control of enhancer function in specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wittkopp and Kalay, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert and Kruglyak, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lappalainen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Pai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>). Our lab and others have previously used the extensive genetic variation present among inbred mouse strains to conduct ‘mutagenesis screens’ of enhancer sequences in their native chromatin context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heinz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">van der Veeken et al., 2019</xref>). By crossing highly divergent inbred mouse strains to generate F<sub>1</sub> hybrids, it is possible to directly compare the activity of two alleles of each enhancer locus within the same cellular environment.</p><p>Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from two distinct inbred strains, we found that the binding of AP-1 TFs is required for chromatin accessibility and activity at many active enhancers in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>). However, we also observed that many instances of allele-specific AP-1 binding cannot be readily explained by sequence variants within AP-1 motif(s). These data indicated that, at many enhancer loci, sequence features outside of AP-1 TF-binding sites contribute to AP-1 binding. In this previous study, we observed an enrichment of variants in motifs for putative collaborating TFs (e.g. TEAD) at these sites, but the nature of this collaborative relationship with AP-1 remained to be defined. Both AP-1 and TEAD are broadly expressed and have critical roles in mediating signal-dependent transcription downstream of the Ras/MAPK and Hippo/YAP/TAZ pathways, respectively. Consistent with our findings, the co-occurrence of AP-1 and TEAD motifs at enhancers has also been noted in a variety of human tumor cells, providing support for the idea that AP-1 and TEAD coordinately regulate cell fate and proliferation. Therefore, delineation of the sequence features that determine the binding of AP-1 and TEAD TFs to enhancers could provide insight into enhancer function across a broad range of cellular contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zanconato et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we carried out an extensive allele-specific analysis of chromatin state (ATAC-seq, H3K27ac, H3K4me1/2, and H3K4me3) and TF binding (Fos, Tead1, and CTCF) in F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid MEFs derived from crosses between C57BL/6 J mice and a panel of nine inbred mouse lines, including several wild-derived inbred strains from distinct sub-species of mice that contain a high frequency of SNPs/indels (1 in every ~85–170 bp) compared to C57BL/6 J mice. Using these genetically divergent strains, we examined the frequency and distribution of SNPs/indels at thousands of enhancers with allele-specific chromatin features and/or TF binding patterns. We found that sequence variants within the central ~50 bp of enhancer sequences were most likely to lead to an allele-specific change in enhancer activity. These data also revealed that AP-1 binding is often required for TEAD TF binding to enhancers, whereas TEAD is generally dispensable for AP-1 TF binding. This result is consistent with a model in which AP-1 TFs function as pioneer factors and facilitate binding of additional TFs during enhancer selection in fibroblasts. An analysis of our allele-specific data revealed that sequence features, such as partial AP-1 motifs and nucleotide sequences flanking core AP-1 binding motifs, also contribute to enhancer function. These findings provide new insight into how AP-1 TFs function at enhancers in fibroblasts, and suggest that across other cell types, AP-1 TFs may employ similar collaborative binding mechanisms at enhancers. In addition, our data provide new insight into the crosstalk between Ras/MAPK and Hippo/YAP/TAZ/TEAD signal-dependent gene expression and suggest that Ras/MAPK-induced AP-1 can play an instructive role in determining the output of Hippo/YAP/TAZ/TEAD-dependent transcriptional programs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping TF binding and CREs in F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid MEFs</title><p>To identify genetic variants that modulate TF binding and/or chromatin state at CREs, we isolated MEFs from male F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid embryos derived from crosses between C57BL/6 J females and males from nine distinct inbred mouse strains, including four wild-derived inbred strains (CAST/EiJ, MOLF/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and SPRET/EiJ) that have a high frequency of SNPs/indels compared to C57BL/6 J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

These defined conditions reduce technical variability between samples by synchronizing cells in the population at a specific stage of the cell cycle and allow us to measure the binding of TFs that are induced by serum stimulation, such as AP-1 TFs, at the peak of their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Allele-specific mapping of CREs and TF binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid male MEFs were derived from crosses between female C57BL/6 J mice and male mice from a panel of inbred mouse strains.

For instance, it is thought that H3K4me1/2 deposition is indicative of enhancers that have been partially activated or primed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>). However, it is not known whether the majority of these primed sites only become active later in development (i.e. subsequently gain H3K27ac; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bogdanovic et al., 2012</xref>), or if they typically are fully activated in a single step (i.e. concurrently gain H3K4me1/2 and H3K27ac), such as upon the binding of signal-dependent TFs or during cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kaikkonen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ostuni et al., 2013</xref>). To address these hypotheses, we examined our allele-specific H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 ChIP-seq datasets, which contain thousands of allele pairs that have significant differences in these histone modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Our previous work suggested that disruption of AP-1 TF binding results in the loss of histone marks associated with both primed and active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>), but whether this feature is generally applicable for all enhancers (independent of AP-1 binding) and whether there are mutations that inactivate enhancers without affecting H3K4me1/2 levels were unresolved. To assess whether the priming and activation of enhancers are genetically separable processes, we focused on H3K4me1/2 levels at enhancers with the greatest difference in H3K27ac levels between alleles. We observed that 70.1<italic>%</italic> of enhancers in the top decile of allele-specific enhancers have a significant and &gt;2-fold concordant loss of H3K4me1 on the inactive allele, compared to 0.6% of the bottom decile of allele-specific enhancers (peaks with the smallest, statistically significant fold changes in H3K27ac levels between alleles). Chromatin accessibility and AP-1 binding exhibit similar changes to H3K4me1 at enhancers with strongly allele-specific H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Together, these data reveal that few if any SNPs/indels cause a significant loss of enhancer H3K27ac and maintain strong enrichment of H3K4me1/2 and chromatin accessibility. Thus, our data is consistent with a model in which enhancer priming/selection and activation are not separable steps mediated by distinct TF-binding events at enhancers in MEFs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Contribution of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting effects on enhancer activity</title><p>In F<sub>1</sub> hybrids, both enhancer alleles are exposed to the same nucleoplasmic environment, and thus observed differences between the two alleles are generally considered to be caused directly by local SNPs (i.e. SNPs within the ~200 bp sequence of chromatin accessibility at the CRE in question). However, each enhancer allele is also located within a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory unit or topologically associated domain (TAD), which contains additional genetic changes outside of the enhancer itself that could potentially impact TF binding or chromatin state at the enhancer in an allele-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kilpinen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grubert et al., 2015</xref>). These ‘locus-scale’ <italic>cis</italic>-acting mechanisms could include: (1) sequence variants in other CREs at the same locus that interact with an enhancer in 3D, (2) gains or losses in CTCF-binding sites that influence 3D interactions between CREs within the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory unit associated with that enhancer, (3) structural variants that disrupt the organization of the locus such that the enhancer is subject to different 3D interactions, and (4) variation in repeat elements (e.g. LINEs, SINEs) within the locus that are not generally well annotated in genomic datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ou et al., 2019</xref>). Another possible explanation for allele-specific activity of CREs is parent-of-origin specific imprinting. We excluded CREs at known imprinted loci from subsequent analyses due to the differing nature of this type of allele-specific transcriptional regulation.</p><p>To quantify the relative impact of these <italic>cis</italic>-acting, locus-level mechanisms, we analyzed sequencing reads from our allele-specific histone modification datasets, which typically flank the functional CRE sequence and can thus be mapped to one allele or the other even when there are no SNPs present in the accessible chromatin window at enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We reasoned that enhancers lacking SNPs/indels should only show an allelic skew in H3K27ac levels when these aforementioned non-local mechanisms significantly contribute to the function of those enhancers. Only 9.1% of enhancers that have no SNPs/indels in their central 150 bp (centered on the ATAC-seq summit used to initially define the CRE) exhibit a significant, allele-specific, &gt;2-fold skew in H3K27ac levels on flanking nucleosomes, compared to 22.1% of enhancers with SNPs/indels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This result suggests that it is relatively rare for SNPs outside the enhancer sequence itself to influence the function of the enhancer in question. In addition, allele-specific 0-SNP enhancers are not situated significantly closer (than H3K27ac-matched shared 0-SNP enhancers) to an allele-specific CTCF peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>), suggesting that rearrangement of CTCF-dependent TAD boundaries is not a major contributor to allele-specific differences in enhancer activity at these sites. However, among 0-SNP enhancers, those with allele-specific H3K27ac signal were more likely to be located near another allele-specific enhancer that has at least one SNP/indel (median = 48,623 bp and 75,664 bp for allele-specific and shared 0-SNP enhancers, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast, allele-specific and shared 0-SNP enhancers did not exhibit significant differences in their proximity to active CREs in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we observed that allele-specific 0-SNP enhancers are frequently located in enhancer clusters with another allele-specific enhancer (within ~1–2 kb apart). In such cases, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that the quantification of H3K27ac-marked nucleosomes flanking the 0-SNP enhancer is not simply detecting diffuse signal from other enhancer(s) in the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, based on H3K27ac Hi-ChIP, we rarely observed 0-SNP allele-specific enhancers connected via a long-range loop (e.g. &gt;10 kb) with another allele-specific SNP/indel-containing enhancer in the same TAD. Thus, while previous studies have observed that allele-specific enhancers tend to be highly interconnected with other allele-specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prescott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Link et al., 2018</xref>), which has been interpreted to suggest that CREs within the same topological domain can modulate each other’s function, our data indicate that locus-scale, <italic>cis</italic>-acting mechanisms exert limited effects on enhancer activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Number and position of genetic variants at allele-specific CREs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting TF-bound enhancer with zero SNPs/indels (denoted by red X’s) in the transposase-accessible CRE region (indicated in orange).

Across nine F1-hybrid strains, we identified a total of 29,185 pairs of enhancer alleles with a significant and &gt;2-fold difference in H3K27ac levels between alleles. Allele-specific enhancers have a significantly higher frequency of SNPs/indels than H3K27ac signal-matched shared enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, enhancers with a greater number of genetic variants are more likely to show larger quantitative differences in H3K27ac levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>).

For AP-1, the k-mer identified by KMAC (5’-VTGACTCAB-3’; V indicates A/C/G and B indicates C/G/T) includes the known core AP-1 site (known as a TRE; TGASTCA; S indicates C/G), which is bound by heterodimers of Fos and Jun family TFs or homodimers of Jun family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Risse et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eferl and Wagner, 2003</xref>). VTGACTCAB is the most enriched k-mer at active fibroblast enhancers (30.8%, versus 1.6% of control sequences; AUC = 0.450). AP-1 TFs bind DNA as dimers, with the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding domain of each Fos/Jun monomer recognizing half of a palindromic consensus motif. Because k-mer based motif representations make it possible to capture internucleotide dependencies (that are lost in position weight matrix (PWM) representations of TF-binding motifs), we were able to observe that certain flanking nucleotides on either side of the TRE are strongly depleted from bound AP-1 motifs relative to all occurrences genome-wide (i.e. T and A were depleted from the nucleotide on the 5’ and 3’ ends of the AP-1/TRE motif, respectively).</p><p>KMAC also identified an enriched k-mer (5’-GGAATK-3’; K indicates G/T) that matches the known core binding motif for the TEAD family of TFs (GGAAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Farrance et al., 1992</xref>) and includes an additional restricted nucleotide on the 3’ end (10.9%, versus 0.6% of control sequences; AUC = 0.289).

We performed a series of validations to ensure that distinct methods (ChIP-seq and CUT&amp;RUN) were providing similar quantitative information on TF-binding levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-G</xref>).

Recent in vitro studies of AP-1 binding affinity to AP-1/TRE motifs suggests that the three nucleotides flanking the core AP-1 motif (TGASTCA) can strongly modulate AP-1 TF binding by altering the shape of the AP-1/TRE motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Leonard and Kerppola, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Rohs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yella et al., 2018</xref>).

These data indicate that AP-1 and TEAD motifs are the most enriched TF motifs within active enhancers in fibroblasts and functionally validate the importance of motif-flanking nucleotides for TF binding in the native chromatin context.</p><p>We next sought to use our allele-specific TF-binding data to perform a targeted analysis of how an allele-specific loss in AP-1 or TEAD occupancy impacts enhancer chromatin state. We separately identified a set of active enhancers that have a single instance of their core motifs (TGACTCA or GGAAT) and have a SNP/indel that alters this binding motif into a sequence not predicted to bind AP-1 or TEAD based on in vitro binding experiments, respectively. For both classes of TFs, motif-disrupting SNPs are correlated with a marked loss of binding of their cognate TFs, as expected, but this incomplete loss (in aggregate) also suggests that SNPs within core motifs alone are not completely predictive of changes in AP-1 or TEAD binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and J</xref>). Loss of AP-1 binding is associated with a substantial decrease in chromatin accessibility, H3K4me1/2, and H3K27ac levels on the allele with the mutated AP-1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>), consistent with our previous observations from a smaller set of enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>). This finding suggests that at enhancers that contain a single consensus AP-1 site and are bound by Fos/Jun, a variant that changes a nucleotide in the core AP-1 motif is likely to result in a complete loss of enhancer function, consistent with data from a smaller set of plasmid-based reporters that suggest AP-1 motifs are required for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Malik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).

Nevertheless, these data suggest that both AP-1 and TEAD motifs play a central role in enhancer function in fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>AP-1 TFs facilitate binding of TEAD TFs to enhancers</title><p>Although SNPs that disrupt core TF-binding motifs (AP-1, TEAD, and ETS) are enriched at enhancers with allele-specific TF binding, our data also indicate that SNPs in these motifs are not sufficient to explain all instances of functional variation between enhancer alleles. For example, among all enhancers in the top decile of allele-specific H3K27ac signal, only 13.3% had a SNP/indel overlapping a core AP-1, TEAD, and/or ETS motif in their central region. In contrast, we found that 21.5% of allele-specific CTCF binding sites (with &gt;2-fold difference in CTCF signal) that contain a CTCF motif (identified using position weight matrix match) had at least one SNP/indel overlapping the CTCF binding site. These data favor a model in which other types of SNPs outside core TF-binding motifs can collectively modulate enhancer activity.</p><p>In previous work, we found that strain-specific instances of AP-1 TF binding in MEFs (in a comparison of two inbred mouse strains) that lack a mutation in a core AP-1 site were enriched for SNPs in TEAD motifs, suggesting a model in which AP-1 binding was dependent, at least in part, on the presence of TEAD binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>). However, we lacked TEAD binding data, which prevented us from examining in depth the sequence determinants and functional relationship of AP-1 and TEAD binding at enhancers across the genome. Other data have suggested that AP-1 and TEAD TFs coordinately regulate transcriptional programs critical for cell growth and proliferation during normal development and in the context of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zanconato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">He et al., 2021</xref>). Since multiple AP-1 and TEAD TFs are also often co-expressed in the same cell types and can play functionally redundant roles with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Seo et al., 2021</xref>), it has been difficult to examine how these two TFs that exhibit extensive co-occupancy work together at enhancers to regulate gene transcription. With our newly generated AP-1 and TEAD binding data across four wild-derived inbred F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid lines, we could more systematically examine a larger number of loci to define the functional relationship between AP-1 and TEAD.</p><p>We first quantified how often consensus TF motifs are mutated at allele-specific versus shared AP-1 and TEAD peaks. If the binding of a given TF was entirely dependent on the occupancy of another TF, we would expect to observe a similar loss in binding of the dependent TF, regardless of which TF motif was mutated. For these analyses, we included all distal Fos and Tead1 peaks in our dataset, including those that do not co-occur with H3K27ac. We observed that AP-1 motif mutations are frequently associated with a loss of TEAD binding, whereas AP-1 binding is more weakly affected by TEAD motif mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Strikingly, AP-1 motif mutations were as enriched at allele-specific TEAD peaks as TEAD mutations were (compared to sites with shared TEAD binding). Analysis of AP-1 and TEAD co-bound sites (independent of whether they contained consensus AP-1 or TEAD motifs) further supported a hierarchical binding relationship between these TFs. For example, 50.2% (n=821/1635 allele pairs) of allele-specific Fos-bound sites also exhibit an allele-specific loss of Tead1 binding, whereas only 8.7% (n=821/9416 allele pairs) of allele-specific Tead1 peaks showed significant allele-specific Fos signal. In summary, these data are consistent with previous studies that suggest that AP-1 can serve as a pioneer TF to facilitate the binding of other TFs, such as the glucocorticoid receptor, PU.1, and C/EBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biddie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heinz et al., 2013</xref>), and that AP-1 binding is required for inducible chromatin remodeling and nucleosome displacement at late-response gene enhancers in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mechanisms of hierarchical binding for AP-1 and TEAD TFs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Percentage of allele-specific (n=1635 allele pairs) versus shared (n=142,778 allele pairs) gene-distal Fos peaks that contain strain-specific core AP-1 (TGASTCA; Fisher’s exact test, p&lt;2.2 x 10<sup>–16</sup>) or extended TEAD (GGAATK; Fisher’s exact test, p=2.123 x 10<sup>–9</sup>) k-mer(s) within 75 bp of their respective ATAC-seq summits.

However, we observed a ~2-fold greater frequency of AP-1 half sites containing SNPs (TGASVDB) in allele-specific versus shared Fos peaks (mean = 0.25 and 0.13 occurrences per peak, respectively), suggesting that AP-1 half sites contribute to AP-1 TF binding in chromatin. However, based on our prior analysis of mutations in full AP-1 sites, it is clear that disruption of one of two half sites within an AP-1 consensus motif has a strong effect on AP-1 binding in most cases, which suggests that AP-1 half sites alone might not be sufficient for binding without another intact AP-1 motif at the same enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>). Thus, we favor a model in which AP-1 half sites play an accessory role in modulating levels of AP-1 occupancy, and are unlikely to be sufficient for AP-1 binding by themselves in the absence of a full AP-1 motif.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Identification of k-mers predictive of AP-1 binding and/or activity using machine learning</title><p>Since core TF-binding motifs alone cannot fully distinguish TF-bound alleles from those in which TFs are bound, we reasoned that additional k-mers could contribute to our ability to distinguish TF-bound sites versus non-bound sites in the C57BL/6 J genome, and we considered the possibility that identification of these k-mers might help identify other motifs that are recurrently mutated in our allele-specific TF-binding data. Therefore, we applied a gapped k-mer SVM approach (gkm-SVM) to our datasets that has been optimized to detect k-mers of similar length to typical TF-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ghandi et al., 2016</xref>). Support vector machine (SVM) algorithms have been utilized in a variety of contexts to perform classification of DNA sequences in a supervised manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barozzi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ghandi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Van den Bosch et al., 2022</xref>). It should be noted that k-mers identified by gkm-SVM are simply DNA sequences of k length that can discriminate two sets of input sequences, and do not necessarily correspond to TF-binding sites per se.</p><p>We first compared 60 bp of DNA sequences from AP-1 peaks in C57BL/6 J MEFs (positive set) to GC- and length-matched, randomly sampled background DNA sequences from the C57BL/6 J genome (negative set). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC = 0.872) from this gkm-SVM analysis is highly similar to the corresponding value obtained from a control analysis of CTCF peaks from human cells, suggesting that the gkm-SVM is able to classify Fos-bound and unbound regions with a low rate of detecting false positives while correctly assigning true negatives. Similarly, a relatively high value for the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC = 0.881) indicates that the gkm-SVM is able to reliably distinguish true and false positives. Together, these results suggest that the information within the central 60 bp sequences (+/-30 bp relative to the ATAC-seq summit) at Fos-bound peaks is sufficient to train a model to reliably distinguish Fos-bound sites from control non-coding regions of the same genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Inclusion of additional sequence beyond this central 60 bp (up to a total of 300 bp) had only a slight positive effect on the performance of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Conversely, shortening of DNA sequence below 60 bp resulted in a drop-off in performance of the model. k-mers containing AP-1 sites were the largest contributors to the performance of the model, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Next, to determine whether sequences outside of the AP-1 motif contribute to the performance of the model, we repeated this same analysis, but we computationally masked all occurrences of core AP-1 sites. This revealed a slight drop in AUROC (unmasked = 0.874, masked = 0.804) and AUPRC (unmasked = 0.884, masked = 0.794) values, suggesting that the model retains some predictive capacity when core AP-1 motif sequences are excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Machine learning prediction of AP-1 binding sites genome-wide.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Area under ROC and P-R curves for gkm-SVM comparison of Fos peaks in the C57BL/6 J genome (positive set) and length-matched, random genomic regions (negative set).

When we ran the gkm-SVM on CTCF peaks, we observed a highly distinct set of enriched k-mers from those found at AP-1 peaks. Many of these identified k-mers matched the well-documented CTCF binding site, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and G</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to apply this gkm-SVM approach to attempt to identify k-mers that distinguish between AP-1 binding sites with and without H3K27ac. Our data indicate that the AP-1 binding is required for the function of many of the active enhancers at which they bind in MEFs. However, AP-1 binding alone is clearly not sufficient for enhancer activity. For example, 34.9% of gene-distal Fos peaks do not overlap H3K27ac peaks. This suggests that the sequence features that are permissive for AP-1 binding in MEFs might be separable from those that confer activity. For this gkm-SVM analysis, we selected a curated set of Fos-bound allele pairs (n=2,697) that (1) have equivalent levels of Fos binding, (2) contain a consensus AP-1 site on both alleles, but (3) exhibit allele-specific H3K27ac levels. We input 60 bp DNA sequences (centered on the shared AP-1 consensus motif) from the active (positive set) and inactive (negative set) alleles at Fos-bound enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). In contrast to the results above, the gkm-SVM failed to discriminate between these two sets of sites (AUROC = 0.086 and AUPRC = 0.318), suggesting that sequence features predictive of H3K27ac are more complex and cannot be readily captured by this k-mer based SVM approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Generalizability of sequence determinants of AP-1 binding across cell types and species</title><p>Having defined some features of sequences that determine AP-1 binding to CREs in MEFs, we next extend our analyses to data derived from a larger number of other cell types. To do this, we used DNase-seq footprinting data generated from a large panel of human tissues and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Vierstra et al., 2020</xref>). These data provide an unbiased view of individual TF-DNA binding interactions within CREs.</p><p>First, we identified TF footprints that overlap an extended AP-1 motif (VTGACTCAB) within CREs, which we interpret as individual instances of AP-1 binding. We found a total of 164,705 TF footprints (from among &gt;4 × 10<sup>6</sup> total footprinted regions) that contain VTGACTCAB motifs. These AP-1 footprints were centrally enriched within CREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>,) consistent with the distribution of AP-1 k-mers observed at AP-1 bound peaks in MEFs, as well as previous data examining AP-1 motif frequency within human DNase-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grossman et al., 2017</xref>). The majority of AP-1 footprints were &lt;30 bp in width (83.3%; median = 17 bp), which suggests that they represent the footprint caused by binding of a single AP-1 homo/heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). CREs with AP-1 footprints typically have a total of ~3–4 additional TF footprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), and the median distance between AP-1 footprints and the nearest other TF footprint is ~24 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). gkm-SVM analysis of sequences flanking AP-1 footprints (60 bp windows) revealed an enrichment of TEAD and ETS k-mers, consistent with our observations at AP-1 bound sites in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Together, these data suggest a model in which AP-1 is critical for CRE function across many cell types and provide further insight into the nature of TF-binding events that occur with AP-1 binding at CREs active across cellular contexts, such as TEAD and ETS. These data will be valuable for disentangling the complex sequence features that control AP-1 binding and enhancer function across diverse cell types and tissues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we leverage natural genetic variation across inbred mouse strains to identify sequence variants associated with differential TF binding and/or enhancer activity in their endogenous genomic context. To systematically assess the effect of many genetic variants on CRE function, we mapped TF binding (AP-1, TEAD, CTCF) and multiple chromatin features (ATAC-seq, H3K27ac, H3K4me1/2, H3K4me3) in up to ten distinct alleles for each CRE locus. By assessing the frequency and distribution of genetic variants at large numbers of CREs with shared or allele-specific TF binding and/or <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory activity, we define features of <italic>cis</italic>-acting genetic variants that are most predictive of differences in chromatin state and/or TF binding.</p><p>We find from our analysis of enhancer alleles with different H3K27ac levels that loss of the active enhancer histone modification H3K27ac is generally not genetically separable from loss of H3K4me1/2. This is interesting to consider given a number of previous observations about the relative contribution of these histone modifications to enhancer function: (1) we previously found that enhancers that regulate late-response genes exhibit H3K4me1 enrichment in serum-starved MEFs, but have low chromatin accessibility and lack H3K27ac, and upon serum-stimulation, gain H3K27 acetylation and inducibly bind AP-1 TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>), (2) recent studies suggest that enhancers with H3K4me1 enrichment that lack H3K27ac are not, in fact, poised for future activity, but instead that this chromatin state is a remnant of activity in a recent, prior developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kim and Shiekhattar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jadhav et al., 2019</xref>), and (3) catalytic mutants of Mll3/4, enzymes responsible for H3K4me1/2 deposition, do not appear to affect recruitment of RNA polymerase II to enhancers suggesting that the H3K4me1/2 modification is not required for enhancer function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dorighi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Rickels et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that in a given cell type or context, H3K4me1/2-only enhancers might exhibit different <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory features compared to enhancers that have H3K27ac enrichment because they represent enhancers that were active in a previous developmental stage characterized by a distinct complement of TFs expressed.</p><p>The functional sequence variants between inbred mouse strains that we identified provide insight into enhancer turnover that occurs across evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Villar et al., 2015</xref>). We find that greater numbers of SNPs/indels at enhancers are correlated with higher probabilities of allele-specific enhancer activity, and that allele-specific enhancers in fibroblasts are also less conserved across species than shared enhancers. Enhancers are thought to turn over rapidly because many loci contain multiple enhancers with overlapping <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory activity, such that loss of any individual single enhancer is often insufficient to cause a large change in gene expression and/or result in an organismal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>). It would also be interesting to examine how the impact of SNPs on enhancer activity correlates with their frequency in natural populations or whether the SNP represents a derived or ancestral state across the broader rodent lineage, as SNPs with larger impacts on enhancer function would be expected to be found at lower frequencies if they are potentially deleterious to overall fitness.</p><p>We also found that SNPs/indels that are associated with allele-specific H3K27ac levels tend to occur within ~50 bp of the center of the accessible chromatin region used to define enhancer sequences. This is further supported by enhancer loci in which alleles differ by a single SNP/indel. At such enhancer alleles, these single sequence variants are almost certainly causal and thus likely to explain observed differences in enhancer activity. Together, these data suggest that SNPs within the central region of enhancers should be prioritized in genome-wide association studies for human traits and/or disease risk.</p><p>The distribution of SNPs that impact AP-1 binding to enhancers is interesting to consider in the context of a recent paper that looked at sequence features that distinguish AP-1 bound enhancers with high versus low activity in reporter assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chaudhari and Cohen, 2018</xref>). Their analysis using a supervised machine learning approach (gkm-SVM) suggests that most of the variation in AP-1 bound enhancer activity can be predicted using input sequences that consist of the AP-1 core motif and an additional +/-10 bp on each side. The close proximity of these sequences to AP-1 sites contrasts with the broader window (+/- 50 bp relative to AP-1 motifs) that we observe to be important for determining AP-1 binding to chromatin in fibroblasts. More generally, these observations suggest that the sequence determinants of enhancer activity might be more complex within the genomic context than what has been observed in reporter assays. In addition, we found that the gkm-SVM has limited ability to predict activity levels of AP-1 bound sites, suggesting that deep learning approaches might be required to delineate higher order sequence features associated with active enhancers in a given cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avsec et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Almeida et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The observed requirement for AP-1 for TEAD binding to enhancers is interesting to consider given that these two distinct TFs have been previously shown to co-regulate gene expression programs associated with cell proliferation and tissue growth. Both AP-1 and TEAD are transcriptional effectors of intercellular signaling pathways. AP-1 TFs are activated by Ras/MAPK signaling and TEAD TFs are required for the binding of the transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ, whose nuclear localization is directly regulated by Hippo signaling. Our data suggests a mechanism for crosstalk between these two signaling pathways in which the transcriptional output of the Hippo pathway can be modulated depending on whether Ras/MAPK is active or not. This instructive function of AP-1 in selecting the enhancers at which TEAD TFs can bind is similar to the role for AP-1 in facilitating the binding of transcriptional effectors from several other signaling pathways, including the glucocorticoid receptor, NF-κB, and SMAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biddie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heinz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Enhancer sequences tend to be occluded by histone octamers prior to TF binding, suggesting that during the process of enhancer selection, some TFs must be able to bind to their cognate motifs in a nucleosomal context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Tillo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barozzi et al., 2014</xref>). This complicates efforts to determine sequence features required for TF binding because the affinity of a TF for nucleosomal and naked DNA often differ significantly. Furthermore, different classes of TFs utilize distinct mechanisms to engage with their cognate motifs on nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Michael and Thomä, 2021</xref>). Based on in vitro nucleosome-binding studies, bZIP TFs, which include AP-1 TFs, can only bind to their cognate motifs on nucleosomes when their motifs are present on outer regions of nucleosomes (i.e. furthest from predicted dyad locations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">He et al., 2013</xref>). These outer regions are thought to be more accessible for TF binding because they are intermittently unwound from the histone octamer (known as nucleosome breathing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). This is consistent with structural data suggesting that AP-1 TFs cannot bind their full cognate motif (TGASTCA) on nucleosomes due to steric constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Michael and Thomä, 2021</xref>). We observe an enrichment of SNPs in AP-1 half sites (TGASVDB) at allele-specific AP-1 peaks, raising the possibility that partial AP-1 motifs contribute to AP-1 binding to nucleosomal enhancers. The binding to partial motifs has been observed for other nucleosome-binding TFs, such as OCT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we favor a model in which (1) AP-1 recognizes full motifs towards the edges of nucleosomes, (2) AP-1 dimers can then bind both halves of the core AP-1 site when it is accessible upon nucleosome breathing, (3) the initial binding of AP-1 facilitates the binding of other dependent TFs (e.g. TEAD) via collaborative competition to evict the histone octamer and/or recruit co-regulatory proteins and chromatin remodelers to enhancers, and (4) AP-1 might be able to bind half motifs absent nucleosome breathing at any position on the nucleosome. In future, fully delineating sequence requirements for AP-1 binding will require detailed in vitro and structural experiments using naturally occurring enhancer sequences, as well as deep learning approaches applied to genomic data of AP-1 binding from multiple cell types and genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avsec et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid dataset has provided new insights into how DNA sequences within CREs contribute to TF binding and enhancer function.

Our F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid datasets identify thousands of enhancer allele pairs that differ subtly in their DNA sequences and yet have strongly allele-specific functional properties. In the future, incorporating F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid data from additional cell types can further reveal both context-specific and broadly applicable mechanisms of TF binding and enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Halow et al., 2021</xref>).

Two pseudoreplicates consisting of a random subset (50%) of total reads were generated by samtools view -h -b -s 1.5 and samtools view -h -b -s 2.5.

For both macs2 and spp, reads from input DNA pooled from all ChIP-seq experiments were used as the control sample. To analyze consistency of peak calling across pseudoreplicates, we employed an Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Landt et al., 2012</xref>) by running batch-consistency-analysis.R and ranking peaks by p.value for macs2 and signal.value for spp. Peaks with a global IDR score of 0.0025 or less were retained for downstream analyses. Since peaks called across samples from different genotypes can vary somewhat in their specific coordinates, we generated a total universe of possible ATAC-seq peaks by combining all sequencing reads into a single tag directory in HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). We then used the HOMER function getPeakTags with the -center option to generate single bp coordinates with maximal ATAC-seq signal (which we refer to in our manuscript as ATAC-seq summits).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Allele-specific CUT&amp;RUN peak calling</title><p>Peak calling was performed as detailed above for ATAC-seq data, except reads mapping to the C57BL/6 J and corresponding pseudogenome for each F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid line were inputted separately into macs2 and spp. CUT&amp;RUN peaks were then intersected with all ATAC summits detected across all genotypes and were recentered on the summit of ATAC-seq signal. This was important to do because peak calling algorithms that we used would often identify multiple histone modification peaks for individual CREs due to the non-continuous enrichment in signal. This also enabled us to generate uniform windows centered around ATAC-seq summits to consistently quantify signal for CUT&amp;RUN data across different ATAC-seq summits. Peaks from both the C57BL/6 J and pseudogenome were concatenated, and only peaks with at least one SNP/indel within +/-60 bp of the ATAC summit were retained for allele-specific analysis (as highly “mappable” sites). To determine whether the CUT&amp;RUN signal is significantly skewed towards one allele, we used HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) to annotate read coverage with -noadj -size –250,250 for AP-1 and -noadj -size –500,500 for H3K27ac.

We also mapped the positioning of SNPs/indels relative to the ATAC-seq summit by using bedtools window -w 200, and computed the difference in coordinates between the ATAC-seq summit and the closest nucleotide present in the SNP/indel. For defining the locations of putative CTCF motifs, we inputted the MA0139.1 profile from the JASPAR database into FIMO and limited the maximum stored scores to 10<sup>6</sup> per genome. The density of SNPs/indels at regions with significant allele-specific signal was visualized (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–F</xref>) using the geom_histogram function with default parameters (from ggplot2), after centering upon the given coordinate of interest indicated on the horizontal axis.

Bigwig files with phastCons scores for 60 vertebrate species for each mouse mm10 chromosome were obtained from UCSC. For each CRE, we computed a phastCons score for a 150 bp window centered on the ATAC-seq summit using the bigWigAverageOverBed script from UCSC Tools (Version 3.6.3).</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Identifying recurrent k-mer clusters at <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements with KMAC</title><p>Nucleotide sequences present at the central 60 bp of enhancers were extracted using bedtools getfasta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>).

Nucleotide sequences in.fasta format for both alleles of each locus (60 bp window) were obtained with bedtools getfasta and were concatenated across different F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid lines. For performing the active versus inactive Fos-bound site comparison, we used the gkm-SVM package developed by Dr. Michael Beer’s lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ghandi et al., 2016</xref>) and generated the kernel matrix by inputting the active allele DNA sequence (with higher H3K27ac levels) as the positive set and the corresponding inactive allele DNA sequence as the negative set.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Characterization of sequence determinants of enhancer function using natural genetic variation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We all thought the data are quite strong. We have included the full review from both reviewers below and have summarized the essential three items for revision here:</p><p>1) The authors claim &quot;Our findings provide new insight into how enhancer function is encoded within DNA sequences…&quot; but it was hard to see the new insights that were provided. We suggest hardening up the abstract to clarify precisely what the authors have discovered, and considering reorganizing the text to consolidate and focus the introductory material on what is relevant to these key claims.</p><p>2) The overall data set is strong, but they are not utilized to the fullest extent for analyses. For example, no population genetics data were considered. Can the authors examine allele frequency and effect size relationships? Basic population genetics tells us that rare SNPs are more likely to be deleterious. So, in situations where C57BL/6J has the rare allele -- is accessibility and TF binding more likely to be reduced? There are several analyses that could address this general question.</p><p>3) Data sharing through GEO must be complete.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors claim &quot;Our findings provide new insight into how enhancer function is encoded within DNA sequences…&quot; but I had trouble seeing the new insights that were provided here.</p><p>Several claims were made about enhancer priming, selection, and other chromatin kinetics. But to really understand this, I think one needs time series data, which is not part of the present study.</p><p>In the Allele-specific CUT&amp;RUN peak calling section, what does it mean to recenter a CUT&amp;RUN peak onto an ATAC-seq summit? Are you shifting the coordinates of the CUT&amp;RUN peak so the middle occurs where the ATAC summit is located? Does this make sense to do? Given that a modified histone should not occur at the same place as an open chromatin summit, I'm not sure why this was done. Perhaps there are missing details that should be here.</p><p>It looks like there are issues with the GEO upload and these should be resolved before the manuscript is finalized.</p><p>The abstract claim of &quot;impact of sequence variation on enhancer function&quot; seems a little broad.</p><p>Sometimes, the figures should be labeled more clearly. For example, Figure 6A-B has two different line colors but these are not explained with a color key in the figure.</p><p>Figure 2H-J and every panel in Figure 5 have typos on the x-axis. -100 is incorrectly plotted as -10.</p><p>The acronym CRE is used extensively throughout the paper, beginning in the second sentence of the introduction, but is never defined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The abstract is pretty general and did not help me figure out what the main claims of the paper were. I had difficulty triangulating the claim I found most interesting with its description in the narrative and the data in the figures. For example, the abstract claims &quot;our data…reveal a hierarchical relationship between AP-1 and TEAD TF binding at enhancers&quot; (lines 38-39), which is too vague. The relevant section begins on page 21, but includes two paragraphs of introduction before arriving at the new claim. I would suggest hardening up the abstract to clarify precisely what the authors have discovered, and considering reorganizing the text to consolidate and focus the introductory material on what is relevant to these key claims.</p><p>2) I found the use of the term &quot;k-mer&quot; confusing. It appears that the authors use this as shorthand for &quot;TF recognition sequence&quot; or &quot;motif match&quot;, but sometimes as meaning TF consensus/motif (e.g. the AP1 consensus in line 666).

We have included the full review from both reviewers below and have summarized the essential three items for revision here:</p><p>1) The authors claim &quot;Our findings provide new insight into how enhancer function is encoded within DNA sequences…&quot; but it was hard to see the new insights that were provided. We suggest hardening up the abstract to clarify precisely what the authors have discovered, and considering reorganizing the text to consolidate and focus the introductory material on what is relevant to these key claims.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the feedback from the reviewers, we have modified the abstract to better highlight the new findings in the manuscript. We have also extensively edited the introduction of the revised manuscript so that it is more focused.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The overall data set is strong, but they are not utilized to the fullest extent for analyses. For example, no population genetics data were considered. Can the authors examine allele frequency and effect size relationships? Basic population genetics tells us that rare SNPs are more likely to be deleterious. So, in situations where C57BL/6J has the rare allele -- is accessibility and TF binding more likely to be reduced? There are several analyses that could address this general question.</p></disp-quote><p>It would be interesting to examine the relationship between allele frequency and effect size relationships, however, we do not think that our experimental design is appropriate for this analysis because all of our F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid cells were generated by crossing inbred mouse lines to C57BL/6J mice. Each inbred strain was originally derived from a relatively small number of mice from wild populations that were subsequently inbred for many generations. Thus, each inbred strain is homozygous for most alleles across the genome, and as a result is only representative of a small fraction of the diversity of alleles present in the natural population from which these mice were first caught. The allele frequency across each of these inbred strains is thus not indicative of their frequency in natural populations. In the future, it would be interesting to examine this question in a more appropriate context, such as commercially available outbred mouse strains. This is mentioned in the revised discussion (Lines 740-745).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Data sharing through GEO must be complete.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for reminding us about this critical issue. All of the data is now uploaded and publicly available via the following accession number: GSE193728. The GEO accession number has also been added to the revised manuscript (Lines 1313-1314).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors claim &quot;Our findings provide new insight into how enhancer function is encoded within DNA sequences…&quot; but I had trouble seeing the new insights that were provided here.</p><p>Several claims were made about enhancer priming, selection, and other chromatin kinetics. But to really understand this, I think one needs time series data, which is not part of the present study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the discussion of chromatin kinetics at enhancers from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Allele-specific CUT&amp;RUN peak calling section, what does it mean to recenter a CUT&amp;RUN peak onto an ATAC-seq summit? Are you shifting the coordinates of the CUT&amp;RUN peak so the middle occurs where the ATAC summit is located? Does this make sense to do? Given that a modified histone should not occur at the same place as an open chromatin summit, I'm not sure why this was done. Perhaps there are missing details that should be here.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not explaining this in sufficient detail. In the Methods section of the revised manuscript, we have included a more detailed description of how we uniformly called ATAC-seq peaks across different genotypes and our rationale for doing so, reproduced here (Lines 1126-1131):</p><p>“Since peaks called across samples from different genotypes can vary somewhat in their specific coordinates, we generated a total universe of possible ATAC-seq peaks by combining all sequencing reads into a single tag directory in HOMER (Heinz <italic>et al</italic>., 2010). We then used the HOMER function getPeakTags with the -center option to generate single bp coordinates with maximal ATAC-seq signal (which we refer to in our manuscript as ATAC-seq summits).”</p><p>Moreover, we clarified what we intended by recentering a CUT&amp;RUN peak onto an ATAC-seq summit, reproduced here (Lines 1134-1140):</p><p>“Peak calling was performed as detailed above for ATAC-seq data, except reads mapping to the C57BL/6J and corresponding pseudogenome for each F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid line were inputted separately into macs2 and spp. CUT&amp;RUN peaks were then intersected with all ATAC summits detected across all genotypes and were recentered on the summit of ATAC-seq signal. This was important to do because peak calling algorithms that we used would often identify multiple histone modification peaks for individual CREs due to the non-continuous enrichment in signal. This also enabled us to generate uniform windows centered around ATAC-seq summits to consistently quantify signal for CUT&amp;RUN data across different ATAC-seq summits.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It looks like there are issues with the GEO upload and these should be resolved before the manuscript is finalized.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the initial submission, we have uploaded all of our raw and processed data, and these data are now publicly available via the following accession number: GSE193728. This accession number has been added to the revised manuscript as well (Lines 1313-1314).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The abstract claim of &quot;impact of sequence variation on enhancer function&quot; seems a little broad.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced that sentence with a more specific statement:</p><p>“Taken together, these data represent one of the most comprehensive assessments of allele-specific TF binding and enhancer function to date and reveal how sequence changes at enhancers alter their function across evolutionary timescales.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sometimes, the figures should be labeled more clearly. For example, Figure 6A-B has two different line colors but these are not explained with a color key in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the figures to include further description of these important details, as suggested. We added a color key in Figure 6A-B now to indicate that the black and green traces represent the area under curve values for Fos peaks in the C57BL/6J genome with and without masking core AP-1 sites, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2H-J and every panel in Figure 5 have typos on the x-axis. -100 is incorrectly plotted as -10.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this mistake in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The acronym CRE is used extensively throughout the paper, beginning in the second sentence of the introduction, but is never defined.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we now define cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in Lines 49-54 and 176-178 of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The abstract is pretty general and did not help me figure out what the main claims of the paper were. I had difficulty triangulating the claim I found most interesting with its description in the narrative and the data in the figures. For example, the abstract claims &quot;our data…reveal a hierarchical relationship between AP-1 and TEAD TF binding at enhancers&quot; (lines 38-39), which is too vague. The relevant section begins on page 21, but includes two paragraphs of introduction before arriving at the new claim. I would suggest hardening up the abstract to clarify precisely what the authors have discovered, and considering reorganizing the text to consolidate and focus the introductory material on what is relevant to these key claims.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to Essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I found the use of the term &quot;k-mer&quot; confusing. It appears that the authors use this as shorthand for &quot;TF recognition sequence&quot; or &quot;motif match&quot;, but sometimes as meaning TF consensus/motif (e.g. the AP1 consensus in line 666). The gk-SVM uses another definition, where k-mers are used as SVM features. I eventually gathered that the first use follows from the KMAC (Guo et al. 2018) tool. I would suggest clarifying this terminology to refer more generally to TF recognition sequences where appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified our definition of k-mers in the revised manuscript (Lines 366-370). When referring to specific TF binding motifs, we have replaced k-mer with “motif”.</p><p>The output of the KMAC algorithm is also “k-mer based motif representation”, which are nucleotide sequences of variable length (k) that are enriched within CREs. k-mer based motif representation is an alternative method for representing TF binding motifs, which preserves positional dependencies between nucleotides (as described in Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018). This is distinct from the more commonly used position weight matrices (PWM) representation, because k-mers explicitly account for the occurrence of particular nucleotide identities at each position, whereas PWM representations of motifs indicate the probability that a given nucleotide will be observed at a given position. This is indicated now in the text in Lines 378-383.</p><p>The output from the gkm-SVM algorithm that we employed also includes a set of kmers, and we have clarified that the use of k-mer in this context is not necessarily referring to a TF-binding motif, but instead a sequence of length (k) identified as predictive by the gkmSVM model. We have modified the text in this section to clarify this point (Lines 618-620).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The manuscript would benefit from a supplemental table describing the details of the sequencing data generated, including basic experimental metadata, sequencing QC statistics (read counts, duplicate rates, enrichment, etc.), and identification of replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we now include a supplementary table (Table 6) that includes the details of all of the sequencing data generated for this study (cited on Line 370 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors say that the data have been submitted to GEO but the accession was not available upon submission.

The authors should provide an assessment of the similarity of the two conditions, and clearly describe and justify in the narrative how they handled this variable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a subsection in our Methods (“Allele-specific ChIP-seq peak calling”) to detail how we handled data from different timepoints and our reasoning for when we would compile data between serum-starved and stimulated MEFs (Lines 1194-1206).</p><p>In general, all experiments were performed in both serum-starved (0 min) and restimulated MEFs (90 min), with the exception of our CTCF binding dataset that was generated in asynchronous, proliferating MEFs. For all analyses, we defined active enhancers and promoters based on the presence of an ATAC-seq peak with H3K27ac enrichment at either the 0 min or 90 min timepoint. This decision was informed by data from a previous publication (Vierbuchen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017), in which we noted that the vast majority of active MEF enhancers (~83%) exhibited similar levels of H3K27ac enrichment at 0, 10, or 90 min of serum stimulation.</p><p>In this manuscript, we focused on identifying sequence properties of active enhancers identified in both conditions (0 or 90 min serum stimulation). The only analysis where we separately considered the set of enhancers that inducibly gained H3K27ac upon 90 min of serum stimulation was the KMAC search we performed to identify enriched binding motifs at late-response gene enhancers (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1B).</p><p>Moreover, for the TF-binding data, we only considered FOS peaks present after 90 min of serum stimulation because Fos expression is induced by serum stimulation, and Fos protein is undetectable in serum-starved MEFs (0m). On the other hand, TEAD1 peaks in our dataset were defined based on an enrichment of signal at either 0 or 90 min, since it expressed robustly at both timepoints.</p></body></sub-article></article>
