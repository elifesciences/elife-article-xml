However, our recent studies challenged the essentiality of Golgi in the biogenesis of specific transporters. Here, we investigate the trafficking mechanisms of membrane proteins by following the localization of the polarized R-SNARE SynA versus the non-polarized transporter UapA, synchronously co-expressed in wild-type or isogenic genetic backgrounds repressible for conventional cargo secretion. In wild-type, the two cargoes dynamically label distinct secretory compartments, highlighted by the finding that, unlike SynA, UapA does not colocalize with the late-Golgi. In line with early partitioning into distinct secretory carriers, the two cargoes collapse in distinct ER-Exit Sites (ERES) in a <italic>sec31</italic><sup>ts</sup> background. Trafficking via distinct cargo-specific carriers is further supported by showing that repression of proteins essential for conventional cargo secretion does not affect UapA trafficking, while blocking SynA secretion. Overall, this work establishes the existence of distinct, cargo-dependent, trafficking mechanisms, initiating at ERES and being differentially dependent on Golgi and SNARE interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fungi</kwd><kwd>secretion</kwd><kwd>SNARE</kwd><kwd>Golgi-bypass</kwd><kwd>COPII</kwd><kwd>transporter</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013209</institution-id><institution>Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3112/KE18458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diallinas</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013209</institution-id><institution>Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diallinas</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Sante</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dimou</surname><given-names>Sofia</given-names></name><name><surname>Georgiou</surname><given-names>Xenia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unconventional secretion of a plasma membrane purine transporter via Golgi-bypass is established at an early ER-associated secretory compartment revealing that specific cargoes define alternative trafficking routes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotic cells proper subcellular trafficking, topological distribution and targeting of de novo made plasma membrane (PM) proteins constitute processes of primary importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barlowe and Helenius, 2016</xref>).

Proper integration into the ER membrane is followed by partitioning of membrane cargoes into ER-Exit Sites (ERES), which define distinct microdomains promoting the bud-off of vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zanetti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DâArcangelo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feyder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gomez-Navarro and Miller, 2016</xref>) or tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shomron et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Weigel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Raote and Malhotra, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Phuyal and Farhan, 2021</xref>). Vesicles or tubules loaded with membrane cargoes are directed to and fuse with the early- or <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi, seemingly via a dynamic pre-Golgi compartment, known as ERGIC (ER-to-Golgi Intermediate Compartment) in mammals and yeast, or the Golgi entry core compartment (GECCO) in plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aridor, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Peotter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wong-Dilworth et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">FougÃ¨re et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tojima et al., 2023</xref>). Once in the early-Golgi, cargoes âadvanceâ toward the medial- and late- or trans-Golgi network (TGN), through Golgi maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Glick and Luini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Suda and Nakano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Day et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pantazopoulou and Glick, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lujan and Campelo, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tojima et al., 2023</xref>). From the late-Golgi/TGN, cargoes destined to the PM are loaded in vesicular carriers coated, in most cases, with the AP-1/clathrin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Robinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zeng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>). Alternative coated vesicles for specific cargoes or proteins other than those destined to the PM are also well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Makowski et al., 2020</xref>). The movement of such vesicular carriers toward the PM can be direct or via specific sorting endosomes and seems to require functional microtubule tracks and actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berepiki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schultzhaus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fourriere et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The initial exit of PM cargoes from ERES is orchestrated primarily by the protein coat complex COPII (Sar1, Sec23/24, Sec13/Sec31) and its associated scaffold proteins or regulators (e.g., Sec12, Sec16, cargo adaptors, or chaperones) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zanetti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miller and Schekman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Peotter et al., 2019</xref>). Past and recent results have also strongly supported the direct involvement of coat complex COPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shomron et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Weigel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Raote and Malhotra, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Phuyal and Farhan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wong-Dilworth et al., 2023</xref>), independently to its long-thought role in specific cargo retrograde trafficking from the Golgi to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altan-Bonnet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gomez-Navarro and Miller, 2016</xref>). Based on recent findings, COPII and COPI seem to carry topologically distinct functions, in which COPII first concentrates and drives cargoes into ERES, and subsequently COPI promotes further extension of budding, leading to homotypic or heterotypic fusion of the vesicularâtubular carriers into specific pre-Golgi intermediates, such as the ERGIC. Notably, both COPII and COPI protein complexes polymerize into flexible curved scaffolds to support membrane deformation, which seems crucial for cargo trafficking at the ER to Golgi interface. Anterograde cargo trafficking also necessitates membrane fusion at least in two steps. First, at the ER-to-Golgi transfer and secondly at the targeting of post-Golgi vesicles or endosomal carriers to the PM. Membrane fusion between cargo carriers and recipient membranes requires specific tethering factors, SNARE proteins (soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) and Rab GTPases, all of which regulate organelle identity as well as the direction of vesicular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stenmark, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Novick, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stanton and Hughson, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The outlined mechanism of anterograde cargo trafficking, which is centrally dependent on Golgi maturation and functioning, is thought to be the major mechanism that directs membrane cargoes to the PM, excluding specific cases of unconventional trafficking routes, detected mostly under cellular stress and only for a small number of specific cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rabouille, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kemal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sun et al., 2024</xref>). However, our view of canonical anterograde cargo trafficking has been mostly shaped by studies in a small number of cell systems, such as yeasts or specific mammalian or plant cells, or by in vitro biochemical approaches, and crucially, with only a limited number of membrane cargoes. Surprisingly, trafficking mechanisms of the two most abundant types of membrane cargoes in eukaryotic cells, namely transporters and receptors, have not been investigated systematically. Related to this issue, we have recently provided evidence that in the filamentous fungus <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> several nutrient transporters, the major proton pump ATPase PmaA and the PalI component of the pH sensing receptor, can all well translocate to the PM when key Golgi proteins are repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dimou and Diallinas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dimou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dimou et al., 2020</xref>). This contrasts what has been observed, using the same fungal system, with apical PM proteins, such as chitin synthase ChsB<sup>Chs1/2</sup>, R-SNARE SynA<sup>Snc1/2</sup>, or lipid flippases DnfA/B<sup>Dnf1/2</sup>, which are considered as standard Golgi-dependent cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">HernÃ¡ndez-GonzÃ¡lez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Taheri-Talesh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pantazopoulou and PeÃ±alva, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schultzhaus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schultzhaus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martzoukou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dimou et al., 2020</xref>). A notable aspect of our previous work is also that both Golgi-dependent and Golgi-independent cargo trafficking seems to depend on key COPII components. This in turn signified that there must be two subpopulations of COPII cargo carriers: one that reaches the Golgi carrying conventional, growth-related, apically localized cargoes, and a second one that bypasses the Golgi to sort non-polarized cargoes needed for nutrition or homeostasis to the PM.</p><p>Here, we describe a novel genetic system in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> for synchronously co-expressing and following the de novo localization of the non-polarized cargo UapA, a well-studied purine transporter, versus the polarly localized R-SNARE SynA. Using this system, we obtained multiple evidence for the existence of distinct cargo trafficking routes for these two cargoes, initiating at ERES and early secretory compartments. Most interestingly, we also obtained evidence that translocation of UapA to the PM seems to necessitate non-canonical SNARE interactions and is also exocyst-independent. Our work provides strong evidence that in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> specific polarized and non-polarized PM cargoes serving different physiological functions follow distinct anterograde trafficking routes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synchronously co-expressed polarized (SynA) and non-polarized (UapA) membrane cargoes follow distinct routes to the PM</title><p>A new genetic system was designed to follow the dynamic subcellular localization of selected specific polarized and non-polarized membrane cargoes, namely SynA<sup>Snc1/2</sup> (R-SNARE) versus UapA (purine transporter), co-expressed in parallel. Notice that in this work we keep the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> protein (or gene) terminology based on previous experimental work and relevant publications, albeit in cases of proteins not studied before and/or not being annotated, we mostly use the terminology of the orthologous <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> proteins/genes.

SynA and UapA tagged with GFP have been used previously for studying cargo trafficking mechanisms, albeit expressed in different strains, and in some cases under different promoters. In these studies, SynA has been shown to localize polarly in the apex of growing hyphae via conventional Golgi and post-Golgi secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Taheri-Talesh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martzoukou et al., 2018</xref>), whereas UapA localized non-polarly all over the hyphal PM, through a mechanism that essentially did not require Golgi maturation and post-Golgi secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dimou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dimou et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Here, we constructed novel strains where we can simultaneously co-express, via the regulatable <italic>alcA</italic> promoter (<italic>alcA<sub>p</sub></italic>), functional mCherry-SynA and UapA-GFP.

UapA-GFP labeled homogeneously the PM in a non-polarized or even anti-polarized manner, while mCherry-SynA marked mostly the PM of the apical region of hyphae, with some overlap with UapA-GFP, at the subapical region. Thus, UapA-GFP and mCherry-SynA nicely reflect non-polarized and polarized cargo accumulation when expressed in the same cell. The distinct distribution of the two cargoes remained the same at all development stages tested (e.g., germlings, young or mature hyphae). Noticeably however, the localization of UapA in some cells where SynA has not yet accumulated at the apical region, can also show apical localization. This points to the hypothesis that there is no specific inhibitory mechanism that excludes UapA from the apex but is rather the consequence of massive accumulation of apical markers related to fast growth of hyphae that limits translocation of UapA at the tips. This idea is strongly supported later, as in cases where we blocked conventional apical localization of SynA, UapA could then accumulate also in apical tips (see Figure 6C, E, F).</p><p>To investigate whether the observed steady-state accumulation of cargoes is the result of distinct or overlapping trafficking routes, especially at early steps of their secretion, we followed the dynamic appearance of the two cargoes from the onset of their transcriptional derepression.

This assumption seemed the most logical, as at least SynA, which colocalizes to the late-Golgi, should ânecessarilyâ pass via the early-Golgi. Although we were unable to estimate the relevant contribution of early-Golgi in the trafficking of distinct cargoes, a challenge that would require more ultra-fast high-resolution microscopy and/or synchronization of controlled ER-exit (see later), our findings, already provided strong evidence that the two cargoes studied traffic via distinct routes. SynA seems to be secreted via the conventional Golgi-dependent mechanism, while UapA is probably sorted to the PM from an early secretory compartment, ultimately bypassing the need for Golgi maturation. This assumption is strengthened by subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>UapA and SynA sorting to the PM is differentially dependent on COPII components</title><p>The evidence that UapA and SynA follow distinguishable trafficking routes, which are differentially dependent on Golgi maturation, leads to the hypothesis of existence of functionally discrete ERES/COPII or ERGIC-type subpopulations that might be involved in the generation of distinct trafficking carriers (vesicles or tubules). One subpopulation (the âcanonicalâ) drives the budding of carriers containing polarized cargoes like SynA or other growth-related proteins to the Golgi, whereas the second type of carrier (the âunconventionalâ) bypasses the Golgi to sort non-polarized cargoes like UapA or other transporters to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dimou and Diallinas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dimou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dimou et al., 2020</xref>).

We specifically tested the role of the major COPII structural components SarA<sup>Sar1</sup>, Sec24, Sec13, and Sec31, as well as Sec12, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that regulates SarA. Notice that SarA, Sec24, and Sec13 have been previously shown to be essential for growth, while Sec24 or Sec13 have also been found critical for proper trafficking of both polarized and non-polarized cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">HernÃ¡ndez-GonzÃ¡lez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dimou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dimou et al., 2020</xref>). Noticeably, however, these studies have been performed in different strains for each cargo so that a direct comparison of the relative contribution of COPII components in the trafficking of distinct cargoes has not been possible.</p><p>Here, we analyzed the relative role of COPII components in the trafficking of UapA versus SynA using newly constructed thiamine-repressible alleles for SarA, Sec31 and Sec12 (for strain construction see Materials and methods), as well as previously made repressible alleles of Sec24 and Sec13 (<italic>thiA<sub>p</sub>-sec24</italic> and <italic>thiA<sub>p</sub>-sec13</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dimou et al., 2020</xref>).

Sec12 could not be detected in western blots, probably due to an apparent high turnover or modification of its terminal regions.

In wt background UapA was sorted non-polarly to the PM, while SynA was localized in the apical area of the PM. Repression of SarA, Sec24, Sec13, and Sec31 led to total retention of SynA at the ER network in 100% of cells. UapA trafficking was also totally blocked upon SarA or Sec31 repression (100% of cells), and also efficiently blocked when Sec24 was repressed (~76% of cells). Notably, UapA trafficking was not blocked upon Sec13 repression in most cells (79%). Notice also that when the trafficking of SynA is blocked, SynA partitions in the ER membranes, whereas in the fraction of cells where UapA translocation to the PM is blocked, the protein forms aggregates (e.g., in 24% of cells repressed for <italic>sec24</italic>, and 21% of cells repressed for <italic>sec13</italic>). UapA aggregation might be to the fact that it is a large homodimeric protein with 28 transmembrane segments that oligomerizes further upon translocation into the ER membrane, apparently causing ER stress and turnover. Sec12 repression led to a moderate simultaneous negative effect on the sorting of UapA and SynA to the PM (33%) The number of cells used for quantitative analysis upon repressed conditions was <italic>n</italic> = 101 for SarA, <italic>n</italic> = 158 for Sec12, <italic>n</italic> = 163 for Sec24, <italic>n</italic> = 256 for Sec13, and <italic>n</italic> = 126 for Sec31, respectively.

UapA trafficking was also totally blocked upon SarA or Sec31 repression (100% of cells) and was also highly blocked when Sec24 was repressed (~76% of cells). The partial independence of UapA localization on <italic>sec24</italic> repression might be due to the existence of a Sec24 homolog, namely LstA, in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dimou et al., 2022</xref>). LstA is known to function as a cargo selection adaptor, similar to Sec24, for bulky or large oligomeric cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dimou et al., 2022</xref>). Notice that UapA is indeed a large cargo (i.e., the UapA dimer has 28 transmembrane segments), while SynA is a relatively small cargo (single transmembrane segment).</p><p>Interestingly, UapA trafficking to the PM was not efficiently blocked upon Sec13 repression in most samples (~80% of cells). This was quite surprising given that <italic>sec13</italic> is an absolutely essential gene for growth and SynA trafficking. Given that <italic>A. nidulans</italic> has no other Sec13-like proteins, this suggests that Sec13 is partially dispensable for UapA exit from the ER. The dispensability of Sec13 for UapA trafficking in most cells overrules our previous conclusion, which considered it as an essential protein for translocation of UapA or other transporters to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dimou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dimou et al., 2022</xref>). Apparent discrepancy in our previous and present findings is probably due to the fact that previous studies have been performed in strains that separately expressed the two cargoes, so that a direct <italic>relative</italic> comparison could not have been performed. This shows the validity of our new system of synchronous co-expression of two cargoes in the same cell, especially when the role of a trafficking factor on different cargoes is variable, as is the case of Sec13.</p><p>Given the differential requirement of Sec13 and other COPII components on UapA translocation to the PM, we further addressed the degree of relative contribution of Sec13 and Sec24 by measuring the capacity of transport of radiolabeled xanthine (i.e., substrate of UapA) in strains expressing the respective <italic>thiA<sub>p</sub></italic>-repressible alleles. In other words, we took advantage of the fact that UapA, our model cargo, is a native transporter whose activity is directly related to proper integration to the PM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> shows that UapA-mediated xanthine transport was very low when Sec24 was repressed (~15% of wt) but remained relatively high when Sec13 was repressed (~72% of wt or non-repressed levels). This confirmed the high degree of dispensability of Sec13 for UapA functional translocation to the PM, relative to the other COPII components.</p><p>Finally, Sec12 repression of transcription was shown to lead to a moderate negative effect on the trafficking of both UapA and SynA to the PM (~33â38%, <italic>n</italic> = 116, <italic>t</italic> = 4), compatible with a less profound effect on growth (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Sec12 is very probably present at extremely very low levels when expressed from its native promoter under the condition of our experiment (minimal media). This is supported by our recent proteomic analysis, performed under similar conditions, which failed to detect the Sec12 protein, unlike all other COPII components see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dimou et al., 2021</xref>, but also by cellular studies of the group of M.A. PeÃ±alva, who failed to detect Sec12 tagged with GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo-Plaza et al., 2019</xref>). Given that repression of <italic>sec12</italic> transcription via the <italic>thiA</italic> promoter still allows 68% of cells to secrete normally both SynA and UapA, while 32% of cells are blocked in the trafficking of both cargoes, suggests that in most cells either SarA can catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP without Sec12, maybe through a cryptic GEF, or that very small amounts of Sec12 remaining after repression are sufficient for significant SarA activation. Additionally, in yeast, immune detection of Sec12 has been possible only in cells harboring <italic>sec12</italic> on a multicopy plasmid, suggesting its low abundance in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nakano et al., 1988</xref>). Whichever scenario is true, Sec12, similar to SarA, is not critical for distinguishing Golgi-dependent from Golgi-independent routes, as both cargoes are affected similarly.</p><p>Overall, the above findings suggest that while SynA proper trafficking requires a âcanonicalâ COPII functional formation, UapA seems to be able to be secreted to the PM in the absence of Sec13, which is a major component of the outer coat of COPII. The differential role of Sec13 on specific cargo trafficking is discussed further later.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genetic block in COPII formation or repression of COPI activity traps UapA and SynA in distinct ERES</title><p>Live imaging of newly synthesized membrane cargoes in the ER is challenging because these proteins are continuously being synthesized and traffic rapidly from the ER to their final subcellular destination.

Upon shifting down to the permissive temperature (42â25Â°C), ER export is restored and cargoes are progressively incorporated into ERES-like structures. UapA and SynA appear mostly in distinct puncta, showing a low degree of colocalization (open arrowheads, non-colocalizing dots; white arrowheads, colocalizing dots), as illustrated also by the calculation of Pearsonâs correlation coefficient (PCC) on the right (PCC = 0.28 Â± 0.06, <italic>n</italic> = 17).

This confirms that the specific <italic>sec31<sup>ts</sup></italic> allele used has severally inactivated Sec31 function at higher than the physiological temperatures, in line with growth tests shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Importantly, UapA and SynA marked very distinct areas of a membranous network typical of the ER (see merged panel). When cells were shifted from 42 to 25Â°C and observed after 0â45 min, the picture changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right panel). More specifically, both cargoes progressively marked puncta on or closely associated with the ER membranous network, often associated with rings reflecting nuclear ER, but also in cortical regions next to the PM. Most notably, UapA and SynA puncta did not colocalize significantly (PCC = 0.28 Â± 0.06, <italic>n</italic> = 17). The distribution, size, and rather static nature of UapA and SynA puncta strongly suggested that these reflect distinct ERES, as they appear when marked with FP-tagged COPII components (e.g., Sec24; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dimou et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, when Sec31 is inactivated (42Â°C) and proper ERES cannot be formed, UapA and SynA collapse in extensive parts of the ER network, but when Sec31 is progressively re-activated by a shift at 25Â°C, stable COPII complexes start being formed, giving rise to apparently proper ERES and normal trafficking. In this series of events, UapA and SynA never colocalized significantly, which in turn suggested that the two cargoes, after post-translational translocation to the ER, partition and exit from distinct ERES, subsequently forming spatially distinguishable secretory compartments.</p><p>To further define the identity of the ER-associated puncta marked with UapA or SynA, we constructed <italic>sec31<sup>ts</sup></italic> strains that co-express either UapA-GFP or GFP-SynA with a standard marker of ERES, namely Sec16, tagged with mCherry (for strain construction see Material and methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows the localization of UapA-GFP/Sec16-mCherry or GFP-SynA/Sec16-mCherry in the presence of <italic>sec31</italic><sup>ts</sup> mutation after growth in a non-permissive temperature (42Â°C) and transfer to permissive temperature (25Â°C). Both cargoes show significant colocalization with Sec16 (PCC â 0.6) in clearly defined puncta, as those detected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. These findings strongly suggested that upon block-and-release of ER-exit, both cargoes are sorted to ERES. Ideally, for showing directly the existence of distinct cargo-specific ERES, a three-color approach, using red, green, and blue fluorescent tags, would be needed. However, the BFP-tagged Sec16 failed to give a specific and strong signal for performing colocalization studies with UapA-GFP and mCherry-SynA (not shown). Nevertheless, given that UapA and SynA mark distinct compartments, as clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, our results strongly suggest that the two cargoes are recruited in spatially distinct ERES.</p><p>To further follow the parallel fate of UapA and SynA carriers exiting the ER, we also tried to detect their dynamic localization when immediate downstream steps in their secretion were blocked. More specifically, we tested their localization when COPI function is conditionally downregulated by repression of transcription of either CopA<sup>Cop1</sup> or ArfA<sup>Arf1/2</sup>. CopA is an essential core component of the COPI complex, while ArfA is an essential ADP-ribosylation GTPase that regulates anterograde coated vesicle formation by recruiting COPI at the ERESâearly-Golgi interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Weigel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shomron et al., 2021</xref>). We have previously constructed <italic>thiA<sub>p</sub></italic>-repressible alleles of CopA and ArfA and shown that these affect trafficking of UapA or SynA, albeit in experiments performed in separate strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Georgiou et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we introduced <italic>thiA<sub>p</sub>-copA</italic> and <italic>thiA<sub>p</sub>-arfA</italic> alleles in the dual strain synchronously co-expressing UapA and SynA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, repression of either CopA or ArfA, abolished translocation of these cargoes to the PM. Whether this signifies a direct block in anterograde transport or alternatively CopA/ArfA are needed to recycle proteins from ERES-derived carriers (or ERGIC) back to the ER, and thus indirectly affecting anterograde transport, is a still a debatable issue. Noticeably, the picture obtained upon CopA repression was rather similar to what has been observed when cargo trafficking was followed in the background of the <italic>sec31<sup>ts</sup></italic> strain shifted from 42 to 25Â°C. More specifically, we observed distinct, little colocalizing (PCC = 0.15 Â± 0.08, <italic>n</italic> = 9), UapA or SynA cytosolic puncta associated with the ER network. On the other hand, upon ArfA repression, the effect on cargo trafficking seemed more dramatic compared to CopA repression or <italic>sec31<sup>ts</sup></italic>, with UapA sorted into vacuoles and SynA collapsed all over the ER membrane. This might be related to the fact the ArfA has a pleiotropic effect on other steps in cargo trafficking, besides recruitment of COPI. Notably, the ER membranes where SynA collapses upon ArfA repression is distinct from the structures marked with UapA (PCC = â0.14 Â± 0.1, <italic>n</italic> = 10).</p><p>Overall, the findings described above show that UapA and SynA are trapped in distinct ERES and possibly downstream secretory compartments upon functional blocks in COPII or COPI formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Golgi maturation and conventional post-Golgi vesicular secretion are redundant for UapA localization to the PM</title><p>Using a similar approach as that for studying the role of COPII components, we followed the synchronous co-expression and trafficking of de novo made UapA and SynA in mutant backgrounds where we could repress the transcription of genes encoding essential Golgi proteins or conventional post-Golgi secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pantazopoulou, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pinar and PeÃ±alva, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pantazopoulou and PeÃ±alva, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pantazopoulou and Glick, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nakano, 2022</xref>).

In wt background SynA was localized to the apical area of the PM, while UapA was sorted non-polarly to the subapical PM. Repression of SedV, GeaA, RabO, RabE, and Ap1<sup>Ï</sup> led to total retention of SynA in cytoplasmic structures, while repression of HypB abolished SynA trafficking in 56% of cells. Notice that upon repression of SedV and GeaA, SynA mostly labeled the ER network, indicating the close dynamic association of the ER with the ERGIC/early-Golgi. In contrast to SynA, UapA reached the PM when several essential ERGIC/early-Golgi and post-Golgi were repressed. More specifically, in GeaA, RabO, HypB, and Ap1<sup>Ï</sup> repressible strains UapA translocated to the PM in 100% of cells. Repression of SedV and RabE had a partial negative effect on UapA trafficking. In particular, lack of SedV led to block of UapA traffic in 65% of cells, while upon RabE repression, a significant fraction of UapA could translocate to the PM in ~75% of cells, but in this case, the same cells also showed a significant number of large cytoplasmic structures.

These findings were in full agreement with previous reports supporting that SynA is a membrane cargo that traffics exclusively via the conventional Golgi-dependent vesicular secretion mechanism. In contrast to SynA, UapA translocated to the PM when several key Golgi proteins were repressed. More specifically, in GeaA, HypB, RabO, or AP-1<sup>Ï</sup> repressible strains UapA translocation to the PM was practically unaffected in all cells (~100%). The non-essentiality of HypB for UapA trafficking, but not for SynA, was also in line with the colocalization of SynA, but not of UapA, with the late-Golgi/TGN marker, as shown earlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1 fig3video2 fig3video3 fig3video4">Figure 3âvideos 1â4</xref>. On the other hand, two proteins among those tested, namely SedV and RabE, had a partial but prominent negative effect on UapA translocation to the PM. Repression of SedV led to a block in UapA trafficking to the PM in ~65% of cells, while in ~35% of cells UapA was normally localized to the PM. The partial dependence of UapA trafficking on SedV seems to be in line with the low relative colocalization detected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Upon RabE repression, a significant fraction of UapA could translocate to the PM in ~75% of cells, but in this case, the same cells also showed numerous large cytoplasmic structures.

This confirmed a partial dependence of UapA trafficking on RabE and SedV. A possible explanation for the indirect role of RabE and SedV on UapA trafficking is discussed later.</p><p>To further address the importance of Golgi proteins in the trafficking of SynA and UapA we also used the standard approach of pharmacological inactivation of Golgi by addition of Brefeldin A (BFA). Notice that BFA does not affect early secretion steps, as ERES or ERGIC formation seems intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Saraste and Svensson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">FÃ¼llekrug et al., 1997</xref>). Our results showed that addition of BFA for 60 min after derepression of cargoes for 90 min, blocks the trafficking of SynA in all cells (~100%), leading to the trapping of this cargo into large Golgi aggregates (known as âbrefeldin bodiesâ), but has only a very modest effect on UapA translocation to the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Notice that the images of SynA versus UapA localization in the presence of BFA are very similar with those observed when the early-Golgi protein GeaA, which is a target of BFA, was repressed (see white head arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested the effect of microtubule depolymerization on SynA versus UapA traffic by adding benomyl in the sample of cells after 90 min of cargo derepression and before microscopic imaging. Our results showed that proper trafficking of SynA to the apical PM was totally abolished, as expected for a conventional cargo, while UapA translocates normally to the PM, in all cells, similar to the control without benomyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our findings confirmed that in cells exhibiting a total block in SynA conventional secretion due to repression of Golgi maturation, UapA could still translocate to the PM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>UapA translocation to the PM occurs in the absence of SNAREs essential for conventional fusion of ER-derived carriers to the cis-Golgi</title><p>Specific fusion of ER-derived vesicles with target Golgi membranes requires the pairing of SNARE proteins embedded in vesicles (i.e., v-SNAREs) to SNAREs anchored in the target membrane (i.e., t-SNAREs).

In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the SNARE proteins Sed5, Bos1, Bet1, and Sec22 have been shown to form a basic <italic>trans-</italic>SNARE complex required for vesicular traffic from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shim et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dascher et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hardwick and Pelham, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parlati et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, two additional yeast SNAREs, Ykt6 and Sft1, have also been shown to play essential roles in cargo trafficking via their interaction with Sed5 at the ERâGolgi interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kweon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adnan et al., 2019</xref>). Given the difficulty in assigning rigorously whether a SNARE is anchored in vesicles or target membranes, an alternative classification is based mostly on their sequence similarity but also the presence of either Arg (R) or Gln (Q) residue in the motif that is needed for SNARE self-assemblage into a stable four-helix bundle in the <italic>trans</italic>-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bock et al., 2001</xref>). By this classification, Sec22 and Ykt6 are R-SNAREs, while Sed5, Bos1, Bet1 or Sft1 are Qa-, Qb-, and Qc-SNAREs, respectively. Commonly, a v-SNARE is an R-SNARE and t-SNAREs are Q-SNAREs. Notice however that Bet1, Bos1, and Sft1 despite lacking an R residue are also annotated as v-SNARES (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.yeastgenome.org/">https://www.yeastgenome.org/</ext-link>), and that Bet1 and Sft1, although phylogenetically classified as Q-SNAREs, they possess polar residues (T/S or D) other than the critical Q at their SNARE motifs. In most cases, the <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complex is formed by a single R-SNARE and three structurally and phylogenetically distinct Qa/b/c-SNAREs. In yeast, null mutants of the Q-SNAREs Sed5, Bos1, Bet1 or Sft1 and of the R-SNARE Ykt6 are inviable, whereas the deletion of the R-SNARE Sec22 is viable but affects the trafficking of specific cargoes. The viability of Î<italic>sec22</italic> is thought to be due to Ykt6, which seems to be a multitask R-SNARE involved in vesicular fusion occurring at several trafficking compartments, as for example, at the ERâGolgi interface, within Golgi, during endocytosis, or in vacuolar sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kweon et al., 2003</xref>).

Based on the known SNARE interactions regulating ER to Golgi sorting in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> outlined above, SedV (Qa-SNARE) might interact with orthologs of Bos1 (Qb-SNARE), Bet1 or Sft1 (Qc-SNAREs), and Sec22 or Ykt6 (R-SNAREs).

Evidence for Golgi-independence was obtained by colocalization studies coupled with a genetic system where proteins essential for Golgi function or post-Golgi secretion could be knocked-down by transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dimou and Diallinas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dimou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dimou et al., 2022</xref>). Despite its apparent advantages, our previous system for evaluating the contribution of Golgi and post-Golgi secretion in cargo biogenesis suffered from the fact that trafficking was evaluated in separate strains for each specific cargo, and in some cases the cargoes were expressed through different promoters. This endangered quantitative misevaluation of results obtained due to non-homogenous efficiency of transcriptional repression of Golgi-related genes in all cells, a problem most obvious in cases where the trafficking factor repressed had a partial role on cargo secretion (e.g., SedV or RabE).</p><p>Here, we improved our genetic system to be able to follow in parallel the trafficking of specific neosynthesized polarized (SynA) and non-polarized (UapA) cargoes, <italic>synchronously co-expressed</italic> via the <italic>same</italic> regulatable promoter in the <italic>same</italic> cell, and in addition, we managed to synchronize cargo accumulation and exit from the ER by using a novel <italic>sec31<sup>ts</sup></italic> allele. These approaches allowed us to compare and rigorously quantify the <italic>relative</italic> dynamic localization and the effect of secretory proteins on the trafficking of neosynthesized UapA versus SynA, irrespective of developmental stages and only in cells where repression of genes essential for conventional secretion route was totally arrested (i.e., cells that show a total block in SynA localization to the apical membrane). We thus obtained strong evidence that UapA and SynA, representing examples of <italic>native</italic> polarized versus non-polarized PM cargoes, follow distinct trafficking routes in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>.</p><p>The evidence concerning the independence of UapA trafficking from essential proteins necessary for Golgi maturation and post-Golgi vesicular secretion was very clear specifically in genetic backgrounds repressible for GeaA (early/medial Golgi), HypB (late-Golgi), RabO (early- and late-Golgi), or AP-1<sup>Ï</sup> (post-Golgi). In these strains proper UapA translocation to the PM was observed in nearly 100% cells, which at the same time showed a total block in SynA trafficking. Furthermore, proper UapA trafficking was shown not to be affected by the Golgi-disrupting drug BFA or the tubulin depolymerizing agent benomyl, unlike the absolute negative effect of these drugs on SynA trafficking. These findings strengthen our previous results pointing to a mechanism that bypasses Golgi maturation and post-Golgi vesicular secretion for transporters and other non-polarized proteins. Importantly, the present work goes further in presenting novel findings on the specific contribution of COPII, COPI, specific SNAREs and exocyst activity in the trafficking of UapA relative to polarized cargoes (SynA or ChsB).</p><p>Highlights of our new findings include (1) the minor contribution of Sec13, an essential COPII component for growth, to the trafficking of UapA, (2) the partitioning of UapA and SynA to distinct ERES and downstream early secretory compartments, similar to intermediate compartments (ICs) or ERGIC upon reversible Sec31 inactivation or repression of CopA activity, and (3) the non-involvement in proper UapA trafficking of essential ER-to-Golgi or Golgi-to-PM SNAREs other than Sec9 and SsoA. Altogether, these results strongly support the existence of a specific trafficking route for UapA, independent of conventional Golgi maturation, post-Golgi secretion, or canonical SNARE interactions. The partial but prominent negative effect of the knockdown of SedV or RabE on Golgi-independent UapA trafficking is very interesting and needs to be studied further, as it points to new roles, direct or indirect, of these proteins, in addition to their involvement in conventional secretion.</p><p>The discovery of spatially and dynamically distinct secretory compartments for UapA and SynA, coupled with the independence of UapA proper trafficking from late-Golgi or post-Golgi secretory mechanisms, or canonical SNARE interactions and exocyst recruitment, strongly suggest the existence of a distinct cargo-specific type of vesicular or tubular carrier that drives UapA, and very possibly other non-polarized cargoes, to the PM from specific ERES. Distinct ERES generating specific COPII subpopulations have been shown to be formed in vitro and in vivo for specific glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins or other cargoes, such as hexose or amino acid transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">MuÃ±iz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Watanabe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castillon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castillon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rodriguez-Gallardo et al., 2021</xref>), but also interleukin-1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The early distinction of trafficking routes in these cases seems to be driven via specific cargo associations with chaperones/adaptors (e.g., p24 or Erv14 proteins), specific ER-exit motifs on cargoes, and/or differential dependence on COPII accessory proteins (Sec12 or Sec16), which all seem to lead to partitioning into distinct ERES prior to budding. Most interestingly, a Rab1-dependent, Golgi-independent, pathway connecting directly a pre-Golgi IC with the PM has been reported in polarized neuroendocrine PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sannerud et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Saraste and Marie, 2018</xref>). This IC, which is spatially segregated from canonical ERGIC membranes, seems to act as a cargo-specific tubular network that delivers, via Golgi-bypass, PM components in developing neurites. Given its well established essentiality in conventional secretion, this work further reveals a new role of Rab1 GTPase in regulating Golgi-bypass via interactions with apparently non-canonical effectors. In line with these findings, it was also shown that Golgi and canonical Rab1 effectors, but not the ERES generating unconventional ICs, are excluded from neurites. Notably, in our case, RabO, which is the fungal homolog of RaB1, was found to be dispensable for Golgi-bypass. Despite this important difference, we cannot avoid noticing a possible analogy of the role of Golgi-bypass to the development and maintenance of highly polarized cells, such as filamentous fungi and neuronal cells.</p><p>Several more cargoes undergoing Golgi-independent trafficking in mammalian cells might also be secreted via specific ERES or ICs exiting the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rabouille, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kemal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sun et al., 2024</xref>). In fact, distinct early secretory ICs have been reported in plants, where two types of ERGIC-type subpopulations have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">FougÃ¨re et al., 2023</xref>). One subpopulation forms a dynamic reticulated tubulo-vesicular network, generated independently from Golgi maturation, while the other subpopulation is more stable, more cisterna-like, and dependent on Golgi. Apparently, the generation of two types of ERGIC serves the trafficking of structurally and functionally different cargoes. However, the distinct ER-exit routes detected in plants have not been related to Golgi-sorting versus Golgi-bypass.</p><p>Possibly related to the existence of distinct ERES, UapA trafficking, unlike that of SynA, can take place in the absence of Sec13. A rationalization of this finding might come from reports showing that intrinsic cargo properties and/or the mode of cargo oligomerization might lead to surface-crowding effects and influence the bending of membranes, which in turn might specify differential needs for different COPII components, and particularly for Sec13, as reflected in the isolation of several mutants bypassing the need for Sec13 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elrod-Erickson and Kaiser, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fatal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Copic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Springer et al., 2014</xref>). Most notably, Sec13 has been shown, through both genetic and biochemical approaches, to serve the rigidification of the COPII cage, which in turn leads to an increase in its membrane-bending capacity, especially needed when specific cargoes tend to elicit the opposing curvature toward the lumen of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Copic et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, a requirement for Sec13 can also be bypassed when non-essential membrane cargo proteins are depleted (e.g., GPIs or p24-family proteins). These proteins cause a concave negative curvature of the membrane into the ER lumen, which to be inverted necessitates Sec13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DâArcangelo et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, for specific cargoes, Sec31 is mechanistically sufficient to generate COPII vesicles in the absence of Sec13, albeit with reduced efficiency, as we also recorded here for UapA. UapA is known to form a tight dimer, necessary for its transport activity, and genetic evidence suggests that UapA dimers might further oligomerize to achieve concentrative exit from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martzoukou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kourkoulou et al., 2019</xref>). It is thus probable that UapA forms large oligomers that might elicit sufficient positive curvature to rigidify the COPII cage and thus promote ER-exit, even in the absence of Sec13. One can further speculate that the presence or absence of Sec13 in specific ERES, driven by properties of the cargo itself, might affect the size, composition, and membrane scaffolding of the emerging cargo carriers, and thus dictate their downstream trafficking routes.</p><p>Related to the aforementioned ideas, it was interesting to find out that none of standard R-SNAREs (v-SNAREs) known to pack in canonical COPII vesicles destined to the early-Golgi was found to be essential for proper UapA trafficking. The absence of a canonical ER-Golgi R/Q-SNARE complex might be sufficient to diverge these carriers away from Golgi and instead promote fusion to proximal PM via a short-range âhug-and-kissâ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kurokawa et al., 2014</xref>). The physiological consequence and rationale of a mechanism bypassing late-Golgi functioning might be to uncouple the trafficking of cargoes localized all over the PM, serving nutrition and homeostasis, from microtubule-directed secretion of apical cargoes, which are essential for growth. Furthermore, in line with Golgi-bypass, fungal nutrient transporters, unlike those of mammals, are not glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zielinska et al., 2012</xref>), so Golgi-bypass might serve to avoid fortuitous glycosylation of transporters and other cargoes that function as non-glycosylated proteins. Noticeably also, the trafficking of Chs1, a chitin synthase localized in growing hyphal tips but also in nascent septa and subapical spherical structures in the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> has been found to be unaffected upon Benomyl and BFA treatment, which suggests a Golgi-bypass mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">SÃ¡nchez-LeÃ³n et al., 2011</xref>). As also discussed earlier, Golgi-bypass has been reported for several other mammalian or plant transmembrane cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rabouille, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dimou and Diallinas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kemal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sun et al., 2024</xref>). However, most of these studies concern trafficking routes operating only under specific conditions or stress, and do not seem to reflect a major trafficking mechanism for the biogenesis of essential cargoes, as transporters or receptors, proposed through our work. Notice also that in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> transporters and apical cargoes use different endocytic mechanisms for their internalization, turnover or recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martzoukou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite the possibility that SedV might affect UapA trafficking indirectly, as discussed earlier, we also addressed the possibility of a direct role by investigating the role of all principal SNAREs in yeast known to functionally interact with Sed5 (Qa-SNARE), possibly forming the <italic>trans-</italic>SNARE complex necessary for transfer of cargoes from ERES/ERGIC to early-Golgi cisternae. We showed that none of these (Sec22, Ykt6, Bet1, Bos1, or Sft1) is critical for UapA translocation to the PM, while repression of SedV, Sft1, and Ykt6 totally blocks ER-exit and sorting of SynA to the apical membrane. We subsequently obtained evidence that although localization of UapA and apical cargoes (e.g., ChsB) to the PM requires the SsoA/Sec9 (Q-SNARE) complex, it is however independent of SynA, which is considered the canonical R-SNARE syntaxin partner of SsoA/Sec9 in both yeast and mammals. Since the knockdown of SynA had little effect on growth and there are no SynA paralogs in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, this suggests that for most cargoes a ânon-canonicalâ v-SNARE (R-SNARE) might interact with SsoA-Sec9 at the PM in this fungus.</p><p>Overall, the only SNAREs found to be strictly necessary for UapA localization to the PM were SsoA and Sec9. This foresees the existence of a novel, unprecedented <italic>trans</italic>-interaction of these Qa/b/c-SNAREs with other SNARE partners not studied herein. Interestingly, there are reports showing that the 3Q:1R ratio might not be necessary the formation of a <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complex. In these studies, genetic and biochemical assays have shown that SNARE complexes composed of four glutamines (4Q) are fully functional for assembly in vitro and exocytic function in vivo. Thus, SNARE complexes may, in principle, be composed entirely of Q-SNAREs in non-canonical, context-dependent, combinations, for the trafficking of specific cargoes or under specific conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katz and Brennwald, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ossig et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Parlati et al., 2002</xref>). In line with this, some SNAREs, like Sed5, are known to possess remarkable plasticity in mediating distinct <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">DâSouza et al., 2023</xref>). In <italic>A. nidulans,</italic> as in other systems, there are additional Q-SNAREs related to ER to Golgi sorting of cargoes and essential for growth, not studied here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gupta and Brent Heath, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kuratsu et al., 2007</xref>). These are homologs of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SNAREs: Ufe1 (Qa), Tlg2 (Qa), Sec20 (Qb), Gos1 (Qb), Vti1 (Qb), Use1 (Qc), and Tlg1 (Qc). Notice also that Sed5 has been shown to physically interact with several of these SNAREs (e.g., Gos1, Vti1, Use1 and Tlg1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.yeastgenome.org/">https://www.yeastgenome.org/</ext-link>). Most interestingly, in a recent article it has been shown that hyperactive Sly1, a member of the Sec1/mammalian Unc-18 (SM) family of SNARE chaperones, can directly tether close-range vesicles with high curvature to the Qa-SNARE on the target organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duan et al., 2024</xref>). This leads to the alternative and rather provocative possibility that cargo carriers bypassing the late-Golgi/TGN might fuse to the PM without any v-SNARE in them.</p><p>Notice also that in the filamentous fungus <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> growing apical and non-growing subapical hyphal compartments have been shown to possess spatially distinct ternary SNARE complexes at their PM, involving two SsoA-like paralogs (SSOI and SSOII) interacting with their SynA-like partner (SNCI). This finding indicated that there is more than one pathway for exocytosis in filamentous fungi, employing different surface SNARE proteins, at apical and subapical regions of fungal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Valkonen et al., 2007</xref>). Distinct exocytic routes in apical and subapical regions have also been suggested in older studies in filamentous fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harsay and Bretscher, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nykanen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis et al., 2000</xref>). Future studies will be necessary to define the role of all SNAREs in respect to unconventional cargo trafficking in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>.</p><p>Lastly, we obtained indirect evidence, via knockout of RabD, suggesting that the exocyst is not needed for UapA localization in the PM. On the other hand, RabD was found to be essential for proper growth and SynA translocation to the apical membrane. Previous findings on the tethering role of the exocyst complex in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> showed that, similar to UapA, secretion of the non-polarized GPI-anchored protein EglC to the cell periphery and septa was little impaired in the absence of RabD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">PeÃ±alva et al., 2020</xref>). Notice also that while fungal exocyst proteins and associated effectors (e.g., Sec4 or Sec1) are polarly localized, the functionally relevant transmembrane SNARE SsoA is distributed all along the PM, despite a relatively higher abundance in the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martzoukou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dimou et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that the PM <italic>trans-</italic>SNARE complex might serve exocytic vesicular fusion at the subapical membrane of hyphae via an exocyst-independent non-canonical mechanism, as also suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grote and Novick, 1999</xref>).</p><p>We believe that our present work paves the way to the next obvious step in dissecting the mechanistic details of unconventional trafficking routes of transporters or other non-polarized cargoes in eukaryotes. This should necessitate the employment of more powerful high-speed live cell imaging at high spatial resolution, coupled with in vitro vesicle/tubule budding and fusion reconstitution assays. The coupling of such approaches to the unique genetic tools and mode of extreme polarized growth of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, or other model filamentous fungi, is expected to enrich the study of membrane tracking in eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Media, strains, growth conditions, and transformation</title><p>Standard complete and minimal media for <italic>A. nidulans</italic> were used (FGSC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fgsc.net">http://www.fgsc.net</ext-link>).

They showed in earlier work that apparently at least two different transport routes exist, one involving the classical ER-ERES-ERGIC-Golgi route, one bypassing the Golgi. Unpolarized membrane proteins use the former, apically sorted membrane proteins the latter route. The study here confirms their earlier findings, uses a better model (co-expression of representatives for both routes in the same cell) and provides additional mechanistic insights about the roles of rabs, SNARES and other important proteins of the secretory pathway. The study is thoroughly done, figures are of high quality, data and methods well described and adequately replicated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive comments</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I do have, however, a number of comments that could help to improve the manuscript.</p><p>-I suggest using the term polarized or apical rather than polar. Polar alone to me refers more to physico-chemical properties like water-solubility.</p></disp-quote><p>Amended in most parts of the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-introduction and discussion: I donât think the literature about unconventional secretion bypassing the Golgi is complete, for example studies about TMED10 like Zhang, M. et al. Cell 181, 637-652 e615 (2020) or Zhang et al. ELife 4 (2015) are missing, there might be others. Is UapA a leader-less cargo that could be inserted via TMED10 translocation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for letting us know, we have missed these articles. More references on UPS are now added, including the Zhang et all publications. UapA, as all transporters, is a multispan transmembrane protein with no leader peptide. In fact, we have checked the role of p24 family proteins (homologous to TMED10) in UapA trafficking. The knock-out of key p24 proteins does not affect UapA sorting to the PM (please consider this as confidential unpublished results)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Figure 1C. Can these intracellular structures be characterized in more detail?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained briefly to the handling editor above, and following the reviewerâs suggestion, we performed new experiments to better characterize the identity of the cargo-labeled fluorescent puncta. To do so, we used co-expression of a standard ERES marker, Sec16, in cells expressing either UapA or SynA, tagged with different fluorescent tags. More specifically, we constructed and analyzed strains co-expressing UapA-GFP/Sec16-mCherry or GFP-SynA/mCherry-Sec16 in the <italic>sec31</italic><sup>ts</sup> genetic background, which allows synchronization and better analysis of ER exit, as described in our text. The new findings appear as Figure 5C in the revised manuscript. Notice that <italic>sec16-mCherry</italic> introduced in the native <italic>sec16</italic> locus by standard knock-in reverse genetics of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (see Materials and methods) does not affect Aspergillus growth or secretion. Experiments depicted in 5C show that both cargoes, UapA and SynA, co-localize significantly (PCC â 0.6), with Sec16, suggesting that most of these puncta are indeed ERES structures. Given that the puncta marked with UapA or SynA are clearly distinct (see Figures 1C,2A, 3A, 5B), this new experiment strongly suggests that there are indeed two distinct ERES, one populated mostly by UapA and the other by SynA. Notice, as we already outline in our response to the editor above, a three-colored approach using Sec16-BFP (or Sec13-BFP) for showing directly the existence of these two populations of cargo-specific ERES in the same cell failed as the BFP signal was problematic for colocalization studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Where is the Golgi localized in A. nidulans, is it decentralized like in yeast?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, as in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>A. nidulans</italic> Golgi cisternae are individually scattered throughout the cytoplasm, also similarly to other filamentous fungi. Notice that in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> Golgi structures are moderately polarized (Pantazopoulou and Penalva 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the UapA at the time points shown in Figure 1C in some sub-PM structures? To me the distribution at or near the PM is more punctate than in the steady state image shown in 1B</p></disp-quote><p>The punctuate appearance of PM transporters at the periphery of fungal cells is a common theme when these do not reach high, steady-state, levels of accumulation. In fact, several transporters mark specific subdomains of the PM, more evident before achieving their steady-state levels. For example, in yeast several amino acid and nucleobase transporters mark punctuate structures that colocalize with eisosomes markers (caveolin-like PM subdomains), while the proton pump ATPase Pma1 marks distinct punctuate domains. Similarly, UapA and other solute transporters mark punctuate structures before reaching their state-state accumulation in the PM. Figure 1C shows the de novo synthesis of cargoes after 100 min of transcription, while Figure 1B depicts the steady-state localization of UapA and SynA after 4h. In the latter case, the PM is âsaturatedâ with UapA molecules and thus the fluorescent signal of distinct puncta âfusesâ, creating continuous fluorescent labeling. Notice also that in several cases, in our work, we have also performed UapA transport assays, which provide a direct tool to test and confirm the presence of UapA in the PM (see Figures 4D or 6C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Figure 3A. To me it looks like there is actually a lot of colocalization of UapA and SynA, especially at or near the PM, where there is quite some white, punctate staining. The green fluorescence is just much stronger, overlaying the violet. Can you show separate channels and explain?</p></disp-quote><p>We think the reviewer means Figure 2A, which compares UapA and SynA (Figure 3A compares UapA with Golgi markers). If so, we have quantitatively estimated and performed statistical analysis (PCC) which indicates that this, visually apparent colocalization, is not significant (right panel in Figure 2A). Notice also that we cannot totally exclude very minimal colocalization of UapA and SynA signals as both cargoes mark very proximal early secretory domains (i.e., ERES or ERGIC), especially in fungal cells. Anyhow, in the revised Figure 2 we also added a panel depicting separate channels, as the reviewer asks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Figure 3: In my opinion the statement that UapA &quot;is probably sorted from an early secretory compartment, ultimately bypassing the need for Golgi maturation&quot; is too strong at that point. You say for both UapA and SynA you donât get significant colocalization with early Golgi/ERGIC marker, then you cannot conclude that one takes the conventional route via early-late Golgi and the other does not. What you can say is that UapA is apparently not going through late Golgi.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is in principle correct. However, significant colocalization with the late Golgi marker, as SynA shows, strongly suggests that this cargo has passed via the early Golgi compartment. The fact we failed to detect significant colocalization of any cargo tested with early Golgi/ERGIC markers (e.g., SedV) is very probably due to very rapid passage of cargoes from these compartments, which conventional widefield or confocal microscopy cannot detect. To achieve this, ultra-fast fluorescent microcopy, as Lattice Light Sheet Microscopy (LLSM), should be used. In fact, we are currently initiating these studies, which will appear in the near future elsewhere.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Figure 4C: UapA does not seem to accumulate in the ER in the Sec24 and 13 mutants but in punctate structures. This for me is unexpected, any explanations? Can you characterize that punctate staining?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting observation. Notice that UapA is a large homodimeric protein (e.g., 28 transmembrane domains) that oligomerizes further upon translocation into the ER membrane. Repression of Sec24, and to a less extent of Sec13, leads to inability to exit the ER properly. Consequently, this will lead to UapA overaccumulation in the ER, which might in turn lead to ER stress and turnover, reflected in UapA aggregates. In line with this, we have previously shown that specific mutants of UapA unable to exit the ER are indeed degraded by selective autophagy (Evangelinos et al., 2016). In contrast to UapA, SynA partitions in the entire ER without forming aggregates when <italic>sec24</italic> or <italic>sec13</italic> are repressed. This might be due to the fact that is a single-pass, much smaller, membrane protein compared to UapA and one that is not known to form oligomers. Thus, its overaccumulation in the ER might not lead to aggregation, allowing it to diffuse laterally in the membrane of the ER. A note on this is included in the Figure legend of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Figure 6D: You state that BFA &quot;has only a very modest effect on UapA translocation to the PM&quot;. To me the PM (or very near PM) staining of UapA looks very different in the PFA treated cells, more uneven/punctate. Is there an explanation for that?</p></disp-quote><p>Our explanation is the following. When BFA is added, conventional secretion is blocked and Golgi collapses. We believe that this might have a moderate <italic>indirect</italic> effect also on cargoes bypassing the late Golgi/TGN, as UapA (i.e., lower levels of UapA present in the PM). This is based on the fact that UapA, in addition to conventional cargoes, requires the Q-SNARE complex SsoA/Sec9 to translocate to the PM. SsoA, being a membrane protein cargo itself, also needs to traffic to the PM. Interestingly, we have previously obtained evidence suggesting that SsoA traffics to the PM by both conventional and a Golgi-bypass routes (Dimou et al. 2020). Thus, UapA translocation to the PM might indeed be partially impeded or delayed due to repression of proteins, such as SsoA (and probably Sec9), needed for its final integration into the PM bilayer. Importantly, in line with an indirect effect of BFA on the levels of UapA localized in the PM, notice that, unlike SynA, UapA was never trapped in brefeldin bodies (i.e., Golgi aggregates).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance):</p><p>One strength of the study is the use of a model organism, A. nidulans, not cell cultures. Also, the use of both reporters, UapA and SynA, in the same cell is an advantage over previous studies using different lines and different promotors. Limitation of the study might be that it remains unclear to what extend the basic mechanism (UapA and SynA are transported to PM in different carrier and via different routes) can be generalized to other polarized (apically?) membrane proteins versus non-polarized membrane proteins in A. nidulans and whether a similar mechanism exists in other organisms. Some of the basic findings of the study are not new but were published by the same group. However, as the authors point out, the current study uses improved assays and extends their previous studies, advancing our understanding of the mechanistics of transport in the conventional secretory pathway and novel alternative routes. The study will be of interest for basic researchers in the trafficking field. My own expertise is transport through the secretory pathway in mammalian cells, many years ago more post-Golgi, now mostly ER-Golgi and ER itself.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>The idea that transmembrane proteins of the plasma membrane move from the ER to the Golgi and then to the cell surface is firmly entrenched, and the mechanisms and components of this secretory pathway have been extensively characterized. Secretory vesicles are often delivered from the Golgi to sites of polarized growth. This paper builds on previous work by the same group to provide evidence that in Aspergillus nidulans, some non-polarly localized plasma membrane proteins follow a very different pathway, which bypasses components of the conventional secretory machinery such as SNAREs that have been implicated in secretion as well as the exocyst. In particular, they systematically compare the trafficking of the SNARE SynA, which follows the conventional secretory pathway, with that of the purine transporter UapA, which apparently does not. The two proteins were co-expressed in the same cells using the same promoter. A variety of genetic and microscopy methods are used to support the conclusion that UapA reaches the plasma membrane by a route distinct from that followed by SynA.</p><p>In my view, the authors present a convincing case. The individual experimental results are sometimes ambiguous, but the combined results favor the conclusion that UapA follows a novel pathway to the plasma membrane. I have only a few relatively minor comments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive comments</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the Introduction and elsewhere: to my knowledge, there is no clear evidence that AP-1-containing clathrin-coated vesicles carry cargoes from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. On the contrary, as recently reported by Robinson (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38578286/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38578286/</ext-link>), AP-1-containing vesicles likely mediate retrograde traffic in the late secretory pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment and the relative reference. We are aware that AP-1 is likely to also mediate retrograde traffic in the late secretory pathway or/and intra-Golgi recycling, as also reported by the group of Benjamin Glick. Thus, in the revised version we added a short comment on this plus relative references. Along this line, our previous work has shown that transcriptional repression of AP-1 arrests the polar localization of several apical markers in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> and we reported that this might be due to an effect on both anterograde and retrograde trafficking. Please see âSecretory Vesicle Polar Sorting, Endosome Recycling and Cytoskeleton Organization Require the AP-1 Complex in Aspergillus nidulansâ. Martzoukou O, Diallinas G, Amillis S. Genetics. 2018 Aug;209(4):1121-1138. Overall, the fact that AP-1 was found absolutely dispensable for UapA trafficking, further strengthens our conclusion that UapA bypasses the Golgi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 2, is there any known significance to the presence of UapA in &quot;cytoplasmic oscillating thread structures decorated by pearl-like foci as well as a very faint vesicular/tubular network&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>At present we cannot answer this question. In order to understand what these structures represent and answer what is their role, we will need to employ super-resolution and ultra-fast microscopy and additional markers, which we envision to do. We suspect that they might be tubular networks, but this extends beyond the present work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. SynA is related to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Snc1/2, which are known to be present in late Golgi compartments due to repeated rounds of endocytosis to the Golgi and exocytosis to the plasma membrane. The SynA shown here to colocalize with PH<sup>osbp</sup> is probably present in a similar recycling loop rather than being en route to the plasma membrane for the first time. Therefore, the differential colocalization of UapA and SynA with PH<sup>osbp</sup> does not by itself provide &quot;strong evidence that the two cargoes studied traffic via different routes&quot; as stated in the text but might instead indicate that only SynA undergoes frequent endocytosis. The text should be amended accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is in principle correct. However, given that colocalization of SynA and PH<sup>osbp</sup> occurred all over the cytoplasm of hyphae and not only at the apical region, and because we record colocalization of cargoes before their steady-state accumulation to the PM, thus at a stage where recycling must be minimal, the recorded colocalization should reflect anterograde transport rather than recycling. We added this reasoning it the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. A missing piece of the story is a test of whether the puncta visualized for the two cargoes in Figure 5B are indeed distinct populations of COPII-containing ER exit sites. The relevant experiment would involve co-labeling of the cargoes together with a COPII marker. Three-color labeling would presumably be needed.</p></disp-quote><p>This point was also raised by reviewer 1 (and review 3) and thus performed new experiments to better characterize the identity of the cargo-labeled fluorescent puncta. To do so, we used co-expression of a standard ERES marker, Sec16, in cells expressing either UapA or SynA, tagged with different fluorescent tags. More specifically, we constructed and analyzed strains co-expressing UapA-GFP/Sec16-mCherry or GFP-SynA/Sec16-mCherry in the <italic>sec31</italic><sup>ts</sup> genetic background, which allows synchronization and better analysis of ER exit, as described in our text. The new findings appear as Figure 5C in the revised manuscript. Notice that <italic>sec16-mCherry</italic> introduced in the native <italic>sec16</italic> locus by standard knock-in reverse genetics of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (see Materials and methods) does not affect Aspergillus growth or secretion. Experiments depicted in 5C show that both cargoes, UapA and SynA, co-localize significantly (PCC â 0.6), with Sec16, suggesting that most of these puncta are indeed ERES structures. Given that the puncta marked with UapA or SynA are clearly distinct (see Figures 1C,2A, 3A, 5B), this new experiment strongly suggests that there are indeed two distinct ERES, one populated mostly by UapA and the other by SynA. Notice, as we already outline in our response to the editor above, a three-colored approach using Sec16-BFP (or Sec13-BFP) for showing directly the existence of these two populations of cargo-specific ERES in the same cell failed as the BFP signal was problematic for colocalization studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance):</p><p>This study provides compelling evidence that in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans, some transmembrane transporter proteins reach the plasma membrane by a pathway that bypasses much of the conventional machinery associated with the Golgi apparatus and secretory vesicles. Although previous publications pointed toward a similar conclusion, the present work tackles the problem in a more rigorous and systematic way. These findings are important for cell biologists who study membrane traffic, it remains to be determined how prevalent this type of non-canonical secretion might be in other organisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his positive comments</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>The manuscript by Sagia et al. compares the trafficking of a polarized (SynA) with a non-polarized (UapA) transmembrane protein. In agreement with previous work of the same lab, they find that UapA reaches the plasma membrane through a Golgi-bypass route, which they characterize to some extent. Overall, the data are of good quality and the story is interesting and timely. Understanding trafficking routes that bypass the Golgi is highly interesting. Nevertheless, there are several points of criticism that I have and below is a list where I combine major and minor points together:</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive comments</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Comments:</p><p>1- Is it possible that the polarized phenotype of SynA is caused by selective removal, i.e. SynA is delivered to the entire plasma membrane, but endocytosed rapidly from all areas except the tip of the hyphae. This would also result in a polarized distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>This is in principle possible, but here this is not the case. SynA is polarized due to rapid local endocytosis and immediate recycling at the subapical region, known as the subapical collar.

However, these data are not shown, and it is not clear how they were quantified. It would be important to add quantitative data here.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantitative data are included in Figure 4C, displaying the percentages of cells with UapA either retained in the ER or reaching the PM for each background deficient in a COPII protein. Repression of SarA and Sec31 resulted in UapA retention in the ER in all analyzed cells (100%). However, repression of Sec12, Sec24, or Sec13 had a differential effect across the cell population, with UapA reaching the PM in some cells, while remaining trapped in the ER in others. To quantify these data and determine which cargo localization pattern prevails, we measured the number of cells in each category and represented them as percentages. A similar approach was used to examine the role of Golgi proteins in the trafficking of UapA and SynA (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3- on page 8, the authors discuss the discrepancy regarding the role of Sec13. They offer as an explanation that the previous studies have been performed in strains that separately expressed the two cargoes. However, I am unable to see why and how this would be a valid explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that Sec13 has a variable/partial effect on UapA, we have previously been biased towards images that showed an effect on localization, as expected, and considered that the lack of an effect might have been due to inefficient repression in a fraction of cells. In our new system, we were able to directly compare UapA to SynA and find out that while SynA was always affected under our conditions, the effect of UapA was still variable. Thus, the partial effect of Sec13 on UapA is physiologically valid and not a matter of insufficient repression in a fraction of cells. This shows the importance of our new improved system where we follow the synchronous expression of two cargoes in the same cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4- Why is the effect of Sec24 depletion so much stronger than of Sec12 depletion? Sec12 is the GEF for SarA, without which Sec24 should not be recruited to ERES. The explanation that low amounts of Sec12 are still present and sufficient to carry out the role of this protein. What is the evidence for that?</p></disp-quote><p>Sec24 is the principal receptor of cargoes responsible for their recruitment to ERES. Sec12 is the catalytic effector for SarA required for the initiation of COPII vesicle formation. The question of the reviewer is thus logical.</p><p>However, Sec12 is indeed present at extremely very low levels when expressed from its native promoter under the condition of our experiment (minimal media). This is supported by our recent proteomic analysis, performed under similar conditions, which failed to detect the Sec12 protein, unlike all other COPII components (see Dimou et al., 2021, doi; 10.3390/jof7070560), but also by cellular studies of the group of M.A. PeÃ±alva, who failed to detect Sec12 tagged with GFP (Bravo-Plaza et al., 2019, doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2019.118551). Additionally, in yeast, immune detection of Sec12 has been possible only in cells harboring sec12 on a multicopy plasmid, suggesting its low abundance in wild-type cells (Nakano et al., 1988, doi:10.1083/jcb.107.3.851).</p><p>Given that repression of <italic>sec12</italic> transcription via the <italic>thiAp</italic> promoter still allows 68% of cells to secrete normally both SynA and UapA, while 32% of cells are blocked in the trafficking of both cargoes, suggests that in most cells either SarA can catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP without Sec12, maybe through a cryptic guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), or that very small amounts of Sec12 remaining after repression are sufficient for significant SarA activation. Whichever scenario is true, Sec12, similarly to SarA, is not critical for distinguishing Golgi-dependent from Golgi-independent routes, as both cargoes are affected similarly. In the revised text we added a not on this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5- In Figure 5, it would help readers who are not so familiar with Aspergillus organelle morphology to explain the figure a bit better. This might appear trivial for experts, but anyone from outside this field is slightly lost.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we added a figure panel depicting a schematic representation of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> key secretory compartments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6- The authors write that not seeing UapA in Golgi membranes is evidence that it does not pass through this organelle. However, when they write that SynA is never seen in cis-Golgi elements, they do not conclude that SynA bypasses the cis-Golgi.</p></disp-quote><p>The fact that SynA, unlike UapA, colocalized significantly with late-Golgi/TGN and follows conventional secretion in general, strongly suggests that SynA also passes from the early-Golgi. Cargo traffic through the Golgi is mediated by cisternal maturation, where an individual cisterna gradually changes its nature from an earlier to a later one, while the cargo remains inside. UapA, unlike SynA, never colocalized with any Golgi marker used and was not affected by BFA. We agree with the reviewer that we did not have direct proof for passage of UapA or SynA from the early-Golgi in the wt background, which allows for the alternative, but rather unlikely hypothesis, that none of the two cargos is sorted to the early Golgi and that SynA traffics directly to late-Golgi/TGN. Our inability to detect sorting of any cargo to the early-Golgi is seemingly due to ultra-fast passage of cargoes from very early secretory compartments, such as ERGIC/early-Golgi. In fact, we have obtained evidence of this using Lattice Light Sheet microscopy (results in progress, to appear elsewhere).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7- Figure 5C: the authors claim that the CopA and ArfA affects trafficking of UapA and SynA from ER to plasma membrane and assign CopA and ArfA as regulators for anterograde trafficking. I think this interpretation is not justified by the data. Depletion of CopA and ArfA will affect the Golgi apparatus in structure and function. The more straight-forward interpretation is that repression of the COPI machinery results in a defect in Golgi exit and therefore retention in pre-Golgi compartments (including the ER and maybe the ERGIC should it exist in Aspergillus). The same is true for BFA treatment where there are also negative effects on ER export, which are rather indirect consequences of alterations of Golgi function and integrity. Likewise, the interpretation of the papers by Weigel et al. and Shomron et al. is not correct. It is more likely that COPI is recruited to the growing ERES-derived tubule (or ERGIC) to recycle proteins back to the ER. This is not necessarily a proof that COPI regulates anterograde trafficking</p></disp-quote><p>This is a highly debatable issue which our work cannot address.

In Figure 5 upon activation of Sec31 (permissive temperature) we detect mostly punctual structures resembling ERES, whereas at the nonpermissive temperature we detect a membranous network typical of the ER. Upon repression of CopA we also detect punctual structures similar to ERES. In Figure 6, we mostly detect an effect on SynA. Repression of early secretory steps (SedV, GeaA) lead to collapse of SynA in the entire ER network. Repression at later stages of Golgi maturation and post-Golgi secretion (RabO, HypB, RabE, AP-1) lead to the appearance of punctual structures, most probably Golgi aggregates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9- Figure 6D: How long was the BFA treatment.

After 12-14h cells were shifted to derepressed conditions using fructose as carbon source. BFA was added after 90min of cargo derepression, while both cargoes were still in cytoplasmic structures so there was not preexisting SynA or UapA at the PM (see also Figure 1C). Subcellular localization of both cargoes was studied for 60min after BFA treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10- This might be beyond the scope of this study, but as far as I know UapA is not N-glycosylated. Would the introduction of an N-glycosylation site shift it towards the Golgi-based route?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have performed this experiment, adding a glycosylation site on UapA, based on the glycosylation sites found in tis mammalians homologues. We did not detect any effect on UapA trafficking route or its activity. As the reviewer recognizes this goes beyond the scope of this study and thus, we did not include it the manuscript. Differential cargo glycosylation is however an important issue to be studied systemically in respect to different trafficking routes, and we envision to investigate it systematically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments</p><p>1- This might be just a personal preference, but I think that the term polar is misleading, because it implies something about the polarity of the amino acids.

Notice, however, that RabO, the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> homologue of Rab1, which in their case was essential for direct cargo sorting from the ERES/ERGIC to the PM, in or system, was dispensable for Golgi bypass.

Understanding trafficking routes that bypass the Golgi is highly interesting. The main weakness is the lack of mechanistic understanding of the Golgi-bypass pathway.

The primary approach is to conduct dual live-cell imaging of GFP-tagged UapA (plasma membrane localized purine transporter) and SynA (plasma membrane R-SNARE) after their simultaneous derepression to monitor trafficking routes. In germlings, both secretory proteins are detected in non-overlapping intracellular compartments and puncta after 60-90 min of derepression. After 4-6 hrs, SynA localizes to hyphal tips whereas UapA localizes to non-polar regions of the PM. Colocalization studies do not show UapA overlap with Golgi markers (SedV, PH-OSBP) during its biogenesis whereas SynA displays significant co-localization. Repression of COPII and COPI components generally block transport of both cargos to the PM and cause accumulation in ER compartments, although there are some differential effects on UapA and SynA localization. Finally, repression of other transport factors (ER-Golgi SNAREs, Golgi transport factors, and exocytic machinery) had differential effects on UapA and SynA localization over time with UapA reaching the plasma membrane in many instances and SynA accumulating in intracellular compartments.</p><p>Based on these observations, the authors conclude that UapA and SynA follow distinct trafficking routes to the plasma membrane where SynA uses a canonical SNARE-dependent secretory pathway route and UapA follows a non-canonical route that may bypass Golgi compartments. The study is extensive and supports the model that biogenesis of SynA and UapA follow distinct processes. However, there are some complexities that may limit interpretation. First, the cargo studied are targeted to the ER differently. UapA is a multispanning transmembrane protein that is likely dependent on the Sec61 translocon for co-translational membrane insertion and will involve ER chaperones and quality control machinery for its biogenesis. SynA will depend on the tail-anchored machinery (GET/TRC pathway) for insertion into the ER and is processed by cytosolic factors/chaperones. Therefore, the sites of ER insertion and the rates of biogenesis of these cargoes will be different. In addition, the repression of trafficking machinery used in this study appears to be variable and may exert partial blocks on intracellular transport stages. Regardless, the study clearly documents that SynA and UapA follow distinct biogenesis and transport processes when co-expressed in cells under experimentally controlled conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive comments.</p><p>To our knowledge there is no evidence suggesting that SynA translocates via a tail-anchored machinery (GET/TRC pathway) and not through the translocase. Despite this, we agree with the reviewer that translocation to the ER, as well as exit from it, might be cargo-dependent, especially when it concerns proteins with very different size, structures and oligomerization. Thus, the rate of biogenesis of UapA and SynA is probably quite different. However, this still does not dismiss our basic conclusion that the two cargoes follow distinct routes to traffic to the PM. The âproblemâ of variable transcriptional repression of some trafficking-related proteins is solved by comparing the relative effect of the two cargoes in the same cells, and this is in fact the advantage of our new system. Importantly, notice that we took care to use conditions of repression where SynA trafficking by the conventional path was totally abolished and compared it to UapA.</p><p>We have performed a critical experiment showing colocalization with Sec16, confirming partition of the two trafficking routes at early secretory compartment. This, together with the differential dependence of the two cargos on COPII components proves the existence of two kinds of early carriers. This is an important advancement compared to our previous publications for dissecting the full mechanism of Golgi bypass.</p><p>Our studies did not only include co-localization experiments. Our work additionally and primarily includes a series of experiments performed in strains KO for conventional secretion, where UapA reaches the PM while SynA does not. Differential dynamics of insertion of the two in the ER cannot explain the steady state accumulation of UapA, but not of SynA, in the PM when conventional secretion is blocked.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It was not clear if the translation, ER insertion and folding of UapA and SynA are fully synchronous. Is it possible that the rate of UapA synthesis and transport to the plasma membrane is substantially faster than for SynA? The imposition of transport blocks could trap SynA and not UapA if this cargo was at later transport stages.</p></disp-quote><p>As already discussed above translation, ER insertion and folding of UapA and SynA might indeed by different. This might somehow affect the trafficking path followed, but this issue is beyond the scope of this work. Notice, however, that the transcription of both cargoes is kept fully repressed during establishment of repression of secretion. Only when repression and blocking of secretion is established (12-14 h germination), as verified by Western blot analysis, we derepress the transcription of UapA and SynA, expressed from the same promoter, and follow their dynamic subcellular localization. Hence, this system ensures that both cargoes start from the earliest transport stage, the ER, upon imposition of transport blocks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In repressing transport factors (e.g., SarA, Sec12, Sec24, Sec13, SedV, RabE), it is clear that under thiamine repressing conditions these cells do not grow or have greatly reduced growth rates. However, it was not clear if proteins are depleted to the same extent in cells after repression for 12-14 hr or 16-22 hr. as mentioned in the methods. Indeed, in some cases depleted cells display different cargo localization patterns, for example 67% of cells show normal localization of UapA and SynA after sec12 repression and 33% show ER accumulation of both cargoes. There is differential localization of UapA and SynA in many cases where transport factors are repressed, but this could be due to partial inhibition and not complete blocks. It would be helpful to clearly indicate the time points and conditions in each of the figure legends as in points 3-5 below.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we did our best to clearly indicate the time points and conditions in each of the figure legends. Differential localization of UapA and SynA in many cases where trafficking factors are repressed is indeed an interesting outcome. Inefficient repression was dismissed based on the lack of colony growth (see relative growth tests of SarA, Sec24, Sec13, Sec31, SedV, GeaA, RabO, RabE, Ykt6, Sft1, SsoA and Sec9), but also by western blots (e.g., Sec24, Sec13, Sec31 or Sec9 shown in the present manuscript, or other trafficking proteins studied previously. Martzoukou et al., 2018; Dimou et al., 2020). Repression of Sec12 and HypB, and to lower degree AP-1, allowed formation of small and/or compact colonies, but even in these cases relative protein levels could not be detected in western blots, guaranteeing efficient repression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 4A immunoblot, HA-tagged proteins are not detected after thiamine repression. Please state the time of thiamine repression used before protein extraction and blot. Is this for the same length of time as for cells shown in panel 4C? It would also be helpful to state the time of cargo derepression before capturing images in 4C.

For the thiA-copA and thiA-arfA repression experiments (Figure 5C), the methods section states that thiamine was not added ab initio in the culture, but after an 8 h time window without thiamine at the start of spore incubation.

However, the figure legend states that de novo synthesis of cargos takes place after full repression of CopA and ArfA is achieved (&gt;16 hr).

Subsequently, thiamine was added in the media (16-18 h) to repress CopA and ArfA, while cargo expression remained glucose-repressed. The transcriptional repression of the cargoes UapA and SynA was maintained for a longer period (24-26 h) compared to other repression experiments, but longer times of repression of cargoes do not make any difference, as full repression is achieved already at 12 h. de novo cargo trafficking was followed next day by eliciting depression, via a shift to fructose media, while still maintaining thiamine to repress CopA or ArfA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 6D, BFA treatment is shown to trap SynA in Golgi aggregates while UapA still reaches the plasma membrane. Please state the time of BFA treatment before collecting these images. Do longer treatments with BFA before cargo derepression cause accumulation of UapA in intracellular compartments?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above (response to Reviewerâs #3 comment 9) cells were grown overnight under repressed conditions for both UapA and SynA. After 12-14h cells were shifted to derepressed conditions using fructose as carbon source. BFA was added after 90min of cargo derepression, while both cargoes were still in cytoplasmic structures so there was not preexisting SynA or UapA at the PM (see also Figure 1C). We have not noticed any different effect on UapA trafficking after a max of 1h of BFA treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. A minor point, but on page 21 the methods state that &quot;cells were shifted down to the permissive temperature (25 C), to restore the secretory blockâ¦&quot;. Suggest changing to &quot;to reverse the secretory blockâ¦&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Modified accordingly</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Significance):</p><p>This manuscript nicely builds on a developing line of investigation in the Aspergillus nidulans model that specific plasma membrane proteins are efficiently delivered to the cell surface in a pathway that is distinct from the canonical secretory pathway. Previous work from this lab has suggested that a subpopulation of COPII carriers can bypass the Golgi for delivery of specific cargo to the plasma membrane. The current study uses dual expression of UapA-GFP and mCherry-SynA to provide further support for this model. Molecular definition of a direct ER to PM transport pathway for secretory cargo would be a significant advance to a broad audience. This study provides additional depth and support that such a pathway exists but does not define how COPII vesicles or related intermediates are transported to the PM.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, thank you for your positive comments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
