PARPi possess both PARP1 inhibition and PARP1 trapping activities. The relative contribution of these two mechanisms toward PARPi-induced innate immune signaling, however, is poorly understood. We find that the presence of the PARP1 protein with uncompromised DNA-binding activities is required for PARPi-induced innate immune response. The activation of cGAS-STING signaling induced by various PARPi closely depends on their PARP1 trapping activities. Finally, we show that a small molecule PARP1 degrader blocks the enzymatic activity of PARP1 without eliciting PARP1 trapping or cGAS-STING activation. Our findings thus identify PARP1 trapping as a major contributor of the immunomodulatory functions of PARPi. Although PARPi-induced innate immunity is highly desirable in human malignancies, the ability of ‘non-trapping’ PARP1 degraders to avoid the activation of innate immune response could be useful in non-oncological diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PARP</kwd><kwd>ADP-ribosylation</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>cGAS</kwd><kwd>PARP trapping</kwd><kwd>BRCA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM122932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Yonghao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM134883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Yonghao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Yonghao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of PARP1 trapping as the major contributor of PARP1 inhibitor-induced innate immune response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (hereafter referred to as PARP1) is an enzyme that is critically involved in mediating DNA damage response (DDR). Upon sensing the genotoxic stress, PARP1 is recruited to DNA stand breaks and is activated to synthesize negatively charged Poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) polymers. One of the functions of these PAR chains is to serve as a platform to recruit the DDR machinery to repair and resolve these DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ray Chaudhuri and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gibson and Kraus, 2012</xref>). Therapeutics that target PARP1 have been proposed as an attractive strategy to treat human malignancies. Indeed, cancers with <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations rely on PARP1 for genome integrity, and they are selectively killed by PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) via the ‘synthetic lethality’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lord et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lord and Ashworth, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farmer et al., 2005</xref>). Four PARPi (Olaparib, Rucaparib, Niraparib, and Talazoparib) have been approved by the FDA to treat <italic>BRCA1/2</italic>-deficient breast and/or ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faraoni and Graziani, 2018</xref>). In addition, PARPi are being extensively evaluated in the clinic, either as single agents or in combination with chemo- and radiation-therapy approaches, for the treatment of many other solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rouleau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lord and Ashworth, 2017</xref>).</p><p>All FDA-approved PARPi are NAD<sup>+</sup>-competitive, and it was initially thought that these agents kill tumors simply by inhibiting the catalytic activity of PARP1. However, recent studies suggest that the cytotoxicity of PARPi is ascribed, at least in part, to the ability of these compounds to induce PARP1 trapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hopkins et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murai et al., 2012</xref>). During DDR, PARP1 is activated to catalyze the Poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) of many proteins, including PARP1 itself. PARylation triggers the release of PARP1 from the DNA lesions, owing to the charge repulsion and steric hinderance introduced by the PAR polymers. PARPi block the synthesis of PAR chains, which causes PARP1 to be trapped on the chromatin. The trapped PARP1 triggers further DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and eventually, cancer cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lord and Ashworth, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Slade, 2020</xref>). Besides the PARylation-dependent mechanism, several recent studies also suggest that although the various clinically relevant PARPi all bind to PARP1, they induce different degrees of PARP1 conformational changes, and in doing so, PARP1 trapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lord and Ashworth, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hopkins et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murai et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Many recent studies have provided compelling evidence for a functional link between tumor DNA damage and the immune system, during the treatment of cancers. During chemo- and radiation-therapy, self-DNA is released, and is detected by the cytosolic DNA sensor, cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthetase (cGAS). cGAS subsequently produces the second messenger cGAMP. cGAMP binds to Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), leading to the recruitment and activation of Tank-binding kinase I (TBK1). TBK1 phosphorylates a transcription factor called interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), resulting in its nuclear translocation, and the IRF3-dependent activation of type I interferon (IFN) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishikawa and Barber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li and Chen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barber, 2015</xref>). Thus, the cGAS-STING pathway plays a vital role not only in protecting the cells against a variety of pathogens, but also in the antitumor immune response. Because PARPi treatment is known to produce cytosolic dsDNA (double-stranded DNA), it has been proposed that the activation of innate immune signaling could be a critical molecular mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of PARPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ding et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pantelidou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sen et al., 2019</xref>). However, the relative contribution of the two independent, yet interconnected mechanisms (i.e., PARP1 inhibition and PARP1 trapping) in mediating the antitumor immunity of PARPi is not well understood.</p><p>In this study, we show that PARPi treatment induces the antitumor immune response via the cGAS-STING pathway. However, PARPi treatment generates cytosolic dsDNA, only in the presence of the PARP1 protein. PARPi-induced dsDNA is subsequently recognized by cGAS, which leads to the activation of innate immune signaling. We subsequently employed a series of clinically relevant PARPi with different PARP1 trapping activities, as well as a ‘non-trapping’ PARP1 degrader. We showed that the activation of innate immune signaling is critically dependent on the PARP1 trapping activity of these compounds. These results provide evidence that PARPi-mediated PARP1 trapping, but not the catalytic inhibition of PARP1, is a key determinant for the activation of the innate immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PARPi activates innate immune signaling via the cGAS-STING pathway</title><p>It is being increasingly appreciated that chemo- and radiation-therapy cause the formation of cytosolic dsDNA and micronuclei, which, in turn, lead to the activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and inflammatory responses in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanpouille-Box et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liang and Peng, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mackenzie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glück et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vanpouille-Box et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yum et al., 2019</xref>). We explored the immunomodulatory functions of PARPi using Talazoparib, which is an FDA-approved PARP1 inhibitor that is known to potently inhibit and trap PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that Talazoparib treatment was able to induce the formation of cytosolic dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) as well as γH2AX (a marker for DNA double strand breaks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To evaluate the innate immune response, we examined the phosphorylation of TBK1 (pS172 TBK1) and IRF3 (pS396 IRF3), two critical components in the cGAS-STING pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Motwani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kato et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, Talazoparib treatment dramatically increased both phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Talazoparib treatment also remarkably induced the nuclear translocation of phospho-IRF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right), which is a critical step for IRF3-mediated gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Motwani et al., 2019</xref>). We then examined the mRNA expression level of a number of known downstream target genes of the cGAS-STING pathway. Consistent with the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parkes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2020</xref>), Talazoparib treatment greatly upregulated the expression of type I interferons (IFN; <italic>Inf-α</italic> and <italic>Inf-β</italic>), pro-inflammatory cytokines (<italic>Ccl5</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic>), and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; <italic>Isg15</italic>, <italic>Mx1</italic>, <italic>Mx2</italic>, and <italic>Ifit3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To examine whether the cGAS-STING pathway is necessary for the PARPi-induced innate immune signaling, we depleted cGAS using two independent short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Knock-down (KD) of cGAS did not interfere with PARP1 trapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or the subsequent DDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, the activation of the innate immune response, as assessed by the level of pS172 TBK1 and the cGAS-STING target genes, was dramatically reduced in cGAS-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

The innate immune system as one of antitumor immune responses is composed of molecules and cells that respond to external and internal danger signals such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). PAMPs and DAMPs bind to their respective pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to initiate immune responses. Thus, cytosolic PRRs including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain–like receptors, retinoic acid–inducible gene I–like receptors (RLRs), and cGAS detect intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu and Chen, 2014</xref>). Upon ligand binding, PRRs activate downstream signaling cascades to induce inflammatory responses such as the innate immune response, providing early protection against pathogen invasion or cellular damage.</p><p>Unlike normal cells, cancer cells are often replete with cytosolic dsDNA that originates from genomic, mitochondrial, and exogenous sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanpouille-Box et al., 2018</xref>). Accumulating data have been reported that acute genomic stressors, including radiation, cisplatin, and intrinsic DNA damage generate cytosolic dsDNA and micronuclei to activate cGAS–STING in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mackenzie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dou et al., 2017</xref>). The role of PARPi as an inducer of DNA damage response has been well established to explain the cytotoxic effects of these compounds. However, accumulating evidence have pointed out that coordinated activation of both local and systemic antitumor immune responses could also underlie the antitumor effects of PARPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pantelidou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ding et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chabanon et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with these previous studies, our date showed that PARPi treatment results in the robust production of cytosolic dsDNA, which leads to the subsequent activation of cGAS-STING signaling and the downstream innate immune pathway. The current PARPi are known to kill tumors via two distinct, but interconnected, mechanisms (i.e., PARP1 inhibition vs. PARP1 trapping) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhen and Yu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). The relative contribution of these two mechanisms in PARPi-mediated innate immune signaling, however, is poorly understood. Here, we sought to address this important question by using several independent systems. First, we found that the PARP1 protein is required for the PARPi-induced activation of cGAS-STING signaling. Indeed, Talazoparib was unable to cause PARP1 trapping, DDR and TBK1 activation in PARP1 KO cells. It is also important to note that the deletion of PARP1 alone does not lead to TBK1 activation and the expression of inflammatory genes, suggesting that the blockage of PARP1 catalytic activity is not sufficient to drive the activation of cGAS-STING signaling. Second, we found that the DNA-binding activity of PARP1 is required for the PARPi-induced activation of cGAS-STING signaling. Specifically, we employed a recently described PARP1 mutant (R138C) that was identified from an EMS-induced random mutagenesis screen for resistance to a PARPi (i.e., Olaparib) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herzog et al., 2018</xref>). This mutant is defective for DNA binding and PARP1 trapping, and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) that bear this mutation are resistant to Olaparib. We generated PARP1-deleted cells and reconstituted them with either WT PARP1 or the PARP1 R138C mutant. We found that Talazoparib was able to induce DDR and cGAS-STING signaling only in cells expressing WT PARP1, but not the PARP1 R138C mutant. Third, we utilized a panel of 5 clinically relevant PARPi (i.e., Talazoaprib, Niraparib, Rucaparib, Olaparib, and Veliparib) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lord and Ashworth, 2017</xref>). While these compounds all potently blocked the formation of PAR, they displayed a dramatically different capability in inducing PARP1 trapping. Indeed, a recent study showed that the different structural elements within these PARPi drive, in an allosteric manner, the release or retention of these compounds at a DNA break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zandarashvili et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, these compounds then induce DDR and activation of cGAS-STING signaling that is closely correlated with the degree of PARP1 trapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>). Fourth, we utilized that a recently developed, ‘non-trapping’ PARP1 degrader (iRucaparib-AP6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). This compound is cell-membrane permeable and is able to block the enzymatic activity of PARP1. However, unlike regular PARPi, iRucaparib-AP6 degrades PARP1, which prevents PARP1 trapping, DDR, cytotoxicity, and finally, the activation of cGAS-STING signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, recent studies have pointed to cytosolic dsDNA as a source of stimulus for the activation of cGAS-STING pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Civril et al., 2013</xref>). In the context of PAPRi, cytosolic dsDNA could result from PARPi-induced PARP1 trapping, and subsequently, stalled or collapsed replication forks. The detailed molecular underpinnings of this critical pathway need to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a direct mechanism of the antitumor immune response of PARPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We demonstrated that the ability to induce PARP1 trapping is the primary driver for the PARPi-mediated cytotoxicity and activation of innate immune signaling in cancer cells. In the presence of PARP1, PARPi-induced PARP1 trapping generates cytosolic dsDNA, which activates cGAS, and the downstream innate immune response. Although the immunomodulatory roles of PARPi are highly desirable in human malignancies, the ability for PARP1 degraders to prevent PARP1 trapping, and hence the activation of innate immune response could be useful in other contexts (e.g., ischemia-reperfusion injury and neurodegenerative diseases). The full therapeutic potential of this class of compounds warrants further studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The proteins were re-solubilized in 8 M urea and digested by Lys-C at a 1:100 (w/w) enzyme/protein ratio for 2 hr, followed by trypsin digestion at a 1:100 (w/w) enzyme/protein ratio overnight at RT in 2 M urea. The peptides were desalted using Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges (Waters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erickson et al., 2015</xref>) and approximately 100 μg of peptides from each sample were re-suspended in 200 mM HEPES, pH 8.5. The peptides were then labeled with the amine-based TMT 6-plex reagents (Thermo Fisher) for 1 hr at RT. Hydroxylamine solution was added to quench the reaction and the labeled peptide samples were combined. The TMT samples were lyophilized and reconstituted in buffer A (10 mM Ammonium formate, pH 10.0). Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 3 min using spin-X centrifuge tube filters (Thermo Fisher Scientific) prior to loading onto a ZORBAX 300Extend-C18 HPLC column (Agilent, Narrow Bore RR 2.1 mm x 100 mm, 3.5 μm particle size, 300 Å pore size). Peptides were fractionated by bRPLC (basic pH reversed phase HPLC) at a 0.2 mL/min flow rate using a gradient from 0% to 70% buffer B (1% Ammonium formate, pH 10.0% and 90% Acetonitrile). A total of seventeen fractions were collected, which were lyophilized, desalted, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantitative proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS</title><p>The TMT samples were analyzed on a Q-Exactive HF Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS/MS spectra were searched against a composite database of human protein sequences (Uniprot) and their reversed complement using the Sequest algorithm (Ver28) embedded in an in-house-developed software suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huttlin et al., 2010</xref>). MS1 and MS2 mass tolerances were set to be 50 ppm and 0.05 Da, respectively. Search parameters allowed for full tryptic peptides (two missed cleavage sites) with a static modification of 57.02146 Da on cystine (Carbamidomethyl), a variable modiﬁcation of 15.994915 Da on methionine (oxidation), and a static modification of TMT labels (229.16293 Da) on peptide N-terminus and lysine. Search results were filtered to include &lt;1% matches (both peptide and protein level filtering) to the reverse database by the linear discriminator function using parameters including Xcorr, dCN, missed cleavage, charge state (exclude 1+ peptides), mass accuracy, peptide length, and fraction of ions matched to MS/MS spectra. Peptide quantification was performed by using the CoreQuant algorithm implemented in an in-house-developed software suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erickson et al., 2017</xref>). The labeling scheme for the TMT experiments is: 126: DMSO; 127: Talazoparib (0.1 µM); 128: Talazoparib (1 µM), 129: Talazoparib (1 µM); 130: Talazoparib (0.1 µM); 131: DMSO. For TMT quantification, a 0.03 Th window was scanned around the theoretical m/z of each reporter ion (126: 126.127726; 127: 127.124761; 128: 128.134436; 129: 129.131471; 130: 130.141145; 131: 131.138180) to detect the presence of these ions. The maximum intensity of each ion was extracted, and the signal-to-noise (SN) value of each protein is calculated by summing the reporter ion counts across all identified peptides. Because the same amount of peptides was used for each TMT channel, the total reporter ion intensity of each channel was summed across all quantified proteins, and was then normalized and reported. Data were exported to Excel for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical analyses including unpaired Student’s t-tests, one- and two-way ANOVA tests were performed using the GraphPad Prism software (v8.2.0).

The cytotoxic effects of PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) can be ascribed to two distinct, yet interconnected mechanisms, i.e., PARP1 inhibition and PARP1 trapping. We surveyed a series of clinically relevant PARPi, including Talazoparib, Niraparib, Rucaparib, Olaparib, and Veliparib. Consistent with previous studies, these compounds all potently blocked the enzymatic activity of PARP1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). However, these compounds were able to induce different levels of PARP1 trapping (PARP1 trapping levels: Talazoparib &gt; Niraparib &gt; Rucaparib ≈ Olaparib &gt; Veliparib) (Figure 3A). Interestingly, DDR as measured by γH2AX was correlative with respect to the level of PARP1 trapping elicited by these PARPi (DNA damage levels: Talazoparib &gt; Niraparib &gt; Rucaparib ≈ Olaparib &gt; Veliparib) (Figure 3B). We have now measured the cytotoxicity of these PARPi in MHH-ES-1, which is a PARPi-sensitive Ewing’s Sarcoma cell line. We found that the cytotoxicity of these compounds also positively correlated with their PARP1 trapping activities (data provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>To further assess the relative contribution of PARP1 inhibition vs. PARP1 trapping in mediating the cytotoxicity of PARPi, we used iRucaparib-AP6, which is a specific PARP1 PROTAC compound. By degrading PARP1, iRuccapaib-AP6 blocks the enzymatic activity of PARP1, without eliciting PARP1 trapping. We showed that iRucaparib-AP6 led to robust downregulation of PARP1. In contrast, the parent compound (Rucaparib) only induced the cleavage, but not the degradation of PARP1, presumably because of its toxicity in these cells (Figure 4A). Using a different cell line system (i.e., MHH-ES-1), we also showed that Rucaparib, but not iRucaparib-AP6, strongly promoted cell death (data provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Taken together, these data indicate that PARP1 trapping is the major driver of the cytotoxicity of PARPi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please provide proper loading controls to the blots where these are not shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the proper loading controls to the blots (Figure 1D, Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, Figure 2C, Figure 3C, and Figure 4D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please check the existing proteomic data for the cytokines that have been examined at mRNA levels and provide this information in the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Using q-RT-PCR assays, we found that Talazoparib treatment in MHH-ES-1 cells greatly induced the expression of innate immune-related genes, including type I interferons (IFN; Inf-α and Inf-β), pro-inflammatory cytokines (Ccl5 and Cxcl10), and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; Isg15, Mx1, Mx2, and Ifit3).</p><p>We have now gone back to our quantitative proteomic data, and extracted these information. Specifically, we found Interleukin 1<italic>α</italic> (IL1A) as one of the most up-regulated cytokines in Talazoparib-treated MHH-ES-1 cells (Supplementary file 1). In addition, we also identified several up-regulated proteins that are related to innate immune response, including ISG15, IFIT3, MX1 and MX2. Together, these results support that PARPi correlatively up-regulates both genes and proteins which are related to innate immune response.</p><p>Taken together, our data show that PARPi treatment in MHH-ES-1 cells upregulates the expression of innate immune related genes at both the mRNA and protein levels. We have now added these discussions (Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please add to the Discussion possible mechanisms by which PARP1 trapping increases cytosolic DNA and cite and briefly connect their results to the following paper: Zandarashvili et al., 2020.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. In this paper, we have shown that PARP1 trapping is major driver for PARPi-mediated DDR, cytotoxicity and innate immune signaling. We utilized a panel of 5 clinically relevant PARPi (i.e., Talazoaprib, Niraparib, Rucaparib, Olaparib, and Veliparib) Lord and Ashworth, 2017(). While these compounds all potently blocked the formation of PAR, they displayed a dramatically different capability in inducing PARP1 trapping. Indeed, a recent study showed that the different structural elements within these PARPi drive, in an allosteric manner, the release or retention of these compounds at a DNA break Zandarashvili et al., 2020(). Intriguingly, these compounds then induce DDR and activation of cGAS-STING signaling that is closely correlated with the degree of PARP1 trapping (Figure 3A-D, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and D).</p><p>Although the detail mechanisms remain unknown, recent studies have pointed to cytosolic dsDNA as a source of stimulus for the activation of cGAS-STING pathway Sun et al., 2013Wu et al., 2014Civril et al., 2013(, , ). In the context PAPRi, cytosolic dsDNA could result from PARPi-induced PARP1 trapping, and subsequently, stalled or collapsed replication forks. The detailed molecular underpinnings of this critical pathway will be addressed in future studies. We have added these discussions in the manuscript (Discussion).</p></body></sub-article></article>
