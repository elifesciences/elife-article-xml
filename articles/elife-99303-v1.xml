hypothesis, explaining how long-term memories could be maintained in the face of short protein lifetimes. However, it is unknown whether the subunits of protein complexes that mediate memory are sequentially replaced in the brain and if this process is linked to protein lifetime. We address these issues by focusing on supercomplexes assembled by the abundant postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD95, which plays a crucial role in memory. We used single-molecule detection, super-resolution microscopy and MINFLUX to probe the molecular composition of PSD95 supercomplexes in mice carrying genetically encoded HaloTags, eGFP, and mEoS2. We found a population of PSD95-containing supercomplexes comprised of two copies of PSD95, with a dominant 12.7 nm separation. Time-stamping of PSD95 subunits in vivo revealed that each PSD95 subunit was sequentially replaced over days and weeks. Comparison of brain regions showed subunit replacement was slowest in the cortex, where PSD95 protein lifetime is longest. Our findings reveal that protein supercomplexes within the postsynaptic density can be maintained by gradual replacement of individual subunits providing a mechanism for stable maintenance of their organization. Moreover, we extend Crickâs model by suggesting that synapses with slow subunit replacement of protein supercomplexes and long-protein lifetimes are specialized for long-term memory storage and that these synapses are highly enriched in superficial layers of the cortex where long-term memories are stored.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd><kwd>PSD95</kwd><kwd>synaptome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>The Uhera Memorial Foundations</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaizuka</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101029343</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaizuka</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M010996/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>Candace T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014370</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>529085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Seth GN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/202932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Seth GN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>695568 SYNNOVATE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bulovaite</surname><given-names>Edita</given-names></name><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Seth GN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>885069 SYNAPTOME</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bulovaite</surname><given-names>Edita</given-names></name><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Seth GN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The vast majority of synapses in the mammalian brain employ glutamate as the neurotransmitter, which is released from the presynaptic terminal on axons and diffuses onto the postsynaptic terminal on dendrites where it binds glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kandel et al., 2021</xref>). Activating glutamate receptors triggers the biochemical changes in the postsynaptic terminal that ultimately encode memories. The proteome of the postsynaptic termini of excitatory synapses is highly complicated and comprises over 1000 proteins representing many structural and functional classes of molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sorokina et al., 2021</xref>). Biochemical studies show that all these proteins are organized into supramolecular assemblies of complexes and supercomplexes (complexes of complexes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins and Grant, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank and Grant, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Husi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Husi and Grant, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nithianantharajah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pocklington et al., 2006</xref>). The best described complexes are the ionotropic glutamate receptors known as NMDA (<italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>D</sc>-aspartate) and AMPA (Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors, which are formed from four membrane-spanning subunits that together produce a ligand-gated ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>). Major supercomplexes are those formed by the scaffolding protein PSD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 1992</xref>), which can assemble various complexes including NMDA and AMPA receptors, other ion channels, adhesion proteins, and signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank and Grant, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Husi et al., 2000</xref>). Mice and humans carrying mutations in PSD95 show profound learning and memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Migaud et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nithianantharajah et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that the formation and function of supercomplexes is crucial for storage of information in the brain.</p><p>Although it is widely accepted that rapid biochemical changes in the postsynaptic termini of excitatory synapses underlie the initial encoding of memories, the mechanisms that control the duration of memories and rate of forgetting remain poorly understood. There has been a long-standing quest to identify molecular changes that could persist for the duration of the memory. This became a central issue in memory research in 1984 as a result of an influential article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crick, 1984</xref>. He reasoned that the biochemical changes in synapses would be erased by protein turnover, and that because some memories must have a longer lifetime than synaptic proteins, he postulated that there must be molecular mechanisms that perpetuated the initial biochemical changes. Toward this, he posited that dimeric complexes of proteins may be modified during learning and gradually replace their subunits in a way that would allow the âmolecular memoryâ in a preexisting subunit to be transferred to the new subunit in a mixed complex of old and new subunits. As a result of this, much attention has focused on the enzymatic complex known as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII), which is comprised of multiple subunits that have the capacity for autophosphorylation and persistent activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayer and Schulman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stratton et al., 2013</xref>). Experiments using recombinant proteins in vitro show that holoenzymes of CamKII can exchange subunits, which in principle could be a mechanism for perpetuation of molecular memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singh and Bhalla, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stratton et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is unknown if old subunits are sequentially replaced by new subunits in vivo in CamkII complexes, or indeed any other complexes in synapses.</p><p>PSD95 affords an opportunity to revisit Crickâs hypotheses for several reasons. First, biochemical studies of PSD95 supercomplexes isolated from the mouse brain reveal there is a family of supercomplexes where members all appear to comprise two copies of PSD95 and different combinations of interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank and Grant, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2016</xref>). Second, excitatory synapses show high diversity arising from the differential distribution of protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cizeron et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) and differential lifetimes of PSD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulovaite et al., 2022</xref>). Those synapses with longest PSD95 lifetimes were referred to as long-protein lifetime synapses, and a brainwide analysis of their distribution showed they were most highly enriched in the cortex where long-term memories are stored. These findings raise the following questions: are the two copies of PSD95 in supercomplexes sequentially replaced, or does the dimeric complex degrade and rebuild from two new copies of PSD95? Secondly, if there is a sequential replacement of PSD95 subunits in supercomplexes, is the rate of this replacement related to the protein lifetime?</p><p>To address these questions, we have used single-molecule imaging of PSD95-containing supercomplexes isolated directly from the mouse brain. Using lines of mice that contain genetically encoded tags fused to the carboxyl terminus of endogenous PSD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broadhead et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulovaite et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>), we prepared protein extracts from the brain and imaged supercomplexes using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. We counted the number of PSD95 copies in each supercomplex, and found that the majority contain two units. We next measured the mean distance between the labels using MINFLUX, which has a spatial resolution of 1â5 nm, and showed that the average distance between the fluorophores is 12.7 nm. Using mice that express HaloTag fused to PSD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulovaite et al., 2022</xref>), we injected a fluorescent ligand into the tail vein, which efficiently labels PSD95 in brain synapses, and by extracting supercomplexes at time points after injection, we show that individual PSD95 subunits are sequentially replaced, in line with Crickâs hypothesis. Finally, we ask if the rate of subunit exchange is influenced by PSD95 protein lifetime by comparing brain regions with different PSD95 lifetimes. We found that the rate of exchange is slowest in the cortex where the protein lifetime is longest. Our results, which are the first visualization of individual synaptic supercomplexes and their constituent proteins, show that synaptic scaffold proteins that play a crucial role in memory are organized as dimers in supercomplexes, and are maintained by sequential replacement of individual subunits over extended periods of time, and that this process is linked to the rate of protein turnover in the regions of the brain involved with long-term memory storage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Imaging individual PSD95 supercomplexes isolated from mouse brain</title><p>Single-molecule and super-resolution (SR) approaches enable the heterogeneity in molecular complexes and supercomplexes to be distinguished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saleeb et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Szymborska et al., 2013</xref>), and therefore provide an invaluable tool for studying synaptic molecular supercomplexes isolated from brain homogenate. Forebrains from PSD95-eGFP homozygous mice were dissected and homogenized as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2009</xref>) (Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The supercomplexes were subsequently diluted and immobilized on a glass coverslip, and imaged on a TIRF microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bi</xref>) (Materials and methods). Although this technique is diffraction-limited, the number of fluorescent proteins present in each supercomplex can be quantified by the stepwise photobleaching of each fluorophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leake et al., 2006</xref>). The number of photobleaching steps per diffraction-limited spot was determined for a population of &gt;6000 supercomplexes across three biological repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bii</xref>, with examples of one-step and multi-step photobleaching traces presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1biii</xref>). On average, there were 1.6 PSD95 proteins per PSD95-containing supercomplex; however, taking advantage of our ability to characterize individual supercomplexes, we found that 63% contained one PSD95 protein, 24% two PSD95 proteins, and 13% more than two PSD95 proteins.

Although we have previously used biochemical approaches to demonstrate that, on average, two copies of PSD95 exist in supercomplexes in bulk protein extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank and Grant, 2017</xref>), this study represents the first direct observation of PSD95 in these megadalton supercomplexes at single-molecule resolution. Using multiple single-molecule and SR microscopy techniques to image the brain homogenate from three mouse models (PSD95-HaloTag, PSD95-eGFP, and PSD95-mEos2), we have robustly cross-validated our approach for studying the organization of PSD95 in individual supercomplexes. Unlike ensemble averaging techniques, a major advantage of our approach is the ability to observe and quantify hundreds of thousands of PSD95 molecules in tens of thousands of individual supercomplexes, allowing the stoichiometry in each one to be determined, as well as the distances between the PSD95 molecules. Furthermore, by tagging PSD95-HaloTag with specific Halo ligands in vivo, followed by imaging at different time points, our approach allows the lifetime of PSD95 in individual supercomplexes to be measured. Dissection of brain regions prior to homogenization and imaging also enables our methods to be deployed for generating maps of structure and lifetime of supercomplexes in different brain areas.</p><p>PSD95 is one of the most abundant synaptic proteins and is localized beneath the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses in a structure known as the postsynaptic density. Nanoscale imaging of PSD95 in synapses using PALM and STED reveals individual synapses differ in their PSD95 content and spatial organization. For example, in the mouse hippocampus and cortex there are populations of synapses with single or multiple 40 nm ânanoclustersâ and larger contiguous structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broadhead et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masch et al., 2018</xref>). Receptors, including AMPARs have also been shown to distribute into such nanoclusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>) and these have been shown to align to clusters at the presynapse via ânanocolumnsâ, demonstrating their functional role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Bulk protein extracts reveal that all PSD95 is assembled into 1â3 MDa supercomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank and Grant, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Husi et al., 2000</xref>) indicating that they are the building blocks of the nanoscale structures observed with SR techniques. We now show that this synaptic heterogeneity extends to the individual supercomplex level, and demonstrate that while the majority of supercomplexes contain two or fewer PSD95 molecules, others contain more. With the enhanced resolution of MINFLUX, we were able to measure the distances between individual PSD95 molecules within the supercomplexes and find that, rather than being fixed, there is considerable variation; however, class averaging showed a dominant separation distance of 12.7 nm. This could reflect a difference in the molecular make-up of each supercomplex. Indeed, supercomplexes are composed of dozens of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank and Grant, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Husi et al., 2000</xref>) and biochemical characterization of their composition from different brain regions show different supercomplexes populate synapses in different regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank and Grant, 2017</xref>). Moreover, brainwide synaptome mapping of the proteins in individual synapses show synapse diversity arises from their constituent complexes and supercomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cizeron et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tomas-Roca et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Two recent studies have provided insights into the spacing between PSD95 molecules. MINFLUX revealed a mean nearest neighbor distance of approximately 7 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">GÃ¼rth et al., 2023</xref>), while one-step nanoscale expansion microscopy found a preferred spacing of 8â9 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaib et al., 2023</xref>). These measurements, taken within the PSD, may represent distances between neighboring supercomplexes rather than within a single supercomplex, as reported here. Furthermore, in our study, the slightly larger measurements may be due to the size of the eGFP molecules (~3 nm) and the nanobodies used, which could contribute to an increased observed separation between PSD95 molecules.</p><p>The maintenance of synaptic structure at the molecular level is necessary to maintain physiological stability of brain circuits. Brainwide mapping of the spatial distribution of PSD95-expressing synapses across the lifespan shows that between 3 and 9 months of age the remarkable synapse diversity and its organization into the synaptome architecture is very stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cizeron et al., 2020</xref>). However, when we measured the lifetime of PSD95 during this age window, we found that the vast majority of PSD95 is replaced every few weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulovaite et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the synaptome architecture, which is comprised of molecularly diverse synapses, is stable despite its constituent proteins being replaced. Our present findings offer an explanation for how this stability can be maintained: the protein supercomplexes which are the building blocks of the synaptome architecture are not removed and replaced in toto, but are maintained by the sequential replacement of constituents including core scaffolding proteins.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Memory maintenance by sequential subunit replacement and protein lifetime</title><p>In the synaptome theory of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grant, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>), representations, memories, and behavioral programs are encoded in the synaptome architecture, and thus its stability is required to maintain these functional outputs. The stability conferred on the synaptome architecture by the sequential replacement of subunits in supercomplexes offers a stability mechanism. However, it is also necessary to have plasticity to learn new things and to forget unnecessary information. We propose that synapse diversity resolves this dilemma: there are some synapses that are very stable, and others that are less stable and more plastic. Our present findings indicate that the most stable synapses are those with long-protein lifetime in the cortex, and that these synapses undergo slow replacement of their supercomplex subunits. The processes of subunit replacement and protein turnover are synergistic mechanisms that produce stability of supramolecular entities, which together with synapse diversity can result in synapses with a range of memory durations and plasticity potential.</p><p>This model fits with Crickâs basic framework in that it involves dimeric proteins that sequentially exchange their subunits. Our findings extend his model in that we show a link between the protein lifetime and the rate of subunit exchange. At the time Crick made his postulate, the rate of protein turnover in the brain and synapses was unknown, and until recently, there was no evidence that synapses might differ in their protein lifetime. The surprising finding that some synapses can maintain copies of PSD95 for months draws into question Crickâs assumption that protein lifetimes are much shorter than memories, because most memories are forgotten within a short period (days to weeks) in mice.</p><p>It is interesting to speculate how the exchange of PSD95 subunits could lead to the perpetuation of a molecular and behavioral memory. There are families of PSD95 supercomplexes that contain different proteins and particular interacting proteins may be well-suited to modifying the newly arrived subunit and altering its properties. The concentration of PSD95 supercomplexes is highest in the postsynaptic terminal and this environment may facilitate exchange of subunits between supercomplexes, consistent with our results. Some synapses such as the long-protein lifetime synapses that are enriched in the cortex may be better suited to the exchange process and transmission of modifications. Indeed, it may be that the environment of these synapses facilitates other complexes and supercomplexes (such as CamKII holoenzymes) to exchange and/or replace subunits and that our observations with PSD95 reflect a more widespread and general phenomenon. Our findings and approaches provide a platform for addressing these issues as well as providing a new model of memory duration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of mouse brain homogenates</title><p>Homogenates were prepared from dissected brains or whole mouse forebrains, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2016</xref>).

Briefly, collimated laser light at 405 nm (Cobolt MLD 405-250 Diode Laser System, Cobalt, Sweden), 488 nm (Cobolt Fandango-300 DPSS Laser System, Cobalt, Sweden), 561 nm (Cobolt DPL561-100 DPSS Laser System, Cobalt, Sweden), and 638 nm (Cobolt MLD Series 638-140 Diode Laser System, Cobolt AB, Solna, Sweden) was aligned and directed parallel to the optical axis at the edge of a 1.49 NA TIRF objective (CFI Apochromat TIRF 60XC Oil), mounted on an inverted Nikon TI2 microscope. The microscope was fitted with a perfect focus system to auto-correct the z-stage drift during imaging. Fluorescence collected by the same objective was separated from the returning TIR beam by a dichroic mirror Di01-R405/488/561/635 (Semrock, Rochester, NY, USA), and was passed through appropriate filters (488 nm: BLP01-488R-25, FF01-525/30-25; 561 nm: LP02-568RS, FF01-587/35; 638 nm: FF01-432/515/595/730-25, LP02-647RU-25, Semrock, Rochester, NY, USA). Fluorescence was then passed through a 2.5Ã beam expander and recorded on an EMCCD camera (Delta Evolve 512, Photometrics) operating in frame transfer mode (EMGain = 11.5 eâ/ADU and 250 ADU/photon). Each pixel was 103 nm in length. Images were recorded with an exposure time of 50 ms. The microscope was automated using the open-source microscopy platform Micromanager. Borosilicate glass coverslips (20 Ã 20 mm, VWR International) were cleaned using an Ar plasma cleaner (Zepto, Diener) for 30 min to remove any fluorescent residues. Frame-Seal slide chambers (9 Ã 9 mm<sup>2</sup>, Bio-Rad) were affixed to the glass to create a well in which samples (100 Âµl) were added.

For diffraction-limited photobleaching analysis of SiR and AF488, whole forebrain homogenate and DOC-treated synaptosomes were diluted 1:100 in PBS. Homogenates from dissected brain regions were diluted 1:1000 to 1:10,000 in PBS. The samples were first irradiated and imaged with 638 nm light (850 W cm<sup>â2</sup>, 25 s), followed by 488 nm light (110 W cm<sup>â2</sup>, 25 s), ensuring all molecules were photobleached.

The distances between the <italic>n</italic>th spot in the first channel and all spots in the second channel were calculated. Any spots with a separation distance less than the channel offset parameter (2 pixels in this work) were classed as being âcoincidentâ.

The intensity of the emitted fluorescence from all molecules was tracked over a period of 25 s. The intensity traces from each molecule were extracted by finding spots in the first frame of the image stack using the ImageJ Find Maxima function. The intensity at each spot location was then measured in all frames of the stack using a custom-written ImageJ macro. ChungâKennedy filtering was performed on the resulting intensity traces using a custom-written MATLAB script, with a shuttling window size of 12. The ChungâKennedy filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung and Kennedy, 1991</xref>) shuttles two windows along the dataset either side of each data point. The output of the ChungâKennedy filter is a weighted average of the mean of the two windows. The weighting shifts the output value toward the mean of the window with the lowest variance such that noise is reduced, but discontinuities in the data do not become blurred during the filtering process.</p><p>To detect photobleaching steps in the filtered traces, an approximate differential of the filtered data was calculated. Peaks in the differentiated intensity traces indicated a sharp change in gradient in the intensity trace and thus the position of the photobleaching steps. A peak threshold of 75 was applied to the differentiated intensity traces to extract the location of the steps. The validity of each of the steps was determined by calculating the ratio of individual step height to the local regional variance. This calculation returned a <italic>t</italic>-statistic for each potential step. A <italic>t</italic>-threshold of 0.1 was applied to distinguish true steps from false steps. True steps have large ratios of step height to local regional variance and thus larger <italic>t</italic>-statistics. False steps have smaller ratios of step height to local regional variance and thus smaller <italic>t</italic>-statistics.

Once the localizations were extracted, a custom-written MATLAB clustering script was used. The clustering script sorted all localizations by precision from low precision to high precision. To correct for multiple blinks emanating from the same fluorophore, the script consolidated all localizations within the precision of another localization into one object. The distances between all objects were then calculated. Objects separated by less than 160 nm were grouped into clusters. The number of objects in each cluster was counted.

MINFLUX imaging of Alexa 647 was performed using a 642-nm CW excitation laser at 22.6 ÂµW/cm<sup>2</sup> in the first MINLUX iteration. Laser powers were measured at the position of the objective lens back focal plane using a Thorlabs PM100D power meter equipped with a S120C sensor head.

This is particularly critical in the case of neurons, where the size and protein composition of synapses define synaptic strength and encode memory.</p><p>PSD95 is an abundant synapse protein that acts as a scaffold in the recruitment of transmitter receptors and other signaling proteins and is required for memory formation. The authors used super-resolution microscopy to study PSD95 super-complexes isolated from the brains of mice expressing tagged PSD variants (Halo-Tag, mEos, GFP). Their results show compellingly that a large fraction (~25%) of super-complexes contains two PSD95 copies about 13 nm apart, that there is substantial turnover of PSD95 proteins in super-complexes over a period of seven days, and that ~5-20% of the super-complexes contain new and old PSD95 molecules. This percentage is higher in synaptic fractions as compared to total brain lysates, and highest in isocortex samples (~20%). These important findings support the hypothesis put forward by Crick that sequential subunit replacement gives synaptic super-complexes long lifetimes and thus aids in memory maintenance. Overall, this is a very interesting study that provides key insights into how synaptic protein complexes are formed and maintained. On the other hand, the actual role of these PSD95 super-complexes in long-term memory storage remains unknown. Specifically, a direct correlation between PSD95 stability and memory formation remains hypothetical - but the present findings indicate important new directions for studying the mechanisms that control postsynaptic protein organisation and the maintenance of postsynaptic proteinaceous substructures.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>(1) The study employed an appropriate and validated methodology.</p><p>(2) Large numbers of PSD95 super-complexes from three different mouse models were imaged and analyzed, providing adequately powered sample sizes.</p><p>(3) State-of-the-art super-resolution imaging techniques (PALM and MINFLUX) were used, providing a robust, high-quality, cross-validated analysis of PSD95 protein complexes that is useful for the community.</p><p>(4) The result that PSD95 proteins in dimeric complexes are on average 12.7 nm apart is useful and has implications for studies on the nanoscale organization of PSD95 at synapses.</p><p>(5) The finding that postsynaptic protein complexes can continue to exist while individual components are being renewed is important for our understanding of synapse maintenance and stability.</p><p>(6) The data on the turnover rate of PSD95 in super-complexes from different brain regions provide a first indication of potentially meaningful differences in the lifetime of super-complexes between brain regions.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>(1) The manuscript emphasizes the hypothesis that stable super-complexes, maintained through sequential replacement of subunits, might underlie the long-term storage of memory. While an interesting idea, this notion requires considerably more research. The presented experimental data are indeed consistent with this notion, but there is no evidence that these complexes are causally related to memory storage.</p><p>(2) Much of the presented work is performed on biochemically isolated protein complexes. The biochemical isolation procedures rely on physical disruption and detergents that are known to alter the composition and structure of complexes in certain cases. Thus, it remains unclear how the protein complexes described in this study relate to PSD95 complexes in intact synapses.</p><p>(3) Because not all GFP molecules mature and fold correctly in vitro and the PSD95-mEos mice used were heterozygous, the interpretation of the corresponding quantifications is not straightforward.</p><p>(4) It was not tested whether different numbers of PSD95 molecules per super-complex might contribute to different retention times of PSD95, e.g. in synaptic vs. total-forebrain super-complexes.</p><p>(5) The conclusion that the population of 'mixed' synapses is higher in the isocortex than in other brain regions is not supported by statistical analysis.</p><p>(6) The validity of conclusions regarding PSD95 degradation based on relative changes in the occurrence of SiR-Halo-positive puncta is limited.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99303.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Morris</surname><given-names>Katie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edinburgh</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bulovaite</surname><given-names>Edita</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edinburgh</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kaizuka</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edinburgh</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schnorrenberg</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">GÃ¶ttingen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>Candace T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edinburgh</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Komiyama</surname><given-names>Noboru</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hinxton</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mendive-Tapia</surname><given-names>Lorena</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edinburgh</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Seth GN</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edinburgh</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Horrocks</surname><given-names>Mathew H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edinburgh</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The work is well performed and thoroughly convincing.</p><p>However, a few points could be improved, by adjusting the manuscript:</p><p>(1) The wording of the abstract is confusing for the casual reader. The initial impression is that the 2-copy complexes contain the majority of the PSD95 copies. This is not the case, as shown in panel cii. It would be important for the authors to explain in the abstract the exact percentage of molecules found within 2-copy complexes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now amended the abstract, making it clear that itâs not most of the complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Did the authors find a sizeable population of 2-copy complexes by investigating wild-type proteins, using nanobody labeling (Figure S2)? It would be important to quantify and discuss these data.</p></disp-quote><p>It was not possible to perform this analysis on the wild-type proteins. The quantification would rely on all the PSD95 molecules being bound by the antibody, which we cannot guarantee. Furthermore, the nanobody labeling would need to be stoichiometric.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors quote the separation value of 12.7 nm throughout their text, including the abstract. This may be somewhat misleading since the authors investigate the PSD95-GFP molecules, labeled using anti-GFP nanobodies. The large size of the two GFP molecules (~3 nm), and that of the nanobodies, will influence the readout. Two groups have already reported a separation of ~7-8 nm between neighboring PSD95 molecules in synapses, using PSD95 nanobodies, to minimize the linkage</p><p>error: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.03.502284">https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.03.502284</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.18.562700">https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.18.562700</ext-link>.</p><p>The difference observed here is consistent with an effect of the additional GFP moieties; the authors should cite these works (albeit they are now only provided as biorXiv pre-prints) and should mention this discrepancy, and its potential tagging-related explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now referenced the work and referred to this in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors may want to re-check the manuscript; some minor problems should be corrected, such as the mislabeling of Figure 2 and &quot;Figure 5&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors suggest that the stability of the PSD95 dimeric complex correlates with memory formation. However, the turnover experiments were conducted only on three-month-old animals, which can be considered to be at a stage of lower synaptic functionality turnover.

In the discussion, it is concluded that stable synapses have long protein lifetimes and slow replacement of scaffolding proteins. However, this is based on the correlation of protein lifetime and mixed supercomplexes in the cortex, which does not provide any evidence that this relation is true in single synapses or is specific for stable synapses. To make this statement, the authors could for instance directly correlate the stoichiometry of supercomplexes with the protein lifetime and size of individual synapses.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we canât directly measure the lifetime of each complex, and so itâs only possible to compare region-to-region. In doing so, we found that there was a correlation between the protein lifetime and the âmixedâ population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Some essential parts seem missing: the materials and methods and Figure 2 are not included.

For example, it could be made clearer how PSD95 supercomplexes are isolated from brain homogenate.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now presents in the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 1c, single molecules of PSD95 are identified using PALM with a resolution of 30 nm. However, in Figure 1d it is shown that PSD95 molecules reside on average 13 nm apart, indicating that a resolution of 30 nm is not sufficient to resolve single PSD95 molecules. In addition, it would be of interest to show the distribution of fluorophore separation (assessed with MINFLUX) of only the supercomplexes with two PSD95 molecules, since only these were used to calculate the average distance.</p></disp-quote><p>The 13 nm distance was measured using MINFLUX, as stated in the text.
