Here, using mungbean (<italic>Vigna radiata</italic> var. <italic>radiata</italic>) as a test case, we investigated the genomes of more than 1000 accessions to illustrate climatic adaptationâs role in dictating the unique routes of cultivation range expansion. Despite the geographical proximity between South and Central Asia, genetic evidence suggests mungbean cultivation first spread from South Asia to Southeast, East and finally reached Central Asia. Combining evidence from demographic inference, climatic niche modeling, plant morphology, and records from ancient Chinese sources, we showed that the specific route was shaped by the unique combinations of climatic constraints and farmer practices across Asia, which imposed divergent selection favoring higher yield in the south but short-season and more drought-tolerant accessions in the north. Our results suggest that mungbean did not radiate from the domestication center as expected purely under human activity, but instead, the spread of mungbean cultivation is highly constrained by climatic adaptation, echoing the idea that human commensals are more difficult to spread through the south-north axis of continents.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mungbean, also known as green gram, is an important crop plant in China, India, the Philippines and many other countries across Asia. Archaeological evidence suggests that humans first cultivated mungbeans from wild relatives in India over 4,000 years ago. However, it remains unclear how cultivation has spread to other countries and whether human activity alone dictated the route of the cultivated mungbeanâs expansion across Asia, or whether environmental factors, such as climate, also had an impact.</p><p>To understand how a species of plant has evolved, researchers may collect specimens from the wild or from cultivated areas. Each group of plants of the same species they collect in a given location at a single point in time is known collectively as an accession. Ong et al. used a combination of genome sequencing, computational modelling and plant biology approaches to study more than 1,000 accessions of cultivated mungbean and trace the route of the cropâs expansion across Asia.</p><p>The data support the archaeological evidence that mungbean cultivation first spread from South Asia to Southeast Asia, then spread northwards to East Asia and afterwards to Central Asia. Computational modelling of local climates and the physical characteristics of different mungbean accessions suggest that the availability of water in the local area likely influenced the route. Specifically, accessions from arid Central Asia were better adapted to drought conditions than accessions from wetter South Asia. However, these drought adaptations decreased the yield of the plants, which may explain why the more drought tolerant accessions have not been widely grown in wetter parts of Asia.</p><p>This study shows that human activity has not solely dictated where mungbean has been cultivated. Instead, both human activity and the various adaptations accessions evolved in response to their local environments shaped the route the crop took across Asia. In the future these findings may help plant breeders to identify varieties of mungbean and other crops with drought tolerance and other potentially useful traits for agriculture.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mungbean</kwd><kwd><italic>Vigna

humans, leading to associated genetic and morphological changes. These changes may be intentional from human selection or unintentional as a result of adaptation to the environments of cultivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuller, 2007</xref>). Later, the cultivated plants spread out from their initial geographical range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meyer and Purugganan, 2013</xref>), and elucidating the factors affecting the range expansion of crops is another focus of active research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutaker et al., 2020</xref>). In the old world, during the process of âprehistoric food globalizationâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2011</xref>), crops originated from distinct regions were transported and grown in Eurasia. Archeological evidence has shown that such âtrans-Eurasian exchangeâ had happened by 1500 BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), and the proposed spread routes from archeological studies were supported by modern genetic evidence especially in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutaker et al., 2020</xref>) and barley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lister et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the spread may accompany genetic changes for the adaptation to novel environments. For example, in barley, variations in the gene <italic>Photoperiod-H1</italic> (<italic>Ppd-H1</italic>) resulting in the non-responsiveness to longer daylengths were likely associated with the historical expansion to high-latitude regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones et al., 2016</xref>). While these mid-latitude cereals have been extensively studied, investigations of crops originated from other climate zones are needed. Using the South Asian (SA) legume mungbean as a test case, here, we investigate how climatic adaptation might affect crop spread route and the evolutionary changes making such spread possible.</p><p>Mungbean (<italic>Vigna radiata</italic> [L.] Wilczek var. <italic>radiata</italic>), also known as green gram, is an important grain legume in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nair and Schreinemachers, 2020</xref>), providing carbohydrates, protein, folate, and iron for local diets and thereby contributing to food security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Among pulses, mungbean is capable of tolerating moderate drought or heat stress and has a significant role in rainfed agriculture across arid and semiarid areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pratap et al., 2019</xref>), which are likely to have increased vulnerabilities to climate change. Although there have been studies about the genetic diversity of cultivated and wild mungbean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Noble et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sangiri et al., 2007</xref>), the evolutionary history of cultivated mungbean after domestication still lacks genetic studies. Existing archeological evidence suggests that South Asia is the probable area of mungbean domestication, and at least two independent domestication events have been suggested, including Maharashtra and the eastern Harappan zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuller and Harvey, 2006</xref>). The early archeological records suggest that the selection of large seed sizes occurred in the eastern Harappan zone by the third millennium BC and in Maharashtra, dating to the late second to early first millennium BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuller and Harvey, 2006</xref>). This pulse later spread to mainland Southeast Asia and has been reported in southern Thailand dating to the late first millennium BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castillo et al., 2016</xref>). Further north, the earliest record of mungbean in China was from the book Qimin Yaoshu (é½æ°è¦è¡, 544 AD). While mungbean is also cultivated in Central Asia today, it was not identified in archaeobotanical evidence ranging from several millennium BC to the medieval period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Spengler et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Spengler et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting later arrival. While the archaeobotanical studies elucidated the route of mungbean cultivation range expansion, researches are still needed to identify the genetic evidence and factors shaping such spread route.</p><p>A recent genetic study revealed that present-day cultivated mungbeans have the same haplotype in the promoter region, reducing the expression of <italic>VrMYB26a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2022</xref>), a candidate gene controlling the important domestication trait, pod shattering, in several <italic>Vigna</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takahashi et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests the loss of pod-shattering phenotype in cultivated mungbean may have a common origin and despite the archaeobotanical findings of several independent early cultivations of mungbean in South Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuller and Harvey, 2006</xref>), descendants from one of these cultivation origins might have dominated South Asia before the pan-Asia expansion. Since large regions remain archaeologically unexplored, utilization of genetic data can be a crucial complementation to reconstruct crop evolutionary history. Using seed proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tomooka et al., 1992</xref>) and isozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dela Vina and Tomooka, 1994</xref>), previous studies proposed two expansion routes out of India, one in the south to Southeast Asia and the other in the north along the silk road to China. While later studies used DNA markers to investigate mungbean population structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breria et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gwag et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Islam and Blair, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Noble et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sandhu and Singh, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sangiri et al., 2007</xref>), few have examined these hypothesized routes in detail. Therefore, genomic examination of the cultivation rage expansion proposed by archaeobotanical studies and the elucidation of its contributing factors are strongly needed.</p><p>In this study, we compiled an international effort, reporting a global mungbean diversity panel of more than 1100 accessions derived from (i) the mungbean mini-core collection of the World Vegetable Center (WorldVeg) genebank, (ii) the Australian Diversity Panel (ADP), and (iii) the Vavilov Institute (VIR), which hosts a one-century-old collection enriched with mid-latitude Asian accessions that are underrepresented in other genebanks, many of which were old landraces collected by Nikolai I.

The geographic distribution of these genetic groups is not random, as these three groups are distributed in South Asia (India and Pakistan), Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Taiwan), and more northernly parts of Asia (China, Korea, Japan, Russia, and Central Asia). As K increased, the cross-validation (CV) error decreased a little after K=4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), where the north group could be further divided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, worldwide diversity of cultivated mungbean could be separated into four major genetic groups corresponding to their geography: SA, Southeast Asian (SEA), East Asian (EA), and Central Asian (CA) groups. Note that the genetic groups were named after the region where most of their members distribute, and exceptions exist. For example, many EA accessions also distribute in Central Asia, and some SEA accessions were found near the eastern and northeastern coasts of India. Throughout this work, we make clear distinction between genetic group names (e.g. SA) and a geographic region (e.g. South Asia). Therefore, unlike any other previous work in this species, this study incorporates global genetic variation among cultivated mungbean of this important crop.</p><p>Using wild progenitor <italic>V. radiata</italic> var. <italic>sublobata</italic> (Wild hereafter) as the outgroup, the accession- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and population-level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) phylogenies both suggest CA to be genetically closest to EA.

According to this model, after initial domestication, the out-of-India event (when other groups diverged from SA) happened about 8.3 thousand generations ago (kga) with 75% parametric bootstrap range between 4.7 and 11.3 kga. Not until more than 5000 generations later (2.7 kga, 75% range 1.1â4.6 kga) did SEA diverge from the common ancestor of present-day EA and CA. CA diverged from EA only very recently (0.2 kga, 75% range 0.1â0.8 kga). Note that the divergence time was estimated in the number of generations, and the much longer growing seasons in the southern parts of Asia may allow more than one cropping season per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mishra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vir et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest the non-SA accessions have a common origin out of India (otherwise these groups would branch off independently from the SA group). Given this, the phylogenetic relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) is consistent with the following hypotheses. (1) The east hypothesis: mungbean expanded eastward and gave rise to the SEA group. This group might initially occupy northeast South Asia and later expanded to Southeast Asia either through the land or maritime route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castillo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuller et al., 2011</xref>). The group later expanded northward as EA. EA expanded westward into Central Asia and gave rise to the CA group. (2) The north hypothesis: the group leaving South Asia first entered Central Asia as the EA group. EA expanded eastward into East Asia through the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stevens et al., 2016</xref>). The eastern population of EA expanded southward as the SEA group, and later the western population of EA diverged as the CA group. (3) The northeast hypothesis: the group leaving South Asia (through either of the above-mentioned routes) was first successfully cultivated in northern East Asia without previously being established in Southeast Asia or Central Asia. The EA group then diverged southward as SEA and later expanded westward, giving rise to CA. Consistent with this model, the genetic variation of the EA group gradually declines from east to west, accompanied by the gentlest decline of precipitation per unit geographic distance across Asia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>While all three hypotheses are consistent with the phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the SEA group originated earlier than EA in the east hypothesis but later in the two other hypotheses. The former case predicts higher nucleotide diversity and faster LD decay in SEA than EA, which is supported by our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). While populations that were established in a region for an extended time could accumulate genetic differentiation, generating patterns of isolation by distance, rapid-spreading populations in newly colonized regions could not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; The 1001 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1001 Genomes Consortium, 2016</xref>). Using this idea, Mantelâs test revealed a significantly positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances for the SA genetic group (<italic>r</italic>=0.466, <italic>P</italic>=0.010), followed by SEA (<italic>r</italic>=0.252, although not as significant, <italic>P</italic>=0.069). No such association was found for EA (<italic>r</italic>=0.030, <italic>P</italic>=0.142) or CA (<italic>r</italic>=0.087, <italic>P</italic>=0.172). In addition, the southern groups (SA and SEA) together (<italic>r</italic>=0.737, <italic>P</italic>=0.001) have a much stronger pattern of isolation by distance than the northern groups (EA and CA, <italic>r</italic>=0.311, <italic>P</italic>=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Using Qâ¥0.5 instead of Qâ¥0.7 to assign individuals into genetic groups generated results that are largely consistent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). These results are again consistent with the âeast hypothesisâ that local accessions from the SA and SEA groups were established much earlier than those from EA and CA. Finally, the genetic variation of the EA group is highest in the eastern end and declines westward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This does not support the north hypothesis where EA first existed in Central Asia and expanded eastward.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Environmental differentiation of the inferred genetic groups</title><p>We further examined the possible causes governing the expansion of mungbean cultivation ranges. For a crop to be successfully cultivated in a new environment, dispersal and adaptation are both needed. Being a crop that has lost the ability of pod shattering, the spread of mungbean was governed by commerce or seed exchange. While barriers such as the Himalayas or Hindu Kush may limit human activity, South and Central Asia was already connected by a complex exchange network linking the north of Hindu Kush, Iran, and the Indus Valley as early as about 4 thousand years ago (kya; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dupuy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kohl, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kohl and Lyonnet, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LambergâKarlovsky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lombard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lyonnet, 2005</xref>), and some sites contain diverse crops originated across Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spengler et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, other ancient land or maritime exchange routes existed among South, Southeast, East, and Central Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stevens et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that mungbean could have been transported from South to Central Asia, but our genetic evidence suggests that the present-day CA group did not descend directly from the SA group. Therefore, we investigated whether climatic adaptation, that is, the inability of mungbean to establish in a geographic region after human-mediated long-range expansion, could be a contributing factor.</p><p>Multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) of eight bioclimatic variables (after removing highly-correlated ones; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e,f</xref>) indicated strong differentiation in the environmental niche space of the four genetic groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g,h</xref>).

The former three are relatively drier than the latter three zones. While SEA and CA are relatively homogeneous, SA and EA have about half of the samples in the dry and non-dry zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We, therefore, separated SA into SAe and SAw and EA into EAe and EAw, corresponding to the wetter eastern and drier western regions within the SA and EA ranges. Environmental niche modeling revealed distinct suitable regions of these six groups except for CA and EAw, whose geographical ranges largely overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistent with PCA, pairwise Schoenerâs D values are smallest between the northern and southern groups while largest (suggesting overlaps of niche space) between the eastern and western subsets within north and south (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), consistent with PCA that the major axis of climatic difference is between the northern and southern parts of Asia. Analyses using temperature and precipitation from May, July, and September yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Given a single out-of-India event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the results suggest it might be easier to first cultivate mungbean in Southeast rather than Central Asia, supporting the east hypothesis.</p><p>While both temperature and precipitation variables differ strongly between north and south, one should note that these year-round temperature variables do not correctly reflect conditions in the growing seasons. In the north, mungbean is mostly grown in summer where the temperature is close to the south (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4AâC</xref>). On the other hand, precipitation differs drastically between the north and south, especially for the CA group, where the summer-growing season is the driest of the year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4D</xref>). By estimating the regression slope of annual precipitation on geographical distance, we obtained a gradient of precipitation change per unit geographic distance between pairs of genetic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Despite the SA-SEA transect having the steepest gradient (slope = 0.21), the spread from SA to SEA has been accompanied by an increase of precipitation and did not impose drought stress. However, the second highest slope (0.18) is associated with a strong precipitation decrease if the SA group were to disperse to Central Asia. Results from the precipitation of May, July, and September yielded similar conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref>). This likely explains why no direct historic spread is observed from South to Central Asia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Trait variation among genetic groups</title><p>If environmental differences constrained the spread route of mungbean, the currently cultivated mungbean accessions occupying distinct environments should have locally adaptive traits for these environments.

Here, we report the records associated with our proposed mungbean spread route and the underlying mechanisms. The âClassic of Poetryâ (Shijing è©©ç¶) contains poems dating between the 11th and 7th centuries BCE near the lower and middle reaches of the Yellow River. While crops (especially soy bean, è½), vegetables, and many other plants have been mentioned, mungbean was not recorded. This is consistent with our results that mungbean had not reached the northern parts of East Asia at that time (the EA group diverged from the SEA group at around 2.7 kga). The first written record of mungbean in China is in an agricultural encyclopedia Qimin Yaoshu (é½æ°è¦è¡, 544 AD, Chinese text and translation in Supplementary note), whose spatiotemporal background (~1.5 kya near the lower reaches of Yellow River) is again consistent with our estimated origin of the EA group.</p><p>Our results suggest that the expansion of the mungbean cultivation range may be associated with the novel phenotypic characteristics potentially adaptive to the new environments. This proposal would be rejected if the novel phenotypic characteristics appeared very recently. In support of our proposal, Xiangshan Yelu (æ¹å±±éé, an essay collection during 1068â1077 AD) recorded that mungbean from the southern parts of Asia had higher yield and larger grains than those in northern China (Chinese text and translation in Supplementary note). Similarly, Tiangong Kaiwu (å¤©å·¥éç©, 1637 AD) mentioned that mungbean must be sown during July and August (Chinese text and translation in Supplementary note). The record suggests that the daylength requirement restricts the sowing period of mungbean in the north. Together with the dry summer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4D</xref>) and soon-arriving autumn frost, there might be a strong selection favoring accessions with the rapid life cycle. These records suggest the phenotypic characteristics of northern accessions did not originate very recently, and the unique distribution of climatic zones in Asia resulted in not only the specific patterns of expansion but also the evolution of novel phenotypic characteristics in mungbean.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using mungbean as a test case, we combined population genomics, environmental niche modeling, empirical field and laboratory investigation, and ancient Chinese text analyses to demonstrate the importance of climatic adaptation in dictating the unique patterns of cultivation range expansion after domestication. In this study, we focus on how or when mungbean could be established as part of local agriculture throughout Asia. We showed that after leaving South Asia, mungbean was likely first cultivated in Southeast Asia, East Asia, and finally Central Asia. We acknowledge that our data do not allow us to specify the number of previous out-of-India events that did not leave traces in modern genetic data or their exact routes (e.g. whether mungbean expanded from South to Southeast Asia through the land or maritime routes). While there might be multiple attempts to bring mungbean out of India as a commodity for consumption, our results suggest all present-day non-SA accessions have a common out-of-India origin.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The climate-driven spread route despite historical human activities</title><p>Combining archeological records, population genetics, and niche modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), our results suggest that after the early cultivation of mungbean in northwestern or southern South Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kingwell-Banham et al., 2015</xref>), the large environmental difference may restrict its northward spread to Central Asia. Mungbean may first spread to eastern South Asia, and the subsequent expansion to Southeast Asia might be facilitated by the environmental similarity between these two regions. This is supported by archaeobotanical remains from the Thai-Malay Peninsula date to ca. 400â100 BCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castillo et al., 2016</xref>). It took more than 5000 generations until mungbean further spread to northeast Asia, again likely due to the environmental difference. The later appearance of mungbean in northern China is also supported by historical records. After that, the EA group spread across the northern part of Asia within a few thousand generations. Our proposed route suggests that mungbean reached Central Asia at the latest, consistent with its absence from archeological sites in Central Asia, including Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in the Chalcolithic and Bronze ages (fifth to second millennium BC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller, 1999</xref>), Southeastern Kazakhstan in the Iron age dating first millennium BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Spengler et al., 2017</xref>), and eastern Uzbekistan during the medieval period (800â1100 AD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Spengler et al., 2018b</xref>). In addition, mungbean was only mentioned later by the 18th and early 19th centuries as a pulse grown in the Khiva region of Uzbekistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annanepesov and Bababekov, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we suggest that the ability to disperse may not be an essential factor restricting mungbean spread from South to Central Asia. Cultivated mungbean has lost the natural ability of pod shattering to disperse seeds, and they mostly traveled through landscapes by human-mediated seed exchange or commerce. Evidence of long-distance human-mediated dispersal of mungbean was available. For example, mungbean seeds have been found near the Red Sea coast of Egypt during the Roman (AD 1â250) period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van der Veen and Morales, 2015</xref>). As early as about 4 kya, the BactriaâMargiana Archaeological Complex civilization north of the Hindu Kush had extensive contact with the Indus Valley Civilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dupuy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kohl, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kohl and Lyonnet, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LambergâKarlovsky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lombard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lyonnet, 2005</xref>). By 1500 BC, the âTrans-Eurasian Exchangesâ of major cereal crops has happened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). The frequent crop exchange is evidenced by archaeobotanical findings in the Barikot site (ca. 1200 BC-50 AD) in northern Pakistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spengler et al., 2021</xref>), where diverse crops were cultivated, including those from West Asia (wheat, barley, pea, and lentil), South Asia (urdbean/mungbean), and likely East Asia (rice). Despite this, in Bronze-age archeological sites north of Hindu Kush, legumes (such as peas and lentils) were observed to a lesser extent than cereals, and SA crops were not commonly found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spengler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Spengler et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spengler et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Spengler et al., 2014b</xref>). Interestingly, archeologists suggested legumeâs higher water requirement than cereals may be associated with this pattern, and pea and lentilâs role as winter crops in Southwest Asia may be associated with their earlier appearance in northern Central Asia than other legumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Spengler et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spengler et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Spengler et al., 2014b</xref>). Therefore, despite the possibility of human-mediated seed dispersal between South and Central Asia, our results and archeological evidence concurred that mungbean arrived in Central Asia at the latest, likely restricted by environmental adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Local adaptation of mungbean genetic groups</title><p>Despite the profound impact of human-mediated dispersal on the spread of these and many other crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herniter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kistler et al., 2018</xref>), in mungbean, we suggest adaptation to distinct climatic regimes to be an important factor in the establishment after dispersal. Mungbean is commonly grown under rainfed cultivation and depends on the residual moisture in the fields after the primary crop, thus responding to water stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas et al., 2020</xref>). In the south, a temperature range of 20â30Â°C and annual precipitation of 600â1000 mm is optimal for mungbean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ha and Lee, 2019</xref>). In Central Asia, however, the annual precipitation could be as low as 286 mm, greatly below the lower limit required for the southern mungbean. This situation could be further acerbated by the fact that mungbean might not be a highly valued crop under extensive care during cultivation. Indeed, the earliest record of mungbean in China (Qimin Yaoshu é½æ°è¦è¡, 544 AD) emphasizes its use as green manure. In Central Asia, mungbean is a minor crop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rani et al., 2018</xref>) grown with little input, only in the short duration between successive planting of main crops (which is also the dry season in Central Asia, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>) and using residual soil moisture with little irrigation. We suggest that the lack of extensive input subjects mungbean to more substantial local climatic challenges than highly valued high-input crops that receive intensive management, including irrigation. Therefore, the combination of climatic constraints and cultural usage, instead of physical barriers, may have shaped the historical spread route of the mungbean despite extensive human activities across the continent.</p><p>In addition to the constraint of soil moisture, other factors may have contributed to the selection of short-season accessions in the north. In the short summer seasons of much of Central Asia, short crop cycling is a requirement. In Uzbekistan, mungbean is often sown in early July after the winter wheat season and harvested before mid-October to avoid delays in the next round of winter wheat and escape frost damage. Therefore, fast-maturing accessions are essential for this production system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rani et al., 2018</xref>). Similar rotation systems using mungbean to restore soil fertility during the short summer season after the harvest of the main crop were also mentioned in ancient Chinese sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen, 1980</xref>). Mungbean is a short-day species from the south, and daylength likely limits the window when mungbean could be grown in the north: Chinese texts during the 17th century (Tiangong Kaiwu å¤©å·¥éç©, 1637 AD) specifically mentioned the suitable duration to sow mungbean to control the flowering behavior for maximum yield (Supplementary note). Therefore, unlike in the south where yield appears to be an important selection target, the unique combination of daylength, agricultural practices, soil water availability, and frost damage in the north requires the selection for short-season accessions, likely limiting the direct adoption of southern accessions in the north. Consistent with this, CA accessions have a faster life cycle potentially adaptive to both short growing season and reduced soil water availability, with reduced plant size and lower yield as tradeoffs. These accessions also have increased root:shoot ratio for drought adaptation, similar to findings in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xu et al., 2015</xref>), alfalfa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), and chickpea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>About accession sampling and climatic niche modeling, we recognize that not all samples have available spatial data, and we do not have samples from some parts of Asia. For example, while most samples of the SEA group were collected from Taiwan, Thailand, and Philippines, we do not have many samples from the supposed contact zone between SA and SEA (Bangladesh and Myanmar) or between SEA and EA (southern China). If more samples were available from these contact zones, the modeled niche space between SA and SEA and between SEA and EA would be even more similar than the current estimate, strengthening our hypothesis that niche similarity might facilitate the cultivation expansion. On the other hand, clear niche differentiation between SA and CA was evident despite the dense sampling near their contact zone. Based on the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, South Asia could be roughly separated into two major zones, with the eastern zone slightly more similar to Southeast Asia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This partially explained the existence of some SEA accessions in the northeastern coast of India. While the SEA genetic group was named after the geographic region where most of its members were found in the present time, we recognize the possibility that it first occupied northeastern South Asia when it diverged from SA. In that case, the SA-SEA divergence time (4.7â11.3 kga) might indicate the divergence between the two climate zones within South Asia rather than the expansion of mungbean into Southeast Asia, which may occur much later.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study demonstrates that mungbeanâs cultivation range expansion is associated with climatic conditions, which shaped the genetic diversity and contributed to adaptive differentiation among genetic groups. The climatic differences likely also resulted in farmersâ differential emphasis on using it mainly as a grain or green manure crop, further intensifying the phenotypic diversification among regional mungbean accessions that could be used as an invaluable genetic resource for genetic improvement in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and SNP genotyping</title><p>A total of 290 cultivated mungbean (<italic>V. radiata</italic> var. <italic>radiata</italic>) accessions were provided by the VIR.

Using the longitude and latitude information, we extracted the KÃ¶ppen climate zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">KÃ¶ppen, 2011</xref>) using âkgcâ in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bryant et al., 2017</xref>). After excluding zones with less than 5 samples, the remaining 10 zones were grouped into 6 categories based on climate similarity: dry hot (BSh and BWh), dry cold (BSk and BWk), temperate dry summer (Csa), tropical savanna (Aw), continental (Dwb and Dfb), and temperate wet summer (Cfa and Cwa). The former three are relatively dry environments.</p><p>Climate layers comprising monthly minimum, maximum, mean temperature, precipitation, and 19 bioclimatic variables were downloaded from the WorldClim database version 1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hijmans et al., 2005</xref>). All climate layers available from WorldClim were created based on climate conditions recorded between 1960 and 1990 at a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds (approximately 1 km<sup>2</sup>). To minimize redundancy and model overfitting, pairwise Pearson correlations between the 19 bioclimatic variables were calculated using ENMTools version 1.4.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Warren et al., 2010</xref>), excluding one of the two variables that has a correlation above 0.8. As a result, eight bioclimatic variables were used for all further analyses, including Bio1 (annual mean temperature), Bio2 (mean diurnal range), Bio3 (isothermality), Bio8 (mean temperature of wettest quarter), Bio12 (annual precipitation), Bio14 (precipitation of driest month), Bio15 (precipitation seasonality), and Bio19 (precipitation of coldest month). Bioclimatic variables were extracted for each occurrence point using ârasterâ in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hijmans, 2021</xref>). PCA and MANOVA were conducted to examine whether there was a significant habitat difference among genetic groups. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) was performed using MAXENT version 3.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Phillips et al., 2006</xref>) to predict the geographic distribution of suitable habitats for cultivated mungbean. The ENM analysis was run with a random seed, a convergence threshold of 5000 and 10-fold CV. As a measure of the habitat overlaps of the four genetic groups, pairwise of Schoenerâs D was calculated using ENMTools. The value ranges from 0 (no niche overlap) to 1 (niche complete overlap). In addition, we carried out the same analyses using monthly temperature and precipitation from May, July, and September.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Field evaluation</title><p>Among the 52 accessions used for laboratory experiments, phenotyping of 49 accessions was conducted at WorldVeg, Taiwan in 1984 and 2018 and at Crop Sciences Institute, National Agricultural Research Centre, Pakistan in 2015. The traits related to phenology (days to 50% flowering), reproduction (100 seed weight, pod length, pods per plant, 1000 seed weight, seeds yield per plant, and seeds per pod), and plant size (petiole length, plant height, plant height at flowering, plant height at maturity, primary leaf length, primary leaf width, terminal leaflet length, and terminal leaflet width) were included. Trait values were inverse normal transformed. The ANOVA was performed to test for inferred genetic groups differences for each trait using R software (version 4.1.0).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Drought phenotyping</title><p>A total of 52 accessions with ancestry coefficients Qâ¥0.7 from three genetic groups (SEA, SA, and CA) were selected for experiments of seedling-stage drought response. The experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design with three replicates of each accession under two treatments (control/drought). The experiment was conducted in two independent batches, and the whole experiment included 624 plants (52 accessions Ã 2 treatments Ã 3 plants per treatment Ã 2 batches).</p><p>Mungbean seeds were surface-sterilized with 10% bleach for 10 min and rinsed with distilled water for three times. Seeds were treated with 70% ethanol for 5 min and washed three times in distilled water. The sterilized seeds were germinated on wet filter paper in petri dishes for 3 days. The experiment was conducted in a 740FLED-2D plant growth chamber (HiPoint, Taiwan) at a temperature of 25 Â± 1Â°C and 12 hr of photoperiod (light ratios of red: green: blue 3: 1: 1) with light intensity 350 Âµmol m<sup>â2</sup>s<sup>â1</sup> and relative humidity at 60 Â± 5%. The seedlings were then transplanted to a hydroponic system with half-strength Hoagland nutrient solution (Phytotechnology Laboratory, USA) and were grown for 6 days before drought stress started. The nutrient solution was changed on alternate days, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.0 with 1 M KOH or 1 M HCl.</p><p>For drought treatment, seedlings of mungbean were exposed to polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced drought stress for 5 days. The solution of PEG6000 with an osmotic potential of â0.6 MPa was prepared by adding PEG6000 (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) to the nutrient solution according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Michel and Kaufmann, 1973</xref>, and pH was also adjusted to 6.0. The seedlings grown with the nutrient solution under the same environmental conditions were considered as controls.</p><p>At the end of the experiment, plants were evaluated for SDW and root dry weight, measured on digital balance after oven-drying at 70Â°C for 48 hr. All traits were analyzed by mixed-model ANOVA with the treatment (control/drought) and the genetic group as fixed effects. The models included accessions as a random effect nested within genetic groups and a random effect of batches. Tukeyâs test was conducted to compare genetic groups. All statistics were performed using JMP v13.0.0 (SAS Institute, 2016).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title><italic>Q<sub>ST</sub>-F<sub>ST</sub></italic> comparisons</title><p>For each trait, quantitative trait divergence (<italic>Q<sub>ST</sub></italic>) was calculated separately with respect to each treatment.

AD)</title><p>Qimin Yaoshu, compiled by Sixie Jia (è³æå°), is one of the earliest and most complete agricultural sources in China, detailing agricultural techniques near the lower reaches of Yellow River at that era. This is the earliest record of mungbean in China, demonstrating mungbean has reached northern China at that time and is consistent with our estimates of population divergence time. The popularity of mungbean is demonstrated by it being mentioned multiple times under different contexts, most notably as a green manure:</p><p>ãè¥ç³ä¸å¯å¾èï¼äºå­æä¸­ï¼ç©ç¨®èè±ï¼è³ä¸æï¼å«æï¼çæ©æ®ºä¹ãå¦ä»¥ç³ç³ç°ï¼åè¯ç¾èç³ä¸æ®ï¼åçååãã</p><p>Translation: âShould feces be unavailable, during May and June one could grow mungbean. In July or August, one could plow mungbean plants into the soil. This is equivalent to using feces to manure the land. This is as good as using feces and saves efforts.â</p><p>Notice that the months used in ancient China are slightly different from the Gregorian calendar.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-1-2"><title>Xiangshan Yelu (æ¹å±±éé, 1068â1077 AD)</title><p>Xiangshan Yelu was written by a monk, Wen-Ying (æç©), recording anecdotes during that era. Its records about the Emperor Zhenzong of Song (å®çå®, 968â1022 AD) detailed the phenotypes of Indian mungbean at that time:</p><p>ãçå®æ·±å¿µç¨¼ç©¡ï¼èå åç¨»èæ±, è¥¿å¤©ç¶ è±å­å¤èç²å¤§ï¼åé£ä½¿ä»¥çè²¨æ±å¶ç¨®ãå åå¾ç¨®äºåç³ï¼è³ä»å¨èæ­ä¹ãè¥¿å¤©ä¸­å°åå¾èè±ç¨®äºç³ï¼ä¸ç¥ä»ä¹èè±æ¯å¦ï¼ã</p><p>Translation: âZhenzong of Song deeply concerned about agriculture. He heard Champa rice being drought tolerant, and mungbean from India produce numerous and large seeds. Diplomats were sent to exchange the seeds with treasure. Twenty dans of Champa rice were obtained and propagated everywhere. Two dans of mungbean were obtained from India, but it is unclear whether the mungbean today descended from these.â</p><p>âDanâ (ç³) is a unit of volume in ancient China and is called âKokuâ in Japanese. The exact amount varied with time.</p><p>The texts provide us with two pieces of important information. First, mungbean from South Asia (likely also includes the SEA genetic groups if accessions near eastern India and Bangladesh were included) at that time had higher yield and larger seeds than native mungbean accessions in northern China, consistent with our results on trait divergence. Second, compared to the clear success of Champa rice in China, it was unclear whether those southern mungbean accessions had prospered in northern China, likely suggesting an unsuccessful introduction of southern high-yield and large-seeded accessions to the north.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-1-3"><title>Tiangong Kaiwu (å¤©å·¥éç©, 1637 AD)</title><p>Tiangong Kaiwu is a famous Chinese encyclopedia compiled by Song Yingxing (å®ææ). While it mostly covers technologies at that time, a section about agricultural practices covers mungbean:</p><p>ãç¶ è±å¿å°ææ¹ç¨®ï¼æªåå°æèç¨®ï¼åå¶èèå»¶æ¸å°ºï¼çµè¢çç¨ãè¥éæè³æ¼èæï¼åé¨æéè±çµè¢ï¼é¡ç²äº¦å°ãã</p><p>Translation: âMungbean must be sown at or after Xiaoshu (Gregorian 7â8 July). Being sown before Xiaoshu, mungbean stems would spread for meters with few pods set. Being sown as late as Chushu (Gregorian 23â24 August), the plants would flower and set pods at any time, also with low yield.â</p><p>As a short-day plant, being sown too early when the days are too long, mungbean would have mostly vegetative growth. Being sown too late when the days are too short, flowering would be induced too quickly before sufficient vegetative development. In addition to our results that short-season accessions were favored in the north due to the requirement for drought escape, this source provides us with another support that mungbean could only be sown in a narrow time window due to daylength requirement. Given the autumn frost damage in the north, not being able to be sown earlier restricts the growing season length in the north, limiting the adoption of southern long-season accessions.</p></sec></sec></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85725.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Weigel</surname><given-names>Detlef</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0243gzr89</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology TÃ¼bingen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This is an important interdisciplinary effort, with compelling genetic evidence, that informs on the spread of an important crop.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;The climatic constrains of the historical global spread of mungbean&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>First we would like to apologize for the length of time it took to reach this decision. We had hoped to get input from another archaeologist who had agreed to review but in the end did not submit a review. We had a rather long discussion of the work, plus several of the people involved were on vacation.</p><p>Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jeffrey RossâIbarra (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will is not acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The first two reviewers, both geneticists with experience in plant domestication, were excited about the topic and the interdisciplinary approach taken. But both raised a number of concerns about the methods and approaches used, which would require substantial additional work to address. The third reviewer, an archaeologist, raised real concerns about how well the paper has incorporated existing data into interpretation and analysis.</p><p>In the end, given the number of concerns raised on both the genetic and archaeological fronts, I'm sorry to say that we have decided that this work in its current form will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. Having said this, there was broad interest in the work and the topic, and we would reconsider, albeit as a new submission, an extensively revised paper, which would likely look very different from the study at hand.</p><p>We are sorry about this outcome, but hope that the comments will be helpful for submission elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors provide an ambitious interdisciplinary analysis of the postâdomestication spread of mungbean. I believe the authors' general thesis is correct, and the various data they provide are all consistent with their model.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are some issues with analysis and interpretation, and in general, the data don't provide definitive evidence that allows claims about drought or the importance of the environment.</p><p>All of the evidence and analysis presented are consistent with the authors' proposed SAâSEAâEAâCA model. The f3 results are particularly convincing. I struggle, however, with how the data definitively show environment was more important than human movement. Some text shows, for example, that trading or demic movement between SA and CA was frequent would make clear that mungbean 'could' have moved SAâ&gt;CA via humans but didn't. Otherwise, could the SAâSEAâEAâCA model simply reflect historical movements/expansions of people in those directions/times?</p><p>On a similar note, the paper claims that drought was the most important factor limiting the mungbean movement. The phenotypic data certainly suggest adaptive differences in traits related to drought and drought differences in phenotype in an experimental setting, but additional evidence would be helpful to convince that drought is the key factor. The authors note the importance of daylength differences, for example â how do we know daylength wasn't the limiting factor (as it seems to have been in the northward spread of maize, for example)?</p><p>Methods Recommendations</p><p>â It's difficult in some places to know which SNP data set is used where. Are the LDâpruned SNPs used to estimate LD decay? The methods say there are 67K sites (including monomorphic) but there are 41K SNPs. This would imply that 2/3 of the sites are polymorphic. That can't be right so I must be misunderstanding something. Are these monomorphic sites also used for estimating nucleotide diversity (see the issue with VCFtools below)? For fastsimcoal, do you include sites where the derived allele is frequency=0 and where the derived allele is frequency 1?</p><p>â It would be good to modify the language of the MaxEnt modeling. While MaxEnt may show that the modern mungbean does not currently grow in conditions similar to those during the Holocene at a certain spot on the map, this is not the same as saying the plant could not have grown there. For example, if we were to model MaxEnt on modern CO2 concentrations, we would come to the conclusion that modern mungbean could not have grown anywhere during the Holocene. I don't think necessarily the methods need to be changed, but it would be good to change the language here to be less definitive.</p><p>â Although dominance is less of a concern in inbred species, I believe it is still incorrect to assume that using Vg is equivalent to Va in Qst. The epistatic variance could still be important, for example, and my brief internet search suggests mungbean isn't 100% selfing either. The authors have SNP data for all the individuals phenotyped, so it should be doable to estimate Va using kinship matrices and thus do a correct Qst analysis.</p><p>âÂ VCFtools calculates nucleotide diversity assuming every bp in a window has been sequenced. This will lead to incorrect estimates of Ï and Fst. See https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33453139/ for details and one potential fix if you have a vcf with invariant sites, or https://github.com/RILAB/mop for another if you just have bams + variable vcf.</p><p>â an NJ tree (Figure 1E) is just a clustering algorithm and shouldn't be interpreted as providing information on the timing or order of evolutionary events. (lines 119â123)</p><p>â If the growing season is known and is what is most relevant for the crop (line 190), these should be used for most analyses or a justification for using annual data should be provided</p><p>â I can't find the total length of time plants were grown for the drought stress experiment. The text reads as if it were 9 days?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study aims to understand the diffusion of the Mugbean population in Asia using genomic and phenotypic data. The authors used phylogeny, analysis of population structure, modelâbased inference, quantitative genetics, and niche modeling to understand the diffusion of Mugbean and proposed a scenario where diffusion is strongly constrained by climate, and partially by geographical.</p><p>I found the study very interesting with a mix of different methodologies from genomics to niche modeling and quantitative genetics. Few others studies used similar approaches but it is rather unique for the study of diffusion to combine these different approaches and bring up very interesting results. I have several comments on the methods so the results are better supported for the genetic part, for the phenotypic part, I am not sure the author will be able to support their claims, as the method they used might inflate variance in their estimations.</p><p>Main comments:</p><p>Phylogeny. Phylogeny is not really an appropriate method per see for intraâdiversity study, phylogeny analysis could be used but the basic assumptions of the method are often inadequate, so the result should be put in context. A better method to do phylogenyâlike inference is the TREEMIX approach based on the relationship of population integrating drift. I suggest the authors add this complementary analysis.</p><p>Model inference. Here, I would have liked a statistical comparison of the different scenarios. FastSimcoal allows for estimated probability of models/scenarios and it would be an independent validation to have such a comparison of models.</p><p>The inference of the model is dependent on mutation rate (unknown), notably on the time of divergence. The author used 10â8 but it is neither discussed nor justified.</p><p>Analysis of structure.</p><p>The author led aside from further studying individuals with ancestry lower than 70% in a given group. The analysis of structure could lead to such ancestry because of admixture or isolation by distance. One is secondary contact based on recent (or not) gene flow between genetic groups, the author is related to diffusion across the landscape. A large fraction of individuals in the PCA seems to me more likely related to isolation by distance (between SEA/EA, EA/CA). How this will impact the analysis of correlation by geographical distance if such individuals are not considered? The authors should perform the analysis of the Mantel test with all individuals to assess the impact of their choices.</p><p>Quantitative analysis of QST. The author used the genetic variance and not the additive variance. The reasoning behind that is not explained, neither the inflation created by this broad sense QST. Authors have concluded that the &quot;extent to which comparisons between FST and broadâsense QST are appropriate remains unknown&quot; (Pujol et al. 2008).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper aims to look at the domestication, postâdomestication spread, and adaptation of mungbean (Vigna radiata) across Asia through the use of genetic data from landraces and accessions in see and genebanks.</p><p>The genetic aspects of this paper are a strength â there is a lot of work that has been done putting together a range of datasets allowing for interâcollection comparison and comparison of collections made by different institutes with their varying goals, sampling strategies, and dates of collecting. Mapping this diversity, think about how drift has occurred and why is something that needs to be done, especially in mungbean (and other tropical pulses of Asian/South Asian origin) as they are often overlooked in literature.</p><p>However, the main stated goal of the paper â to look at the domestication, postâdomestication, and adaptations to climate change as this crop was moved around â is where it falls short. There is little engagement with the deep archaeological literature on both domestication as a process, postâdomestication use and spread of mungbean (and other South Asian crops and those involved in the Silk Routes trade pathways), and the complexity of climate reconstructions and climate change over the stated period of interest/regions of interest. Works by Spengler and d'Alpoim Guedes for example are missed with regards to the Silk Routes debates, and literature by Fuller, Murphy given only short sentences as background for what is a very complex background regarding where and when mungbean is thought to have been domesticated. There is little reflection on the context of the two/three possible origins for mung (south, north, and west South Asia), how this interacts with the Southern Indian Neolithic and Indus regions, and how the changing cultural dynamics may have contributed to the processes of domestication, postâdomestication change and the spread of different varieties. Without this background, it is hard to then move into discussing modern genetic data with a view to past patterns, for example with thinking about how climate may have affected change, given that the debates around the 4,2k event are extremely complex within these, let alone thinking panâAsian and trying to link potentially 'drifted' genetic data today to these deepâtime events. This comes across in the timescales given to the genetic data, as without the context of the where and when from archaeology, we see dates such as those given in Figure 2B that suggest domestication for South Asia moving to South East Asia at c.6kya (4000BC), which is when we still think they were under domestication within South Asia. The region is also not pinned down for where in South Asia these specific 'domesticated' mung are coming from to go to South East Asia, and the routes, yet arrows and big circles are added in Figure 2A. This shows the issue of not using that important context from archaeology.</p><p>A further issue arises from thinking about the climate data. By conflating vast areas (e.g.: South Asia, Central Asia, etc.), when applying climate modelling there has been an oversimplification, which makes any discussion of mung bean adapting to climate post domestication difficult to sustain. In line 184 for example, there is a suggestion on the role of the 6.2k event in Central Asia (putting aside the above issues of the dating of mung domestication in South Asia before it even reaches Central Asian regions already noted). While there are a few datasets as cited in the paper that show some impacts of wetter climates in some regions of Central Asia for a wetter 6,2k event this is by no means a universal impact, and regional data points are needed. We can see this when looking to the Indus and the impact of the 4.2k event as another example, again a point that needs refining in order to make such claims about mung domestication, let alone postâdomestication adaptations.</p><p>Overall the thrust of the paper â domestication, postâdomestication, and the spread of agriculture â are overshadowing what is actually a far more interesting point, hidden in lines 87â89: this data could be &quot;used this resource to investigate the global history of mungbean after domestication [â¦looking at the â¦] phenotypic characteristics for local adaptation to distinct environments.&quot; This perhaps is where the paper is most interesting, and reframing it in this context would be truly exciting, looking at the diversity of the crop, how it is now adapted to diverse environments, and what this might mean for longâterm sustainability in cropping systems.</p><p>This paper sadly is losing some very interesting genetics data in complex and poorly explained mung history.</p><p>â The lack of engagement with archaeological data and the misunderstanding of the chronology of mung use in the past makes it very difficult to tally the results with the interpretations and discussions. This MAJOR point has been unpacked in more detail above and must be addressed in order to reduce the oversimplification of the background and remove the concerning premise that no one has done much work on ancient mung use (as stated up to l.77). While it has not had as much work as the cereals, there is still work being done on it, looking at its domestication regions, secondary domestication changes and spread across South Asia and then into different parts of Asia.</p><p>â Data seems to have been massaged to make it fit with the climate modelling in various regions (for example Figure 2B has mung arriving in Central Asia around 0.2k yet discussions of 6.2k climate events in l.184), and to also make mung seem to be spreading before the domestication event itself. More engagement with the archaeological discussions on mung domestication is needed and discussions of what domestication is as a process (there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the conscious/unconscious action outline in Larson et al. in l.47 â the way it is phrased implies deliberate choice to ensure change rather than recognizing the inherent unconscious and indirect action of human behavior and the entanglement of humanâplantâenvironment interactions).</p><p>â Terms like cultivar and variety and landrace are used interchangeably. These must be defined in the paper. How they fit in with notions of domestication and postâdomestication agricultural behavior must also be unpacked.</p><p>â &quot;how the domesticated forms later expanded to a broader geographical area has also been detailed in several species, including maize (Matsuoka et al., 2002), rice (Huang et al., 2012), tomato (Razifard et al., 2020), chickpea (Varshney et al., 2021), and lettuce (Wei et al., 2021).&quot; â these are unusual choices of case study to make a point as many (maize and rice as key examples) are not accepted as well defined and remain highly controversial. These are genetics papers, and demonstrate the lack of familiarity with the archaeological context of domestication. A quick glance at the literature around them will illustrate that they are poor choices of case studies to make this point as they too are highly controversial.</p><p>â &quot;It is also unclear whether the expansion of most crops strictly follows the longitudinal axis of the continents (Diamond, 2005) or whether or why some are able to cross different climatic zones.&quot; â again poor knowledge of the archaeological context of these debates, and the reliance on Diamond is concerning as he is not an archaeologist. See works by Lister on barley and Lui on wheat as a good starting point.</p><p>â Debate on wild progenitor of mung bean needs to be explored. while sublobator is a likely candidate it should be explained in the paper that there are other possible options, and then why it was chosen here, with citations.</p><p>â The figures are difficult to use. This comes back to the conflation of space and time outlined in the public review. There are big circles on the maps covering the dots which I presume are either archaeological sites or accession points of the sampled beans(?! unclear), and then very odd choices of illustrating change over time. The figures are small and hard to see and require very long text in the figures to make them useable.</p><p>â Some aspects of basic geography have been overlooked to make climate the most important variable; l.166â7 &quot;Given that geographic barrier might not be the most important factor&quot;. I find it hard to believe that both the Himalayas and major flood basins like the Brahmaputra would not be an issue, as would issues of day length when moving things northâsouth.</p><p>â In dealing with issues of climate change and adaptation some discussion of tolerance is needed. there must be a discussion (and a table perhaps) of the different watering, salination, temperature, etc. tolerance of the mung bean(s) under consideration to make the claims justified.</p><p>â Within the methods, the sampling strategy was hard to follow. This needs a more careful and clear description of decisions made: exactly where did the accessions come from geographically? how did their spread affect the dataset? Is there geographic clustering, did you compensate for that? how does the sampling potentially bias your data? a map would be useful.</p><p>â Fair and open protocols dictate that all methods must be stated: &quot;Genomic DNA was extracted from a single plant per accession using QIAGEN Plant Mini DNA kit according to the manufacturer's instruction with minor modification.&quot; If you modified the protocol then you have to outline what you did so it can be reproducible and the data comparable.</p><p>â &quot;Climate data for conditions between 1960â1990 were downloaded from the WORLDCLIM 1.4 database&quot; â how was this dataset determined? why 30 years and not more? give citations to explain this decision, and look to other modelling efforts to check comparability.</p><p>â &quot;19 bioclimatic variables&quot; â what are these? why were they chosen? a table and explanation are needed.</p><p>â &quot;excluding one of the two variables that have a correlation above 0.8 (Supplementary file 4)&quot; â why? explain the reasoning for exclusion.</p><p>â Throughout the dataset has relied on &quot;In total, our dataset contains more than one thousand accessions (1092) and covers worldwide diversity of mungbean representing a wide range of variation in seed colour&quot; however at no point is there a discussion of whether these are modern variants of historic landraces and how this was assessed. This has a big impact on any discussion of &quot;ancient&quot; adaptations, and there must be a discussion of how you tested to see if the genetic changes you see are more recent or past changes and how the genetic clock was applied.</p><p>As noted in the public review, a far more interesting aspect than trying to tie into domestication/postâdomestication and chronological vagaries are the points made in lines 87â89: this data could be &quot;used this resource to investigate the global history of mungbean after domestication [â¦looking at the â¦] phenotypic characteristics for local adaptation to distinct environments.&quot; Thinking about the value of this dataset for the preservation of diversity, and how diversity links to localised adaptations today and to sustainable cropping now is critical, and I suggest this could be the way to reframe things.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Environment as a limiting factor of the historical global spread of mungbean&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Specifically, we emphasized studies that as early as about 4kya, Central and South Asia was connected through a complex exchange network linking the north of Hindu Kush, Iran, and the Indus River Civilization (Doumani Dupuy, 2016; Kohl, 2007; Kohl and Lyonnet, 2008; Lamberg-Karlovsky, 2002; Lombard, 2020; Lyonnet 2005). Later, there was archaeological evidences that diverse crops from West, South, and East Asia have been cultivated in northern Pakistan (Spengler <italic>et al.</italic> 2021), suggesting the prevalence of crop exchange. Human-mediated long distance dispersal of mungbean seeds also happened, as mungbean seeds have been found near the Red Sea Coast of Egypt during the Roman period (Van der Veen and Morales, 2015). Despite the prevalence of exchange, we note in Discussion: âDespite this, in Bronze-age archaeological sites north of Hindu Kush, cereals were frequently observed. Legumes (such as peas and lentils) were observed to a lesser extent, and South Asian crops were not commonly found (Jeong <italic>et al.</italic> 2019, Spengler <italic>et al.</italic> 2018). Interestingly, archaeologists suggested legumeâs higher water requirement than cereals may be associated with this pattern, and pea and lentilâs role as winter crops in Southwest Asia may be associated with their earlier appearance in northern Central Asia than other legumes (Spengler <italic>et al.</italic> 2014).â Our study of genetics, climate, and plant traits therefore support conclusion from archaeological studies.</p><p>Doumani Dupuy PN 2016.

On a similar note, the paper claims that drought was the most important factor limiting the mungbean movement. The phenotypic data certainly suggest adaptive differences in traits related to drought and drought differences in phenotype in an experimental setting, but additional evidence would be helpful to convince that drought is the key factor. The authors note the importance of daylength differences, for example â how do we know daylength wasn't the limiting factor (as it seems to have been in the northward spread of maize, for example)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. The main thesis of this study is that environmental adaptation may be an important factor. We used drought (among many other environmental factors) as a test case and chose root/shoot traits and field phenology as supporting evidences. We wish to note that we do not claim drought to be the most important. We believe mungbean was influenced by the join effects of multiple environmental factors: In the north, there is a limited duration for sowing (due to daylength), and the soon-arriving fall frost (temperature) further limited the growing season. During this period the water availability is also low (drought). The rapid phenology therefore appears to be important for adaptation to the short growing season (caused by daylength and temperature) and declining water availability (drought). We have rephrased the point throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods Recommendations</p><p>3. It's difficult in some places to know which SNP data set is used where. Are the LDâpruned SNPs used to estimate LD decay? The methods say there are 67K sites (including monomorphic) but there are 41K SNPs. This would imply that 2/3 of the sites are polymorphic. That can't be right so I must be misunderstanding something. Are these monomorphic sites also used for estimating nucleotide diversity (see the issue with VCFtools below)? For fastsimcoal, do you include sites where the derived allele is frequency=0 and where the derived allele is frequency 1?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the error. After quality filtering, in total there are 1248K sites, among which 34K are SNPs. The nucleotide diversity, pairwise genetic distance, and all related analyses have been re-done using the estimates incorporating monomorphic sites. For fastsimcoal, we included monomorphic sites. The previous information (67K sites for fastsimcoal) was a typo. The LD decay was calculated using the SNP sites without LD-prune. We have revised the manuscript throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It would be good to modify the language of the MaxEnt modeling. While MaxEnt may show that the modern mungbean does not currently grow in conditions similar to those during the Holocene at a certain spot on the map, this is not the same as saying the plant could not have grown there. For example, if we were to model MaxEnt on modern CO2 concentrations, we would come to the conclusion that modern mungbean could not have grown anywhere during the Holocene. I don't think necessarily the methods need to be changed, but it would be good to change the language here to be less definitive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.

Although dominance is less of a concern in inbred species, I believe it is still incorrect to assume that using Vg is equivalent to Va in Qst. The epistatic variance could still be important, for example, and my brief internet search suggests mungbean isn't 100% selfing either. The authors have SNP data for all the individuals phenotyped, so it should be doable to estimate Va using kinship matrices and thus do a correct Qst analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. Goudet and BÃ¼chi (2006) showed that for partially inbred species, the selfed-progeny design (as in our study) is more suitable than the half-sib design. With selfed progeny, Goudet and BÃ¼chi (2006) suggested using Q<sub>ST</sub> = V<sub>B</sub> / ( V<sub>B</sub> + V<sub>Fam</sub> ) , where V<sub>B</sub> is the among-group variance component and V<sub>Fam</sub> is the family-level variance component within genetic groups.

Mapping this diversity, think about how drift has occurred and why is something that needs to be done, especially in mungbean (and other tropical pulses of Asian/South Asian origin) as they are often overlooked in literature.</p><p>1. However, the main stated goal of the paper â to look at the domestication, postâdomestication, and adaptations to climate change as this crop was moved around â is where it falls short. There is little engagement with the deep archaeological literature on both domestication as a process, postâdomestication use and spread of mungbean (and other South Asian crops and those involved in the Silk Routes trade pathways), and the complexity of climate reconstructions and climate change over the stated period of interest/regions of interest. Works by Spengler and d'Alpoim Guedes for example are missed with regards to the Silk Routes debates, and literature by Fuller, Murphy given only short sentences as background for what is a very complex background regarding where and when mungbean is thought to have been domesticated. There is little reflection on the context of the two/three possible origins for mung (south, north, and west South Asia), how this interacts with the Southern Indian Neolithic and Indus regions, and how the changing cultural dynamics may have contributed to the processes of domestication, postâdomestication change and the spread of different varieties. Without this background, it is hard to then move into discussing modern genetic data with a view to past patterns, for example with thinking about how climate may have affected change, given that the debates around the 4,2k event are extremely complex within these, let alone thinking panâAsian and trying to link potentially 'drifted' genetic data today to these deepâtime events. This comes across in the timescales given to the genetic data, as without the context of the where and when from archaeology, we see dates such as those given in Figure 2B that suggest domestication for South Asia moving to South East Asia at c.6kya (4000BC), which is when we still think they were under domestication within South Asia. The region is also not pinned down for where in South Asia these specific 'domesticated' mung are coming from to go to South East Asia, and the routes, yet arrows and big circles are added in Figure 2A. This shows the issue of not using that important context from archaeology.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the valuable comments. In this revision we discussed previous archaeological findings in Introduction and, as suggested, use the archaeological findings as the basis of our genetic investigation. Using genetic data, we re-constructed the evolutionary relationship among these major genetic groups. We showed that CA and EA to be genetically closest, followed by SEA, and SA is the most diverged group. As stated in our revised Results section, this observation is actually still consistent with several hypotheses, and we used further population genetics evidences to distinguish among these hypotheses. While our data suggested the general trend of SA-SEA-EA-CA, our investigation is limited by the amount of samples with detailed geo-referenced information.</p><p>Indeed, archaeological evidences have shown multiple independent early cultivation of mungbean within South Asia. As the reviewer has pointed out, the present-day samples were âdriftedâ from the ancient varieties. It is exactly because of this reason that we did not attempt to use the present-day samplesâ detailed GPS coordinates to answer/discuss the issue about these independent origins of mungbean cultivation within South Asia. Due to the possibility of long-term seed exchange and replacement within South Asia, the samples collected in a specific location might not necessarily reflect the genetic information for ancient mungbean at the same locations. This is supported by our recent results (Lin <italic>et al.</italic> 2022) that present-day worldwide cultivars, despite their geographic origin, have the same haplotype in the promoter region of <italic>VrMYB26a</italic>, a candidate gene controlling pod shattering in several <italic>Vigna</italic> species. This is consistent with a single origin of the loss of pod shattering phenotype common to present-day cultivars and suggests that while early mungbean cultivations happened independently, eventually one form with the loss-of-pod-shattering phenotype (and <italic>VrMYB26a</italic> haplotype) dominated and replaced others. Answering where the &quot;domestication allele&quot; of <italic>VrMYB26a</italic> originated or deciphering the relationship between present-day germplasms and ancient cultivation origins within India would require information from more geo-referenced ancient DNA, which would be out of the scope of this present study. On the other hand, we recognize the climate heterogeneity within South Asia. We performed new climatic analyses separating the SA group into two major regions based on the KÃ¶ppen climate classification (one more similar to Southeast Asia and the other more similar to Central Asia). The results remain similar.</p><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that modern samples are âdriftedâ and do not necessarily reflect ancient conditions. It is exactly due to this reason that we did not attempt to pinpoint the detailed or specific route of the out-of-India event, either. The genetic data simply do not allow us to pinpoint, for example, whether mungbean expanded from South Asia to Southeast Asia / southern China through the land or maritime routes (Fuller <italic>et al.</italic> 2011; Castillo <italic>et al.</italic> 2017). In our revision, we emphasized these routes are both compatible with our hypothesis. We wish to emphasize that we do not put much emphasis on the exact route of mungbean expansion, nor do we think there is only one wave/one route of the out-of-India event. There might be multiple attempts to bring mungbean out of India (which could not be answered unless with ancient DNA), and our focus in this study is whether or when mungbean could be grown and became part of the local agriculture throughout Asia. As in many other population genetics studies, if the previous waves were replaced by the later-arriving germplasms, our data could not provide information for the previous waves. We agree using big circles and arrows are too rough for the more complicated history of mungbean spread. We have modified this figure and prevent specifying a specific route without genetic evidence.</p><p>Take human genetics as an example, while modern populations have drifted from ancient populations, studies using modern DNA revealed much of the important demographic history. Using genetic and phenotypic data from modern populations, scientists are able to decipher the unique adaptation in human history (for example, lactose intolerance and many other studies from researchers such as Rasmus Nielsen and Graham Coop). Our work has similar aims and approaches to these studies. Similarly, questions such as âhow many independent out-of-Africa events have happenedâ, âwhether each of these originated from different locations within Africaâ, or âthe specific route of how anatomically modern human reached East Asiaâ would await studies incorporating ancient DNA from archaeological studies. For mungbean, we look very much forward to the chance of investigating these samples.</p><p>About the estimated divergence time among genetic groups, we wish to note that the time estimates have high confidence intervals (previously we only used the 50% range, and Reviewer1 suggests reporting wider ranges). Further, the time estimated was in units of generations instead of years (we modified the manuscript to clarify this). The growing season in the northern part of Asia is short, and we reasonably assumed one generation per year. This might not fit the whole Asia, since the southern parts of Asian have longer growing season and may allow more than one generation per year. Assuming one generation per year (as we naively did in the previous version) overestimated the divergence time for the southern groups. This is the limitation of current methods in this field, and we have acknowledged this in the manuscript.</p><p>Castillo <italic>et al.</italic> 2016.

A further issue arises from thinking about the climate data. By conflating vast areas (e.g.: South Asia, Central Asia, etc.), when applying climate modelling there has been an oversimplification, which makes any discussion of mung bean adapting to climate post domestication difficult to sustain. In line 184 for example, there is a suggestion on the role of the 6.2k event in Central Asia (putting aside the above issues of the dating of mung domestication in South Asia before it even reaches Central Asian regions already noted). While there are a few datasets as cited in the paper that show some impacts of wetter climates in some regions of Central Asia for a wetter 6,2k event this is by no means a universal impact, and regional data points are needed. We can see this when looking to the Indus and the impact of the 4.2k event as another example, again a point that needs refining in order to make such claims about mung domestication, let alone postâdomestication adaptations.</p></disp-quote><p>Our study started from population genetic analyses, which separated the samples into four genetic groups. These genetic groups were separated purely based on genetic data without any geographic information, and their names (SA, SEA, EA,CA) were given based on where most of the materials came from. Given this, each genetic group is a relatively homogeneous entity compared to worldwide genetic variation. We fully agree that each specific location has its own unique climatic conditions, but since the purpose of this study is to investigate what factors affect the divergence among these four genetic groups, we used each genetic group as a unit in climate analyses and aimed to identify which factors have larger among-group than within-group variation. We fully agree and recognize that the distribution ranges for some genetic groups have large environmental heterogeneity. For example, the EA group distributes from the Pacific Coast to Central Asia. This is why we separated the EA groups into the eastern and western halves to accommodate this issue. Another geographic region potentially with large environmental heterogeneity is South Asia. In this revision, we investigated the distribution of these samples based on KÃ¶ppen climate classification. CA samples have relatively homogeneous distribution in a few KÃ¶ppen zones with similar climatic characteristics, and so are SEA samples. Based on the patterns of SA and EA samples, we separated them into two groups each, resulting in a total of sis zones. We wish to emphasize that the major goal of this study is to investigate factors affecting the differentiation among these four genetic groups. Further subsetting the range into many small regions was not strongly supported by genetic evidence. Finally, niche modeling requires reasonable amount of samples to estimate the âtolerance environmental rangeâ (Reviewer 3, point 1) of a group, and subsetting samples based on the unique climatic characteristics of each location is not suitable for this analysis.</p><p>Note that in climatic modeling, we obtained the present-day environments from the present-day distribution of these present-day materials to identify their suitable âniche spaceâ. Using this information, we predicted âwhere would be the suitable environment for these genetic groups under different climatic conditionsâ given the niche space information of each genetic group. The existence of the projected distribution for the CA group at 6.2kya (in the previous supplement figure) was merely a method to compare the climatic difference between 6.2kya and today, and this figure does not mean we thought the CA group already existed in the Central Asia geographical region at 6.2kya. We did not attempt to make mungbean seem already widespread at that time (in response to Reviewer 3, point 5). The whole purpose of the analysis using 6.2k climate was to investigate whether the Central Asia geographical region may be a suitable habitat for plants from the SA group when the Central Asian climate might be slightly different from today. If so, that would reject our hypothesis. Due to the possibility of confusion, we removed this figure in the revision.</p><p>To project the suitable distribution range, this niche modeling method requires the GIS layer with data in every 1km geographical grid, which is available for very limited number of time points. While mid-Holocene is the only close-enough time point with bioclimatic variables being modeled (http://www.worldclim.com/past), we agree this is a poor choice. We also agree detailed regional data would better reflect the spatial heterogeneity of climatic conditions, but this distribution modeling approach requires climate data for all geographical grids. We therefore removed the mid-Holocene niche modeling result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Overall the thrust of the paper â domestication, postâdomestication, and the spread of agriculture â are overshadowing what is actually a far more interesting point, hidden in lines 87â89: this data could be &quot;used this resource to investigate the global history of mungbean after domestication [â¦looking at the â¦] phenotypic characteristics for local adaptation to distinct environments.&quot; This perhaps is where the paper is most interesting, and reframing it in this context would be truly exciting, looking at the diversity of the crop, how it is now adapted to diverse environments, and what this might mean for longâterm sustainability in cropping systems.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We fully agree understanding the genetics, unique phenotypic characteristics, and local adaptation of these germplasms is important, and we sincerely hope to use our results to contribute to the goal of long-term sustainability and crop improvement. This is the topic of other research projects in our group. On the other hand, we also agree with the two other reviewers that using the genetic data to contribute to understanding of mungbean cultivation expansion is interesting. As the potential importance of environmental adaptation in determining crop cultivation range has been suggested in several archaeological studies (Spengler <italic>et al.</italic> 2014 and Spengler <italic>et al.</italic> 2018), here we provide supports from the genetics perspective. We have modified the manuscript to reflect the archaeological context.</p><p>Spengler <italic>et al.</italic> 2014.

The lack of engagement with archaeological data and the misunderstanding of the chronology of mung use in the past makes it very difficult to tally the results with the interpretations and discussions. This MAJOR point has been unpacked in more detail above and must be addressed in order to reduce the oversimplification of the background and remove the concerning premise that no one has done much work on ancient mung use (as stated up to l.77). While it has not had as much work as the cereals, there is still work being done on it, looking at its domestication regions, secondary domestication changes and spread across South Asia and then into different parts of Asia.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. In our revision, we have devoted a paragraph in Introduction for the archaeological results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Data seems to have been massaged to make it fit with the climate modelling in various regions (for example Figure 2B has mung arriving in Central Asia around 0.2k yet discussions of 6.2k climate events in l.184), and to also make mung seem to be spreading before the domestication event itself. More engagement with the archaeological discussions on mung domestication is needed and discussions of what domestication is as a process (there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the conscious/unconscious action outline in Larson et al. in l.47 â the way it is phrased implies deliberate choice to ensure change rather than recognizing the inherent unconscious and indirect action of human behavior and the entanglement of humanâplantâenvironment interactions).</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to emphasize that we did not massage the data in any way. For the 6.2k climate issue, please refer to our response to Reviewer 3, point 2. We have modified the introduction to reflect the reviewerâs point about Larson <italic>et al.</italic> (2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Terms like cultivar and variety and landrace are used interchangeably. These must be defined in the paper. How they fit in with notions of domestication and postâdomestication agricultural behavior must also be unpacked.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise that we have not made it clearer about the definition of cultivar, variety and landrace. In our work, we defined landraces if accessions are collected from the countries traditionally cultivating them and locally adapted as well as lack of formal genetic improvement, ie. those conserved in the Vavilov Institute, many of which were collected in the early 20th century. In order to avoid confusion, we revised all sentences to clarify these terms in relevant places across the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. &quot;how the domesticated forms later expanded to a broader geographical area has also been detailed in several species, including maize (Matsuoka et al., 2002), rice (Huang et al., 2012), tomato (Razifard et al., 2020), chickpea (Varshney et al., 2021), and lettuce (Wei et al., 2021).&quot; â these are unusual choices of case study to make a point as many (maize and rice as key examples) are not accepted as well defined and remain highly controversial. These are genetics papers, and demonstrate the lack of familiarity with the archaeological context of domestication. A quick glance at the literature around them will illustrate that they are poor choices of case studies to make this point as they too are highly controversial.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this citation and completely re-written this paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. &quot;It is also unclear whether the expansion of most crops strictly follows the longitudinal axis of the continents (Diamond, 2005) or whether or why some are able to cross different climatic zones.&quot; â again poor knowledge of the archaeological context of these debates, and the reliance on Diamond is concerning as he is not an archaeologist.

This comes back to the conflation of space and time outlined in the public review. There are big circles on the maps covering the dots which I presume are either archaeological sites or accession points of the sampled beans(?! unclear), and then very odd choices of illustrating change over time. The figures are small and hard to see and require very long text in the figures to make them useable.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We responded the space and time issue in Reviewer 3, point 1 and Reviewer 3, point 2. In this revision we removed the circles and arrows and moved the figures to supplement. We still keep some supplement figures with circles and arrows, but these figures (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2) should be merely treated as simple illustrations of potential hybridization scenarios instead of detailed routes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Some aspects of basic geography have been overlooked to make climate the most important variable; l.166â7 &quot;Given that geographic barrier might not be the most important factor&quot;. I find it hard to believe that both the Himalayas and major flood basins like the Brahmaputra would not be an issue, as would issues of day length when moving things northâsouth.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. Since pods of mungbean cultivars do not shatter naturally, they have lost the natural ability to disperse seeds. We therefore focus on human activities when we discuss the ability to disperse. We are fully aware that it is difficult for human to cut through the Himalayas directly and we did not claim the Himalayas are not a barrier. Previously we put our argument mainly in Discussion, and here we elaborated part of the points in Results. Specifically, we emphasized that South and Central Asia was connected by a complex exchange network among north of Hindu Kush, Iran, and the Indus Valley. Between South and Southeast Asia, we did not assign a specific route, either. It is equally likely that mungbean spread through land or maritime routes. As emphasized in Reviewer 3, point 1, we focus on the relationship among the genetic groups instead of designating the exact routes. We have modified the manuscript reflect this.</p><p>In this study, âgeographyâ mostly refers to landscapes hindering human activity and the movement (such as the Himalayas and the Brahmaputra). We regard daylength (as well as temperature, growing season length, and water availability) as a environmental factor that might limit the successful cultivation of mungbean in a new environment even though human had successfully transported mungbean there as seeds. We have rephrased this part to reflect the reviewerâs comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. In dealing with issues of climate change and adaptation some discussion of tolerance is needed. there must be a discussion (and a table perhaps) of the different watering, salination, temperature, etc. tolerance of the mung bean(s) under consideration to make the claims justified.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comment. We have now revised the discussion comprehensively, mentioning that the precipitation in Central Asia is greatly below the lower limit of standard optimal conditions to grow mungbean in the south. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically compare the phenotypic characteristics of different genetic groups in mungbean.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Within the methods, the sampling strategy was hard to follow. This needs a more careful and clear description of decisions made: exactly where did the accessions come from geographically? how did their spread affect the dataset? Is there geographic clustering, did you compensate for that? how does the sampling potentially bias your data? a map would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have clarified in Materials and methods that while all samples have the information of their countries of origin, only a subset of samples have the detailed longitude and latitude coordinates. These samples were used in the detailed analyses connecting genetic and location information (the isolation by distance analyses). The genetic groups (SA, SEA, EA, CA) were named from the geographic region where most of their members originated from, by considering both country and geographic coordinate information. Only samples from Asia were used. In this revision, we also put the accession location maps in supplement figures. About how the distribution of sample might affect our conclusion, we added the following note in Discussion:</p><p>âWe recognize that not all samples have available spatial data, and we do not have samples from some parts of Asia. For example, while most samples of the SEA group were collected from Taiwan, Thailand, and Philippines, we do not have many samples from the supposed contact zone between SA and SEA (Bangladesh and Myanmar) or between SEA and EA (southern China). If more samples were available from these contact zones, the modeled niche space between SA and SEA and between SEA and EA would be even more similar than the current estimate, strengthening our hypothesis that niche similarity might facilitate the cultivation expansion. On the other hand, clear niche differentiation between SA and CA was evident despite the dense sampling near their contact zone.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. FAIR and open protocols dictate that all methods must be stated: &quot;Genomic DNA was extracted from a single plant per accession using QIAGEN Plant Mini DNA kit according to the manufacturer's instruction with minor modification.&quot; If you modified the protocol then you HAVE to outline what you did so it can be reproducible and the data comparable.</p></disp-quote><p>The modifications made during DNA extraction were added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. &quot;Climate data for conditions between 1960â1990 were downloaded from the WORLDCLIM 1.4 database&quot; â how was this dataset determined? why 30 years and not more? give citations to explain this decision, and look to other modelling efforts to check comparability.</p></disp-quote><p>Using the WorldClim database has now become a common practice in the field of environmental niche modeling. The WorldClim database used meteorological station data collected during 1960-1990 to extrapolate worldwide climatic conditions in about 1km<sup>2</sup> (30s) resolution. Therefore, we directly used the available climate layers which were created based on climate conditions recorded between 1960 and 1990 to predict the geographic distribution of suitable habitats for cultivated mungbean.

Throughout the dataset has relied on &quot;In total, our dataset contains more than one thousand accessions (1092) and covers worldwide diversity of mungbean representing a wide range of variation in seed colour&quot; however at no point is there a discussion of whether these are modern variants of historic landraces and how this was assessed. This has a big impact on any discussion of &quot;ancient&quot; adaptations, and there must be a discussion of how you tested to see if the genetic changes you see are more recent or past changes and how the genetic clock was applied.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. Our materials were directly obtained from worldwide stock centers, which house germplasms mostly collected during the 20th century. The missions of these stock centers are the collection and conservation of local landraces instead of developing or breeding novel varieties, and therefore our materials have limited numbers of âbreeder linesâ from recent artificial crosses. Since we focused on the comparison among the four genetic groups, recent admixture within the same group would have limited impact on the among-group pattern, and cross-group admixed accessions were excluded from most analyses. Similarly, despite generations of admixture, human geneticists could use contemporary human DNA and phenotypes to infer the divergence time and adaptation among major worldwide populations, as long as recently admixed individuals were excluded. In addition, as we noted in Introduction, the majority of accessions with detailed collection site information (from the Vavilov Institute) were collected during the early 20th century, before large-scale seed exchanges among worldwide stock centers. As noted by Jones <italic>et al.</italic> (2008), &quot;The efforts of collectors such as N. I. Vavilov have prevented the extinction of some of these local ecotypes.&quot;, our use of the Vavilov institute collection is therefore important.</p><p>We, however, acknowledge that genetic results from these materials collected during the 20th century may not reflect specific changes in specific time points in the past. This may be solved by ancient DNA analyses and is out of the scope of this current work. About divergence time, the fastsimcoal2 analysis was specifically used to address this issue while allowing potential gene flow among groups. Finally, we acknowledge that it may be difficult to estimate when the adaptive phenotypes originated. This may require specific modelling on whole-genome sequencing data and the identification of candidate genes, which would be out of the scope of the current study. Therefore, we used the descriptions in ancient Chinese texts about plant phenotypes as a supporting evidence to show some of these phenotypic characteristics appeared long time ago.</p><p>Jones <italic>et al.</italic> 2008.
