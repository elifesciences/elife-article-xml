While both sexes exhibit aggression, its neuronal underpinnings are understudied in females. Here, we identify a population of sexually dimorphic aIPg neurons in the adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> central brain whose optogenetic activation increased, and genetic inactivation reduced, female aggression. Analysis of GAL4 lines identified in an unbiased screen for increased female chasing behavior revealed the involvement of another sexually dimorphic neuron, pC1d, and implicated aIPg and pC1d neurons as core nodes regulating female aggression. Connectomic analysis demonstrated that aIPg neurons and pC1d are interconnected and suggest that aIPg neurons may exert part of their effect by gating the flow of visual information to descending neurons. Our work reveals important regulatory components of the neuronal circuitry that underlies female aggressive social interactions and provides tools for their manipulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>social behavior</kwd><kwd>aggression</kwd><kwd>connectomics</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schretter</surname><given-names>Catherine E</given-names></name><name><surname>Aso</surname><given-names>Yoshi</given-names></name><name><surname>Robie</surname><given-names>Alice A</given-names></name><name><surname>Dreher</surname><given-names>Marisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Dolan</surname><given-names>Michael-John</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Nan</given-names></name><name><surname>Ito</surname><given-names>Masayoshi</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Tansy</given-names></name><name><surname>Parekh</surname><given-names>Ruchi</given-names></name><name><surname>Branson</surname><given-names>Kristin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A discrete group of interconnected neurons are shown to drive aggressive social interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> females and genetic tools to manipulate these neuronal cell types are provided.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aggressive behaviors are important for gaining access to resources, including food and territory, and are exhibited by both sexes in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kravitz and Huber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zwarts et al., 2012</xref>). As aggressive actions carry the risk of injury, strict regulation of aggression is needed to facilitate survival. Sensory information about the presence of other individuals and the nature of the surrounding environment strongly modulate aggressive social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen and Hong, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoopfer, 2016</xref>). However, understanding the neuronal mechanisms by which such stimuli influence aggression has been hindered by a lack of knowledge about the structure of the underlying neuronal circuits, particularly in females.</p><p>Centers mediating, or conveying the information necessary for, aggression have been identified in the medial hypothalamus through classic experiments using electrical stimulation in cats and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bandler et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Berntson, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chi and Flynn, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gregg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kruk et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lammers et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siegel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takahashi and Miczek, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Woodworth, 1971</xref>). Such key regions are thought to perform a different role than other brain areas that facilitate aggressive interactions by altering the overall level of social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siegel et al., 1999</xref>). Recent work using opto- and chemo-genetic techniques have narrowed down these key regions to small populations of cells in mice, including those expressing estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1) and progesterone receptor (PR) in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hashikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). While Esr1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the VMHvl regulate aggression in both male and female mice, there are sex differences in the populations involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hashikawa et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, the VMHvl has been implicated in other female sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hashikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pfaff and Sakuma, 1979a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pfaff and Sakuma, 1979b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), further complicating the identification of the specific cell types that mediate aggressive interactions.</p><p>Since the first observation of aggressive behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by Sturtevant in 1915, social behaviors associated with attack and threat displays in flies have been well described ethologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shelly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sturtevant, 1915</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ueda and Kidokoro, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zwarts et al., 2012</xref>). While male aggression is heightened in the presence of mate-related cues, female flies display increased aggressive behaviors when nutrients are limited and near egg laying sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bath et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bath et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shelly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ueda and Kidokoro, 2002</xref>). Additionally, social isolation can increase aggression in both male and female flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoffmann, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ueda and Kidokoro, 2002</xref>). As in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hashikawa et al., 2017</xref>), aggressive behaviors in flies include sex-specific components, such as head butting in females, as well as those that are shared between the sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>). Due to the complexity of the behavior and the sensory stimuli that influence its presentation, a circuit diagram would greatly facilitate understanding the underlying neuronal mechanisms. To gain a mechanistic understanding of how these behaviors are regulated and executed, we will need to identify the specific cells that contribute in each sex and place them in the context of larger neuronal circuits.</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> provides a good model for dissecting the neuronal circuitry of aggression due to the genetic tools available for targeting and manipulating individual cell types, the availability of extensive connectomic information, and the relative simplicity of its nervous system and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bellen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dionne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kravitz and Huber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simpson and Looger, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tirian and Dickson, 2017</xref>). In male flies, studies investigating the neuronal correlates of aggression have implicated a group of 18–34 cells in the central brain, the P1/pC1 cluster, as well as various neuropeptides and biogenic amines, including neuropeptide F, tachykinin, and octopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alekseyenko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseyenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asahina, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asahina, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dierick and Greenspan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ishii et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wohl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). However, research on female aggressive social interactions has been less extensive as females exhibit less aggression under the same behavioral conditions used for males. There are also sex differences in the behavioral components and underlying neurons important for aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>). Genes involved in sexual differentiation, including <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>) and <italic>fruitless</italic> (<italic>fru</italic>), contribute to social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dickson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pavlou and Goodwin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Siwicki and Kravitz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yamamoto, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vrontou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Recent work has revealed the involvement of the <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing pC1 cluster, a group of 5 cell types, in promoting aggressive phenotypes in female flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fathy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Palavicino-Maggio et al., 2019</xref>). As in the VMHvl of mice, cells within this cluster can be divided into multiple subtypes and particular subtypes are also involved in other female behaviors, including mating and egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>). Understanding the flow of information within the neuronal circuit controlling aggression will require knowledge of which cells within the pC1 cluster contribute to aggressive behaviors.</p><p>We used connectomic, genetic and behavioral analyses to characterize neuronal cell types contributing to female aggressive behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We found that optogenetic activation of a subset of the neurons derived from the aIP-g neuroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cachero et al., 2010</xref>) increased female aggression, even in the absence of aggression-promoting environmental conditions. Importantly, blocking synaptic transmission from these neurons resulted in diminished female aggression, indicating that these cells normally play a role in modulating social interactions. We next identified a specific, single cell type within the pC1 cluster (pC1d) that induces aggression upon activation. Analysis of the connectome of a large part of the fly central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>) revealed that aIPg and pC1d neurons are strongly interconnected as well as uncovered multiple other neurons linked to these two cell types. Our anatomical data did not allow us to determine which of these neurons play a role in aggressive behaviors, but they did provide clues. For example, we uncovered a simple circuit motif by which aIPg activation could increase the saliency of visual information from LC10 neurons, a cell type used by males to track potential mates during courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sten et al., 2020</xref>). We also identified several short neuronal paths connecting outputs of aIPg neurons to descending interneurons that drive motor behavior. Taken together, our work yields insights into female aggressive behavior and identifies two cell types that appear to form key nodes of the circuit underlying aggression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of neurons involved in female aggressive behaviors</title><p>In a behavioral screen using split-GAL4 lines to examine another phenotype, we noted a dramatic increase in female social interactions, including known components of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bath et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Palavicino-Maggio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ueda and Kidokoro, 2002</xref>), upon stimulation of a neuronal subset of approximately eleven cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

The split-GAL4 lines labelled a set of neurons with cell bodies located in the inferior protocerebrum and major projections in the anterior optic tubercle (AOTU), anterior ventrolateral protocerebrum (AVLP), superior medial protocerebrum (SMP), and superior intermediate protocerebrum (SIP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). The cells observed in our split-GAL4 lines morphologically resemble, and appear to be a subset of, the 32 neurons in the aIP-g neuroblast clone described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cachero et al., 2010</xref>. These neurons were previously classified as <italic>fru</italic><sup>+</sup> auditory interneurons with sexually dimorphic projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cachero et al., 2010</xref>).

We tested for changes in male behavior by optogenetically stimulating males from the aIPgSS1 line and found no differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

We began by quantifying two such behaviors, chasing and touching, using a set of previously created and validated automatic behavior classifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robie et al., 2017</xref>). We found that flies increased touching compared to the empty split-GAL4 control during a 30 s stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A,B</xref>). A low level of chasing was also detected upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6C,D</xref>), consistent with the behavioral pattern described for female aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>). As a control, we also examined walking behavior. We did find a sharp decrease in the percent of flies walking following stimulus onset, coincident with the increase in touching, but the average walking velocity after stimulation did not differ from that of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A,E,F</xref>). Examination of behavior metrics for individual flies revealed a significant increase in the number of flies within two body lengths during stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6G</xref>), consistent with aIPg activation increasing the likelihood of engaging in social behaviors.</p><p>Touching and chasing are also components of social interactions, including aggression, in male flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McKellar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>). There are, however, many sex-specific aspects of aggression, including head butting in females and the way in which behavioral patterns progress during an encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>). To examine female-specific attributes, we generated and validated a new JAABA classifier for female aggression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Female aggression encompasses a range of behaviors involved in attack and threat displays; however, in this paper we used the term ‘aggression’ in a limited way to refer to shoving, fencing, and head butting behaviors. As these behaviors were not always distinguishable at the image resolution used for quantification, an aggressive event was defined as either an instance of head butting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and/or fencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similarly, high posture fencing behavior was not distinguished from shoving as we were not able to clearly discern leg posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zwarts et al., 2012</xref>). Examples of fencing and head butting are shown at high spatial and temporal resolution in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>. Employing this classifier, we found that a 30 s stimulation of the split-GAL4 line aIPgSS1 increased the percentage of flies engaged in aggressive behaviors as well as the amount of time individuals spent in such interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6H</xref>, compare <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). While only about 15% of the flies are engaged in aggressive behaviors at a given time, over 60% of the flies performed aggressive behaviors at some point during the 30 s stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Three different split-GAL4 lines labelling this neuronal population (aIPgSS1, aIPgSS2 and aIPgSS3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) exhibited similar increases in aggressive behaviors upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Higher levels of stimulation also increase the possibility that cells expressing the effector at levels too low for detection may contribute to the observed behavior. For these reasons, we examined the expression patterns of our split-GAL4 lines with the highest level of the effector used in our behavioral experiments. We did not detect expression in other cell types or obvious toxicity in the aIPg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The application of a 5 Hz 0.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> stimulus with a 10 ms fixed duration induced significant behavioral changes over the 30 s stimulus period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9A–C</xref>). Stimulation at 10 Hz resulted in more extensive aggressive behavior, but further increases to 20, 30, or 50 Hz did not have a large effect. However, higher frequency stimulation did increase the amount of aggression observed during the post-stimulus period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9D</xref>).

Under these conditions, we observed sufficient levels of aggression to examine the effects of inactivation of aIPg neurons with the synaptic inhibitor tetanus toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sweeney et al., 1995</xref>). A significant reduction in the time spent performing aggressive behaviors, as measured using both manual and automated behavioral analyses, was observed with three different split-GAL4 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11A,B</xref>).

Our previous neuronal activation experiments demonstrated aggression even in the absence of competition for food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). We next investigated the effects of activation status and the sex of the opponent in experiments using pairs of flies without prior food restriction or food present in the arena. Activation of aIPg neurons increased the total time spent displaying aggression and decreased the time from stimulus onset to the first aggressive event (attack latency), irrespective of whether aIPg neurons were stimulated in both of the females in the arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). These results were also reproduced using a second aIPg split-GAL4 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

First, we used behavioral screens to identify other cell types that could drive female aggression when activated. Second, we used the aIPg neurons as an entry point for EM-based circuit mapping. As described below, both approaches converged on the same set of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>aIPg and pC1d are two key groups of neurons involved in female aggressive behaviors</title><p>Other neurons in the same circuit as the aIPg neurons, or in parallel pathways, might also be able to induce aggression when activated. To identify such neurons, we took a strategy analogous to that used by geneticists to ask how many different genes can produce a particular phenotype when mutated. In that strategy, individual mutations are placed into complementation groups after performing a genetic screen large enough to sample all genes. In this way, the number of different genes that can give rise to the phenotype under study when mutated can be estimated (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980</xref>). To carry out an analogous approach, we started with lines identified as having increased female-female chasing behavior in a previous screen of over 2000 GAL4 lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robie et al., 2017</xref>). Each of the GAL4 lines used in that screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>) had broad expression, precluding the identification of the specific cell types responsible for the observed behavior. To identify these cell types, we generated split-GAL4 hemidriver lines using the enhancers from this screen’s top hits and then crossed them to each other to reveal the presence of shared cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, 13 of the top 14 hits identified by their behavioral score could be accounted for by just two cell types: aIPg neurons and pC1d, one of the five cell types in the female pC1 cell cluster. While such screens could miss cell types with less penetrant activation phenotypes and those that inhibit aggression, these results imply central roles for aIPg and pC1d in female aggression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>An unbiased screen suggests that aIPg1-3 and pC1d are key nodes for gating female-female aggression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The fourteen top hits for female-female chasing from an unbiased activation screen of 2204 generation 1 GAL4 lines are listed along with their Z-scores, the signed number of standard deviations from the mean behavior of the control, as determined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robie et al., 2017</xref>.

Additional controls in which all <italic>trans</italic>-retinal was omitted from the food did not show an elevation in aggression following light onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>). Increasing the intensity of stimulation under conditions of constant illumination did not significantly heighten behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9B</xref>) suggesting that the lowest intensity (0.04 mW) of stimulating light used was already saturating. Moreover, changes in the expression level of CsChrimson were inversely correlated with behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9A</xref>), as was increasing stimulus intensity from 0.1 to 0.4 mW in flies expressing 20xUAS-CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9C</xref>), suggesting that higher effector expression, or activation levels, might be detrimental to cell function. However, increasing the number of individual light pulses, while shortening their length so as to maintain a constant total stimulus duration, resulted in more aggression during the stimulus period. We also found a slight increase in aggression following stimulation at 50 Hz, the highest pulse frequency tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10</xref>).</p><media id="video6" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-58942-video6.mp4"><label>Video 6.</label><caption><title>Behavior of pC1dSS1 &gt; Chrimson flies.</title></caption></media><media id="video7" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-58942-video7.mp4"><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>High-speed video of two pC1dSS1 &gt; Chrimson female flies.</title></caption></media><p>As we observed with aIPg, pC1d stimulation also resulted in a decrease in the attack latency and increase in the time spent performing aggressive behaviors irrespective of whether the opponent was an activated female, wild-type female or male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s11">Figure 4—figure supplement 11</xref>).

Likewise, activation of pC1a - c did not change the percentage of flies displaying aggression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s15">Figure 4—figure supplement 15</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that pC1d, but not pC1e or pC1a - c, acts as a significant facilitator of female aggression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>aIPg and pC1d neurons are interconnected, but have largely distinct upstream and downstream partners</title><p>The generation of the full adult female brain (FAFB) electron microscopic (EM) image set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>) and the connectome of the hemibrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>) allowed us to use EM-level connectomics to determine the structure of the circuit(s) that contained the cells identified through our behavioral studies. First, we identified the cells in EM volumes that correspond to those observed in our aIPg split-GAL4 lines. We began this work in FAFB, before the availability of the hemibrain dataset. The fiber bundle in each hemisphere that contained the neurons corresponding to the aIP-g lineage was first identified based on their cell body and soma tract position in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cachero et al., 2010</xref>). We then traced the major arbors of all these cells sufficiently to determine if they matched the morphologies of the neurons observed in our split-GAL4 lines. Twelve of the putative aIP-g neurons found in the right hemisphere resembled those in our split-GAL4 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). During the process of generating the hemibrain connectome, we were also able to identify a set of eleven aIPg cells corresponding to those found in FAFB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) as well as neurons in the pC1 cluster. The emergence of hemibrain dataset allowed us to both analyze their morphology in greater detail and participate in the effort to improve the accuracy of their reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). Based on morphological differences in their projections, later confirmed by connectivity, we further separated the aIPg neurons into three distinct—but interconnected—types, aIPg type 1, aIPg type 2, and aIPg type 3 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>) that have pre- and postsynaptic sites intermingled throughout their arbors (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). Despite extensive efforts, we were unable to generate genetic tools to separately manipulate each of these aIPg types. Thus, all of our behavioral results reflect activation or inactivation of the combined populations of these three related cell types. A fourth set of neurons is named aIPg type 4 in the hemibrain v1.1 database, but these neurons were not considered here due to their distinct morphology and connectivity. Likewise, the three SMP555/556 neurons, while bearing a morphological resemblance to aIPg neurons, are clearly distinct in their projections and connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Similarly, only 11 of pC1d’s 37 postsynaptic targets are also postsynaptic to any of the aIPg cell types.

Changes in internal state can alter the way in which sensory information is processed and motor outputs are executed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen and Hong, 2018</xref>). The large number of downstream targets of the aIPg neurons—84 different cell types receive 20 or more synapses from at least one of the three aIPg cell types—suggests that the aIPgs might influence many different circuits within the brain to promote aggression as well as likely influence behaviors not related to aggression. Examining the roles of aIPg’s downstream targets provides an approach to understand how aIPg neurons exert their effects. However, most of these downstream targets have not been functionally characterized and genetic tools to manipulate them do not yet exist. Therefore, their identification does not immediately provide insight. Nevertheless, we did find that a substantial subset of aIPg’s output is directed to the anterior optic tubercle (AOTU), where it is poised to gate the flow of visual information, revealing one way in which aIPg activation is likely to affect behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Absence of visual information alters aggressive behaviors following aIPg activation</title><p>As a simple approach to assess the role of visual information, we compared the results of aIPg activation in flies in a lighted versus a dark arena. Aggression was reduced in the absence of visible light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). Moreover, the structure of the behavior also differed when visual information was not available and there were fewer long duration bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video15">Video 15</xref>). A lack of visual information may alter the way in which individuals interact with one another during an aggressive bout.

We found that the six AOTU types that are innervated by aIPg neurons and connected to DNs, as described above, were also innervated by LC10 neurons, with a threshold of 500 synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). These five cell types account for nearly 10% of LC10’s output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1</xref>). LC10 neurons can promote directional movement and reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) and play a key role in small object detection and directed movement during courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sten et al., 2020</xref>). The synapses from LC10 and aIPg neurons were spatially segregated, with LC10 synapses largely confined to the AOTU and two thirds of those from the aIPg neurons occurring on a separate arbor in the SIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). Both aIPg and LC10 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 2020</xref>) are cholinergic and may therefore cooperate in exciting their shared AOTU targets. It is striking that eight of the ten AOTU cell types that serve as major pathways connecting LC10 input to DNs also receive input from aIPg neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In this paper, we described female aggressive behaviors, uncovered key components of the underlying neuronal circuits, developed genetic reagents to manipulate these neurons, and mapped their connections using EM-level connectomics. Specifically, we discovered the involvement of a subset of the aIP-g lineage, a collection of cell types not previously implicated in social behaviors, in mediating female aggressive social interactions. Optogenetic activation dramatically increased aggression in lines labelling aIPg neurons, while inactivation diminished these actions. Analysis using EM-level connectomics revealed strong connectivity between these aIPg neurons and two members of the pC1 cluster, a group of related cell types previously linked to social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Palavicino-Maggio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, pC1d is the top pre-synaptic input to aIPg neurons, devoting ~13% of its output synapses to them. Behavioral tests using split-GAL4 lines that cleanly label pC1d demonstrated its ability to increase female aggression. In contrast, we found no evidence for the involvement of the other four pC1 cell types, pC1a - c and pC1e, in promoting aggression. Consistent with these behavioral results, we found that three of these pC1 neurons, pC1a - c, were not connected to the aIPg neurons. As pC1e has significant connectivity with aIPg neurons, it may well play a role not revealed by our assays. Finally, we characterized the upstream inputs and downstream targets of aIPg and pC1d neurons. In the process, we identified multiple paths from aIPg neurons to DNs as well as a circuit motif by which aIPg neurons might increase the salience of visual information pertinent for aggressive behaviors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>aIPg neurons mediate female aggressive behaviors</title><p>Innate behaviors, including aggression, have been proposed to result from the interplay of external stimuli and the internal state of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lorenz, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tinbergen, 1951</xref>). Neuronal populations that have the ability, when experimentally activated, to bypass normally required sensory cues to induce aggressive behavior have been previously identified. For example, male-specific neurons expressing <italic>Drosophila</italic> tachykinin (DTK) act as a hub mediating aggressive behaviors when activated and have been proposed to encode higher levels of motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asahina, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hashikawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hashikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoopfer, 2016</xref>).

Our efforts to derive lines specific for each of these cell types have been unsuccessful, which has limited our ability to explore their individual roles. Nor have we yet performed physiological experiments that might reveal distinct features of their responses when the circuit is activated. As there are many differences in the inputs and outputs between the aIPg types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), these three cell types are likely to make distinct contributions to the phenotypes we observed.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Proposed circuit underlying female aggressive behaviors.</title><p>A diagram of key neuronal pathways centered on pC1d and aIPg type1, type 2 and type 3 neurons is shown. The numbers in arrows represent synapse number. We propose that pC1d facilitates female aggressive behaviors by acting through aIPg type 1 (orange), type 2 (green), and type 3 (purple) neurons. The top four inputs to pC1d and three other neurons of interest are shown. These include neurons implicated in other female behaviors (highlighted with a blue circumference), including oviposition (oviIN, pC1a) and mating (vpoDN), suggesting communication between the circuits underlying these behaviors and aggression. We propose that aIPg neurons integrate diverse upstream signals and then alter brain state in a way that increases the likelihood of engaging in aggressive social interactions. Upstream neuronal populations are color-coded by the proportion of their synapses they make onto the aIPg type 1, aIPg type 2, and aIPg type 3 subtypes. The post-synaptic targets of aIPg type 1, aIPg type 2, and aIPg type 3 neurons are shown color-coded by the relative proportion of their synaptic input they receive from each aIPg type. AOTU neurons that also get input from LC10 neurons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) are highlighted with a dark green circumference. Inputs to the aIPg neurons were thresholded in proportion to the number of cells in each aIPg type resulting in thresholds of 24, 30, and 12 synapses to type 1, type 2, and type 3, respectively. Downstream outputs receiving more than 50 synapses from aIPg neurons (outputs from all 11 aIPg neurons pooled) are shown, with neurons receiving fewer synapses included when a majority came from aIPg type 3. For cell types that get input from multiple types of aIPg neurons, the relative proportions of inputs from different types are indicated by the color-coding of the circle.

For example, pC1d activation was able to drive aggressive behaviors but was not essential for them; rather it appears to be a focal point for information about other social behaviors. Stimulation of pC1e neurons alone did not result in aggressive phenotypes under the conditions tested, or increase the aggression observed when activated with pC1d, despite being a significant synaptic input to aIPg neurons. Additional experiments with other behavioral assays will be required to explore pC1e’s functions.</p><p>A complementary study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref> found that combined activation of pC1d and pC1e using ReaChR resulted in a persistent phenotype lasting for minutes. Using lines labeling aIPg cells, we did observe head butting and fencing behaviors after the cessation of the optogenetic stimulus that lasted for a shorter, but ethologically relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bath et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>), time period on the order of tens of seconds. In our experiments, we did not observe similar persistence with pC1d under the majority of conditions tested. There are several experimental differences between the two studies that might explain our findings regarding the extent of persistence, including: the effector, stimulus duration, magnitude and wavelength of light, temporal pattern of stimulus, housing and testing conditions, as well as the media used. Consistent with this speculation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref> show that shorter stimulation protocols led to less persistent behavior. Additionally, both our and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>’s connectomic analyses documented reciprocal connectivity between pC1d and aIPg neurons. Feedback between aIPg type 1 neurons and pC1d may play a role in the extension of aggressive behavior during the off period following aIPg activation, a possibility investigated further in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>.</p><p>Analysis of inputs to pC1d revealed links with neurons involved in female-specific and other social behaviors, including oviposition and courtship.

Supporting this close relationship between the behaviors, pC1d receives innervation from pC1a, a cell type involved in the egg laying pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2020a</xref> also noted differences in the depolarization of pC1d and pC1e following activation of the sex-peptide abdominal ganglion neuron. While these are not as extensive as seen in pC1a, they may provide a neural basis for the reported effect of mating status on female aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bath et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bath et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ueda and Kidokoro, 2002</xref>). Further supporting the close tie between these two social behaviors, we found that nearly a quarter of the synaptic output in the central brain of vpoDN, a descending neuron involved in female receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>) goes to pC1d. Additionally, an inhibitory neuron implicated in modulating oviposition and mating behavior, oviIN, innervates both pC1d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>) and aIPg neurons.

However, how these states are encoded within the brain and subsequently influence behavior is not well understood. Does aIPg act by changing brain state? The activation of aIPg neurons does not produce an immediate, synchronous response in all the individual flies in an arena. This contrasts with the activation of the lobula columnar cell type LC16 under the same experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), which results in all the flies immediately walking backward, a type of response associated with command neurons. Our results support the view that, rather than acting as a command neuron, aIPg neurons act by modifying the way in which a fly responds to external stimuli such that its activation increases the likelihood that an individual will engage in aggressive behaviors.</p><p>Social interactions are influenced by environmental stimuli in addition to the internal state of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen and Hong, 2018</xref>).

One way might be to alter the saliency of particular streams of sensory information. Our anatomical analyses uncovered a circuit motif that appears to be designed to do just that for visual information conveyed by LC10 neurons, a population of visual projection neurons well-tuned for tracking other flies during social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sten et al., 2020</xref>).

These projection neurons get input from both aIPg neurons and LC10 neurons, a population of visual projection neurons that are tuned to be activated by a nearby moving fly. The combined activation of these excitatory cholinergic inputs might act synergistically to drive AOTU firing and signaling to DNs. At this point we do not know if the anatomical separation of the aIPg and LC10 inputs to the AOTU neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>) is simply a wiring convenience or has functional significance.

All tests were conducted under visible light conditions at ZT0 to ZT4 unless otherwise stated. Flies were loaded into the arena using an aspirator. For activation of neurons expressing CsChrimson, the arena was illuminated as specified in the figure legends; unless otherwise stated we used constant uniform illumination with 617 nm LEDs (Red-Orange LUXEON Rebel LED - 122 lm; Luxeon Star LEDs, Brantford, Canada). Unless otherwise stated, all trials were performed under white-light illumination. For each trial, flies were acclimatized to the area for 30 s prior to the delivery of a single constant stimulus lasting 30 s. Pulse stimulation at 0.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> was given in 30 s intervals with an inter-stimulus interval of 30 to 60 s. The pulse width was kept constant at 10 ms while the pulse number and period varied. Videos were recorded from above using a camera (ROHS 1.3 MP B and W Flea3 USB 3.0 Camera; Point Gray, Richmond, Canada) with an 800 nm long pass filter (B and W filter; Schneider Optics, Hauppauge, NY) at 30 frames per second and 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution.

The DNA concentration of each sample was determined using Qubit High-Sensitivity DNA kit (Thermo Fisher). To prepare the Illumina sequencing library, 600 pg cDNA from each pooled sample was used in a modified Nextera XT library preparation (Illumina) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soumillon et al., 2014</xref>) using the P5NEXTPT5 primer and extending the tagmentation time to 15 m. The resulting libraries were purified according to the Nextera XT protocol (0.6x ratio) and quantified by qPCR using Kapa Library Quantification (Kapa Biosystems). Six to eight sequencing libraries were loaded on a NextSeq High Output flow cell reading 26 bases in Read 1, including the spacer, sample barcode and UMI, eight bases in the i7 index read, and 50 bases in Read two representing the cDNA fragment from the 3' end of the transcript. Fastq files were pre-filtered to select reads (and their mates) that contained a cell barcode. Extracted reads were concatenated into a single pair of fastqs for downstream analysis. Sequencing adapters were trimmed and aligned as done for the bulk RNA-seq data. Gene counts were generated with the STARsolo algorithm; detailed parameters are given in the GEO submission file metadata.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Connectomics analysis</title><p>The primary data used for our analyses are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zheng et al., 2018</xref> for the FAFB dataset and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref> for the hemibrain dataset. Hemibrain data was queried using NeuPrint and v1.1 of the connectome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuprint.janelia.org/">neuprint.janelia.org</ext-link>). The unique identifier (bodyID number in the hemibrain v1.1 database) for neurons shown in figures, as well as additional data on other neurons connected to aIPg and pC1 neurons, are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. Visualizations of neuronal morphologies from the hemibrain dataset were generated in NeuTu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Cytoscape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cytoscape.org/">cytoscape.org</ext-link>) was used to produce the node layout of connectivity diagrams of connections between neurons, which were then edited in Adobe Illustrator. Thresholds were used in order to limit the number of neurons in the figures to those connections with the most synapses. In all cases, a threshold of three synapses was applied to connections between individual cells. Higher specific thresholds, when applied, are specified in each figure legend. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>, a few neurons of interest that fell below the general thresholds used were also included. BodyIDs for neurons in connectomics figures are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>. A complete list of synaptic connections can be found in NeuPrint.</p><p>Anatomical videos were produced using Blender (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.blender.org/">blender.org</ext-link>) and software written by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hubbard, 2020</xref>. Narration was recorded using Camtasia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.techsmith.com/">techsmith.com</ext-link>) and text, diagrams and narration were added to videos using Adobe Premiere Pro.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample size. Sample size was based on previous literature in the field and experimenters were not blinded in most conditions as almost all data acquisition and analysis were automated. However, inactivation experiments in which manual quantification was performed were blinded. Biological replicates completed at separate times using different parental crosses were performed for each of the behavioral experiments. Behavioral data are representative of at least two independent biological repeats, only one of which is typically shown. For figures in which the behavioral data over the course of a trial is shown, pink shading indicates the stimulus period, the mean is represented as a solid line, and shaded error bars represent variation between experiments.</p><p>For each experiment, the experimental and control flies were collected, treated and tested at the same time. A Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test or Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s post hoc test was used for statistical analysis. All statistical analysis was performed using Prism Software (GraphPad, version 7). p values are indicated as follows: ****p&lt;0.0001; ***p&lt;0.001; **p&lt;0.01; and *p&lt;0.05. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for exact <italic>p</italic>-values for each figure.</p><p>Boxplots show median and interquartile range (IQR). Lower and upper whiskers represent 1.5 × IQR of the lower and upper quartiles, respectively; boxes indicate lower quartile, median, and upper quartile, from bottom to top. When all points are shown, whiskers represent range and boxes indicate lower quartile, median, and upper quartile, from bottom to top. Shaded error bars on graphs are presented as mean ± s.e.m.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank D J Anderson and V Chiu (Caltech), V Ruta (Rockefeller), and the Janelia community, in particular: G Card, E Gruntman, U Heberlein, K Longden, A Nern, M Reiser, N Spruston, K Wang, F Wang, and T Wolff for their helpful suggestions during the course of this work and their comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

It identifies two types of sexually dimorphic neurons that regulate female aggressive interactions, demonstrates their function using optogenetics and, by tracing their connections using the fly EM connectome, shows recurrent connections between specific subsets of these two neuronal classes.</p><p>Optogenetic activation of aIPg neurons promotes aggression toward both male and female targets. Interestingly, brief aIPg neuron activation results in persistently increased aggression during light offset period, suggesting a role for aIPg activation in driving persistent female aggressive behavior. Moreover, inhibiting synaptic transmission in aIPg neurons attenuates innate aggression, indicating a physiological requirement that these neurons promote aggression in female flies. The authors further demonstrate that optogenetic activation of the previously characterized doublesex-expressing pC1 neurons also result in elevated levels of aggression. Using of split GAL4 drivers labelling specific subtypes of pC1 neurons, authors specify pC1d, as the one of five pC1 cell types that drive female aggressive behaviors. Using the EM connectome to trace connections of these cells, the authors discovered that pC1d and pC1e (but not other pC1 cell types) are presynaptic to aIPg neurons. While pC1d is the major pre-synaptic input to all three aIPg neuron subtypes (aIPg type 1 aIPg type 2, and aIPg type 3) identified in by EM, only one, aIPg type1, provides strong reciprocal feedback input to pC1d. These reciprocal connections may explain increased aggression extended beyond the activation period in flies expressing CsChrimson in aIPg neurons.</p><p>This comprehensive description of the synaptic inputs and outputs of aIPg and pC1d neurons using the EM-based circuit mapping, thoughtfully described and discussed, identifies new connected elements of female aggression. It further leads to the definition of pC1d neurons as a central hub receiving inputs from several neurons (oviN and pC1a) implicated in female behaviors such as oviposition (Wang et al., 2020), as well as feedback from aIPg neurons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are two main lines of concern. One line of concern that needs to be addressed, requires relatively straightforward experiments (Essential revisions 1-5 below) to better establish the primary observations made and conclusions reached in this study. The second, major line of concern regards the relatively descriptive nature of the circuit mapping, which leaves issues of functional connectivity between the neuronal classes as well as their biological significance lightly established and difficult to appreciate. It is likely that experiments to address these issues (Essential revisions 6-7) will require new reagents that are not currently available. In light of this, the reviewers agree that though useful, these will not be necessary if the authors choose to submit a revised manuscript as an appropriately abbreviated, refocussed and retitled <italic>eLife</italic> Short Report.</p><p>1) The conclusion of a &quot;persistent&quot; effect of aIPg neuron activation on female aggression needs to be supported by an additional experiment. In addition to a relatively modest level of aggression after the stimulus, the experiments in Figure 1 and the rest of the paper do not exclude a possibility that it is the aggressive interaction itself that provides a momentum to persists after the stimulus is turned off. An experiment similar to the one in Hoopfer et al., 2015 (where flies were allowed to interact after the stimulus was turned off) would be necessary to demonstrate that the &quot;persistence&quot; is due to the activity of neural circuit, rather than residual effects of intense aggressive interactions. The authors admission that the ethological relevance of persistence is unknown, and suggestion that the persistence may be &quot;an experimental artefact&quot; may be indicative of a some doubt on part of the authors.</p><p>Even if the additional behavioral experiments supports their conclusion on aIPg neurons, the additional conclusion that the &quot;recurrent connectivity&quot; between pC1d and aIPg is important for behavioral &quot;persistence&quot; will need to be either modified convincingly demonstrated (See points 6-7).</p><p>2) In Figure 3, the authors show that activation of aIPg neurons promote aggression toward both male and female targets. Does the same manipulation induce aggressive behaviors in a solitary female? If not, why is this manipulation insufficient to cause the phenotype?</p><p>3) In Figure 3, &quot;time performing aggressive behaviors&quot; looks smaller toward a wild-type male target than toward a female target. How do they explain this result? Is the decreased aggression caused by male- pheromones which suppress female aggression?</p><p>4) From the results shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, the authors conclude that the copulation latency is not affected by optogenetic stimulation of aIPg neurons, but the sample size looks small in these experiments. Could authors increase the sample size and see whether their conclusions hold? Particularly since activation of aIPg neurons causes aggression towards males, one might expect copulation to be impacted in these females?</p><p>5) It often is not clear how many times each experiment was performed. For example – data in Figure 2 – appear to be derived from data pooled from two experiments done during the same week. Were these animals from the same cross? How many times was this done independently? Similar, detailed information should be provided for each of the figures. A total number of flies is presented each time, but it is usually not clear how many independent samples there are.</p><p>6) The authors emphasize the significance of recurrent connectivity between pC1d and aIPg neurons as the basis for female aggressive behavior. The recurrent connectivity is observed specifically between pC1d and aIPg Type 1 neurons, but no data demonstrates that it is the Type 1 neurons that is responsible for female aggression. It is equally possible that Type 2 or 3 is the important subset. These 2 types do not make recurrent connection with pC1d – instead, these are almost unidirectional downstream of pC1d (Figure 8A) (note that Type 2 is the second most prominent downstream of pC1d, as shown in Figure 10C). The authors did not perform any physiological experiments to demonstrate whether these recurrent (or unidirectional) connectivities are functional. Without evidence on which aIPg subtype is important for female aggression, it would be fair to acknowledge that top-down connection from pC1d to aIPg could be the behaviorally relevant functional motif between the 2 neuronal populations.</p><p>7) The recurrent model is difficult to reconcile with the different behavioral phenotypes caused by the activation of pC1d and aIPg neurons, as (at least qualitatively) these two reciprocally connected neurons would have similar effect on the circuit. For example, why are aIPg neurons necessary for female aggression (Figure 2), but not pC1d (Figure 5—figure supplement 10), if these make reciprocal connection? If the connectivity is uni-directional, however, it is possible to speculate that aIPg neurons are necessary to integrate important information, one of which (not necessary for aggression on its own) is provided by pC1d. Ultimately, it would be necessary to perform &quot;epistasis&quot; experiments between the 2 populations (e.g. silencing one while activating the other) to resolve which of the 2 motifs is more relevant, although this would be more than what can be reasonably expected in a normal period allowed for revisions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58942.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] As this decision was being finalised, we were alerted to an overlapping manuscript by Mala Murthy and colleagues (Deutsch et al., 2020), which is being independently reviewed by eLife.

In particular, Deutsch et al., 2020, focuses heavily on the mechanism of persistence of female aggression as their paper is entitled: “The Neural Basis for a Persistent Internal State in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Females”. We therefore largely eliminated our speculation about the mechanism of persistence and referred to their experimental data as an alternative to doing more mechanistic experiments ourselves. To reflect the fact that, as noted in the review summary, we discovered a new cell type (aIPg) and determined which member of the pC1 cluster was critical (pC1d), we modified our title from “Neuronal circuitry underlying female aggression in <italic>Drosophila</italic>” to “Cell types and neuronal circuitry underlying female aggression in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.”</p><p>Before describing in detail how we answered each of the reviewer’s comments, we would also like to point out one area of enhancement we made in our paper, concerning changes to visual behaviors after aIPg activation. More specifically, by performing assays in a darkened arena, we had shown that aggression was reduced but did not explore this observation in detail in the original manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we report the results of additional computer vision analysis of this data to determine metrics such as bout duration when flies were deprived of visual input. We also moved their presentation from a figure supplement (Figure 1—figure supplement 8) to a main figure (revised manuscript Figure 9) and added a video (revised manuscript Video 15).</p><p>Two additional new findings published since our initial submission prompted us look more closely at connectomic information that might provide clues as to how aIPg activation could influence the processing of visual information. First, a paper from Rachel Wilson’s lab (Rayshubskiy et al., 2020) showed that a particular descending neuron cell type, DNa02, played an important role in steering of the fly’s movements. We had identified DNa02 as a downstream target of two of aIPg’s direct targets (original Figure 11) but did not appreciate its behavioral significance until their manuscript. Secondly, a paper from Vanessa Ruta’s laboratory on male behavior (Sten et al., 2020), showed that arousal in males gated visual input from LC10 visual neurons, a population of lobular columnar neurons. This is the same population of visual projection neurons that our lab (Wu et al., 2016) had previously shown to trigger reaching and approach. Additionally, the Dickson and Borst labs had shown this neuronal population was important for the male to track the female in courtship (Riberio et al., 2018). Strikingly, we found that LC10 and aIPg both provide input to eight different interneuron cell types that connect the anterior optical tubercule to seven different descending neuron cell types, including DNa02. We added figures diagramming these connections (Figure 10, Figure 10—figure supplements 1 and 2) as well as a model figure (Figure 12) to present these new observations. We are excited about these observations because they suggest specific circuit mechanism for how aIPg-induced changes in “brain state” might modify behavior. While these are new additions to our paper, we wish to emphasize that they did not involve new experimental work but are simply the result of more extensive analysis of the recently published (Scheffer et al., 2020) fly connectome. We believe their inclusion will greatly increase the impact and general interest of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are two main lines of concern.

If not, why is this manipulation insufficient to cause the phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and have added the requested data examining changes in the behavior of an isolated females when aIPg neurons are activated. We found no change in the velocity of solitary females before and after activation (revised manuscript Figure 2—figure supplement 2; subsection “Activation of aIPg overrides the requirement for specific environmental conditions for female aggressive behaviors”), but most of our verified classifiers assess social behaviors (chasing, touching, aggression) and were not applicable. As it is unclear what changes one might expect, we used careful human observation of these videos and could discern no obvious changes in behavior. We added a new video (revised manuscript Video 5) showing four examples each of EmptySS&gt;Chrimson control and aIPg&gt;Chrimson individual flies following activation to allow the interested reader to examine typical primary data.</p><p>The reviewers ask why such a manipulation might be insufficient to cause a phenotype in an isolated fly. Prompted by this question, we added text in the Discussion (subsection “Activation of aIPg neurons results in a change to the individual’s state”) explaining that we do not consider aIPg to be a command neuron, but rather that aIPg activation influences the propensity to engage in certain social behaviors. In that view, the lack of change in the behavior of an individual fly is not unexpected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3, &quot;time performing aggressive behaviors&quot; looks smaller toward a wild-type male target than toward a female target. How do they explain this result? Is the decreased aggression caused by male- pheromones which suppress female aggression?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed this experiment using two different split-GAL4 lines that label aIPg neurons (original Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1; revised manuscript Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). In one case, activated females exhibited slightly less aggression towards a wild-type male than a wild-type female target fly, while the other aIPg line showed slightly more aggression towards a wild-type male target fly. Neither change was significant (<italic>p</italic>=0.65 and <italic>p</italic>=0.16, respectively), which is now noted in the figure legends. We conclude that there is no consistent difference.</p><p>Due to the variability in the data noted by the reviewers, we have also added the <italic>p</italic>-values for a representative biological repeat of this data to the figure legend for Figure 2. We also note that we make no claim in the paper about differences between the level of aggression to targets of different sexes. We only claim that there is also aggression toward male targets, which both our lines show at highly significant levels (<italic>p</italic>=0.01 or <italic>p</italic>=0.001, respectively).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) From the results shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, the authors conclude that the copulation latency is not affected by optogenetic stimulation of aIPg neurons, but the sample size looks small in these experiments. Could authors increase the sample size and see whether their conclusions hold? Particularly since activation of aIPg neurons causes aggression towards males, one might expect copulation to be impacted in these females?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and have doubled the number of flies used in this experiment (Figure 2—figure supplement 3 in the revised manuscript). With the larger sample size, we also found the same conclusion. Additionally, while there was no significant difference at either sample size, the activated and control flies had more similar latency times after the number of flies used in the experiment increased (original means of EmptySS&gt;Chrimson: 101.4±28.2 vs. aIPgSS1&gt;Chrimson: 170.4±40.8 and with larger n EmptySS&gt;Chrimson: 253.4±44.51 vs. aIPgSS1&gt;Chrimson: 238.3±40.02)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It often is not clear how many times each experiment was performed. For example – data in Figure 2 – appear to be derived from data pooled from two experiments done during the same week. Were these animals from the same cross? How many times was this done independently? Similar, detailed information should be provided for each of the figures. A total number of flies is presented each time, but it is usually not clear how many independent samples there are.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. All the requested details were contained in a supplementary file in the original submission. We have now moved this information to a move obvious location in the figure legends and Materials and methods section of the main manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors emphasize the significance of recurrent connectivity between pC1d and aIPg neurons as the basis for female aggressive behavior. The recurrent connectivity is observed specifically between pC1d and aIPg Type 1 neurons, but no data demonstrates that it is the Type 1 neurons that is responsible for female aggression. It is equally possible that Type 2 or 3 is the important subset. These 2 types do not make recurrent connection with pC1d – instead, these are almost unidirectional downstream of pC1d (Figure 8A) (note that Type 2 is the second most prominent downstream of pC1d, as shown in Figure 10C). The authors did not perform any physiological experiments to demonstrate whether these recurrent (or unidirectional) connectivities are functional. Without evidence on which aIPg subtype is important for female aggression, it would be fair to acknowledge that top-down connection from pC1d to aIPg could be the behaviorally relevant functional motif between the 2 neuronal populations.</p></disp-quote><p>As with point #1, we address this question mainly by referring the reader to the paired Deutsch et al., 2020 paper for a discussion of recurrent connectivity. We certainly did not mean to imply in our original manuscript that we had determined the mechanism of persistence; rather we simply intended to point out circuit motifs that were well positioned to play such a role. This should now be clear in the revised manuscript, where we deleted nearly all of that speculation. In addition, we added text to the revised paper that explicitly states that the inputs and outputs of the different aIPg types differ and that they are differ greatly from those of pC1d (subsection “aIPg and pC1d neurons are interconnected, but have largely distinct upstream and downstream partners”). We also make it clear to the reader that all our behavioral data was done with split-GAL4 lines that include aIPg types 1, 2 and 3. Therefore, we cannot assign behavioral roles to individual types based on separately activating the individual types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The recurrent model is difficult to reconcile with the different behavioral phenotypes caused by the activation of pC1d and aIPg neurons, as (at least qualitatively) these two reciprocally connected neurons would have similar effect on the circuit. For example, why are aIPg neurons necessary for female aggression (Figure 2), but not pC1d (Figure 5—figure supplement 10), if these make reciprocal connection? If the connectivity is uni-directional, however, it is possible to speculate that aIPg neurons are necessary to integrate important information, one of which (not necessary for aggression on its own) is provided by pC1d. Ultimately, it would be necessary to perform &quot;epistasis&quot; experiments between the 2 populations (e.g. silencing one while activating the other) to resolve which of the 2 motifs is more relevant, although this would be more than what can be reasonably expected in a normal period allowed for revisions.</p></disp-quote><p>We made some writing changes to clarify the point raised by the reviewer. More specifically we point out the extensive differences between the upstream inputs and downstream targets of aIPg and pC1d neurons (subsection “aIPg and pC1d neurons are interconnected, but have largely distinct upstream and downstream partners”), making it clear why we would not expect identical phenotypes from their activation. This would be irrespective of the possible role of reciprocal connections, as these provide only a minority of inputs to either pC1d or aIPg cell types.</p><p>Both pC1d and aIPg cell types induce aggression, so in that sense they do have qualitatively similar behavioral effects. We do believe [as suggested by the reviewers: “it is possible to speculate that aIPg neurons are necessary to integrate important information, one of which (not necessary for aggression on its own) is provided by pC1d.”] that the simplest interpretation of our data is that pC1d acts upstream of aIPg, and the phenotypes seen with inactivation aIPg are consistent with that view. We also think that the aIPg and pC1d neurons are likely to act in parallel to produce different aspects of the phenotype. We have modified the writing to clarify these points. Our new observation of aIPg’s connections that are well-positioned to gate visual behavior also support this view. We agree with the reviewer that formal epistasis experiments might be informative, but these require reagents that do not yet exist. In any case, as mentioned in our response to point 6, we have removed speculation about the potential role of the reciprocal connections as we agree it will require additional experiments to determine what role, if any, they play.</p></body></sub-article></article>
