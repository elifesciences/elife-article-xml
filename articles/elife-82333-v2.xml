A long-standing debate concerns the question whether IF network organization only reflects or also determines cell and tissue function. Using <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, we have recently described mutants of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) SMA-5 which perturb the organization of the intestinal IF cytoskeleton resulting in luminal widening and cytoplasmic invaginations. Besides these structural phenotypes, systemic dysfunctions were also observed. We now identify the IF polypeptide IFB-2 as a highly efficient suppressor of both the structural and functional deficiencies of mutant <italic>sma-5</italic> animals by removing the aberrant IF network. Mechanistically, perturbed IF network morphogenesis is linked to hyperphosphorylation of multiple sites throughout the entire IFB-2 molecule. The rescuing capability is IF isotype-specific and not restricted to <italic>sma-5</italic> mutants but extends to mutants that disrupt the function of the cytoskeletal linker IFO-1 and the IF-associated protein BBLN-1. The findings provide strong evidence for adverse consequences of the deranged IF networks with implications for diseases that are characterized by altered IF network organization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intermediate filament</kwd><kwd>endotube</kwd><kwd>intestine</kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LE566/14-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leube</surname><given-names>Rudolf E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(NWO)-VICI 016.VICI.170.165</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boxem</surname><given-names>Mike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INST 948/4S-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jankowski</surname><given-names>Vera</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LE566/14-3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leube</surname><given-names>Rudolf E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Transregional Collaborative Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR 219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jankowski</surname><given-names>Vera</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Transregional Collaborative Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>322900939</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jankowski</surname><given-names>Vera</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Transregional Collaborative Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>subproject S-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jankowski</surname><given-names>Vera</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Transregional Collaborative Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INST 948/4S-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jankowski</surname><given-names>Vera</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aberrant cytoskeletal intermediate filament networks in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine are associated with hyperphosphorylated intermediate filament proteins and impact not only intestinal cell structure but have also detrimental consequences for organismal well-being.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intermediate filaments (IFs) together with actin filaments and microtubules are important components of the cytoskeleton. They mediate mechanical tissue stability and have been implicated in multiple cellular processes such as vesicle transport, organelle positioning, cell cycle regulation, differentiation, metabolism, motility, and stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etienne-Manneville, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacob et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leube and Schwarz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Margiotta and Bucci, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoon and Leube, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toivola et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geisler and Leube, 2016</xref>). An ongoing debate is whether IFs are simply bystanders of these cellular processes or contribute actively to cell function and dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etienne-Manneville, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bott and Winckler, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ridge et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To study the morphogenesis and function of the IF system, we use the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. A striking example of specialized IF network organization is encountered in the intestine, where six IF polypeptides IFB-2, IFC-1, IFC-2, IFD-1, IFD-2, and IFP-1 co-localize in the apical cytoplasm and form the electron dense endotube, which surrounds the lumen as a compact fibrous sheath and is attached to the composite <italic>C. elegans</italic> apical junction (CeAJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carberry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jahnel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bossinger et al., 2004</xref>). It is assumed that this evolutionary conserved localization of the intestinal IF network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coch and Leube, 2016</xref>) provides protection against mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geisler and Leube, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toivola et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geisler et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, the endotube is positioned at the interface between the cortical actin cytoskeleton with the stiff microvillar brush border and the soft cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geisler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGhee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bossinger et al., 2004</xref>). Because of its high degree of elasticity the IF-rich endotube likely dampens mechanical stresses occurring during food intake, defecation, and body movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geisler et al., 2020</xref>). Elimination of the intestinal IFs IFB-2, IFC-2, and IFD-2 therefore leads to luminal widening although loss of IFC-1, IFD-1, and IFP-1 does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geisler et al., 2020</xref>). Electron microscopy revealed that IFC-2 mutants have a rarefied endotube, whereas IFB-2 mutants lack it completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geisler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geisler et al., 2020</xref>). The intestinal IF mutants present very mild organismal phenotypes with only minor or no detectable effects on development, progeny production, survival, and stress sensitivity with the exception of IFC-2 mutants, which cause additional excretory canal defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geisler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hashimi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carberry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karabinos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karabinos et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Modulators of intestinal IF distribution have been identified and characterized in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carberry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geisler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Estes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geisler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remmelzwaal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koyuncu et al., 2021</xref>). One of them is SMA-5, a stress-activated kinase orthologue of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watanabe et al., 2005</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> WormBase (version WS287; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wormbase.org">https://wormbase.org</ext-link>) lists MAPK7 (BMK1; ERK4; ERK5; PRKM7) as its closest orthologue in vertebrates. However, MAPK7 activity has not been linked to IFs so far. Abundant cytoplasmic invaginations of the adluminal, apical plasma membrane develop over time in loss-of-function <italic>sma-5(n678)</italic> mutant intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geisler et al., 2016</xref>). These changes correlate with the development of a locally thickened endotube consisting of amorphous material next to areas with complete endotube loss. The cytoplasmic invaginations form at the transition between both areas. The structural changes go along with biochemical changes, that is, altered IFB-2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, in comparison to the wild type and to intestinal IF mutants <italic>sma-5</italic> mutants are smaller, produce less offspring, develop more slowly, live shorter, and are more sensitive to microbial pathogens and osmotic as well as oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geisler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geisler et al., 2019</xref>). It is not known whether these pathologies are attributable to the altered IF cytoskeleton or other <italic>sma-5(n678</italic>)-dependent cellular perturbations. Another modulator of the intestinal IF cytoskeleton is the intestinal IF organizer gene <italic>ifo-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carberry et al., 2012</xref>), which was originally identified as a cellular defense gene against pore-forming toxins and as part of the MAPK/JNK innate immune defense network (referred to as <italic>ttm-4</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kao et al., 2011</xref>). The IF network in loss-of-function <italic>ifo-1</italic> mutants collapses into large aggregates, which accumulate primarily at the CeAJ and occasionally in the cytoplasm. <italic>ifo-1</italic> mutants are small, have reduced progeny, and are hypersensitive to different types of stress. The phenotypes are not only much more pronounced than those observed in IF mutants but are also more pronounced than in <italic>sma-5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geisler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geisler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carberry et al., 2012</xref>). Again, the contribution of the deranged IF network to the <italic>ifo-1</italic> mutant phenotype has not been determined to date. Recently, we described a third type of intestinal IF regulator, namely BBLN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remmelzwaal et al., 2021</xref>). BBLN-1 is a small coiled-coil protein whose depletion results in an intestinal phenotype that is highly reminiscent of that observed in <italic>sma-5</italic> mutants presenting bubble-shaped cytoplasmic invaginations of the apical plasma membrane. Systemic consequences of <italic>bbln-1</italic> mutation have not been analyzed in detail to date. Remarkably, all three regulators have been localized to the apical submembrane compartment in intestinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remmelzwaal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geisler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carberry et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To identify components of the IF regulatory pathways in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine, we performed a suppressor screen of <italic>sma-5(n678</italic>) mutants, which identified <italic>ifb-2</italic> mutation as the most efficient suppressor. Loss-of-function <italic>ifb-2</italic> mutation also partially rescued the <italic>ifo-1</italic> and <italic>bbln-1</italic> phenotypes. The perturbed intestinal IF networks were completely depleted in all instances. Even more importantly, the systemic dysfunctions were also rescued for the most part. These findings provide new evidence on the gain-of-toxic-function hypothesis driving the pathogenesis of aggregate-forming diseases, which have been shown to involve aberrant IF networks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulombe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chamcheu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshida and Nakagawa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clemen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gentil et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Didonna and Opal, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The loss-of-function phenotype of the MAP-kinase SMA-5 is rescued by depletion of the intestinal IF polypeptide IFB-2</title><p>To identify downstream targets of the MAP-kinase orthologue SMA-5, we performed a genome-wide suppressor screen in OLB18 carrying the loss-of-function allele <italic>sma-5(n678</italic>). Selecting for fast developing lines we isolated two lines, in which we were not able to detect any native IFB-2 expression by immunoblotting (data not shown). We therefore focused on the <italic>ifb-2</italic> gene locus for further analysis and identified an 83 bp deletion (positions 5.751.812â5.751.893; allele <italic>ifb-2(kc20</italic>)). Due to the resulting frameshift the mutant <italic>ifb-2</italic> gene encodes only 120 amino acids, consisting of the entire 31 amino acid-long head domain, 85 amino acids of the coiled-coil rod domains 1a and 1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karabinos et al., 2004</xref>), and the four additional carboxyterminal amino acids R-G-P-S. To demonstrate that loss-of-function of IFB-2 is by itself sufficient and necessary to rescue the <italic>sma-5(n678</italic>) phenotype and to exclude that the residual aminoterminal part of IFB-2 that is still produced from <italic>kc20</italic> is responsible for the rescue, we crossed <italic>sma-5(n678</italic>) mutants with the previously described <italic>ifb-2</italic> knockout allele <italic>kc14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geisler et al., 2019</xref>). The <italic>kc14</italic> allele encodes a 29 amino acid-long oligopeptide encompassing only 13 of the most aminoterminal amino acids of IFB-2. Assessment of body length revealed a near normal body size of the double <italic>sma-5(n678);ifb-2(kc14</italic>) mutants. Only a minor reduction was detected at day 4 after egg laying as was the case for <italic>ifb-2(kc14</italic>) single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Dextran feeding experiments confirmed these observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Ultrastructural analyses further showed a reversion of the phenotype to a near wild-type situation in the double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EâHâ²</xref>). Only minor luminal undulations and slight perturbation of the microvillar brush border remained. Most notably, the endotube was completely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1HâHâ²</xref>).

Neither the phosphomimetic nor the phosphorylation-deficient mutant animals presented a visible change in IFC-2 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4CâEâ²</xref>). Further characterization revealed that the mutants showed no developmental delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and only a slight reduction of progeny in case of the <italic>ifb-2</italic> head S&gt;D mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). However, significant reduction of life span could be observed in all instances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Taken together, while the phosphorylation sites in the head domain of IFB-2 are not necessary for IF network morphogenesis per se, they may affect network properties such as subunit turnover that are not readily apparent from static pictures and may result in reduced network resilience leading to the decreased life span.</p><p>During the course of CRISPR mutagenesis, we isolated allele <italic>ifb-2(kc27</italic>). This allele codes for an IFB-2 mutant containing not only the intended S2/S5/S7/S16â19&gt;A mutations but a deletion of the region E31-A184, corresponding to the coil 1A, linker L1 and a large part of the coil 1B domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>ifb-2(kc27</italic>) mutant animals showed an aberrant IFC-2 fluorescence pattern presenting a reduced though still apically localized IFC-2 distribution with additional, strongly fluorescent granules next to the CeAJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4FâFâ²</xref>). The mutant protein could be detected by immunofluorescence in the intestine, albeit at highly reduced levels in the cytoplasm, at the CeAJ and in CeAJ-associated granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A-Bâ²</xref>). The truncated IFB-2a and IFB-2c proteins of about 50 kDa were identified in immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Significant effects on progeny and life expectancy were also noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4HâI</xref>). We therefore propose that the aminoterminal region of IFB-2 up to A184 has an important function in network formation but that mutants lacking this region still retain the ability to enrich apically at the CeAJ.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>IFB-2 is hyperphosphorylated at multiple sites in the absence of SMA-5.</title><p>The upper panel shows a domain model of IFB-2 with its aminoterminal head, alpha helical central rod (coil 1A, linker L1, coil 1B, linker L12, coil 2A, linker L2, and coil 2B), and carboxyterminal tail.

Nevertheless, our observations prove that SMA-5 is involved in regulating IFB-2 phosphorylation. They also indicate that IFB-2 is unlikely a direct target of SMA-5. Further experiments are needed to unravel how SMA-5 acts on IFB-2 phosphorylation, which may be accomplished by regulating the activity or recruitment of a phosphatase or by an even more indirect mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>ifb-2(kc14</italic>) partially rescues the <italic>ifo-1(kc2</italic>) and <italic>bbln-1(mib70</italic>) phenotypes</title><p>The above findings suggested that the rescue function of IFB-2 deletion in <italic>sma-5(n678</italic>) was caused by removal of the densely packed IFs.

This included rescue of structural defects (cytoplasmic invagination and lumen dilatation), developmental and growth defects, as well as oxidative stress resilience. The obtained rescue levels coincided precisely with the mild phenotype of single <italic>ifb-2(kc14</italic>) mutants. Remarkably, osmotic stress resilience could not be rescued suggesting that this loss-of-function is tightly coupled to the absence of the endotube. In accordance, it has been suggested that osmotic stress resilience is a fundamental function of cytoplasmic IFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DâAlessandro et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pekny and Lane, 2007</xref>). Osmotic challenges are of particular relevance to the intestine and its exposure to microbial toxins. Our findings furthermore provide strong in vivo evidence that the <italic>sma-5</italic> mutant phenotype is caused by the presence of IFB-2-containing pathological assemblies. This conclusion was confirmed in <italic>ifo-1</italic> and <italic>bbln-1</italic> mutants. Removal of the pathological IFB-2 assemblies also rescued complex biological functions. We therefore conclude that the deranged intestinal IF cytoskeletons are associated with a gain-of-toxic function exerting negative effects, which have detrimental consequences for cell and tissue function and thereby adversely affect growth and reproduction of the entire organism. The scenario is reminiscent of that described in vertebrate disease paradigms, in which IF depletion has positive effects on disease outcome (review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ridge et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The fact that removal of the very differently deranged IF networks, that is the thick subapical slabs in <italic>sma-5(n678</italic>) and <italic>bbln-1(mib70</italic>) and the large junctional aggregates in <italic>ifo-1(kc2</italic>), rescued the phenotypes in all instances is quite remarkable since the mechanical and structural dysfunctions appear to be fundamentally different in the different mutant backgrounds. They manifest in <italic>sma-5</italic> and <italic>bbln-1</italic> mutants as prominent cytoplasmic invaginations and primarily as luminal widening in <italic>ifo-1</italic> mutants (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geisler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carberry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remmelzwaal et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the absence of an endotube in <italic>ifo-1</italic> mutants predicts that the force equilibrium is affected differently from that in <italic>sma-5</italic> and <italic>bbln-1</italic> mutants with the locally thickened endotube. This indicates that restored mechanics alone are not sufficient to explain the phenotypic restoration in the double mutants. Thus, other non-mechanical functions must be attributable to the abnormal IF assemblies. It is interesting in this context that IFs may serve as signaling platforms by providing a large scaffold capable of sequestering and positioning signaling molecules that can be recruited by weak interactions and can be released, for example, by protein modification or structural changes of the IF cytoskeleton (review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bott and Winckler, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coulombe and Omary, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magin et al., 2007</xref>). Future experiments will be needed to show whether such a scaffolding function is compromised in <italic>sma-5</italic>, <italic>bbln-1,</italic> and <italic>ifo-1</italic> mutants by either sequestering or setting free regulatory factors that modulate pathways needed for normal growth, development, and stress responses.</p><p>By focusing on IF phosphorylation, we could show that IFs are hyperphosphorylated in <italic>sma-5(n678</italic>) animals and not hypophosphorylated as would be expected in case of a direct SMA-5/IF interaction. This implies that SMA-5 regulates IF phosphorylation indirectly. It remains to be shown whether this is mediated by controlling the activity or the recruitment of a phosphatase. This scenario predicts that activation of this yet unidentified phosphatase would restore normal IF phosphorylation levels and IF network morphogenesis in <italic>sma-5(n678</italic>) mutants. An alternative explanation would invoke an even more indirect mechanism whereby SMA-5 phosphorylates a factor that affects IF assembly, which in turn modulates IFB-2 phosphorylation. We do not know whether IF phosphorylation is also altered in <italic>bbln-1(mib70</italic>) and <italic>ifo-1(kc2</italic>) and whether IF hyperphosphorylation is per se able to induce IF network aggregation. The notion of phosphorylation-dependent IF network morphogenesis, however, is in line with numerous publications that have implicated phosphorylation in the regulation of IF assembly and disassembly (reviews in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sawant and Leube, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishimura et al., 2019</xref>). It is furthermore supported by the observation that IF phosphoepitopes are increased in IF aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sawant and Leube, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sawant et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">WÃ¶ll et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Battaglia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binukumar et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the identification of dominant phosphoregulatory sites it has been very difficult to define single sites that are exclusively responsible for a given structural or functional phenotype. This is in agreement with the current observations identifying multiple sites that are spread throughout the IFB-2 molecule. The future challenge is therefore to understand, in quantitative terms, how the multiple phosphorylation sites act together in modulating IF network formation and function. While this is technically difficult to achieve, it endows the cell with endless options to fine-tune its cytoskeleton in a highly context-dependent fashion and to connect the fine-tuning to multiple signaling pathways. We posit that the intestine-specific MAPK SMA-5 is linked to one or more of these signaling pathways, which affect the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of intestinal IFs and possibly other mediators. Similarly, IFO-1 may be linked to a similar pathway since it was initially identified as a toxin-regulated target of MAPK (<italic>ttm-4</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kao et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Obviously, further work is needed to fully understand both the relevant targets of SMA-5 and the role of phosphorylation in IF aggregate formation in order to elucidate the exact mechanism of aggregate suppression. However, our findings are likely relevant for the multiple aggregate-forming human diseases that involve IF polypeptides (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulombe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chamcheu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshida and Nakagawa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clemen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gentil et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Didonna and Opal, 2019</xref>). They mandate a careful evaluation of possible toxic functions of the perturbed IF networks, which may not be limited to the local cell and tissue environment but may have systemic consequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-IFB-2 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AB_528311 MH33</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(1:100-1:1000), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Francis and Waterston, 1991</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-mouse IgG coupled to <break/>horseradish peroxidase <break/>(goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DAKO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#P0447</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-GFP (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#A-11122</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-mouse IgG coupled to <break/>Alexa Fluor 488 (goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#A-11029</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-mouse IgG coupled to <break/>Alexa Fluor 555 (goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#A-21424</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OP50</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CGC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain can be obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HT115</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CGC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain can be obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vidal full-length HT115 <break/>RNAi feeding library</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SourceBio-Science</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3320_Cel_ORF_RNAi</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ahringer fragment HT115 <break/>RNAi feeding library</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SourceBio-Science</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3318_Cel_RNAi_complete</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dextran, Texas Red, <break/>70,000 MW</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#D1830</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Alt-R S.p.

After solidification, OP50 were placed on top of the agar and plates were incubated overnight at 37Â°C. They were then used for growing OLB18. Adult animals were bleached with a solution containing 170 Âµl 12% NaOCl, 100 Âµl 4 M NaOH per 1 ml PBS (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and the resulting embryos were grown on new plates. The resulting synchronized L4 larvae were washed off with PBS and were then centrifuged in 15 ml Falcon tubes at 340Ã<italic>g</italic> for 2 min. Five ml of the pelleted worms were mixed with 50 Âµl of 50 mM <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany, N3385-1G) and the suspension was incubated for 4 hr at room temperature on a rotating shaker. Two washing steps with PBS followed before the mutagenized worms were resuspended in PBS. One hundred L4 animals were placed per agar plate containing enriched NGM supplemented with 5 g/l Difco yeast extract (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA, #210929) (total of 200 plates). The plates were then incubated at 20Â°C. It was ensured that the F2 generation was completely laid on these plates before food was used up. Then 1.5Ã1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> pieces were cut out and placed on new plates, which were again incubated at 20Â°C until food was completely used up. After repeating these steps three times, the development of the mutant lines compared to OLB18 was monitored using a stereomicroscope. Criteria for suppressor activity were body size and developmental stage. If both were rescued, lines were subjected to further selection rounds. Only stable lines were subsequently examined by light microscopy for rescue of invaginations of the apical intestinal membrane. The mutant line, which met all three criteria best, was named strain BJ334 (<italic>sma-5(n678)X;ifb-2(kc20)II</italic>) and was backcrossed twice with OLB18 resulting in strain BJ355 (<italic>sma-5(n678)X;ifb-2(kc20)II</italic>).

They were placed in 30 Âµl dH<sub>2</sub>O each and subsequently washed two times followed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at â80Â°C until further use. To disrupt the cuticle, the samples were subjected to five cycles of rapid thawing on a heating block at 100Â°C and freezing in liquid nitrogen. Samples were subsequently homogenized by up and down pipetting five times through a 30 G hypodermal syringe (BD Medical, Heidelberg, Germany, #MPC B3324826). After addition of 7.5 Âµl 5Ã Laemmli loading buffer (15 ml stacking gel buffer [0.15 M Tris-Cl, 0.1% SDS, pH: 6,8], 12.5 ml glycerine, 2.5 ml Î²-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 g SDS, some bromophenol blue), the samples were incubated for 5 min at 100Â°C. Polypeptides were separated by electrophoresis in an 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel followed up by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The region with proteins between 50 kDa and 150 kDa was manually excised and further processed for matrix-assisted-laser-desorption/ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rueth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kork et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the protein plugs were incubated with ammonium bicarbonate (50 mmol/l) and 0.05% w/c trypsin for 24 hr at 37Â°C. The resulting tryptic peptides were desalted and concentrated using ZipTip<sub>c18</sub> technology (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and eluted with 80% acetonitrile directly onto the (MALDI) target plate (MTP-AnchorChip 400/384; Bruker-Daltonic) using alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. The subsequent MS analyses were performed using a MALDI-time of flight/time of flight (TOF/TOF) mass spectrometer (Ultraflex III and Rapiflex; Bruker-Daltonic, Bremen, Germany).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Mohan Balasubramanian) and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: John E. Eriksson (Reviewer #1). We apologize for the delay caused due to circumstances beyond our control.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below are a number of questions for the authors to consider and amend correspondingly when relevant.</p><p>1. The title may need some rephrasing. From the provided data in the manuscript, it is not obvious that the observed IF network perturbation causes systemic toxicity, as &quot;systemic&quot; is generally referred to as something that affects the whole body rather than a specific organ or area.</p><p>2. In Figure 2B, the authors claimed that sma-5(n678) animal develops slower, 'some of them never reach adulthood.' This statement seems overly vague and needs to be specified. The figure shows that there is a significant number of individuals at L4 stage on day5. On what day may one find adult sma-5 (n678) animals? What is the percentage of the sma-5 animals which finally reached adulthood? In other words, to what extent are those animals 'delayed' in development, and what was the percentage that did not reach adulthood?</p><p>3. Another consideration is to what extent the manuscript explores the effects of the direct target phosphosite of SMA-5 kinase. While the phosphorylation profile of the head domain seems to have a key or partial role in the observed network perturbation, as a whole, the phosphorylation section seems to need strengthening, especially as there is rather extensive literature on the roles of phosphorylation in regulation specific IF domains. This literature could be referred to in greater detail and it would be interesting to hear whether the authors think that the kinase interaction they describe resembles some of the kinase interactions observed in vertebrate and mammalian IFs.</p><p>4. On the same token, SMA-5 is referred to as a MAPK orthologue but with limited or no information on which MAPK family member it would resemble most. Both the introduction and discussion would benefit from placing this MAPK in its vertebrate context. Would there be any analogous MAPK interaction in vertebrates/mammals?</p><p>5. The statement at the end of the first result section: 'Taken together, we can conclude that loss of IFB-2 rescues all major SMA-5 phenotypes to levels observed in ifb-2(kc14). This demonstrates that the alterations of the IF network observed in sma-5(n678) exert a gain-of-toxic function by negatively affecting intestinal and organismal physiology. '</p><p>The authors compared developmental stages, lifespan, and oxidative stress response between mutant and rescued animals, which shows that alterations in the IF network affected both organ and animal development. However, there seems to be a leap of faith that this delayed effect on animal development is a direct result of the effects on intestinal physiology, as there could be parallel processes at work. The authors may consider rephrasing the claims so that the statement would better match the conclusion that can be drawn from the experiments.</p><p>6. SMA-5 mutants are smaller and develop more slowly. Could it be that SMA-5 is part of a cascade/signaling pathway responsible for cell growth so it's actually activating something else?</p><p>7. Is there any evolutionary correlation between IFC2 and IFB2?</p><p>8. It seems IFC2 is reinforcing the expression of the deficient phenotype. Is IFC-2 playing any role in determining the role of IFB-2, which itself is causing the lack of endotube?</p><p>9. Please mark magnified sections in images of lower magnification. For example, in Figure 4A' mark where in the bigger image the magnified crop-out is from.</p><p>10. The endotube and lack thereof in figure 5A-D are a bit hard to see unless one knows what to look for, even with the red/green arrows. Here a magnified crop-out (as used in for example 4A') can be used to make things more obvious</p><p>11. The findings where IF silencing does not rescue osmotic stress response are very interesting and also relevant. It would be interesting if the discussion and conclusions could further elaborate on these observations.</p><p>12. Were there other processes or organs that were impacted due to IF deletion during the course of the study but were not shown among the findings?</p><p>13. The discussion focuses on the relationship between IF network organization and cell and tissue function. Based on the model in figure 7, it seems that an aberrant IF network influences function by impacting a major tissue structure (in this case endotube morphology) but a loss of an IF does not necessarily affect cell and tissue function much unless there is a challenge that reveals a protective or other function of a give IF. In the recent review by Ridge, Eriksson, Pekny &amp; Goldman in Genes &amp; Development (2022), there is an extensive discussion on the balance between protective IF functions vs. IF triggering maladaptive responses, such as fibrosis, extensive gliosis, etc. that may lead to dysregulated tissue repair and tissue destruction.

In the results, related to figure 4, in which the authors mutate a set of serine residues in the head region to A or D and find little impact of these substitutions. The authors summarize these results stating, lines 291-4 &quot;while the phosphorylation sites in the head domain of IFB-2 are not necessary for IF network morphogenesis per se, they may affect network properties such as subunit turnover that are not readily apparent from static pictures and may result in reduced network resilience leading to the decreased life span.&quot; This is fine, however, the abstract concludes: &quot;Mechanistically, IF network morphogenesis is linked to the phosphorylated IFB-2 aminoterminus.&quot; which is not an accurate summary of the results.</p><p>Some additional suggestions for the authors:</p><p>1) The ifb-2 deletion suppressor suggests that assembly of the intestinal IF network requires, and is potentially nucleated by, IFB-2. In their recent Science Reports paper, they state, &quot;The most likely explanation is that IFB-2 pairs with either of the other intestinal IF polypeptides, which may only have a limited or no capacity to form filaments on their own. This view is supported by overlay assays of recombinant polypeptides. They show that IFB-2 binds to IFC-1, IFC-2, IFD-1 and IFD-2, although homo- and heterophilic binding also occurs among the other polypeptides. Overlay assays, however, do not allow to distinguish between different binding strengths and do not provide direct information on filament-forming capacity.&quot;</p><p>Given the transgenes described in this paper, it would be important to test whether the assembly of IFC-1, IFC-2a/e, IFD-2, and IFP-1 at the endotube is dependent upon IFB-2. This could easily be tested using RNAi to deplete IFB-2. In addition, the discussion of this paper should mention that IFB-2 is required for the assembly of all intestinal IFs. The text on lines 233-239 alludes to these observations, but the term &quot;master regulator&quot; is a bit vague and if it is required for all the IFs to assemble, it would be preferable to say that directly. Similarly on line 427-8, &quot;Our findings furthermore provide strong in vivo evidence that the rescued sma-5 mutant phenotype is caused by the presence of IFB-2-containing pathological assemblies.&quot; Again not only do these assemblies contain IFB-2, their assembly requires IFB-2.</p><p>2) It would be helpful to have domain diagrams of the various intestinal IFs, particularly IFB-2. This could highlight the various mutations and the head vs rod domains.

The title may need some rephrasing. From the provided data in the manuscript, it is not obvious that the observed IF network perturbation causes systemic toxicity, as &quot;systemic&quot; is generally referred to as something that affects the whole body rather than a specific organ or area.</p></disp-quote><p>We consider growth and developmental retardation, increased larval arrest, reduced life span, decreased brood size and increased oxidative stress sensitivity as systemic phenotypes, which we link to IF network perturbation that is restricted to the intestine. Simply removing the perturbed IF network in the intestine rescues the systemic dysfunctions to near wild-type levels. The conclusion formulated in the title is therefore, in our view, the main outcome of our study. We agree with the Reviewer, however, that the chosen wording, i.e. linking &quot;systemic&quot; and &quot;toxicity&quot; may be misleading and therefore suggest the following modified title: &quot;Intermediate filament network perturbation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine causes systemic dysfunctions&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 2B, the authors claimed that sma-5(n678) animal develops slower, 'some of them never reach adulthood.' This statement seems overly vague and needs to be specified. The figure shows that there is a significant number of individuals at L4 stage on day5. On what day may one find adult sma-5 (n678) animals? What is the percentage of the sma-5 animals which finally reached adulthood? In other words, to what extent are those animals 'delayed' in development, and what was the percentage that did not reach adulthood?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2C shows that 7.1% of <italic>sma-5(n678)</italic> animals never reach adulthood because of larval arrest, all other animals do. They reach adulthood at 6.0Â±0.2 days (Figure 2A), i.e. more than two days later than N2 (3.7Â±0.5 days).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Another consideration is to what extent the manuscript explores the effects of the direct target phosphosite of SMA-5 kinase. While the phosphorylation profile of the head domain seems to have a key or partial role in the observed network perturbation, as a whole, the phosphorylation section seems to need strengthening, especially as there is rather extensive literature on the roles of phosphorylation in regulation specific IF domains. This literature could be referred to in greater detail and it would be interesting to hear whether the authors think that the kinase interaction they describe resembles some of the kinase interactions observed in vertebrate and mammalian IFs.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the Reviewer we teamed up with Vera Jankowski for analyzing the phosphorylation of IFB-2 in wild-type and <italic>sma-5(n678)</italic> adult animals. The analyses focused on the rod and tail domains identifying five serine residues and three tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated in the mutant animals. None of the tyrosine residues was found to be phosphorylated in the wild type and only three of the serine residues, albeit at lower frequency than in the mutants. The results are depicted in new Figures 5 and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1. We have also added a paragraph on the role of phosphorylation in IF regulation in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. On the same token, SMA-5 is referred to as a MAPK orthologue but with limited or no information on which MAPK family member it would resemble most. Both the introduction and discussion would benefit from placing this MAPK in its vertebrate context. Would there be any analogous MAPK interaction in vertebrates/mammals?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following: &quot;The <italic>C. elegans</italic> WormBase (version WS287; https://wormbase.org) lists MAPK7 (BMK1; ERK4; ERK5; PRKM7) as its closest orthologue in vertebrates. However, MAPK7 activity has not been linked to IFs so far.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The statement at the end of the first result section: 'Taken together, we can conclude that loss of IFB-2 rescues all major SMA-5 phenotypes to levels observed in ifb-2(kc14). This demonstrates that the alterations of the IF network observed in sma-5(n678) exert a gain-of-toxic function by negatively affecting intestinal and organismal physiology. '</p><p>The authors compared developmental stages, lifespan, and oxidative stress response between mutant and rescued animals, which shows that alterations in the IF network affected both organ and animal development. However, there seems to be a leap of faith that this delayed effect on animal development is a direct result of the effects on intestinal physiology, as there could be parallel processes at work. The authors may consider rephrasing the claims so that the statement would better match the conclusion that can be drawn from the experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We reworded the section in the following way: &quot;Taken together, we can conclude that loss of IFB-2 rescues all major SMA-5 phenotypes, except osmotic stress hypersensitivity, to levels observed in <italic>ifb-2(kc14)</italic>. This demonstrates that intestinal IF network perturbations adversely affects organismal physiology...&quot; Obviously, the link between both still needs to be worked out (for initial experiments, see, e.g. Coch et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. SMA-5 mutants are smaller and develop more slowly. Could it be that SMA-5 is part of a cascade/signaling pathway responsible for cell growth so it's actually activating something else?</p></disp-quote><p>We think that our experiments rule out this possibility since depletion of IFB-2 alone is sufficient to rescue <italic>sma-5</italic> deficiency. Having said this, however, we do not rule out and consider it quite likely that the SMA-5 activity is not exclusively targeted to the regulation of the IF network. Similarly, we cannot rule out that SMA-5 acts through recruitment of non-IF polypeptides to the IF cytoskeleton. We state this in the modified Discussion; &quot;We posit that the intestine-specific MAPK SMA-5 is linked to one or more of these [i.e., pathways that regulate IF dynamics] signaling pathways, which affect the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of intestinal IFs and possibly other mediators.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Is there any evolutionary correlation between IFC2 and IFB2?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to stress that the intestinal IFs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are not directly related to vertebrate IFs. For the Reviewerâs confidential perusal, we include an unpublished OrthoMCL cluster analysis of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal IFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. It seems IFC2 is reinforcing the expression of the deficient phenotype. Is IFC-2 playing any role in determining the role of IFB-2, which itself is causing the lack of endotube?</p></disp-quote><p>Published experimental evidence strongly suggests that IFB-2 forms heteropolymers with the other intestinal IF polypeptides (Karabinos et al., 2017). Depletion of IFC-2 therefore compromises the ability of IFB-2 to form filaments and consequently prevents proper endotube formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Please mark magnified sections in images of lower magnification. For example, in Figure 4A' mark where in the bigger image the magnified crop-out is from.</p></disp-quote><p>We made the requested changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The endotube and lack thereof in figure 5A-D are a bit hard to see unless one knows what to look for, even with the red/green arrows. Here a magnified crop-out (as used in for example 4A') can be used to make things more obvious</p></disp-quote><p>We improved the labeling and added the requested micrographs with corresponding explanatory schemes in new Figure 6A-DÂ´Â´. This resulted in separating former Figure 5 E-I into new Figure 7 A-E. We also added explanatory schemes to Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The findings where IF silencing does not rescue osmotic stress response are very interesting and also relevant. It would be interesting if the discussion and conclusions could further elaborate on these observations.</p></disp-quote><p>Our interpretation of this finding is that osmotic stress resilience relies on the presence of an intact IF network reflecting a fundamental stress-protective function crucial of epithelial barrier formation. We mention this in the Discussion and refer to the pioneering work of Brigitte Lane. &quot;â¦it has been suggested that osmotic stress resilience is a fundamental function of cytoplasmic IFs (D'Alessandro et al., 2002, Pekny and Lane, 2007). Osmotic challenges are of particular relevance to the intestine and its exposure to microbial toxins.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Were there other processes or organs that were impacted due to IF deletion during the course of the study but were not shown among the findings?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not notice additional phenotypes except those reported for IFC-2 in the excretory canal (mentioned in the Introduction). We cannot exclude that other phenotypes may have escaped our attention so far. In fact, we even expect that further fine analyses will reveal alterations in other organs due to indirect effects elicited by the perturbed intestinal physiology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. The discussion focuses on the relationship between IF network organization and cell and tissue function. Based on the model in figure 7, it seems that an aberrant IF network influences function by impacting a major tissue structure (in this case endotube morphology) but a loss of an IF does not necessarily affect cell and tissue function much unless there is a challenge that reveals a protective or other function of a give IF. In the recent review by Ridge, Eriksson, Pekny &amp; Goldman in Genes &amp; Development (2022), there is an extensive discussion on the balance between protective IF functions vs. IF triggering maladaptive responses, such as fibrosis, extensive gliosis, etc. that may lead to dysregulated tissue repair and tissue destruction. It would be advantageous if the authors in the discussion would consider the balance between protective vs. maladaptive IF responses and whether their observations on a toxic gain of function effect could somehow reflect such a maladaptive response.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the insightful comment and included some of his ideas in the revised manuscript version together with a referral to the mentioned recent publication in Genes &amp; Development. Besides quoting the paper in the Introduction, we added the following sentence in the Discussion &quot;The scenario is reminiscent to that described in vertebrate disease paradigms, in which IF depletion has positive effects on disease outcome (review in Ridge et al., 2023).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors argue that their &quot;findings provide strong evidence for a gain-of-toxic function of the deranged IF networks&quot;.

It has been described decades ago to be essential for cellular structure, mechanical stability, and organization, as well as for external and internal signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware that the books have been closed on whether and to which degree IF aggregate formation serve to sequester misfolded proteins for the benefit of cell function or are by themselves toxic to cell function. We are aware that the debate has been ongoing for decades and that it is difficult/impossible to unequivocally resolve it. But using <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a model system, we have the opportunity to study in a well-characterized and comparatively simple organism under defined conditions consequences that go beyond the specific cell type or tissue. The observed adverse effects for the entire organism are obvious and we are not aware that a similar straightforward genotype-organismal phenotype relationship has been shown for other IF aggregate-forming diseases.
