Despite the importance of pre-mRNA splicing in shaping the proteome, its role in balancing immune outcomes remains understudied. Transcriptomic analysis of murine macrophage cell lines identified Serine/Arginine Rich Splicing factor 6 (SRSF6) as a gatekeeper of mitochondrial homeostasis. SRSF6-dependent orchestration of mitochondrial health is directed in large part by alternative splicing of the pro-apoptosis pore-forming protein BAX. Loss of SRSF6 promotes accumulation of BAX-κ, a variant that sensitizes macrophages to undergo cell death and triggers upregulation of interferon stimulated genes through cGAS sensing of cytosolic mitochondrial DNA. Upon pathogen sensing, macrophages regulate SRSF6 expression to control the liberation of immunogenic mtDNA and adjust the threshold for entry into programmed cell death. This work defines BAX alternative splicing by SRSF6 as a critical node not only in mitochondrial homeostasis but also in the macrophage’s response to pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pre-mRNA splicing</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>serine-arginine rich</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial DNA</kwd><kwd>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>cgas/sting</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31GM143893</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Haley M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH/NIAID</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI155621</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>Robert O</given-names></name><name><surname>Patrick</surname><given-names>Kristin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH/NIGMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM133720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patrick</surname><given-names>Kristin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The splicing factor SRSF6 helps regulate antiviral immunity and mitochondrial membrane integrity by balancing the abundance of two alternatively spliced isoforms of the apoptotic protein BAX.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When innate immune cells like macrophages sense pathogen or damage associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs), they rapidly induce transcription of hundreds of genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramsey et al., 2008</xref>). While these transcripts are being synthesized by RNA polymerase II, they are subject to several critical co-transcriptional processing steps including 5’ capping, cleavage and polyadenylation, and pre-mRNA splicing, whereby introns are removed and exons are ligated together to generate mature RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carpenter et al., 2014</xref>). Pre-mRNA splicing plays a key role in global regulation of the transcriptome and thus the proteome, with 92–94% of the human genome subject to alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) and &gt;80% of alternative splicing predicted to impact protein functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yura et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Splicing regulatory proteins play a critical role in maintaining the fidelity of splicing while permitting the flexibility needed for alternative exon usage. One major family of splicing regulators is the Serine/arginine rich, or SR proteins. These proteins recognize and bind to exonic splicing enhancer sequences to define exon locations, thus directing the U snRNPs to cis-splicing signals in nearby introns. The SRs also function at other steps of the RNA life cycle including mRNA export, localization, decay, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howard and Sanford, 2015</xref>). Many connections have been made between SR proteins and cancer, with aberrant expression of SR proteins commonly observed in patients with multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Song et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wan et al., 2019</xref>). There are emerging roles for SR proteins in regulating immune homeostasis. SRSF1, the best studied SR protein, limits autoimmunity via a role in maintaining healthy regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Katsuyama and Moulton, 2021</xref>). SRSF3 has been shown to negatively regulate IL-1β release during <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> infection of THP-1 monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moura-Alves et al., 2011</xref>) and SRSF2 promotes herpes simplex virus replication by binding to viral promoters and controlling splicing of viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To better define the contributions of SRSF proteins to innate immunity, we carried out a transcriptomics study of a panel of SRSF knockdown (KD) RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines. This analysis revealed a remarkable degree of diversity in how individual SR proteins influence innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>). One particularly striking phenotype we uncovered was that of <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD macrophages, which express high basal levels of <italic>Ifnb1</italic> and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). SRSF6 is a 55 kDa protein that is essential for viability of <italic>Drosophilia melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mason et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ring and Lis, 1994</xref>). Multiple studies report that SRSF6 preferentially binds purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers, with a predicted consensus site in humans of USCGKM (where S represents G or C; K represents U or G; M represents A or C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 1998</xref>). SRSF6 activity is at least in part controlled via phosphorylation by the dual specificity kinases CLK1 and DYRK1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yin et al., 2012</xref>), which activates SRSF6 shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sapra et al., 2009</xref>). SRSF6 abundance has been repeatedly associated with cancer, liver disease, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juan-Mateu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2021</xref>) and recent work has identified several roles for SRSF6 in mitochondrial function and cell death. For example, loss of SRSF6 decreases mitochondrial respiration, leading to increased cellular apoptosis in human endoC-BH1 endothelial cells, likely via alternative splicing of cell death factors like <italic>Bim</italic>, <italic>Bax</italic>, <italic>Diablo</italic>, and <italic>Bclaf1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juan-Mateu et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, phosphorylation of SRSF6 induces alternative splicing of mitochondria related genes (e.g. <italic>Polg2</italic>, <italic>Nudt13</italic>, <italic>Guf1</italic>, <italic>RnaseI</italic>, and <italic>Nme4</italic>) in a mouse model of fatty liver disease as well as in human hepatitis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that SRSF6 works to limit basal type I interferon (IFN) expression and apoptosis in murine macrophage cell lines and primary macrophages. The mechanisms underlying these phenotypes converge on alternative splicing of the pro-apoptotic factor BAX; specifically, upregulation of a BAX variant called BAX-kappa (Bax-κ). Our findings support a model whereby Bax-κ expression renders BAX mitochondrial pores permissive to mtDNA release and sensitive to triggers of programmed cell death. These studies provide insight into how BAX alternative splicing controls mitochondrial homeostasis and illuminate an unappreciated role for SRSF6 in balancing macrophage innate immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SRSF6 knockdown activates type I interferon gene expression in macrophages</title><p>To appreciate the distinct contribution of individual SR proteins to macrophage gene expression, we generated RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines (RAW MΦ) stably expressing shRNA hairpins directed against <italic>Srsf</italic>1, 2, 6, 7, and 9, as previously reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>. Most SR proteins are ubiquitously expressed across cell types, and we confirmed expression of each of these SRs in our RAW MΦ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Because it is well-established that several members of the SR protein family are essential genes across multiple cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldberger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ortiz-Sánchez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2005</xref>) and because high-quality transcriptomics analyses have been carried out successfully for SR family members using shRNA or siRNA gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van Nostrand et al., 2020</xref>), we opted to stably knockdown these factors, instead of relying on CRISPR-mediated gene editing. To identify major transcriptomic changes due to loss of SR proteins, we isolated total RNA from each of these KD cell lines and a scramble (SCR) control that was selected alongside the SR KDs, performed RNA-seq, and measured differential gene expression using the CLC Genomics Workbench, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>. Using a simple hierarchical clustering algorithm, we visualized the gene expression profiles of each SR KD macrophage cell line and pinpointed SRSF6 as unique amongst the SR proteins queried (correlation between SRSF6’s node and the rest of the tree = 0.138) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Manual annotation of genes in clusters that were uniquely impacted by loss of SRSF6 revealed several downregulated genes related to mitochondrial biology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On the other hand, many upregulated genes fell into the category of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zahoor et al., 2014</xref>. ISGs are a group of genes whose transcription is activated through IFNAR receptor-mediated type I interferon signaling. Generally, very few ISG transcripts accumulate in resting macrophages. Direct visualization of RNA-seq reads using the Integrated Genome Viewer shows elevated reads across all coding exons for representative ISGs <italic>Rsad2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and <italic>Mx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis confirmed overrepresentation of differentially expressed genes in functional categories related to interferon and antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating an overall increase in type I IFN signaling. Furthermore, RT-qPCR confirmed basal ISG expression in two independently derived <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>), with the degree of ISG accumulation correlating with SRSF6 KD efficiency and protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). We also measured ISG accumulation upon transient siRNA KD of SRSF6 in RAW MΦ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), arguing against off-target effects resulting from stable selection of KD cell lines. Importantly, this phenotype was recapitulated by <italic>Srsf6</italic> siRNA KD in primary cell types including bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Differential expression of genes involved in type I IFN responses was not observed in other resting SRSF KD RAW MΦ cell lines, suggesting this phenotype is unique to loss of SRSF6 and is not a general consequence of interfering with splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SRSF6 controls basal type I interferon expression in macrophages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes after knockdown of <italic>Srsf1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>6</italic>, <italic>7</italic>, and <italic>9</italic> in RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cell lines (RAW MΦ) relative to a scramble (SCR) shRNA control.

Phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a critical step in the initial stages of PAMP and DAMP sensing that lead to production of IFN-β. Immunoblot analysis revealed increased levels of phospho-IRF3 (S396) in resting <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Higher levels of IFN-β protein were also measured in the supernatants of <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD RAW MΦ cells via ISRE reporter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffpauir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Consistent with higher levels of IFN-β secretion, supernatants from <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD macrophages were sufficient to stimulate ISG expression in naïve wild-type RAW MΦ cells (24 hr incubation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). Elevated basal ISG expression in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells was rescued by treatment with an IFN-β neutralizing antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). Together, these data suggest that IRF3-mediated expression of IFN-β drives upregulation of basal ISG expression in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD RAW MΦ cells. Finally, to demonstrate the biological relevance of increased SRSF6-dependent basal ISG expression, we infected cells with the single stranded RNA virus VSV, which is hypersensitive to even low levels of ISG expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">West et al., 2019</xref>).

To measure cytosolic mtDNA we used differential centrifugation to separate cytosolic and cellular membrane fractions (the latter of which include mitochondria) from SCR and <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD RAW MΦ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

However, given that the cell death observed was not silent, with ISG upregulation, we sought to rule out additional proinflammatory pathways present during <italic>Srsf6</italic>-mediated cell death. We detected no significant difference in IL-1β release between BMDMs transfected with a non-targeting siRNA vs. <italic>Srsf6</italic>-targeting siRNA in either unprimed or poly dA:dT primed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). Curiously, despite displaying an apoptotic signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, E</xref>), cell death in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD RAW MΦ cells was caspase-independent, as treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitors Q-VD-OPh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) and Z-VAD-FMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) had no impact on PI incorporation in resting <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells. Consistent with lack of caspase involvement, resting <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD RAW MΦ did not release cytochrome c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). These observations, coupled with the disruption to mitochondrial membrane potential reported in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggest a form of mitochondrial-dependent caspase-independent cell death (CICD) (as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xiang et al., 1996</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tait and Green, 2008</xref>) that occurs preferentially in <italic>Srsf6 KD</italic> macrophages. We hypothesize that BAX-κ, which can trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and release of mtDNA without releasing cytochrome c, is a major contributor to this noncanonical form of cell death, which is characterized by low-level sustained damage to mitochondria.</p><p>We next sought to more directly associate BAX and BAX-κ with the altered mitochondrial homeostasis observed in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD MΦ. Our data, and that from previous studies of <italic>Bax-psi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cartron et al., 2005</xref>), suggest that BAX-κ is a constitutively active form of BAX that readily localizes to mitochondrial membranes in resting cells. To determine whether BAX protein accumulates on mitochondria in resting <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD MΦ, we performed a ‘mitoFLOW’ experiment as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weindel et al., 2022</xref>. Briefly, mitoTRACKER green stained mitochondria were isolated by passive lysis and centrifugation, stained with a BAX antibody, and analyzed by flow cytometry. MitoTRACKER was used to identify and gate mitochondria and then BAX association was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref> top). We observed a significant increase of BAX protein on mitochondria isolated from resting <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells compared with SCR controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref> bottom). Although our antibody cannot distinguish between BAX and BAX-κ, this data further connects loss of SRSF6 with increased BAX mitochondrial association, which we argue is mainly contributed by the BAX-κ isoform (full-length BAX is predominantly cytosolic in resting cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cosentino and García-Sáez, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We next wanted to see if <italic>Bax-κ</italic> transcript expression correlated with loss of mitochondrial membrane polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

To specifically implicate BAX-κ in this phenotype, we generated C-terminal 2xSTREP-tagged constructs of BAX, BAX-κ, and a BAX point mutant (BAX<sup>G179P</sup>) that is unable to translocate to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuwana et al., 2020</xref>) and introduced them via lentiviral transduction into RAW MΦ cells expressing a doxycycline-inducible transactivator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Because high levels of doxycycline can negatively impact mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dijk et al., 2020</xref>), we experimentally determined the lowest doxycycline concentration that ensured robust and uniform expression of an inducible mCherry construct without significant toxicity (1 μg/mL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). All three of our BAX constructs were expressed in a doxycycline-inducible fashion, albeit to much lower levels than that of a 2xSTREP-GFP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We found that expression of BAX-κ was sufficient to induce robust basal ISG expression in the wild-type RAW doxycycline-inducible cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Importantly, this ISG induction was dose-dependent and seen even at early timepoints post-DOX treatment when BAX-κ ectopic expression is still quite low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). BAX-κ expression was also sufficient to induce apoptosis and cell death, as measured by flow cytometry of PI and annexin V-stained cells at 15 h post-doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) or by PI + incorporation over a 15 hr time-course of doxycycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The accumulation of PI + and annexin V + cells was dependent on the dose of BAX-κ. Unlike the cell death we measured in resting <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD RAW MΦ cells, BAX-κ induced apoptosis and cell death at 15 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) or 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>) post-DOX treatment was largely caspase-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, bottom graphs). We suspect this contrast between <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells and BAX-κ overexpressing cells is due in large part to the timing and dose of BAX-κ: caspase-inhibition had only a slight impact at 5 hr post-DOX, with a reduction of annexin V+/PI- cells from 8.42% to 6.94% (when BAX-κ expression is low), compared with a rescue of annexin V+/PI- cells from 30% to 12.1% at 24 hr (when BAX-κexpression is high) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We predict that high levels of BAX-κ in these overexpression cell lines at later time points induces a level of MOMP that is sufficient to release cytochrome c and activate downstream caspases. When we directly stimulated apoptosis in these cells via low levels of staurosporine (1 μM), BAX and BAX-κ expression induced similar amounts of enhanced cell death relative to GFP or BAX<sup>G179P</sup>-expressing cells, confirming that an activation signal is required for full length BAX to stimulate cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Expression of BAX-κ promotes type I IFN expression and cell death in macrophages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot of strep tagged BAX<sup>G179P</sup>, BAX, and BAX-κ inducible RAW MΦ expressed over a time course after addition of doxycycline (DOX).

Here, we identify the splicing factor SRSF6 as a primary regulator of <italic>Bax</italic> pre-mRNA splicing in murine macrophages. We show that SRSF6-dependent control of the ratio of BAX to BAX-κ isoforms balances critical aspects of innate immune homeostasis in both macrophage-like cell lines and primary macrophages. Specifically, we demonstrate that expression of BAX-κ promotes upregulation of basal type I IFN expression driven by cytosolic mtDNA and renders cells prone to apoptotic cell death. Unlike BAX, which requires a signal to direct mitochondrial targeting and pore formation, BAX-κ is sufficient to trigger type I IFN expression and cell death in resting macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). These findings position BAX-κ as a potential uncoupler of immunostimulatory mitochondrial DAMP release from cell death and suggests that BAX-κ plays a role in promoting the primed antiviral state that innate immune cells, such as macrophages, must maintain. While we cannot completely rule out the potential for other alternatively spliced genes to contribute to <italic>Srsf6</italic>-dependent innate immune and mitochondrial phenotypes, our data support a significant role for <italic>Bax</italic>-κ in these phenomena.</p><p>Connections between SRSF6 and alternative splicing of the cell death protein BAX complement multiple studies that correlate altered SRSF6 expression levels with cancer progression. Our data show that in macrophages, loss of SRSF6 upregulates the pro-apoptotic BAX-κ isoform suggesting that under normal physiological conditions, SRSF6 is a negative regulator of cell death. Consistent with this, upregulation of SRSF6 promotes proliferation of breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2019</xref>), colorectal cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wan et al., 2019</xref>), and lung cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen-Eliav et al., 2013</xref>). Our finding that loss of SRSF6 expression impacts homeostatic levels of IFN-β and ISGs motivates future studies of SRSF6-dependent immune dysregulation in cancer, particularly in cancers of myeloid cells. Perhaps dysregulation of the immune milieu is part of why SRSF6 upregulation is associated with poor cancer outcomes. At the same time, SRSF6 can also promote expression of pro-apoptotic forms of proteins like BIM (BIM-S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hara et al., 2013</xref>) and cassette exon inclusion in the apoptotic factor FAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2022</xref>). These seemingly contradictory roles for SRSF6 in both limiting and promoting apoptotic cell death suggest that its activity could be concentration and/or cell-type dependent.</p><p>Our report that phosphorylation of SRSF6 at S303 promotes <italic>Bax</italic> splicing and limits BAX-κ-dependent apoptotic cell death adds to a growing literature of regulation of gene expression via post-translational modification of splicing factors. Zn(2+)-dependent phosphorylation of SRSF6 has previously been associated with apoptosis via generation of BIM-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hara et al., 2013</xref>) and ubiquitin-mediated control of SRSF6 protein levels has been linked to exon skipping in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Our data support a model whereby SRSF6 is regulated at multiple levels downstream of pathogen sensing, through decreasing transcript abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and differential phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Budzik et al., 2020</xref>). These multiple levels of regulation argue that SRSF6 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> player in the macrophage innate immune response acting as a common signaling molecule to promote a state of antiviral readiness while regulating apoptotic vs. pro-inflammatory cell death. Determining the precise signals that trigger the regulation of SRSF6 in the nucleus downstream of pattern recognition receptors in the plasma membrane and cytosol remain important outstanding questions. Likewise, future experiments that introduce SRSF6 serine mutations directly into the genome will provide additional insight into how post-translational modification alters SRSF6 function in resting vs. activated macrophages.</p><p>Seminal work from White et al. and Rongveux et al. implicates apoptotic caspases in suppressing cGAS-dependent type I IFN expression via mtDNA released by BAX/BAK pores during mitochondrial apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rongvaux et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">White et al., 2014</xref>). One interpretation of their findings is that cells prevent aberrant type I IFN expression by dying; thus, one cannot capture <italic>Ifnb1</italic> expression triggered by BAX/BAK pore formation without inhibiting or genetically ablating caspases. However, our work and that of others, begin to suggest that BAX/BAK release of mtDNA and apoptotic cell death can in fact be uncoupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Riley et al., 2018</xref>). While our RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines are selected for stable KD of SRSF6, only a low percentage of resting KD cells stain PI+ (approximately 5–20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that some threshold of BAX-κ expression needs to be reached before cells undergo cell death. Because our phenotypes are tightly correlated with the degree of <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD, we predict this threshold is maintained in large part by SRSF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Curiously, our data also show that cell death in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD macrophages is caspase-independent and is not concomitant with cytochrome c release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref>). While additional experiments at the single cell level are needed to confirm that <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells can continuously release mtDNA without releasing cytochrome c and triggering apoptosis, the fact that we were able to uncover the <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD basal type I IFN phenotype in the absence of caspase inhibition argues that some degree of uncoupling is indeed at play.</p><p>Consequently, regulation of BAX/BAK pore formation may constitute an unappreciated way for cells to maintain homeostatic levels of IFN signaling, prime antiviral responses, and regulate cell death programs. Indeed, there is growing appreciation that the nature of BAX/BAK pores dictates their ability to release mtDNA and trigger cytosolic DNA sensing. Large BAX/BAK ‘macropores’ that form at late stages of apoptosis have been shown to allow herniation and extrusion of the inner membrane, releasing mtDNA from the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McArthur et al., 2018</xref>). The availability of BAX and BAK and the composition of BAX/BAK pores (BAX vs. BAK vs. BAX/BAK) also manages the rate at which pores extrude mtDNA. Specifically, BAK pores are more immunogenic than BAX pores and enable faster mtDNA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cosentino et al., 2022</xref>). It is tempting to speculate BAX-κ promotes mtDNA release and type I IFN expression by disrupting the balance of BAX and BAK at the mitochondria. This could occur by BAX-κ binding to and sequestering BAX away from BAK, allowing for more BAK pore formation. Alternatively, BAX-κ itself could form pores with BAX and/or BAK that preferentially release mtDNA or BAX-κ could form homo-oliogomeric pores with their own unique properties. Detailed visualization of BAX/BAK pores and mtDNA extrusion in cells genetically engineered to express a single BAX isoform (BAX or BAX-κ) alongside biochemical studies of BAX-κ oligomerization will provide important insights into the properties of this isoform and how it contributes to the innate immune phenotypes we report here.</p><p>Although we are unable to distinguish between BAX and BAX-κ proteins, our flow cytometry experiments with mitoTRACKER stained mitochondria suggest that BAX-κ is constitutively targeted to mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that expression of BAX-κ impacts activation or targeting of normal BAX to mitochondria, perhaps by sequestering a negative regulator of BAX (e.g. BCL2). Future experiments using reagents designed to distinguish the two protein isoforms from each other will help resolve these different models of BAX-κ action in macrophages.</p><p>Our finding that the intracellular bacterial pathogen <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> replicates more efficiently in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD macrophages suggests that maintaining the balance of BAX vs. BAX-κ is needed to restrain bacterial replication and spread. Numerous reports demonstrate that cell death modality usage is a critical factor in determining Mtb pathogenesis. The established paradigm in the Mtb field asserts that apoptosis controls Mtb replication and spread while necrotic cell death promotes it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abarca-Rojano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abebe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aguiló et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behar et al., 2011</xref>). It is curious then, that we observe more Mtb replication and more cell death in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD RAW MΦ(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H and J</xref>). It is possible that SRSF6 contributes to Mtb restriction in BAX-independent ways. It is also possible that basal IFN expression in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD RAW MΦ creates an intracellular milieu that is ill-adapted for destroying intracellular bacteria (but highly efficient at restricting viral replication <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>). Further studies into the precise nature of the cell death that occurs in Mtb-infected <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD RAW MΦ and its reliance on <italic>Ifnb1</italic> may provide important insights into how BAX isoform usage impacts cell-intrinsic control and cell-to-cell spread of pathogens like Mtb.</p><p>Collectively, this work highlights the role of pre-mRNA splicing in shaping the macrophage proteome and demonstrates how disruption of protein isoform stoichiometry can impact mitochondrial homeostasis and the ability of cells to respond to infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></title><p>The Erdman strain was used for all <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infections as well as a luciferase expressing strain.

Total DNA was isolated from 2% of resuspended cells, treated with 25 mM NaOH, boiled for 30 minutes, and then neutralized with 50 mM TRIS pH 8.0. The remainder of the cell suspension was pelleted at 3000 rcf for 5 minutes. Cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μL cytosolic lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 50 μg/mL digitonin, 10 mM EDTA) and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. Cells were spun down at 1000 rcf to pellet intact cells and nuclei that were then used for obtaining the membrane fraction. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and spun down at 15000 rcf to remove additional organelle fragments and transferred to a fresh tube again. Cytosolic protein was obtained by transferring 10% of supernatant to a fresh tube with 6 X sample buffer +DTT and boiled for 5 minutes. Cytosolic DNA was isolated from the remaining supernatant by mixing an equal volume of 25:24:1 phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol, with vigorous shaking followed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at ~21,130 rcf (max speed). The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and DNA was precipitated by mixing with 300 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 μL glycogen, and 3 volumes of 100% ethanol, and then incubated overnight at –80°C. The precipitated DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at max speed for 20 minutes at 4°C. The pellet was washed with 1 mL of cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged for 5 minutes at max speed, and then the pellet was air dried for 15 minutes at RT. The DNA was resuspended with 200 μL DNase free water.

Therefore, we used a minimum of 5 mice per genotype per time point to assess infection-related readouts. For statistical comparison, each experimental group was tested for normal distribution.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all agree this is generally a strong study but they would like to see some further investigation of at least the first of the following two points:</p><p>1) How is Bax involved in mediating the mitochondrial damage? As the reviewers point out, the expression of the kappa isoform seems minimal. This raises questions as to whether the kappa isoform really is doing anything, or is the impact through a reduction in the full length isoform or are other genes also linking SFSR6 depletion to mitochondrial damage.</p><p>2) Can the authors provide more specifics on how mitochondrial damage is linked in this case to the cellular phenotypes of innate immune triggering and cell death. In particular, are caspases involved?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific suggestions:</p><p>1) To strengthen the conclusion regarding the loss of mitochondrial integrity in response to SRSF6 depletion that authors should minimally quantify the number of cells that exhibit the difference shown in Figure 2G, and directly test if the relatively small change in mitochondrial polarization is sufficient to activate cGAS.</p><p>2) To argue that BAX intron retention is relevant to the mitochondrial and ISG phenotypes, the authors need to (a) show that Bax-k is detectable at the protein level in SRSF6 depleted cells and (b) show that expressing only a small amount of Bax-k in the background of full-length Bax (i.e. by ASO or titrating the cDNA expression experiment), as observed upon SRSF6 KD, is sufficient to induce the ISGs.</p><p>3) Given the likelihood that BAX splicing does not explain all of the phenotype, it would be of interest to know more about the other mitochondrial genes that have SRSF6-regulated splicing events (i.e. from Figure 3B). How big are these changes? What is the predicted impact on protein expression? Might any of these work synergistically with BAX?</p><p>4) Similarly, it is important to know if intron retention of BAX causes a change in the protein expression of any other mitochondrial integrity or cell death proteins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The data in Figure 3E-F showing &quot;preferential retention of intron 1&quot; is not compelling. In 3F, there doesn't seem to be more Bax-kappa but rather less Bax. This seems important for interpreting the role of Bax-kappa in promoting cell death. This becomes especially important because in WT cells, Bax-k overexpression induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent (unlike in the SF6 KD), as the authors note. In Figure 5E – they argue that is due to overexpression – it would be helpful to gauge expression of endogenous Bax to overexpressed Bax-K (either by immunoblot or qRTPCR). I'm not convinced it is this isoform of Bax that is critical, although the data showing that the SRSF6 KD phenotype depends on SOME isoform of Bax is more convincing.</p><p>2. There seem to be some discrepancies in the data from figure to figure. For example:</p><p>– Rsad2 expression is significantly increased in the Srsf6 KD in Figure 1, but it is not marked as significantly different in Figure 3L.</p><p>– Numbers of PI+ cells are significantly different between SCR and KD in Figure 4A or 4H but that difference doesn't seem to be reflected in the PI+ population in Figure 4G.</p><p>3. I really liked the approach of using phospho-dead or phospho-mimetic alleles in Figure 6. Although I can see that the data are statistically significant, the overall difference between the phospho-dead and phospho-mimetic alleles in the cell death assays seems modest.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In Fig4A, B, SRSF6 KD cells are sensitized to cell death and the basal π signal is elevated relative to control cells. I was expecting the PI+ signal in Figure 4A, B to increase over time as more SRSF6 KD cells, which are sensitized to death, die over time. However, the signal decreases and plateaus. Can the authors explain this? Are you selecting for a population of cells that eventually have high enough levels of SRSF6 such that they are no longer sensitized to cell death?</p><p>In Figure 4C, D, the authors observe an increase in both PI+ and Annexin V+ signal, which suggest lytic cell death. They concluded that this cell death was caspase independent as it was not abrogated by the use of Q-VD-OPh, a pan caspase inhibitor. In the discussion they comment that apoptosis restricts <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> replication, but that necrotic death potentiates replication. Given that the authors observed <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> replication advantage in SRSF6 KD cells, it suggests that there may be necrotic cell death. However, they never characterize the mechanism of cell death mediated by BAX-kκ biochemically. It would be nice to see western blots for markers of apoptosis such as cleaved PARP and CASP3, as well as markers of lytic death such as GSDMD and GSDME to determine the precise mechanism of death. Additionally, I would suggest using ZVAD-FmK, a pan caspase inhibitor commonly used in the cell death field to test the dependence on caspases. This is an interesting finding and given that not much is known about the caspase independent mitochondria mediate cell death, it's worth the additional characterization, especially since overexpression of BAX-k induced cell death that was inhibited by Q-VD-OPh (Figure 5).</p><p>The western blot in Figure 6B depicting the expression of the SRSF6 variants suggests that the phospho mimetic SRSF6 S303D is not expressed yet they claim this phosphorylation event determines the ratios of BAX and BAX-κ to fine tune the sensitivity to apoptosis. This western blot is not convincing. It might also be worthwhile to include an inducible protein control such as GFP (Figure 6D) which would not be expected to alter the ratio of Bax-kto Bax.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82244.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all agree this is generally a strong study but they would like to see some further investigation of at least the first of the following two points:</p><p>1) How is Bax involved in mediating the mitochondrial damage?

Because Bax-k is a constitutively active form of BAX (supported by our work and through studies of the analogous isoform in humans (Cartron et al., 2005)), it is not surprising that cells don’t express tons of it— any cell that expresses too much Bax-k will likely die. Regardless, we have addressed these valid concerns through changes to the text and through additional experiments, detailed here.</p><p>A. First off, acknowledging reviewers concerns that the mitochondrial phenotypes reported could be contributed to by additional SRSF6-dependent splicing changes, we have added text to the manuscript addressing this caveat on line 436.</p><p>B. To better link mitochondrial phenotypes to Bax-k, we sorted cells using flow cytometry based on their degree of mitochondrial membrane depolarization (as measured by TMRE staining: less TMRE = more depolarization). We then isolated RNA from these cells and measured Bax-k transcripts by RT-qPCR. We found that cells with more mitochondrial membrane depolarization expressed more Bax-k (new Figure 4K). This was even the case with SCR cells—arguing this isoform is associated with mitochondrial instability in wild-type cells. This finding strengthens the link between expression of the Bax-k isoform and the phenotypes we report in our population of <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells.</p><p>C. Also using flow cytometry, we applied a new technique (recently published in Weindel et al., 2022), wherein we isolated mitochondria (based on MitoTracker green staining) from macrophages and then measured the amount of a particular protein enriched on these isolated organelles (we call this mitoFLOW). We did this using endogenous antibodies against total BAX, with the prediction that we would see increased BAX associated with mitochondria in cells expressing more Bax-k, as Bax-k is proposed to constitutively associate with mitochondrial membranes. We measured more BAX+ mitochondria in Srsf6 KD macrophages (vs. SCR) (new Figure 4J) and in Bax-k dox-inducible cells (vs. normal BAX dox-inducible cells) (new Figure 5F).</p><p>This data suggests that Bax-k promotes mitochondrial instability via its propensity to associate with the mitochondrial outer membrane. Because we cannot distinguish between normal BAX and Bax-k in this experiment, we are aware of the possibility that it is not actually Bax-k on these mitochondria and that somehow Bax-k promotes association of normal BAX (perhaps by sequestering a negative regulator of BAX localization). Either way, our conclusions are valid, but we are careful to propose this alternative scenario in our Discussion (line 496).</p><p>D. We also provide additional evidence arguing against <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD phenotypes being the result of loss of normal BAX, including a western blot of total BAX in SCR vs. <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cell lines (new Figure S3C) and data showing a lack of ISG induction if we knockdown total <italic>Bax</italic> in WT RAW 264.7 cells (new Figure 3L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can the authors provide more specifics on how mitochondrial damage is linked in this case to the cellular phenotypes of innate immune triggering and cell death. In particular, are caspases involved?</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesized that the difference in caspase-dependence between the <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells and cells overexpressing BAX-k was largely due to dose of BAX-k and the length of time that cells were exposed to this harmful variant protein. Caspase-independent cell death, while still poorly defined, is thought to result from prolonged, low-level damage to the mitochondrial network. This is precisely the type of mitochondria stress we’d predict occurs in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells, which are a <italic>stable selected</italic> cell line that we investigate under steady-state conditions. In contrast, cells in the dox system go from expressing normal, low levels of Bax-k to expressing appreciable amounts of it over the course of hours. This scenario represents a more acute response that would be predicted to fully engage the apoptotic cascade.</p><p>To attempt to address this experimentally, we decided that expressing as little BAX-k as possible would be the best way to mimic the <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cell lines. Therefore, we repeated our inducible expression experiment at an early (5h) and late (24h) time point after dox addition, using flow cytometry to measure AnnexinV+ and PI- cells at each time point. Consistent with our prediction, we see a dose dependent increase of dead and apoptotic cells as Bax-k accumulates This cell death is more dependent on caspases at the later time point than at the early time point (new Figure S5D). We also see a dose-dependent increase in ISGs as we turn on Bax-k expression (new Figure 5B). These data support a model whereby low, sustained levels of Bax-k levels stress the mitochondria in a way that leads to caspase-independent cell death but a sudden large increase in Bax-k expression is enough to push cells fully into more canonical apoptosis. Additional experiments outside the scope of this manuscript will pursue whether cell death pathways like necroptosis are engaged downstream of Bax-k-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction (although we do report the inflammasome in likely not involved, see Figure S4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific suggestions:</p><p>1) To strengthen the conclusion regarding the loss of mitochondrial integrity in response to SRSF6 depletion that authors should minimally quantify the number of cells that exhibit the difference shown in Figure 2G, and directly test if the relatively small change in mitochondrial polarization is sufficient to activate cGAS.</p></disp-quote><p>Because IFN-b acts in a powerful autocrine fashion through IFNAR, we are unable to specifically demonstrate “cell-intrinsic” cGAS activation in cells with mitochondrial depolarization—all of the <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells in a culture will be exposed to higher levels of IFN-b in the supernatants so all cells will express ISGs and have some degree of IRF3/STAT1 activation, etc. But we interpret the heart of your question to be an interest in correlating Bax-k expression with the phenotypes we report in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells. To this end, we used flow cytometry to sort SCR and <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD macrophages based on TMRE signal, a measure of mitochondrial membrane polarization. Then we isolated RNA from cells in each “bin” and measured Baxk transcript by RT-qPCR. As seen in new Figure 4K, we show that Bax-k expression is higher in cells with the greatest loss of membrane potential (lowest TMRE). This finding strengthens the link between expression of the Bax-k isoform and the mitochondrial depolarization phenotypes we report in our population of <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To argue that BAX intron retention is relevant to the mitochondrial and ISG phenotypes, the authors need to (a) show that Bax-k is detectable at the protein level in SRSF6 depleted cells and (b) show that expressing only a small amount of Bax-k in the background of full-length Bax (i.e. by ASO or titrating the cDNA expression experiment), as observed upon SRSF6 KD, is sufficient to induce the ISGs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have definitely tried to detect endogenous Bax-k by western blot and cannot convince ourselves that we are truly visualizing the isoform. Because Bax-k is a constitutively active, proapoptotic protein, we think it makes sense that cells will express a very limited amount of it (any cell expressing too much will die). We know this is the case because our dox-inducible cells expressing Bax-k start to die a few hours post induction. Equally frustrating is the fact that we can’t selectively knockdown Bax-k at the RNA level without potentially impacting full length Bax: the coding sequence of Bax-k is identical to the <italic>Bax</italic> pre-mRNA (they differ only through retention of intron 1 so any RNA-based targeting could impact both isoforms).</p><p>Determined to address your concern experimentally, we turned to our inducible Bax/Bax-k system and repeated our “sufficiency” experiments over a time-course of dox induction. Even at early time points post-induction (6h) when Bax-k is just barely detectable, we can start to see accumulation of ISGs and cell death (Figures 5B, S5D). We believe this better recapitulates the situation in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells. Also, showing dose-dependence strengthens our argument that Baxk is the major driver of our phenotypes.</p><p>We also repeated our total Bax KD experiment, this time including data to show that knockdown of total Bax only rescues ISG expression in an <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD background (and not in normal WT RAW 264.7 cells) (new Figure 3K-L). This result also helps argue that <italic>Bax</italic> alternative splicing is the major driver of mitochondrial instability and ISG expression in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given the likelihood that BAX splicing does not explain all of the phenotype, it would be of interest to know more about the other mitochondrial genes that have SRSF6-regulated splicing events (i.e. from Figure 3B). How big are these changes? What is the predicted impact on protein expression? Might any of these work synergistically with BAX?</p></disp-quote><p>Absolutely, there are many other alternative splicing changes induced by loss of SRSF6 that may contribute to the phenotypes in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD macrophages. We are of the opinion that the sufficiency experiments in Figure 5 and Bax KD rescue experiments in Figure 3K provide pretty strong support that Bax-k is the major player but we cannot rule out other events contributing. Because experimentally investigating additional splicing events is outside the scope of this manuscript, we have added text to explicitly state that we cannot for sure conclude that Bax-k is the only driver of mitochondrial instability and cell death in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD macrophages (line 436).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Similarly, it is important to know if intron retention of BAX causes a change in the protein expression of any other mitochondrial integrity or cell death proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. We’ve measured the abundance of two additional mitochondrial factors at the protein level (VDAC1 and TOM20) and do not measure major differences in their abundance in SCR vs. <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD. We have added this to Figure S2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Because each <italic>Bax</italic> pre-mRNA synthesized by RNAPII will either be processed into <italic>Bax</italic> or Bax-k it does conceptually make sense that more Bax-k = less normal <italic>Bax</italic> (ignoring the obvious caveat of mRNA stability), but we do not think that loss of <italic>Bax</italic> drives our phenotypes. We actually tested if <italic>Bax</italic> KD in WT cells could recapitulate phenotypes in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells and observed no change to ISG expression (new data, Figure 3L). Likewise, overexpression of normal BAX in our dox-inducible system had almost no impact on ISG expression or cell death (which makes sense: in the absence of an apoptosis inducing signal, full length BAX is not active) (Figure 5C-D). In new data, using an antibody against all endogenous BAX, we isolated mitochondria and quantified BAX+ mitochondria in SCR and <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells (as well as in the BAX/Bax-k inducible cells). We observe a considerable increase in BAX association with mitochondria in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells and in Bax-k expressing cells, compared to SCR or normal BAX expressing cells. This new data supports a model wherein Bax-k is constitutively associated with mitochondrial membranes, resulting in mitochondrial membrane instability and mtDNA leakage.</p><p>Re: your concern about the caspase-dependency—this always puzzled us too. We hypothesized that the difference between the <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD phenotype and the overexpression of Bax-k was largely due to dose and timing. Caspase-independent cell death, while still poorly defined, is thought to result from prolonged, low-level damage to the mitochondrial network (Tait and Green 2008). This is precisely the type of mitochondrial stress we’d predict occurs in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells, which are a <italic>stable selected</italic> cell line.

You can rest assured that all our phenotypes were consistently replicated over and over during the 2+ years we spent on this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I really liked the approach of using phospho-dead or phospho-mimetic alleles in Figure 6. Although I can see that the data are statistically significant, the overall difference between the phospho-dead and phospho-mimetic alleles in the cell death assays seems modest.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the phenotypes in the phosphomutant cell lines are modest. But we also like the idea of the macrophage using phosphorylation to regulate SRSF6 function so we chose to include the data, mainly as a starting point for future experiments. Admittedly, our experimental system here is not ideal as we are comparing overexpression of WT SRSF6 to overexpression of the phosphomutants on top of endogenous SR6. Future experiments that probe the function of these phosphorylations in a cell line in which serine mutations have been directly engineered into the genome would most certainly yield clearer results. We explicitly point out the shortcomings of our experimental design in line 460 and how we’d like to pursue it in future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In Figure 4A, B, SRSF6 KD cells are sensitized to cell death and the basal π signal is elevated relative to control cells.

Are you selecting for a population of cells that eventually have high enough levels of SRSF6 such that they are no longer sensitized to cell death?</p></disp-quote><p>Good point! Showing the data in Figure 4A as a time course is confusing. Since no</p><p>stimulus/apoptosis inducing agent is added to the cells, we wouldn’t expect an increase in cell death over a 20h time course. These are just our resting <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cell lines and we’re measuring π incorporation at steady state (after we select them, the population stays pretty happy for about 3 weeks and then we toss them and rederive). We’ve replaced 4A and 4B with data for a single time point, which is less confusing, since we are measuring steady state π levels in both cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4C, D, the authors observe an increase in both PI+ and Annexin V+ signal, which suggest lytic cell death. They concluded that this cell death was caspase independent as it was not abrogated by the use of Q-VD-OPh, a pan caspase inhibitor. In the discussion they comment that apoptosis restricts M. tuberculosis replication, but that necrotic death potentiates replication. Given that the authors observed M. tuberculosis replication advantage in SRSF6 KD cells, it suggests that there may be necrotic cell death. However, they never characterize the mechanism of cell death mediated by BAX-kκ biochemically. It would be nice to see western blots for markers of apoptosis such as cleaved PARP and CASP3, as well as markers of lytic death such as GSDMD and GSDME to determine the precise mechanism of death. Additionally, I would suggest using ZVAD-FmK, a pan caspase inhibitor commonly used in the cell death field to test the dependence on caspases. This is an interesting finding and given that not much is known about the caspase independent mitochondria mediate cell death, it's worth the additional characterization, especially since overexpression of BAX-k induced cell death that was inhibited by Q-VD-OPh (Figure 5).</p></disp-quote><p>Because only a small proportion of <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells show signs of cell death at any one time (Figure 4C), we had no luck using bulk assays like western blot to measure cell death pathway events. In the future, we can think about sorting out populations of AnnexinV+/PI- cells to enrich for cells that are actually undergoing this transition.</p><p>Re: your concern about the caspase-dependency—this always puzzled us too. We hypothesized that the difference between the <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD phenotype and the overexpression of Bax-k was largely due to dose and timing. Caspase-independent cell death, while still poorly defined, is thought to result from prolonged, low-level damage to the mitochondrial network. This is precisely the type of mitochondria stress we’d predict occurs in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells, which are a <italic>stable selected</italic> cell line. In contrast, cells in the dox system go from expressing normal, low levels of Bax-k to expressing appreciable amounts of it over the course of hours—this probably constitutes are more acute stress to the cells and pushes them fully into caspase-dependent cell death. We predicted that expressing as little Bax-k as possible would best mimic the <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cell lines so we repeated our inducible expression experiment at an early (6h) and late (24h) time point after dox addition, using flow cytometry to measure AnnexinV+ and PI- cells at each time point. Consistent with our prediction, we see dose dependent increase of apoptotic cell death as Bax-k accumulates and this cell death is more dependent on caspases at the later time point than at the early time point (Figure S5D).</p><p>Following your suggestion, we treated <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD and SCR cells with another caspase inhibitor, zVAD-FMK, and found that it also did not rescue cell death in <italic>Srsf6</italic> KD cells, similarly to QVDOPH. We added this data to Figure S4D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The western blot in Figure 6B depicting the expression of the SRSF6 variants suggests that the phospho mimetic SRSF6 S303D is not expressed yet they claim this phosphorylation event determines the ratios of BAX and BAX-κ to fine tune the sensitivity to apoptosis. This western blot is not convincing. It might also be worthwhile to include an inducible protein control such as GFP (Figure 6D) which would not be expected to alter the ratio of Bax-kto Bax.</p></disp-quote><p>That original western blot was not the best. We have included another repeat of the western to better illustrate that SRSF6 S303D mutant is indeed expressed upon induction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
