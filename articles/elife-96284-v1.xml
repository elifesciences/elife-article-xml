The role of RNA metabolism in shaping the cellular response to stress is vital, yet the global changes in RNA stability under these conditions remain unclear. In this work, we employ direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5ʹ end adapter ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at single-molecule and -nucleotide resolution. By developing a statistical framework to identify robust RNA length variations in nanopore data, we find that cellular stress induces prevalent 5ʹ end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, we show that stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on deadenylation or decapping. We observed that RNAs undergoing decay are predominantly enriched in the stress granule transcriptome while inhibition of stress granule formation via genetic ablation of G3BP1 and G3BP2 rescues RNA length. Our findings reveal RNA decay as a key component of RNA metabolism upon cellular stress that is dependent on stress granule formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stress response</kwd><kwd>cell line</kwd><kwd>RNA decay</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA AG000696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maragkakis</surname><given-names>Manolis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cellular stress induces RNA decay that depends on stress granule assembly and is mediated by XRN1, independent of poly(A) tail and 5' cap removal.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells respond to stress by triggering extensive transcriptome remodeling to restore cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galluzzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Payea et al., 2023</xref>). Cellular stress responses have been under intense study as the capacity of cells to activate adaptive pathways deteriorates with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Derisbourg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haigis and Yankner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maragkakis et al., 2023</xref>) and has been associated with many diseases, particularly age-related neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckman and Ames, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stadtman and Berlett, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The response to different stressors converges at the induction of the integrated stress response (ISR), a common adaptive molecular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>) that induces phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) to inhibit translation initiation and decrease global protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinnebusch, 1994</xref>). In turn, mRNAs exiting the translational pool get localized in stress granules (SGs), membraneless organelles that are formed upon stress when translation of mRNAs gets arrested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>). SGs comprise several different types of biomolecules, particularly mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, but their precise functions in mRNA storage or decay are not yet fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Kedersha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcelo et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Short- and long-read sequencing following tagging of RNA 5ʹ ends has revealed that RNA content in cells is a mix of intact RNA molecules and RNA decay intermediates that exist in a transient, partially degraded state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibrahim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>). However, much less is known about the global transcriptome-wide state of RNA under stress and whether stress leads to RNA decay or stabilization. Evidence has been found in both directions, with stress having been associated with mRNA stabilization in a translation-dependent and -independent way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gowrishankar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilgers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horvathova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kharel et al., 2023</xref>). On the other hand, in yeast, ribosomal and other RNA-binding proteins, which under certain physiological conditions contact mRNAs to facilitate translation, show diminished mRNA association under heat shock stress and decreased mRNA abundance mediated by the 5′–3′ exoribonuclease Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bresson et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, under oxidative stress, deletion of Xrn1 can lead to the accumulation of oxidized RNAs bearing nucleotide adducts such as 8-oxoguanosine (8-oxoG), in turn inhibiting translation and triggering No-Go decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we globally profile the integrity of individual RNA molecules in human cells under stress by full-length direct RNA sequencing with nanopores. We develop a new computational framework for statistical interrogation of RNA decay at single-molecule and -nucleotide resolution. We find that upon cellular stress RNAs globally exhibit marked shortening at their 5′ end. This stress-induced decay is mediated by XRN1, but is not dependent on prior deadenylation or decapping, as classical models would posit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Passmore and Coller, 2022</xref>). Importantly, we find that the decaying RNA molecules are preferentially enriched in the SG transcriptome. Prevention of SG formation by ablation of cells for G3BP1 and G3BP2 rescues RNA length upon stress, suggesting SG formation as a required step for stress-induced RNA decay. Our results identify 5ʹ RNA decay as a hallmark of cellular stress response that defines the transcriptome and that is dependent on SG formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stress induces widespread decay at the 5ʹ end of RNAs</title><p>To explore the state of RNA under stress, we treated HeLa cells with sodium arsenite (0.5 mM) for 60 min to induce oxidative stress. We verified the formation of SGs and increased eIF2α phosphorylation (discussed in subsequent sections) and monitored cell viability up to 4 hr after treatment with no major change observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We collected arsenite-treated and untreated cells and performed direct RNA-seq with the TERA-seq protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Direct RNA-seq profiles RNA at single-molecule resolution without cDNA conversion or PCR amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Workman et al., 2019</xref>) while TERA-seq additionally incorporates unique adapters that are ligated to the 5ʹ phosphorylated end of individual RNA molecules. These adapters are then sequenced along with the native RNA sequence. Nanopore-based direct RNA sequencing proceeds in the 3ʹ to 5ʹ direction; thus. the inclusion, and subsequent computational identification of an adapter, at the 5ʹ end of a read acts as internal control, ensuring an RNA molecule has been sequenced in its entirety. Notably, TERA-seq does not biochemically select for ligated molecules; thus, the resultant sequencing datasets comprise both ligated and non-ligated molecules. Ligated molecules can be computationally recognized and separated to be analyzed jointly or independently to nonligated reads. Samples were prepared in biological triplicates and sequenced on a MinION device, yielding approximately 2 million long reads per library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Replicates displayed high expression correlation and high alignment efficiency to the human genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Consistent with oxidative stress induction, differential gene expression analysis identified several stress response genes being upregulated in arsenite while gene ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed expected associations to cellular response to stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

To test this finding for individual transcripts (‘transcript’ hereafter refers to the annotated loci of a gene isoform), we calculated a metric for transcript length corresponding to the average length of reads of each transcript. We again found that RNAs from stressed cells were globally shorter than in unstressed cells, independent of both transcript differential expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and coding potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d and e</xref>). To exclude potential library preparation artifacts or failure to capture long transcripts by the sequencing device, we repeated the analysis by computationally selecting only reads with ligated 5′ adapters, ensuring RNA molecules were fully sequenced. The subset of 5′ adapter-ligated reads confirmed our findings and again showed global RNA shortening upon oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Since both ligated and nonligated reads showed comparable results, all reads were used in subsequent analysis to increase sequencing depth, unless otherwise mentioned.</p><p>To test whether the observed stress-induced RNA shortening was independent of pre-existing steady-state fragmentation levels, we performed analyses in a length-normalized space (meta-length) that represents read length as a percent of annotated transcript length. We calculated normalized meta-length by splitting each annotated transcript in 20 equal bins, assigning the mapped read ends into individual bins, and defining the transcript meta-length as the difference of the 5ʹ and 3ʹ end bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Our data showed a consistent reduction of transcript meta-length upon oxidative stress, independent of steady-state unstressed fragmentation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). This finding remained consistent when only selecting reads with an identified poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>).</p><p>To exclude potential confounding effects of arsenite itself, we further tested oxidative stress induction with 0.3 mM hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for 2 hr followed by TERA-seq. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress also resulted in significant transcript shortening (Mann–Whitney: p-value&lt;10<sup>–96</sup>), similar to that observed with arsenite, indicating that oxidative stress results in RNA shortening irrespective of inducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>). To explore whether RNA shortening is unique to oxidative stress, we re-examined publicly available direct RNA-seq data for human K562 cells that were subjected to heat shock at 42°C for 60 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maier et al., 2020</xref>). Our results showed that heat-shocked cells also had significantly shorter RNAs compared to unstressed cells (Mann–Whitney: p-value&lt;10<sup>–76</sup>), again independently of differential expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1i and j</xref>). Additionally, we also observed RNA shortening in mouse embryonic fibroblasts 3T3 cells treated with sodium arsenite, suggesting an evolutionary conserved process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1k and l</xref>).</p><p>To identify transcripts with statistically significant RNA length changes, we developed NanopLen, a tool that uses linear mixed models, and modeled the library as a random effect to adjust for variation across replicates. To test the model, we simulated sequencing data over varying RNA shortening proportions and expression counts. The simulated data showed that the model accurately predicted the true length difference for each tested shortening proportion and had a well-controlled false-positive rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). As expected, NanopLen reported lower significance for smaller length differences while higher expression counts resulted in higher statistical power on simulated data. We subsequently employed NanopLen to compare unstressed and arsenite-treated cells and identified 2730 significantly shortened transcripts (p-value&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

Therefore, we anticipated that our method would only be able to capture fragmentation occurring at the 5ʹ end of RNAs. As expected, significantly shortened transcripts showed that their 3ʹ templated end was almost identical in oxidative stress and unstressed conditions, whereas the corresponding 5ʹ end was heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Quantification at the transcriptome-wide level further confirmed this observation (Mann–Whitney p-value&lt;10<sup>–256</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). To validate our sequencing results, we performed RT-qPCR analysis using pairs of primers targeting regions along each transcript. We found that arsenite-treated cells had substantially reduced amplification from primer pairs closer to the 5ʹ end of the transcript than near the 3ʹ end compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We reasoned that RNA shortening at the 5ʹ end should also be reflected in short-read RNA-seq as reduction in read coverage at the 5ʹ end of RNAs. We thus reanalyzed data from HEK293 cells treated with a battery of stressors, that is, 42°C heat shock for 1 hr; 0.6 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 2 hr; and 300  µM NaAsO<sub>2</sub> for 2 hr followed by short-read RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watkins et al., 2022</xref>). Our analysis showed that, compared to unstressed, all stress conditions resulted in significantly reduced read coverage at the 5ʹ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we considered the possibility that selection of alternative transcription start sites (TSSs) downstream of annotated TSSs could be contributing to RNA shortening. We have previously established that positions with high read density upstream of coding sequences in TERA-seq accurately represent TSSs matching those defined by CAGE-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>). We used this method to independently calculate TSSs in stress and unstressed conditions in our HeLa data. Our results showed nonsignificant changes between conditions (Mann–Whitney: p-value=0.35) with no preference toward shorter or longer transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), indicating that the observed shortening is not affected by TSS selection. Collectively, our results, although not excluding 3ʹ end decay for molecules not sequenced due to lack of a poly(A) tail, provide strong evidence for stress-induced decay occurring at the 5ʹ end of RNA molecules harboring poly(A) tails.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stress-induced RNA decay is XRN1-mediated but independent of deadenylation</title><p>XRN1 is the primary 5ʹ to 3ʹ exonuclease in cells, and thus a likely candidate for mediating 5ʹ transcript shortening upon stress following decapping or endonucleolytic fragmentation.

However, the RNA molecules we sequenced and found shortened still had a poly(A) tail, as this is required for dRNA-seq. This argued that removal of the poly(A) tail was not necessary for stress-induced 5ʹ end shortening. To systematically assess the role of deadenylation and decapping, we first downregulated the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex by expressing a GFP-fused catalytically inactive form of the CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 8 (NOT8* D40A, E42A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2019</xref>) in HeLa cells, followed by arsenite treatment and dRNA-seq. Expression of the dominant negative NOT8* form was confirmed by epifluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and resulted in an expected increase in poly(A) tail length compared to control GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). As hypothesized, our results identified significant 5ʹ shortening upon stress following expression of the dominant negative NOT8* (Mann–Whitney, p-value&lt;10<sup>–299</sup>), suggesting that deadenylation by the CCR4-NOT complex was indeed not required for stress-induced 5ʹ RNA decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p><p>These results raised the possibility that decapping may also not be required for stress-induced decay. To test this, we expressed a GFP-fused catalytically inactive form of the mRNA-decapping enzyme 2 (DCP2), DCP2* E148Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loh et al., 2013</xref>) in HeLa cells followed by dRNA-seq. Expression of DCP2* was confirmed by epifluorescence, though it was less pronounced than that of NOT8* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Interestingly, transcripts from DCP2*-expressing cells presented a similar significant (Mann–Whitney, p-value&lt;10<sup>–127</sup>) 5ʹ shortening upon oxidative stress as GFP control cells, suggesting that the canonical decapping pathway is also not necessary for stress-induced RNA decay, and thus likely involves an endonucleolytic cleavage event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).

To test the role of translation initiation inhibition and ribosome run-off upon stress on stress-induced decay, we treated cells with the ISR inhibitor (ISRIB) that bypasses the effect of eIF2α phosphorylation and facilitates translation initiation under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rabouw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>).

ΔΔG3BP1/2 cells inhibit SG condensation in response to arsenite and other stressors. Treatment of WT U-2 OS cells with arsenite showed a highly significant and global shortening of RNA upon stress (Mann–Whitney, p-value&lt;10<sup>–307</sup>) in stark contrast to ΔΔG3BP1/2 cells that showed substantially less shortening (Mann–Whitney, p-value&lt;10<sup>–5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1g and h</xref>). Further comparison of ΔΔG3BP1/2 and WT U-2 OS showed that inhibition of G3BP1/2-mediated SG formation rescued RNA length to the level of unstressed WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1i and j</xref>). These results indicate that G3BP1/2-mediated SG formation is required for stress-induced RNA decay. Alternatively, SGs could be protective of shortened RNAs that otherwise would be rapidly eliminated from cells. Under this assumption, stress-shortened RNAs identified in WT cells would be expected to be depleted in ΔΔG3BP1/2 cells during stress. A comparison of differentially expressed transcripts upon arsenite treatment in ΔΔG3BP1/2 cells showed no association with WT shortening, indicating that in the absence of SGs these RNAs are not rapidly eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bley et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively our results show that G3BP1/2-dependent SG formation is required for stress-induced RNA decay.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cellular response to stress is critical for cell recovery or induction of apoptosis if stress cannot be resolved. Recent works have delineated many of the biochemical pathways involved in stress responses. However, the full-length state of RNA under cellular stress remains incompletely characterized. In this work, we used TERA-seq, a protocol that involves the ligation of unique adapters at the 5ʹ end of RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>) to address a key limitation in nanopore direct RNA sequencing – the inability to consistently capture the 5ʹ end of sequenced RNA molecules. By sequencing RNA molecules end-to-end, we show that stress triggers decay at the 5′ end of RNAs. Interestingly our results show that stress-induced 5ʹ end decay leaves ‘scars’ that can also be identified in traditional short-read RNA-seq as decreased read density at the 5ʹ end of transcripts.</p><p>Our findings highlight XRN1 as an essential component for stress-induced decay, in the absence of which the RNA length is largely rescued. However, contrary to the traditional decay model, evaluation of the shortened RNAs did not reveal a dependency on deadenylation or decapping. Instead, our data point towards endonucleolytic cleavage as the most likely mechanism for the initial cut on RNA, generating either a 5ʹP directly recognized by XRN1 or a 5ʹOH that is subsequently phosphorylated to become a substrate for XRN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Navickas et al., 2020</xref>). Our analysis showing that transcript shortening is suppressed by treatments that increase ribosome occupancy (ISRIB and cycloheximide) also suggests that this putative endonucleolytic cut is likely not due to No-Go decay or a related ribosome quality control pathway since these decay mechanisms are guided to cleavage sites by ribosome collisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doma and Parker, 2006</xref>). However, it is currently unknown whether a mechanistic link exists with other co-translational decay pathways, such as ribothrypsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibrahim et al., 2018</xref>), that also initiate by endonucleolysis. More studies will be needed to dissect the exact molecular events involved in this mechanism. Recent studies have found sporadic fragments of 3' UTRs as products of No-Go decay occurring at the sites of translation termination in oxidative stress, development, and brain aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sudmant et al., 2018</xref>). While most stress-induced decay fragments are longer than 3' UTRs and are not confined to translation termination sites, it is possible that some shorter fragments could also be contributing to an accumulation of 3' UTRs under these conditions.</p><p>Short coding sequences and low GC content were found as features of transcripts that are subject to stress-induced decay, arguing that there may be a component of structural stability to the specificity of 5' end shortening. Low GC content appears to also be a determinant for RNA recruitment to SGs, as also confirmed in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khong et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with these observations, our data show that the SG transcriptome is significantly enriched for stress-induced shortened RNAs. In fact, our results show that the formation of the SGs is required and indispensable for stress-induced decay as genetic ablation of G3BP1/2 rescues RNA length to the level of nonstressed controls. Inhibition of the ISR to reinitiate translation and dissolve SGs also curtails stress-induced RNA decay, further supporting a critical role for SG formation in stress-induced RNA decay perhaps through tethering with P-bodies, dynamically linked with SGs under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moon et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The primary function of the ISR is to inhibit translation initiation and preserve energy for cell recovery during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). While the physiological role of stress-induced RNA decay is currently unknown, it is intriguing to hypothesize that it evolved as a mechanism to further reduce translational load during stress. Endonucleolytic cleavage and removal of RNA 5ʹ ends could provide an orthogonal strategy to dial down translation, with several benefits: rapid elimination of translation initiation sites, degradation of nonessential RNAs, release of ribosomes for stress response translation, and energy conservation. Future studies to test these hypotheses will be required, especially considering the emerging significance of SGs and RNA metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferrucci et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ripin and Parker, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Each simulation was parameterized with a ‘true’ transcript length, a read count as a proxy for transcript expression, and a shortening proportion. The database of known human genic lengths from Ensembl (release 91) was used and the median was selected as ‘true’ length. Since the simulated variance is in proportion of the true length, using any length will result in similar results, so we do not simulate additional true lengths. Expression counts were simulated, ranging from 10 to 200 reads per transcripts to capture the dynamic expression range particularly toward small read depth. Varying shortening percentages were simulated from 50 to 100% of the true length, with the 100% corresponding to the null simulation of no-change.</p><p>Given the parameters, the simulated lengths were generated based on the mixed model in NanopLen, with the number of sampled lengths being the selected expression counts.

This decay, however, is dependent on XRN1 and enriched in the stress granule transcriptome. Notably, inhibiting stress granule formation in G3BP1/2-null cells restores the RNA length to the same level as wild-type.

That said, it appears that the authors at times overinterpret the data they get from a handful of direct RNA sequencing experiments. To bolster some of the statements additional experiments might be desirable.</p><p>A selection of comments:</p><p>(1) Considering that the authors compare the effects of stress, stress granule formation, and XRN1 loss on transcriptome profiles, it would be desirable to use a single-cell system (and validated in a few more). Most of the direct RNAseq is performed in HeLa cells, but the experiments showing that stress granule formation is required come from U2OS cells, while short RNAseq data showing loss of coverage on mRNA 5'ends is reanalyzed from HEK293 cells. It may be plausible that the same pathways operate in all those cells, but it is not rigorously demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that performing all experiments in a single cell system would be desirable. Presently, our core findings on 5’ RNA shortening are all performed in HeLa cells: the identification of 5’ RNA shortening, the reliance of shortening through XRN1 silencing, suppression of shortening by translation inhibition, and now the relationship between 5’ shortening and deadenylation/decapping through experiments described further below. Our use of other cell lines is primarily to show that 5’ shortening is a general phenomenon, and we have now done this for U20S cells, HEK293 cells, and primary 3T3 cells from mouse.</p><p>Regarding stress granule formation, we are unfortunately restricted by the lack of available well characterized resources. The DDG3BP1/2 U2OS is a well characterized cell line that has been extensively used for stress granule-related experiments. We have therefore opted to use it and performed experiments to verify both the occurrence of stress-induced RNA shortening as well as the rescue in the absence of stress granules. The reproducibility and breadth of the cell lines used in our analysis makes us confident on the generality of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) An interesting finding of the manuscript is that polyA tail shortening is not observed prior to transcript shortening. The authors would need to demonstrate that their approach is capable of detecting shortened polyA tails. Using polyA purified RNA to look at the status of polyA tail length may not be ideal (as avidity to oligodT beads may increase with polyA tail length and therefore the authors bias themselves to longer tails anyway). At the very least, the use of positive controls would be desirable; e.g. knockdown of CCR4/NOT.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. Previous studies, using in vitro transcribed RNA molecules, have shown that direct RNA sequencing can capture and quantify poly(A) tails of varying lengths (Krause et al. 2019). Specifically, a range of 10 to 150 nt has been tested and a high concordance between known and dRNA-Seq determined values was observed. Both tailfindR and nanopolish (used in this work) showed high poly(A) tail estimation accuracy.</p><p>Regardless, we agree with the reviewer that our method depends on poly(A) tail capture and thus may be incomplete for fully quantifying poly(A) length changes. We therefore opted to replace these data and instead follow this and other reviewers’ suggestions and perform experiments following knockdown of CCR4/NOT using cells expressing a catalytically inactive CNOT8 (CNOT8*) dominant negative mutant (Chang et al. 2019). Our new data show that stress-induced 5’ end decay is indeed not dependent on prior removal of the poly(A) tail. Specifically, we find that transcript shortening is still observed upon oxidative stress in cells expressing CNOT8* compared to control cells. We present these new results in Fig. 3 and Sup. Fig 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors use a strategy of ligating an adapter to 5' phosphorylated RNA (presumably the breakdown fragments) to be able to distinguish true mRNA fragments from artifacts of abortive nanopore sequencing. This is a fantastic approach to curating a clean dataset. Unfortunately, the authors don't appear to go through with discarding fragments that are not adapter-ligated (presumably to increase the depth of analysis; they do offer Figure 1e that shows similar changes in transcript length for fragments with adapter, compared to Figure 1d). It would be good to know how many reads in total had the adapter. Furthermore, it would be good to know what percentage of reads without adapters are products of abortive sequencing. What percentage of reads had 5'OH ends (could be answered by ligating a different adapter to kinasetreated transcripts). More read curation would also be desirable when building the metagene analysis - why do the authors include every 3'end of sequenced reads (their RNA purification scheme requires a polyA tail, so non-polyadenylated fragments are recovered in a nonquantitative manner and should be discarded).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating our approach. The reviewer is correct that we do not discard reads that are not adapter-ligated. As the reviewer correctly mentions this is to increase the sequencing depth. We have found that the ligation efficiency is very low, ~1-2 % of total reads (now in Sup. Table. 1), across all libraries, and so the percentage of REL5-ligated reads does not directly infer the total amount of non-artifactual 5’ ends. Instead, we use these REL5-ligated reads as a subset of our data for which we have extremely high confidence in the true 5’end. Our results show that non-ligated reads display the same length distribution as ligated ones, and that the results are reproducible regardless of read selection (e.g. Fig. 1c, e, Sup. Fig. 1k, l, Fig. 3b, c). This strong concordance between REL5-ligated and non-ligated reads suggests that our conclusions on 5’ end shortening are not substantially influenced by abortive sequencing or other artefactual creation of 5’ shortening. We have modified the text to clarify these points and have added plots using only ligated molecules for relevant figures that this was not previously done (Sup. Fig 1l, 3c)</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that non-polyadenylated reads could be discarded from metagene analysis and we have performed this change in the revised version. Our conclusions following removal of non-polyadenylated reads remain unchanged (Sup. Fig. 1g).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors should come to a clear conclusion about what &quot;transcript shortening&quot; means. Is it exonucleolytic shortening from the 5'end? They cannot say much about the 3'ends anyway (see above). Or are we talking about endonucleolytic cuts leaving 5'P that then can be attached by XRN1 (again, what is the ratio of 5'P and 5'OH fragments; also, what is the ratio of shortened to full-length RNA)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have performed additional experiments to investigate the role of deadenylation and decapping by expressing dominant negative forms of the NOT8 deadenylase (NOT8*) and DCP2 decapping (DCP2*) enzyme in HeLa cells. Our results show that neither expression of NOT8* nor DCP2* can inhibit stress-induced transcript shortening following arsenite treatment (Fig. 3e-f). These new data suggest that neither deadenylation nor decapping are required for stress-induced RNA decay. Instead, our data are more compatible with endonucleolytic cleavage as the most likely mechanism for stressinduced RNA decay. We have incorporated these results in the text and present them in Fig. 3 and Sup. Fig. 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors should clearly explain how they think the transcript shortening comes about. They claim it does not need polyA shortening, but then do not explain where the XRN1 substrate comes from. Does their effect require decapping? Or endonucleolytic attacks?</p></disp-quote><p>Please also refer to our answer to the previous comment (#4). Collectively, our results from (a) the dominant negative expression of NOT8* and DCP2* that show no effect on stress-induced shortening and (b) the rescue of transcript length upon translation initiation inhibition, indicate a potential endonucleolytic mechanism as a mediator of stress-induced RNA decay. However, we believe that extensive, further studies currently beyond the scope of this work, will be required to discover the nuclease and to dissect the exact molecular mechanisms that define the 5' ends of mRNAs upon stress-induced decay. We now discuss these points in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) XRN1 KD results in lengthened transcripts. That is not surprising as XRN1 is an exonuclease - and XRN1 does not merely rescue arsenite stress-mediated transcript shortening, but results in a dramatic transcript lengthening.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an intriguing point. Additional analysis of data has showed that in fact, in unstressed cells, XRN1 KD leads to modestly significant reduction in overall transcript length (Fig. 3b, c). This could possibly be the result of an accumulation of intermediate cleavage products normally expected to be degraded by XRN1 as previously described (Pelechano, Wei, and Steinmetz 2015; Ibrahim et al. 2018).</p><p>Instead, we find that under stress, XRN1 KD shows an almost identical transcript length distribution to unstressed cells and significantly higher than siCTRL stressed cells (Fig. 3b, c). These results indicate that in the absence of XRN1, stress-induced decay is largely abolished. As the reviewer correctly points out, this seems to affect the majority of RNAs which we believe is evidence of the general lack of specificity in the mechanism. Nevertheless, we find that transcripts that are the primary substrates to stress-induced shortening are substantially more lengthened than all other transcripts (Fig. 3e). This indicates that transcripts primarily affected by stress-induced decay are also lengthened the most in the absence of XRN1 and at an even higher level than expected by general XRN1 KD effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The work by Dar et al. examines RNA metabolism under cellular stress, focusing on stressgranule-dependent RNA decay. It employs direct RNA sequencing with a Nanopore-based method, revealing that cellular stress induces prevalent 5' end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy but is independent of the shortening of the poly(A) tail. This decay, however, is dependent on XRN1 and enriched in the stress granule transcriptome. Notably, inhibiting stress granule formation in G3BP1/2-null cells restores the RNA length to the same level as wild-type. It suppresses stress-induced decay, identifying RNA decay as a critical determinant of RNA metabolism during cellular stress and highlighting its dependence on stress-granule formation.</p><p>This is an exciting and novel discovery. I am not an expert in sequencing technologies or sequencing data analysis, so I will limit my comments purely to biology and not technical points. The PI is a leader in applying innovative sequencing methods to studying mRNA decay.</p><p>One aspect that appeared overlooked is that poly(A) tail shortening per se does lead to decapping. It is shortening below a certain threshold of 8-10 As that triggers decapping. Therefore, I found the conclusion that poly(A) tail shortening is not required for stress-induced decay to be somewhat premature. For a robust test of this hypothesis, the authors should consider performing their analysis in conditions where CNOT7/8 is knocked down with siRNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We have now performed experiments in cells expressing a well characterized catalytically inactive dominant negative NOT8 isoform (NOT8*) (Chang et al. 2019). Our new data show that stress-induced decay still occurs in cells expressing NOT8*.</p><p>These results confirm our findings that stress-induced decay does not require deadenylation. We present these new results in Fig. 3 and Sup. Fig. 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, as XRN1 requires decapping to take place, it necessitates the experiment where a dominant-negative DCP2 mutant is over-expressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have performed this experiment as requested. Expression of a dominant negative DCP2 (DCP2*) isoform (Loh, Jonas, and Izaurralde 2013) in HeLa cells showed that decapping is also not required for stress-induced decay. We present these new results in Fig. 3 and Sup. Fig. 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are G3BP1/2 stress granules required for stress-induced decay or simply sites for storage? This part seems unclear. A very worthwhile test here would be to assess in XRN1-null background.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. Our data show that stress-induced decay is not observed in DDG3BP1/2 U2OS cells, unable to form stress granules (Fig. 6). This result suggests that G3BP1/2 SGs are either (a) required for 5’ RNA shortening or (b) preserve partially fragmented RNAs that would otherwise be rapidly degraded. We find the second option unlikely for two reasons. First, even if the fragments were rapidly degraded, we would still expect to find evidence of their presence in our data. However, Fig. 6f shows that the length distribution of DDG3BP1/2 U2OS cells, with and without arsenite, are almost identical, thus arguing against the presence of such a pool of rapidly degrading RNAs. Second, if these RNAs were protected by SGs, then they would be expected to be downregulated in the absence of SGs in DDG3BP1/2 U2OS cells treated with arsenite. Our results contradict this hypothesis as no association is found between the level of downregulation in arsenite-treated DDG3BP1/2 U2OS cells and the observed stress-induced fragmentation in WT. Collectively our results point towards G3BP1/2 stress granules being required for stress-induced decay. We have expanded on these points in the manuscript to clarify.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors speculate that the mechanism of stress-induced decay may have evolved to relieve translational load during stress. But why degrade the 5' end when removing the cap may be sufficient? This returns to the question of assessing the role of decapping in this mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a very interesting point. Our new results, following expression of dominant negative DCP2, show that stress-induced decay does not require decapping. It is therefore plausible that a stress-induced co-translational mechanism cleaves mRNAs endonucleolyticaly to reduce the translational load. Such a mechanism would have many functional benefits as it would acutely reduce the translational load, degrade non-essential RNAs, preserve energy and release ribosomes for translation of the stress response program. We have expanded the discussion to mention these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>As you can see from the comments, although the reviewers appreciate the novelty of your findings, there was a consensus opinion from all reviewers that the authors overinterpreted their data, since they only have one assay and did not fully analyze it, as laid out in one of the reviewer's critiques. Some orthogonal validation of the &quot;groundbreaking&quot; claims is necessary. Examination of the effects of upstream events in 5'-to-3' decay, namely deadenylation, and decapping, would be necessary for a better understanding of the phenomena the authors describe. Many tools and approaches for studying this are described well in the literature (CNOT7-KD, dominant negative DCP2 E148Q, XRN1-null cell lines), so it is well within the authors' reach. Overall, while some of the evidence presented is novel and solid, for some of the claims there is only incomplete evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and the editor for their comments and suggestions. We have performed several additional experiments to further support our conclusions. We have notably investigated the role of deadenylation and decapping in the stress-induced decay by expressing dominant negative NOT8 and DCP2, respectively, as suggested. Our results show that neither deadenylation nor decapping is necessary for stress-induced transcript shortening, suggesting an endonucleolytic event. We believe that these additional experiments strengthen the main conclusions of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) The experiments were conducted in two unrelated cell lines, HeLa and U2OS. The authors should determine if the 5'end RNA decay in response to stress is also observed in normal human cells such as normal human diploid fibroblasts. Furthermore, it would be important to know if this mechanism is conserved between human and mouse cells. This can be tested in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have now also performed experiments in the mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH 3T3 cell line. Our new results confirm that stress-induced 5’ end RNA decay is also observed in this primary cell line and is conserved between human and mouse (Sup. Fig. 1k, I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors state that they monitored cell viability up to 24 hours after Arsenite treatment, but the data is shown up to 240 min (Suppl. 1a). Also, the Y-axis label of this Figure is &quot;Active cells (%)&quot;. This should be changed to &quot;Live cells (%)&quot; if this is what they are referring to.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for identifying this mistake. Cell viability was monitored up to 4 hours after arsenite treatment. We have corrected the text and modified the figure according to the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Based on direct Nanopore-based RNA-seq the authors surprisingly found that RNAs in oxidative stress were globally shorter than unstressed cells. Since Nanopore-based RNA-seq will not detect RNAs that lack a poly A-tail, are they not missing out on RNAs that have already started getting degraded due to the loss of a poly A-tail? Also, I am not sure if they used a spikein control which would be critical to claim global changes in RNA expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our strategy does not capture RNA molecules without a poly(A) tail. Nevertheless, our data do identify shortening upon stress at the 5’ end of RNAs that include poly(A) tails. We considered this as direct evidence that decay at the 5’ end does not require prior removal of the poly(A) tail. Otherwise, these molecules would not have been captured and observed. Indeed, our newly added data from cells expressing a well characterized catalytically inactive dominant negative NOT8 isoform (Chang et al. 2019) show that stress-induced decay occurs even upon silencing of the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex. We present these results in Fig. 3 and Sup. Fig 3.</p><p>We would like to clarify that in our results we did not use a spike-in control and thus refrain from claiming global changes in RNA expression. Instead, we compare relative ratios of groups of molecules within libraries that are internally normalized, we perform correlative comparisons that are invariant to normalization and we perform differential gene expression using established normalization schemes such as DESeq2 (Love, Huber, and Anders 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Many graphs are confusing and inconsistent. For example, samples for Nanopore RNA-seq were prepared in triplicates. Biological or technical? The schematic in Figure 1a shows ISRIB but it appears from Figure 4 onwards. It is missing in the Figure 1 results and the Figure legend. The X-axis labels of many graphs are confusing. For example, Supplementary Figure 1d, 1e, 1g and 1h. It says transcript length but are these nucleotides? P-values are missing from many of these graphs. For some graphs, the authors compared Unstressed vs Arsenite (Figure 1), but in other panels they state No Ars vs 0.5 mM Ars (Fig. 3a) or Control vs Ars (Figure 5c). Likewise, in Figure 1b, Expression change (log2) is unstressed vs Arsenite or Arsenite vs unstressed?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer identifying these inconsistencies in the presentation of our results. The replicates for nanopore RNA-seq experiments were biological. We have now clarified this point in the text. Furthermore, we have removed “ISRIB” from Fig. 1a to avoid any confusion. We have also made our labelling across all figures more consistent using ‘unstressed’ for NO arsenite treatment vs “arsenite” or ‘+ Ars’ for arsenite treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors transfected cells with siCTRL or siXRN1 using electroporation and treated the cells 72 hours after transfection. Since XRN1 is an essential gene, it would be important to determine the viability of cells 72 hours after transfection. Along these lines, in Figure 3b, it would be important to determine the effect of XRN1 knockdown in unstressed cells. Currently, there are only 3 comparisons in Figure 3b - unstressed, siCTRL + Ars and siXRN1 + Ars, and this is insufficient to conclude the effects of XRN1 knockdown in the presence of Arsenite.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have updated Fig. 3b and the text to show the requested conditions: siCTRL and siXRN1 with and without arsenite. While XRN2 is an essential gene for many organisms, XRN1 is not essential in mammalian cells and no increased cell death has been reported for XRN1-KO or –KD cells (Brothers et al. 2023). We have also tested different concentration (up to 40 nM) of siRNA and monitored the cells up to five days after transfection without observing any cell toxicity, as previously reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) More broadly, the whole study is somewhat descriptive. The biological effect of 5'end mRNA shortening on gene expression is unclear. There is no data indicating how these changes in RNA lengths impact protein expression. Global quantitative proteomics would be critical to determine this.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. To address this concern we have performed additional experiments using cells expressing catalytically inactive forms of NOT8 (Chang et al. 2019) and DCP2 (Loh, Jonas, and Izaurralde 2013) to inhibit deadenylation and decapping.</p><p>These experiments provide additional mechanistic details for 5’ shortening and suggest endonucleolytic cleavage as a critical step (Fig. 3 and Sup. Fig. 3). We agree that it would be interesting to study the fate of these shortened transcripts notably regarding translation. However, given the complexity of the expected proteome changes also following global translation arrest under stress (Harding et al., 2003; Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016), we think that this work is beyond the scope of this manuscript and will be the subject of future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) Some of the affected RNAs can be validated in HeLa and other cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have performed RT-qPCR on 3 different mRNAs that present 5’ shortening upon oxidative stress using different primers located along the mRNA. We hypothesized that the closer the primer set is located to the 5’ end, the less abundant the corresponding region would be for arsenite-treated compared to untreated cells. Our results show indeed that the measured level of these mRNAs depends on the location of the primer sets used for the qPCR, the closer to the 5’end it is, the less abundant the mRNA is upon oxidative stress compared to control cells. We present these data as well as a schematic representing the positions of the primers in Sup. Fig. 2d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should check whether XRN1 also co-localizes in SGs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have performed immunofluorescence on U2OS and HeLa upon oxidative stress and did not observe a co-localization of XRN1 with TIA-1, a marker of stress granules (see below). These results are consistent with (Kedersha et al. 2005) that have shown that XRN1 mainly co-localizes to processing bodies and are very weakly detectable in SGs in DU145 cells. We think that this result is beyond the scope of this study and thus decided to only include it for the reviewers.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Representative immunofluorescence merged image of HeLa (left panel) and U2OS (right panel) cells treated with sodium arsenite and labelled with anti-TIA1 (red), anti-XRN1 (green) antibodies and DAPI (blue).</title><p>Scale bar 50 µm.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96284-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) XRN1 should be knocked down with more than one siRNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.
