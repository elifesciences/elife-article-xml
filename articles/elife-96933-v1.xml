non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) while blocking homologous recombination (HR). Surprisingly, several eukaryotic species lack SHLD1, SHLD2, and SHLD3 orthologs, suggesting that Rev7 may leverage an alternative mechanism to regulate the double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice. Exploring this hypothesis, we discovered that <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rev7 physically interacts with the Mre11–Rad50–Xrs2 (MRX) subunits, impedes G-quadruplex DNA synergized HU-induced toxicity, and facilitates NHEJ, while antagonizing HR. Notably, we reveal that a 42-amino acid C-terminal fragment of Rev7 binds to the subunits of MRX complex, protects <italic>rev7∆</italic> cells from G-quadruplex DNA-HU-induced toxicity, and promotes NHEJ by blocking HR. By comparison, the N-terminal HORMA domain, a conserved protein–protein interaction module, was dispensable. We further show that the full-length Rev7 impedes Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities without affecting the latter’s ATP-binding ability. Combined, these results provide unanticipated insights into the functional interaction between the MRX subunits and Rev7 and highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism by which Rev7 facilitates DSB repair via NHEJ, and attenuation of HR, by blocking Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>non-homologous end-joining</kwd><kwd>Rev7</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG/2021/000082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muniyappa</surname><given-names>Kalappa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SP/CSIR/425/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muniyappa</surname><given-names>Kalappa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of genetic and biochemical approaches suggest that yeast Rev7 promotes DNA double-strand break repair via NHEJ and inhibits homologous recombination by blocking Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A hallmark of low fidelity DNA polymerases, also known as DNA translesion synthesis polymerases (TLS polymerases), with no detectable proofreading activity, is their ability to catalyse DNA synthesis across a variety of bulky, helix-distorting DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Prakash et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Vaisman and Woodgate, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maiorano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ling et al., 2022</xref>). The TLS polymerases are also involved in a plethora of cellular processes, including but not limited to epigenetics, immune signaling, viral mutagenesis, and cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). Indeed, translesion DNA synthesis is a source of mutagenesis, potentially contributing to the development of cancer and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lange et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baranovskiy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pilzecker et al., 2019</xref>). The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> TLS Polζ (henceforth referred to as ScPolζ) is a four-subunit enzyme, comprised of catalytic subunit Rev3, two regulatory subunits of Rev7, and the accessory subunits Pol31 and Pol32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Makarova et al., 2012</xref>). Current evidence suggests that the error rate during ScPolζ-catalyzed replication of undamaged DNA templates is much higher than that of DNA polymerases, as it lacks 3′-to-5′ proofreading exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lawrence et al., 1985a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lawrence et al., 1985b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Northam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kochenova et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this, <italic>S. cerevisiae rev3</italic>, <italic>rev7</italic>, or <italic>pol32</italic> mutant strains show greatly reduced spontaneous mutation frequencies, driving the notion that ScPolζ promotes DNA damage-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Quah et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lawrence et al., 1985a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lawrence et al., 1985b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morrison et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nelson et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Makarova and Burgers, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The TLS Polζ exists in a wide range of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, including fungi, plants, and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maiorano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ling et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). While the catalytic subunit Rev3 alone is capable of replicating damaged DNA, Rev7 enhances its catalytic efficiency by 20- to 30-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Quah et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morrison et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nelson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Makarova and Burgers, 2015</xref>) and the accessory subunits Pol31 and Pol32 further raise it by 3- to 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Makarova et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that they abet the processivity of translesion DNA synthesis by Polζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bezalel-Buch et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, Rev7 (also known as MAD2B and MAD2L2) is an adapter protein, which acts as a bridge between Rev3 and Rev1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haracska et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kikuchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pustovalova et al., 2012</xref>). Various structural and biochemical investigations have uncovered unique structural features of Polζ, wherein its subunits interact with each other to form an highly proficient, multi-subunit TLS holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gómez-Llorente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Malik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Du Truong et al., 2021</xref>). The high-resolution cryo-EM structures of ScPolζ holoenzyme have revealed that the subunits Rev3, Rev7, Pol31, and Pol32 assemble into a pentameric ring-shaped structure in which they are maintained by a chain of uninterrupted protein–protein interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gómez-Llorente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Malik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Du Truong et al., 2021</xref>). Precise details of how Polζ holoenzyme achieves its substrate specificity have not been fully understood. Shedding light on this, A. Aggarwal’s lab has recently provided insights into the mechanism by which the active site of ScPolζ responds to the A:C mismatched duplex DNA distortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Malik et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>A flurry of research has documented that the tetrameric Shieldin complex – comprising REV7, SHLD1, SHLD2, and SHLD3 – binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), blocks 5′ end resection and homologous recombination (HR), antagonizes the recruitment of BRCA1 to the double-strand break (DSB), while facilitating non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boersma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mirman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Findlay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Tomida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Noordermeer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Investigations have also shown that the N-terminus of SHLD3 interacts with REV7 using a stereotypical ‘safety-belt’ interaction mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Tomida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Noordermeer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clairmont et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dai et al., 2020</xref>). In the alternative pathway, Shieldin-53BP1-RIF1 counteracts DSB resection and subsequent repair by recruiting the CST-Polα-primase complex to promote fill-in at the resected DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mirman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mirman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mirman et al., 2023</xref>). The cells derived from Fanconi anemia patients carrying homozygous mutations in <italic>REV7</italic> display hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, accumulate chromosome breaks during S/G2 phase and increased p21 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bluteau et al., 2016</xref>), revealing its critical role in providing protection against FA disease. Some studies have identified non-canonical functions of Rev7/MAD2L2: for example, it binds to and sequesters CDH1, an activator of APC/C, thus prevents premature anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Listovsky and Sale, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Vaisman and Woodgate, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ling et al., 2022</xref>). However, a mechanistic understanding of how Rev7 regulates cell cycle events and how such roles differ or relate to its role in TLS remains underexplored. Although the emphasis of the findings differ, the fact that Rev7 functions as an anti-resection factor has spurred a new wave of experiments on DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clairmont and D’Andrea, 2021</xref>).</p><p>At DSBs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Mre11–Rad50–Xrs2 (MRX) in conjunction with Sae2 first catalyses endonucleolytic cleavage of 5′-terminated DNA strands and then its 3′→5' exonucleolytic activity produces a short 3′-ssDNA overhang, which is followed by resection in a 5′→3′ direction by either Exo1 or Dna2–Sgs1 complex to produce long tracks of ssDNA that are critically important for HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>). As such, the mechanism by which cells restrain over-resection of DSBs remains incompletely understood, although hyper-resection could potentially hinder optimal HR and trigger genomic instability. Surprisingly, however, Shieldin orthologs are absent in different organisms such as yeast, fruit fly, nematode worm, zebrafish, and frog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</xref>), raising the crucial question whether the Rev7-mediated regulation of DSB repair pathway choice is evolutionarily conserved in the single-cell eukaryotic organisms such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. With these observations, we hypothesized that Rev7 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (hereafter referred to as ScRev7) may recruit an unknown functional equivalent(s) of Shieldin orthologs to regulate the DSB repair pathway choice between HR and NHEJ. Thus, an alternative mechanism might involve the MRX complex on the basis of current knowledge that it plays multiple roles in signaling, processing, and repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>). In this study, we provide robust evidence that ScRev7, via its 42-amino acid C-terminal fragment in the ‘safety belt’ region, physically interacts with the Mre11, Rad50, or Xrs2 subunits, protects <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells from G-quadruplex DNA/HU-induced toxicity and facilitates DSB repair via NHEJ while antagonizing HR. Mechanistic studies revealed that ScRev7 binds to the MRX subunits with sub-micromolar affinity, attenuates Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities, without affecting the ability of the latter to bind ATP. Collectively, our study establishes a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism of regulation of DSB repair, revealing how Rev7 regulates the pathway choice between HR and NHEJ in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ScRev7 interacts with the MRX subunits</title><p>As noted above, studies in cancer cells have shown that the Rev7–Shieldin effector complex facilitates NHEJ by blocking 5′ end resection and HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boersma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mirman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Findlay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>). Since there are no identifiable Shieldin orthologs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</xref>), we began our investigations with a hypothesis that Rev7 may recruit alternative factors such as the MRX subunits to block HR and enable NHEJ. To this end, yeast two-hybrid assay (Y2H) was leveraged for the purpose of studying binary protein–protein interactions between ScRev7 and the subunits of MRX complex, whereas in follow-up studies we mapped the minimal region of ScRev7 required for its association with the MRX subunits. The yeast strain PJ69-4A was co-transformed with plasmids (prey vectors) encoding the Mre11, Rad50, or Xrs2 subunits fused to GAL4 activation domain and ScRev7 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (bait vector). The positive colonies were selected on SC/-Trp-Leu-His dropout nutrient medium containing 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fields and Song, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">James et al., 1996</xref>). Remarkably, we found interactions between Rev7 and the Mre11, Rad50, and Xrs2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), whereas cells bearing empty vector and a plasmid expressing Mre11, Rad50, or Xrs2 subunits did not. Consistent with results from prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rizzo et al., 2018</xref>), yeast cells transformed with prey and bait vectors expressing Rev7 showed robust growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating the assembly of Rev7 homodimers, which served as a positive control. In an analogous experiment, cells co-transformed with bait and prey vectors expressing Rev7 and Sae2, respectively, failed to grow in different strain backgrounds (bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), indicating lack of binary interaction between Sae2 and Rev7.

Similarly, deletion of the C-terminal 150–203 amino acid residues of ScRev7 abrogated yeast cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results indicate that the C-terminal 42-residue segment of ScRev7 is critical for its interaction with the MRX subunits. To further confirm these results, a Y2H experiment was carried out with cells co-expressing 42 aa peptide and the Mre11, Rad50, or Xrs2 subunits. Such an analysis showed that the ScRev7’s 42 residue peptide alone was sufficient for interaction with each subunit of the MRX complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, it remained possible that the inability of cells expressing the C-terminally truncated variants of ScRev7 (with appropriate prey proteins) to grow in selection medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref><italic>,</italic> bottom panel) may be due to altered expression or decreased abundance of truncated species. To explore this possibility, whole-cell lysates derived from cells expressing the N- and C-terminally truncated variants, tagged with c-Myc epitope at the N-terminus, were resolved by SDS–PAGE and probed with anti-c-Myc antibody. Reassuringly, the results revealed comparable levels of N- and C-terminally truncated species of ScRev7 in the whole-cell lysates of strains that were employed for Y2H analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Models predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer reveal that Mre11 and Rad50 subunits independently associate with Rev7</title><p>To further characterize the interaction between the MRX subunits and ScRev7, a structure prediction algorithm, AF2-multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evans et al., 2022</xref>), was leveraged to construct structural models of ScRev7–Mre11 and ScRev7–Rad50 heterodimers. The models with the high predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) scores were considered for further analysis. Strikingly, the models indicated that Mre11- and Rad50-binding surfaces overlap with ScRev7, suggesting that the latter can bind these subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the model of Rev7–Mre11 complex, residues Asp 206 and Ile 240 in the Rev7 C-terminal ‘safety belt region’ (green) mediate dimerization with Mre11 through residues Asp 131 and Arg 181. Interestingly, His 127 in the Rev7 N-terminal HORMA domain also contribute its binding to Asp 131 of Mre11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Furthermore, modeling studies of Rev7–Rad50 complex showed that the ScRev7 C-terminal residues Lys 168, Glu 184, Asn 189, and Asp 188 mediate dimerization with ScRad50 via residues Glu 577, Lys 596, and Arg 603 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Curiously, the AF2-multimer models also revealed that amino acid residues outside of the 42-residue fragment also contribute to pairwise interactions between Rev7 and the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits, although Y2H assays did not identify such interaction. Indeed, similar findings have been previously noted for several other interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">You et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koegl and Uetz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoff et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The Rev7’s C-terminal 42-residue fragment mitigates the G-quadruplex-HU-induced toxic effects</title><p>Several studies have documented the genome-wide prevalence of G-quadruplex DNA structures in various organisms ranging from viruses to humans, which play regulatory roles in diverse cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rhodes and Lipps, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Spiegel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yadav et al., 2021</xref>).

A similar analysis showed that <italic>ura3-1</italic> strain and the same strain expressing ScRev7-42 amino acid peptide, but not Rev7-C1 variant, displayed a very few, and small Ura3<sup>+</sup> papillae. As expected, Ura3<sup>+</sup> papillae formation was not observed in the <italic>ura3-1</italic> strain carrying the empty vector.

Thus, we envision that the absence of Ura3<sup>+</sup> papillae in the <italic>ura3-1</italic> strain (with or without empty vector) in the presence of HU might be related to Rev7-mediated suppression; whereas their absence in cells that lack functional Mre11 nuclease could be due to HU-induced toxicity.

In addition, we present robust evidence that ScRev7 impedes Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities, without affecting the latter’s ability to bind ATP. When seen from a teleological perspective, our work is conceptually reminiscent of Shieldin complex-mediated suppression of 5′ end resection and repair of DSBs via NHEJ by blocking HR in human cancer cells. It remains plausible that this alternative mechanism of DSB repair pathway choice in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> might be conserved across multiple species.</p><p>Historically, <italic>REV7</italic> was discovered as playing an important role in DNA damage-induced mutagenesis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lemontt, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lawrence et al., 1985a</xref>). Further investigations showed that Rev7 associates with Rev3 and functions as a regulatory subunit of eukaryotic TLS DNA polymerase Polζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Prakash et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maiorano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ling et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). While Rev7 has no known enzymatic activity, it acts as a versatile scaffolding protein with pleiotropic functions in diverse cellular processes including, but not limited to, epigenetics, immune signaling, viral mutagenesis and cancer development that were initially considered inconceivable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Decottignies, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Krijger et al., 2021</xref>). However, little is known about the nature of specific effector(s) that associate with Rev7 and regulate DSB repair pathway choice in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> As we discuss below, our work convincingly demonstrates that ScRev7 physically interacts with the individual subunits of MRX complex and regulates their activities. In line with this, MST-based protein–protein interaction assays, supported by AF2-multimer modeling, imply tight association between the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits and ScRev7. It is interesting to note that Sae2, which cooperates with the MRX complex to initiate DNA end resection, does not associate with Rev7, suggesting interaction specificity between MRX subunits and Rev7.</p><p>However, an intriguing inquiry arises regarding whether the MRX subunits exist as separate entities in the cell. Although, to our knowledge, the existence and relative amounts of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric species of MRX subunits in vivo are unknown, current evidence suggests that both Mre11 and Rad50 subunits independently bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Stracker and Petrini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Paull, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casari et al., 2019</xref>). Other studies have shown that MRX complex binds and tethers DNA ends, which is thought to be required for DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Trujillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cassani et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, while data obtained from co-immunoprecipitation experiments implicate that Mre11, Rad50, and Xrs2 subunits exist as a hetero-trimeric complex in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Usui et al., 1998</xref>), in vitro experiments have shown the formation of dimeric Mre11–Rad50 and trimeric MRX complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Oh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2017</xref>). Collectively, these results allow us to postulate that the monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric species of MRX subunits might exist in a dynamic equilibrium under in vivo conditions.</p><p>Given that Rev7 and MRX complexes play essential roles in DNA repair pathways, our findings provide novel insights into how ScRev7 interacts with the MRX subunits and regulates their functions. Of note, structure–function analyses showed that deletion of 42-amino acid segment (203–245) at the extreme C-terminus of ScRev7 abolished its ability to interact with the MRX subunits, whereas loss of the N-terminal HORMA domain, an evolutionarily conserved protein–protein interaction module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Muniyappa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rosenberg and Corbett, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Krijger et al., 2021</xref>) had no discernible effect on their interactions. Curiously, further analysis indicated that the 42-amino acid peptide alone was sufficient to bind to the subunits of MRX complex and regulate the DSB repair pathway choice between NHEJ and HR. Reciprocally, future work will be required to determine the regions/domains of MRX subunits that interact with ScRev7 for a comprehensive understanding of the crosstalk between these components. Work is currently in progress to gather insights into these questions.</p><p>The data from MST-based protein–protein interaction assays informed that ScRev7 binds to the MRX subunits with sub-micromolar affinity, analogous to the interaction between HORMA-domain protein hMAD2 and hCDC20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Piano et al., 2021</xref>). How might ScRev7 attenuate the function of Mre11 and Rad50 subunits? Our finding indicate that nanomolar amounts of ScRev7 besides attenuating the Mre11 nuclease activity also impedes Rad50’s ATPase activity without obstructing the ability of the latter to bind ATP. While the specific nuances of the interaction await further research, we surmise that physical interaction between ScRev7 and the Mre11/Rad50 subunits might contribute to the observed effects. Although we provide compelling Y2H data that the C-terminal 42-amino acid peptide of Rev7 is critical for binding to the MRX subunits and protect cells from G4 DNA-HU-induced toxicity, and regulate the pathway choice between NHEJ and HR; however, we could not demonstrate its function in vitro because of technical difficulties associated with its expression and purification. By comparison, we found that the Rev7-C1 variant, which lacks the ability to interact with the MRX subunits in Y2H assays, was capable of blocking, albeit partially, the catalytic activities of Mre11 and Rad50 subunits in vitro. A parsimonious explanation would be that amino acid residues in the Rev7-C1 fragment might be involved in pairwise interactions between ScRev7 and the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits, as seen in AlphaFold2 models. Conversely, the 42-amino acid fragment as a part of whole protein might act as a lid to block the residues in the Rev7-C1 fragment, thereby enabling it to function effectively as a single site for binding to the MRX subunits in Y2H assays. Future studies are required to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Many lines of evidence indicate that G-quadruplex-forming motifs are measurably enriched at certain functional regions in the genomes of all organisms, from humans to plants to microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huppert and Balasubramanian, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castillo Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lejault et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, G-quadruplex structures modulate diverse cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, translation, and are associated with certain diseases, characterized by high rates of chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rhodes and Lipps, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Spiegel et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, we found that <italic>rev7</italic>Δ mutant cells harbouring exogenous G-quadruplex-forming motifs exhibit hypersensitivity to HU-induced genotoxic stress and cell death. This is consistent with emerging evidence that DNA replication stress induced by G-quadruplex structures play a prominent role in triggering genomic instability, which is exacerbated in the presence of HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sato and Knipscheer, 2023</xref>). Although the precise mechanism remains unclear, it is tempting to speculate that Rev7 may recruit G4-resolving helicase(s) such as Sgs1 and Pif1 to unwind G-quadruplex structures prior to or during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Paeschke et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, or in addition, it might generate G4 DNA intermediates which may be processed or cleaved by specific enzymes, including Mus81, Sgs1, or Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Regairaz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sun et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghosal and Muniyappa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ghosal and Muniyappa, 2007</xref>). Regardless, our data align with the notion that G-quadruplex structures are endogenous sources of replication stress and their formation and persistence may lead to genomic instability and cell death.</p><p>As mentioned above, Shieldin complex facilitates NHEJ-dependent DSB repair, while inhibiting DNA end resection and HR in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clairmont and D’Andrea, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). Since 5′ end resection is the primary step in HR-mediated DSB repair, we hypothesized that physical interaction between ScRev7 and MRX subunits might block resection of DNA termini, and then facilitate NHEJ-dependent DSB repair instead of HR. Consistent with this premise, we found that ScRev7 promotes NHEJ by blocking HR. However, other regulatory components may also play a role in modulating the levels of NHEJ versus HR-mediated DSB repair. For instance, TRIP13 or p31<sup>comet</sup> inhibits the interaction of Rev7 with the SHLD3 subunit and regulates DNA end resection at DSBs and promotes their repair by HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sarangi et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, interaction between Rev7 and putative binding partners may be regulated by posttranslational modifications and chromatin accessibility under changing physiological conditions.</p><p>Although the mechanism underlying Rev7-mediated regulation of DSB repair between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human cancer cells indicate broad similarities, specific variations exist, including striking differences. A fundamental difference between the human cancer cells and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is that, while ScRev7 robustly interacts with and suppresses the biochemical activities of both Mre11 and Rad50 subunits to facilitate NHEJ, Rev7–Shieldin complex acts as a downstream effector of 53BP1-RIF1 in restraining DNA end resection to promote NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clairmont and D’Andrea, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). Furthermore, hRev7 interacts with the SHLD3 subunit via the HORMA domain, which is entirely dispensable in the case of ScRev7. Thus, we posit that the Shieldin complex-mediated regulation of DSB repair pathway choice might be a source of evolutionary innovation as an additional layer of regulation. In summary, our data provide novel insights into the alternative mechanism underlying the regulation of DSB repair pathway choice in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains, DNA plasmids and oligonucleotides</title><p>All strains and primers used for the construction of strains/plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e and f</xref>, respectively.

Following reduction, alkylation buffer (55 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate) was added and samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were treated with 10 ng trypsin (Mass spectrometry-grade, Sigma-Aldrich, India), at 37°C for 12 hr. The peptides were eluted with 70% acetonitrile (300 μl) containing 0.1% trifluoracetic acid, and the samples were dried in speed vacuum and the pellet was resuspended in 40 μl resuspension buffer (2% acetonitrile in LC–MS grade Milli-Q). Samples (10 μl) were injected into the Orbitrap Fusion tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, USA). Samples were run for 110 min using a nano-spray ionization source and static spray voltage. Ions were detected by Orbitrap detector at 60,000 resolution using quadrupole isolation. Daughter ions were detected by Ion Trap detector using quadrupole isolation mode. Following data acquisition, peptide spectrum matches and percentage peptide coverage were obtained for the samples.

At this stage, cells were synchronized at G2/M phase by adding nocodazole (10 μg/ml) and HO expression was induced by adding 2% galactose to the cell culture. For each time point, 20 ml samples were collected for each strain and 0.1% sodium azide was added immediately. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The bead-beating step was used for isolation of genomic DNA from the resuspended pellets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amberg et al., 2005</xref>). Samples were incubated with 10 units of StyI-HF and XbaI-HF (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA) in a reaction mixture containing 15 μg of genomic DNA (gDNA), 1× CutSmart buffer at 37°C for 7 hr.

While the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> does not have homologs to SHLD1-3, it does have Rev7, which was identified to function in conjunction with Rev3 in the translesion DNA polymerase zeta. Testing the hypothesis that Rev7 also affect DSB resection in budding yeast, the work identified a direct interaction between Rev7 and the Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex by two-hybrid and direct protein interaction experiments. Deletion analysis identified that the 42 amino acid C-terminal region was necessary and sufficient for the 2-hybrid interaction. Direct biochemical analysis of the 42 aa peptide was not possible. Rev7 deficient cells were found to be sensitive to HU only in synergy with G2 tetraplex forming DNA. Importantly, the 42 aa peptide alone suppressed this phenotype. Biochemical analysis with full-length Rev7 and a C-terminal truncation lacking the 42 aa region shows G4-specific DNA binding that is abolished in the C-terminal truncation and with a substrate containing mutations to prevent G4 formation. Rev7 lacks nuclease activity but inhibits the dsDNA exonuclease activity of Mre11. The C-terminal truncation protein lacking the 42 aa region also showed some inhibition suggesting the involvement of additional binding sites besides the 42 aa region. Also, the Mre11 ssDNA endonuclease activity is inhibited by Rev7 but not the degradation of linear ssDNA. Rev7 does not affect ATP binding by Rad50 but inhibits in a concentration-dependent manner the Rad50 ATPase activity. The C-terminal truncation protein lacking the 42 aa region also showed some inhibition but significantly less than the full-length protein. Using an established plasmid-based NHEJ assay, the authors provide strong evidence that Rev7 affects NEHJ, showing a four-fold reduction in this assay. The mutations in the other Pol zeta subunits, Rev3 and Rev1, show a significantly smaller effect (~25% reduction). A strain expressing only the Rev7 C-terminal 42 aa peptide showed no NHEJ defect, while the truncation protein lacking this region exhibited a smaller defect than the deletion of REV7. The conclusion that Rev7 supports NHEJ mainly through the 42 aa region was validated using a chromosomal NHEJ assay. The effect on HR was assessed using a plasmid:chromosome system containing G4 forming DNA. The rev7 deletion strain showed an increase in HR in this system in the presence and absence of HU. Cells expressing the 42 aa peptide were indistinguishable from wild type as were cells expressing the Rev7 truncation lacking the 42 aa region. The authors conclude that Rev7 suppresses HR, but the context appears to be system-specific and the conclusion that Rev7 abolished HR repair of DSBs is unwarranted and overly broad.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript with well-executed experiments which suggest that Rev7 inhibits MRX-mediated resection to favor NEHJ during DSB repair. This finding is novel and provides insight into the potential mechanism of how the human Shieldin complex might antagonize resection.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The nuclease experiments were conducted using manganese as a divalent cation, and it is unclear whether there is an effect with the more physiological magnesium cation. The data largely support the conclusions, although the effect of Rev7 on HR is less well documented, as only a highly specialized assay is used that does not warrant the broad conclusion drawn. Specifically, the results that the Rev7 c-terminal truncation lacking the 42 aa region still suppresses HR is unexpected and unexplained.</p><p>In this revision the authors addressed most of my concerns by text revisions and addition of new data.</p><p>The new two hybrid data showing that the 42 amino acid segment interacts with MRN are valuable. However, it may not be clear to which subunit the 42 aa segment binds, as in the yeast 2H system the chromosomally encoded subunits are present or were the 2H experiments conducted in an MRN deletion background?. This could be acknowledged.</p><p>The material and methods section was updated to indicate use of 5 mM MnCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2 in the exonuclease assay but not the endonuclease assay. Please check if this is correct. Why the difference between both assays? There is a concern that the absence of ATP and Mg affects the endonuclease assay.</p><p>The addition of Dmc1 as a specificity control for the ATPase inhibition is nice and shows a specific effect. The use of Sae2 associated nuclease activity as a specificity control for the nuclease inhibition is problematic. There has been considerable debate about the Sae2 associated nuclease activity, which seems to have been solved by the Cejka lab showing that Sae2 is a cofactor of MRN without intrinsic nuclease activity (e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25231868/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25231868/</ext-link>). Or do the authors want to suggest that Sae2 has intrinsic nuclease activity? The control may still be useful mentioning that the nuclease is associated but not intrinsic and citing the relevant papers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96933.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study, Badugu et al investigate the Rev7 roles in regulating the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex and in metabolism of G4 structures.

Puzzlingly, Shieldin is absent in many organisms, and it is unknown if and how Rev7 regulates DSB repair in these cells. The authors surmised that yeast Rev7 physically interacts with Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX), the short-range resection nuclease complex and tested this premise using yeast two hybrid (Y2H) and microscale thermophoresis (MST). The results convincingly showed that the individual subunits of MRX interacts robustly with Rev7. By AlphaFold Multimer modelling followed by Y2H confirmed that the carboxy terminal 42 amino acid is essential for interaction with MR and G4 DNA binding by REV7. The mutant rev7 lacking the binding interface (Rev7-C1) to MR shows moderate inhibition to the nuclease and the ATPase activity of Mre11/Rad50 in biochemical assays. Deletion of REV7 also causes a mild reduction in NHEJ using both plasmid and chromosome-based assays and increases mitotic recombination between chromosomal ura3-01 and the plasmid ura3 allele interrupted by G4. The revision also showed that rev7 deleted cells exhibit mild hyper-resection phenotype at 0.7 and 3 kb from the DSB using qPCR assays. The authors concluded that Rev7 facilitates NHEJ and antagonises HR even in budding yeast, but it achieves this by blocking Mre11 nuclease and Rad50 ATPase.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are several strengths to the studies and the broad types of well-established assays were used to deduce the conclusion. Nevertheless, there are notable discrepancies on the mutant phenotypes that were to test the functionality of Rev7-MRX interaction on the repair outcomes, raising concerns on the validity of the proposed model. The manuscript also needs a few additional functional assays to reach the accurate conclusions as proposed. The revision responded to several comments raised by the reviewers, but they are inadequate to address the key concerns and did not offer sufficient and compelling experimental support to the main premise that Rev7-Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 interactions regulate MRX activities in cells and thereby modulates DSB repair choice in budding yeast.</p><p>(1) AlphaFold model predicts that Mre11-Rev7 and Rad50-Rev7 binding interfaces overlap and Rev7 might bind only to Mre11 or Rad50 at a time. Interestingly, however, Rev7 appears dimerized (Fig.1). Since MR complex also forms with 2M and 2R in the complex, it should still be possible if REV7 can interact both M and R in the MR complex. The author should perform MST using MR complex instead of individual MR components. The authors should also analyze if Rev7-C1 is indeed deficient in interaction with MR individually and with complex using MST assay.</p><p>(2) The nuclease and the ATPase assays require additional controls. Does Rev7 inhibit the other nuclease or ATPase non-specifically? Are these outcomes due to the non-specific or promiscuous activity of Rev7? In fig.6, the effect of REV7 on the ATP binding of Rad50 could be hard to assess because the maximum Rad50 level (1 uM) was used in the experiments. The author should use the suboptimal level of Rad50 to check if REV7 still does not influence ATP binding by Rad50.</p><p>(3) The moderate deficiency in NHEJ using plasmid based assay in REV7 deleted cells can be attributed to aberrant cell cycle or mating type in rev7 deleted cells. The authors should demonstrate that rev7 deleted cells retain largely normal cell cycle pattern and the mating type phenotypes. The author should also analyze the breakpoints in plasmid based NHEJ assays in all mutants especially from rev7 and rev7-C1 cells.</p><p>(4) It is puzzling why the authors did not analyze end resection defects in rev7 deleted cells after a DSB. The author should employ the widely used resection assay after a HO break in rev3, rev7 and mre11 rev7 cells as described previously.</p><p>(5) Is it possible that Rev7 also contributes to NHEJ as the part of TLS polymerase complex? Although NHEJ largely depends on Pol4, the authors should not rule out the possibility if the observed NHEJ defect in rev7 cells are due at least partially to its well-known TLS defect and not all due to their role in MRX activity regulation as the authors proposed. In fact, rev3 or rev1 cells are partially defective in NHEJ (Fig. 7). Rev7-C1 is less deficient in NHEJ than REV7 deletion. These results predict that rev7-C1 rev3 could be more deficient than rev3 or rev7-C1, and such results might indicate that Rev7 contributes to NHEJ by two ways; one by interacting (and modulating) MRX and the other as part of Rev3-Rev7 complex. Additionally, the authors should examine if Rev7-C1 might be deficient in TLS. In this regard, does rev7-C1 reduce TLS and TLS dependent mutagenesis? Is it dominant? The authors should also check if Rev3/Rev1 complexes are stable in Rev7 deleted or rev7-C1 cells by immunoblot assays.</p><p>(6) Due to the G4 DNA and G4 binding activity of REV7, it is not clear which class of events the authors are measuring in plasmid-chromosome recombination assay in Fig.9.

Instead, the effect of rev7 deletion or rev7-C1 on recombination should be measured directly by more standard mitotic recombination assays like mating type switch or his3 repeat recombination. The revision did not address these concerns, which still makes the interpretation of the provided recombination results difficult.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96933.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Badugu</surname><given-names>Sugith</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indian Institute of Science Bangalore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bengaluru</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dhyani</surname><given-names>Kshitiza Mohan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indian Institute of Science Bangalore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bengaluru</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Thakur</surname><given-names>Manoj</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Delhi</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New Delhi</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Muniyappa</surname><given-names>Kalappa</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indian Institute of Science Bangalore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bengaluru</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary</p><p>The mammalian Shieldin complex consisting of REV7 (aka MAD2L2, MAD2B) and SHLD1-3 affects pathway usage in DSB repair favoring non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) at the expense of homologous recombination (HR) by blocking resection and/or priming fill-in DNA synthesis to maintain or generate near blunt ends suitable for NHEJ. While the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> does not have homologs to SHLD1-3, it does have Rev7, which was identified to function in conjunction with Rev3 in the translesion DNA polymerase zeta. Testing the hypothesis that Rev7 also affects DSB resection in budding yeast, the work identified a direct interaction between Rev7 and the Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex by two-hybrid and direct protein interaction experiments. Deletion analysis identified that the 42 amino acid C-terminal region was necessary and sufficient for the 2-hybrid interaction. Direct biochemical analysis of the 42 aa peptide was not possible. Rev7 deficient cells were found to be sensitive to HU only in synergy with G2 tetraplex forming DNA. Importantly, the 42 aa peptide alone suppressed this phenotype. Biochemical analysis with full-length Rev7 and a C-terminal truncation lacking the 42 aa region shows G4-specific DNA binding that is abolished in the C-terminal truncation and with a substrate containing mutations to prevent G4 formation. Rev7 lacks nuclease activity but inhibits the dsDNA exonuclease activity of Mre11. The C-terminal truncation protein lacking the 42 aa region also showed some inhibition suggesting the involvement of additional binding sites besides the 42 aa region. Also, the Mre11 ssDNA endonuclease activity is inhibited by Rev7 but not the degradation of linear ssDNA. Rev7 does not affect ATP binding by Rad50 but inhibits in a concentration-dependent manner the Rad50 ATPase activity. The C-terminal truncation protein lacking the 42 aa region also showed some inhibition but significantly less than the full-length protein.</p><p>Using an established plasmid-based NHEJ assay, the authors provide strong evidence that Rev7 affects NEHJ, showing a four-fold reduction in this assay. The mutations in the other Pol zeta subunits, Rev3 and Rev1, show a significantly smaller effect (~25% reduction). A strain expressing only the Rev7 C-terminal 42 aa peptide showed no NHEJ defect, while the truncation protein lacking this region exhibited a smaller defect than the deletion of REV7. The conclusion that Rev7 supports NHEJ mainly through the 42 aa region was validated using a chromosomal NHEJ assay. The effect on HR was assessed using a plasmid:chromosome system containing G4 forming DNA. The rev7 deletion strain showed an increase in HR in this system in the presence and absence of HU. Cells expressing the 42 aa peptide were indistinguishable from the wild type as were cells expressing the Rev7 truncation lacking the 42 aa region. The authors conclude that Rev7 suppresses HR, but the context appears to be system-specific and the conclusion that Rev7 abolished HR repair of DSBs is unwarranted and overly broad.</p><p>Strength</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript with many well-executed experiments that suggest that Rev7 inhibits MRX-mediated resection to favor NEHJ during DSB repair. This finding is novel and provides insight into the potential mechanism of how the human Shieldin complex might antagonize resection.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for their comprehensive summary of our work. The Reviewers' recognition that our manuscript is “well-written” with “many well-executed experiments” and our findings are “novel” is greatly appreciated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses</p><p>The nuclease experiments were conducted using manganese as a divalent cation, and it is unclear whether there is an effect with the more physiological magnesium cation. Additional controls for the ATPase and nuclease experiments to eliminate non-specific effects would be helpful. Evidence for an effect on resection in cells is lacking. The major conclusion about the role of Rev7 in regulating the choice between HR and NHEJ is not justified, as only a highly specialized assay is used that does not warrant the broad conclusion drawn. Specifically, the results that the Rev7 C terminal truncation lacking the 42 aa region still suppresses HR is unexpected and unexplained. The effect of Rev7 on G4 metabolism is underdeveloped and distracts from the main results that Rev7 modulated MRX activity. The authors should consider removing this part and develop a more complete story on this later.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed each point identified as “Weaknesses” by the reviewer, as described below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The nuclease experiments were conducted using manganese as a divalent cation, and it is unclear whether there is an effect with the more physiological magnesium cation.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the Reviewer’s concern and apologize for not having been clear in our first submission. However, several studies have demonstrated that Mre11 exhibits all three DNase activities, namely single-stranded endonuclease, double-stranded exonuclease and DNA hairpin opening only in the presence of Mn²⁺ but not with other divalent cations, such as magnesium or calcium (Paull and Gellert, Mol. Cell 1998; 2000; Usui et al., Cell 1998; Ghosal and Muniyappa, JMB, 2007; Arora et al., Mol Cell Biol. 2017). For this reason, Mn²⁺ was used as a cofactor for the Mre11 nuclease assays. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript. As a side note, Mg2+ serves as a cofactor for Rad50’s ATPase activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional controls for the ATPase and nuclease experiments to eliminate non-specific effects would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this important point, as it led us to evaluate and confirm the specificity of Rev7 and exclude its potential non-specific effects. To this end, we have performed additional experiments, which showed that (a) the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Dmc1 ATPase activity was not affected by Rev7, contrary to its inhibitory effect on Rad50 and (b) Rev7 had no discernible impact on the endonucleolytic activity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sae2, whereas it inhibits DNase activities of Mre11. Thus, the lack of inhibitory effects on the ATPase activity of Dmc1 and nuclease activity of Sae2 confirm the specificity of Rev7 for Mre11 and Rad50 subunits. We have included this new data in Figure 6H and 6J and in Figure 5 –figure supplement 1, respectively, in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Evidence for an effect on resection in cells is lacking.

Reviewer 2 and 3 have also raised point. We now measured the rate of DNA end resection using a qPCR-based assay (Mimitou and Symington, EMBO J. 2010; Gnugge et al., Mol. Cell 2023). The results revealed that deletion of REV7 led to an enhancement in the rate of DNA end resection at a DSB site inflicted by HO endonuclease (Figure 9—figure supplement 3), providing direct evidence that loss of <italic>REV7</italic> contributes to increase in DNA end resection at the DSBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically, the results that the Rev7 C-terminal truncation lacking the 42 aa region still suppresses HR is unexpected and unexplained.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point, and we thank the reviewer for raising it. Although the interaction of Rev7-C1 in the yeast two-hybrid assays was not apparent, surprisingly, it partially suppressed HR (Figure 9). In line with this, biochemical assays showed that it exerts partial inhibitory effect on the Mre11 nuclease (Figure 5) and Rad50 ATPase (Figure 6) activities compared with the full-length Rev7. Consistent with <italic>vitro</italic> data, the AF2 models revealed that, in addition to the C-terminal 42-aa region, residues in the N-terminal region of Rev7 also interact with the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The effect of Rev7 on G4 metabolism is underdeveloped and distracts from the main results that Rev7 modulated MRX activity.

However, we believe that the data (Figure 7-9) in our manuscript, together with new data (Figure 9- figure supplement 2 and 3) in the revised manuscript, clearly demonstrate that Rev7 regulates the choice between HR and NHEJ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) Two stories that do not overlap (regulation of MRX by Rev7 and Rev7's role in G4 metabolism) are brought under one umbrella in this work. There is no connection unless the authors demonstrate that Rev7 inhibits the cleavage of G4 structures by the MRX complex.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point that the themes associated with the regulation of the functions of MRX subunits by Rev7 and its role G4 DNA metabolism do not overlap. This concern has also been expressed by Reviewer 1 and 3. According to their suggestion, we have deleted all figures and text describing the role of Rev7 in G4 DNA metabolism from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors cannot conclude based on the recombination assay between G4-containing 2-micron plasmid and chromosomal ura3-1 that Rev7 &quot;completely abolishes DSB-induced HR&quot;. First of all, there is no evidence that DSBs are formed at G4. Why is there no induction of recombination when cells are treated with HU? Second, as the authors showed, Rev7 binds to G4, therefore it is not clear if the observed effects are the result of Rev7 interaction with G4 or its impact on HR. The established HO-based assays where the speed of resection can be monitored (e.g., Mimitou and Symington, 2010) have to be used to justify the conclusion that Rev7 inhibits MRX nuclease activity in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the insightful comments and drawing our attention to the inference <italic>&quot;completely abolishes DSB-induced HR&quot;</italic>. We have we have rephrased the conclusion, and replaced it with <italic>“REV7</italic> gene product plays an anti-recombinogenic role during HR”. Then, the reviewer refers to lack of “<italic>evidence that DSBs are formed at G4”.</italic> At this point, unfortunately, our attempts to identify DSB at the G4 DNA site in the 2-micron plasmid did not provide a clear answer to this question. This might be related to the existence of myriad DNases in the cell and technical issues associated with the isolation of low-abundant, linearized 2-micron plasmid molecules. Because of these reasons, we cannot provide any data on DSB at the G4 site in the 2-micron plasmid.</p><p>The reviewer then correctly points out “Why is there no induction of recombination when cells are treated with HU?” These findings are consistent with previous studies which have shown that Mre11-deﬁcient cells are sensitivity to HU, resulting in cell death (Tittel-Elmer et al., EMBO J. 28, 1142-1156, 2009; Hamilton and Maizels, PLoS One, 5, e15387, 2010). However, a novel finding of our study is that ura3-1 rev7D cells and ura3-1 cells expressing Rev7-42 amino acid peptide (to limited extent) produce Ura3+ papillae. We have included this information in the Results section and adjusted the text to make this point clear to the reader.</p><p>In the same paragraph, the Reviewer expresses a concern about the interaction of Rev7 with G4 DNA substrates and its impact on HR. As discussed above, in response to your comment (1) and a similar comment of Reviewer 1 and 3, we have deleted all figures and text describing the role of Rev7 in G4 DNA metabolism in the revised manuscript. The reviewer specifically refers to a study by Mimitou and Symington, 2010 in which the speed DNA end resection at the HO endonuclease-inflicted DSB was quantified. We have carried out the suggested experiment and the results are presented in Figure 9─figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>REV7 facilitates the recruitment of Shieldin complex and thereby inhibits end resection and controls DSB repair choice in metazoan cells. Puzzlingly, Shieldin is absent in many organisms and it is unknown if and how Rev7 regulates DSB repair in these cells. The authors surmised that yeast Rev7 physically interacts with Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX), the short-range resection nuclease complex, and tested this premise using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and microscale thermophoresis (MST). The results convincingly showed that the individual subunits of MRX interact robustly with Rev7. AlphaFold Multimer modelling followed by Y2H confirmed that the carboxy-terminal 42 amino acid is essential for interaction with MR and G4 DNA binding by REV7. The mutant rev7 lacking the binding interface (Rev7-C1) to MR shows moderate inhibition to the nuclease and the ATPase activity of Mre11/Rad50 in biochemical assays. Deletion of REV7 also causes a mild reduction in NHEJ using both plasmid and chromosome-based assays and increases mitotic recombination between chromosomal ura3-01 and the plasmid ura3 allele interrupted by G4. The authors concluded that Rev7 facilitates NHEJ and antagonizes HR even in budding yeast, but it achieves this by blocking Mre11 nuclease and Rad50 ATPase.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>There are many strengths to the studies and the broad types of well-established assays were used to deduce the conclusion. Nevertheless, I have several concerns about the validity of experimental settings due to the lack of several key controls essential to interpret the experimental results. The manuscript also needs a few additional functional assays to reach the accurate conclusions as proposed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy that the Reviewer has found “many strengths” in our manuscript and further noted that “results convincingly showed that the individual subunits of MRX interact robustly with Rev7”. We greatly appreciate the Reviewer for these encouraging words, and for specific suggestions that helped us to improve the manuscript. As suggested, we have performed additional experiments including key controls and the data is presented in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) AlphaFold model predicts that Mre11-Rev7 and Rad50-Rev7 binding interfaces overlap and Rev7 might bind only to Mre11 or Rad50 at a time. Interestingly, however, Rev7 appears dimerized (Figure 1). Since the MR complex also forms with 2M and 2R in the complex, it should still be possible if REV7 can interact with both M and R in the MR complex. The author should perform MST using MR complex instead of individual MR components. The authors should also analyze if Rev7-C1 is indeed deficient in interaction with MR individually and with complex using MST assay.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the valuable suggestion. As requested, MST titration experiments have been performed to examine the affinity of purified GFP-tagged Rev7-C1 for the Mre11, Rad50 and MR complex. The results revealed that Rev7-C1 binds to the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits with about 3- and 8.8-fold reduced affinity, respectively; whereas it binds to the MR complex with ~5.6-fold reduced affinity compared with full-length Rev7. The data is shown in Figure 1─figure supplement 4A-C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The nuclease and the ATPase assays require additional controls. Does Rev7 inhibit the other nuclease or ATPase non-specifically? Are these outcomes due to the non-specific or promiscuous activity of Rev7? In Figure 6, the effect of REV7 on the ATP binding of Rad50 could be hard to assess because the maximum Rad50 level (1 mM) was used in the experiments. The author should use the suboptimal level of Rad50 to check if REV7 still does not influence ATP binding by Rad50.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these valuable comments (Reviewer 1 has raised similar issues). Thus, we performed additional control experiments and the results indicate that (a) the ATPase activity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Dmc1 was not affected by Rev7 and (b) Rev7 does not inhibit the endonucleolytic activity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sae2. The results are depicted in Figure 6H and 6J and Figure 5 –figure supplement 1A-D, respectively.</p><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, using suboptimal levels of Rad50 (0.2 mM), we carried out experiments to test the effect of varying concentrations of Rev7 on the ability of Rad50 to bind ATP and catalyse its hydrolysis. The results showed that Rev7 had no discernible effect on its ability to bind ATP, even at concentrations 30 times higher than the concentration of Rad50 (Figure 6B and 6D). However, Rev7 suppresses the ATPase activity of Rad50, but not that of Dmc1, in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure G, 6J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The moderate deficiency in NHEJ using plasmid-based assay in REV7 deleted cells can be attributed to aberrant cell cycle or mating type in rev7 deleted cells. The authors should demonstrate that rev7 deleted cells retain largely normal cell cycle patterns and the mating type phenotypes. The author should also analyze the breakpoints in plasmid-based NHEJ assays in all mutants, especially from rev7 and rev7-C1 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer's critical and insightful comment. We monitored cell-cycle progression of both wild-type and <italic>rev7D</italic> cells over time using FACS. The results revealed that the cell cycle profiles and mating type phenotypes <italic>rev7D</italic> cells were similar to the wild type cells. The data is presented in Figure 7-figure supplement 1. This indicates that <italic>rev7D</italic> cells do not possess aberrant cell cycle or mating type defects as compared with the wild-type cells.</p><p>We find the second point raised by the Reviewer although is intriguing, its relevance to the current study is unclear. In our view, identification of breakpoints using plasmid-based NHEJ assays in all the mutants will require a significant amount of time, and the insight that we may gain is unlikely to add to the central theme of this paper. Moreover, we know for sure that Rev7 has no DNA cleavage/nicking activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It is puzzling why the authors did not analyze end resection defects in rev7 deleted cells after a DSB. The author should employ the widely used resection assay after a HO break in rev3, rev7, and mre11 rev7 cells as described previously.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Reviewer 1 also has raised this point. As suggested, we have analysed end resection in the rev7D cells at a HO inflicted DSB site using a qPCR assay (Mimitou and Symington, EMBO J. 2010; Gnugge et al., Mol. Cell 2023). The results revealed that deletion of REV7 led to an enhancement in the rate of DNA end resection at a DSB inflicted by HO endonuclease (Figure 9—figure supplement 3),</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Is it possible that Rev7 also contributes to NHEJ as the part of TLS polymerase complex? Although NHEJ largely depends on Pol4, the authors should not rule out that the observed NHEJ defect in rev7 cells is due at least partially to its TLS defect. In fact, both rev3 or rev1 cells are partially defective in NHEJ (Figure 7). Rev7-C1 is less deficient in NHEJ than REV7 deletion. These results predict that rev7-C1, rev3 should be as defective as the rev7 deletion. Additionally, the authors should examine if Rev7-C1 might be deficient in TLS. In this regard, does rev7-C1 reduce TLS and TLS-dependent mutagenesis? Is it dominant? The authors should also check if Rev3 or Rev1 are stable in Rev7 deleted or rev7-C1 cells by immunoblot assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the possibility that Rev7 may play a role in translesion DNA synthesis and TLS-dependent mutagenesis. Accordingly, Rev7-C1 might be deficient in TLS. While we do not rule out such scenarios, we respectfully suggest that this is outside the scope of the current manuscript. This manuscript focuses on the role of Rev7 in NHEJ and HR pathways, not on translesion DNA synthesis. Nevertheless, we recognise the importance of this line of investigation, and we will certainly consider this suggestion in our future work. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Due to the G4 DNA and G4 binding activity of REV7, it is not clear which class of events the authors are measuring in plasmid-chromosome recombination assay in Figure 9. Do they measure G4 instability or the integrity of recombination or both in rev7 deleted cells? Instead, the effect of rev7 deletion or rev7-C1 on recombination should be measured directly by more standard mitotic recombination assays like mating type switch or his3 repeat recombination.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer for highlighting this important point and would like to take the opportunity to clarify the rationale behind plasmid-chromosome recombination assay, as previously described (Paeschke et al., Cell 145, 678, 2011). In this assay, we are measuring the rate of Ura+ papillae formation arising from integration of the targeting plasmid into the genome at the ura3-1 locus of wild-type and rev7D cells. Analysis of PCR-generated DNA fragments indicate that pFAT10-G4 plasmid integrates at the ura3-1 genomic locus of rev7D cells, but not in the wild-type cells (Figure 9-figure supplement 2). Further, we also measured the stability of G4 DNA and the results indicate that it is stable in rev7D cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Title: The word 'choice' implies a regulator.

Rev7 seems to suppress HR independent of the function of the 42 aa peptide.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed in response to the query posed by Reviewer 1 in the Public Review. We do see that the Rev7-C1 lacking the 42 aa peptide suppresses HR, but the suppression was only partial as compared with the wild type. This is consistent with biochemical assays suggesting that Rev7-C1 exerts partial inhibition on the Mre11 nuclease (Figure 5) and Rad50 ATPase (Figure 6) activities. Further, the AF2 models indicate that, in addition to the C-terminal 42-aa region, other regions of Rev7 also interact with the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), consistent with biochemical and genetic data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) Line 478: The conclusion that &quot;these findings are consistent with the idea that REV7 completely abolishes DSB-induced HR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.&quot; is overly broad as the assay</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer's assessment.

At least, it should be a negative control in their YH2 assay and protein-protein interaction assay in vitro that Rev7 does not bind to some other proteins. For example, Sae2 and Rev7 interactions can be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that it is important to validate the specificity of Y2H interactions as well as in vitro enzyme assays. These findings are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 5-figure supplement 1. As suggested by the Reviewer, we included <italic>SAE2</italic> in Y2H and MST assays, and Dmc1 and Sae2 in vitro enzyme assays. Our results clearly showed that Sae2 neither interacts with MRX subunits in Y2H assays (Figure 1A-C) nor inhibits the Sae2’s nuclease and Dmc1’s ATPase activities in vitro (Figure 6 and Figure 5-figure supplement 1)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is surprising that in the Discussion the authors speculate that Rev7 might recruit Mus81 nuclease for cleavage, completely ignoring their own publication on the cleavage of G4 by MRX.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and we have added discussion about MRX (mentioned above by the reviewer) in revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) How does the AlphaFold-Multimer modeling predict the interaction between Rev7 and MRX as a complex? Are the same regions of MRX accessible for the interaction with Rev7 in this case? Similarly, how are the activities of the MRX complex and phosphorylated Sae2 (see P. Cejka's work) affected by Rev7?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. In this study, we investigated the interaction between Rev7 and Mre11, and between Rev7 and Rad50 subunits using AF2 algorithm. However, the three-dimensional structure of <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> MRX-Rev7 complex could not be constructed due to the size limits imposed by AF2 algorithm. Therefore, we are unable to comment on whether the same regions of MRX subunits in the complex are accessible for the interaction with Rev7.

As such, there are no AF2 structural models that cover the whole length of Mre11-Rad50 proteins.</p><p>Regarding the second point raised by the Reviewer, our results suggest that Rev7 does interact with Sae2 in Y2H assays.

The recombination assay with targeting plasmids containing G4 DNA forming sequences was performed as previously described (Paeschke et al., Cell 145, 678, 2011). In this assay, the appearance of Ura+ recombinants arise from the integration of the targeting plasmid bearing ura3G4 allele (with a G4 DNA forming insert) integrates into the genome at the ura3-1 locus. As shown in Author response image 1B, this is confirmed by PCR amplification of the insert in the genomic DNA of wild type and rev7D cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) All Y2H experiments were performed with REV7 fusion to pGBKT7 and MRX to pGADT7.
