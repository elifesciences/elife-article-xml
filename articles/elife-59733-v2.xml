brain regions, generate new neurons throughout life. These stem cells are specialized astrocytes, but astrocytes in other brain regions do not generate neurons under physiological conditions. After stroke, however, striatal astrocytes undergo neurogenesis in mice, triggered by decreased Notch signaling. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize neurogenesis by Notch-depleted striatal astrocytes in vivo. Striatal astrocytes were located upstream of neural stem cells in the neuronal lineage. As astrocytes initiated neurogenesis, they became transcriptionally very similar to subventricular zone stem cells, progressing through a near-identical neurogenic program. Surprisingly, in the non-neurogenic cortex, Notch-depleted astrocytes also initiated neurogenesis. Yet, these cortical astrocytes, and many striatal ones, stalled before entering transit-amplifying divisions. Infusion of epidermal growth factor enabled stalled striatal astrocytes to resume neurogenesis. We conclude that parenchymal astrocytes are latent neural stem cells and that targeted interventions can guide them through their neuronal differentiation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Regenerative medicine aims to help the body replace damaged or worn-out tissues, often by kick-starting its own intrinsic repair mechanisms.

This is because nerve cells or neurons, which underpin learning, memory, and many other abilities, are also the brain’s greatest weakness when it comes to tissue repair.</p><p>In most parts of the adult brain, neurons are never replaced after they die. This means that damage to brain tissue – for example, after a stroke – can have severe and long-lasting consequences.

However, the ability was restricted to small numbers of astrocytes in a specific part of the brain. Here, Magnusson et al. set out to determine the molecular mechanisms behind this regenerative process and why it is unique to certain astrocytes.</p><p>The researchers used a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the genetic activity within individual mouse astrocytes that had been exposed to conditions mimicking a stroke.

In most mammals, specialized astrocytes in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) are stem cells and generate new neurons continuously, but apart from that, the brain’s ability to replace lost neurons is very limited. However, in response to an experimental stroke or excitotoxic lesion, some astrocytes in the mouse striatum can generate neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magnusson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nato et al., 2015</xref>). This neurogenic response is regulated by Notch signaling and can be activated even in the uninjured mouse striatum by deleting the Notch-mediating transcription factor <italic>Rbpj</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magnusson et al., 2014</xref>). Striatal astrocytes undergo neurogenesis by passing through a transit-amplifying cell stage. But it is not known whether these astrocytes become bona fide neural stem cells. If they do, this could have far-reaching implications for regenerative medicine. Astrocytes make up a large fraction of all brain cells (10–20% in mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun et al., 2017</xref>) and are distributed throughout the central nervous system. They would thus represent a very abundant source of potential neural stem cells that might be recruited for therapeutic purposes.</p><p>Although certain injuries and <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion can both trigger neurogenesis by astrocytes, it almost exclusively does so in the striatum. And even within the striatum, primarily the astrocytes in the medial striatum readily activate neurogenic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This suggests that neurogenic parenchymal astrocytes either occupy an environmental niche favorable to neurogenesis or that only they have an inherent neurogenic capacity. In order to recruit astrocytes for therapeutic neurogenesis, a first step is to understand the mechanisms underlying this process. If these mechanisms are understood, they could potentially be targeted to induce localized therapeutic neurogenesis throughout the central nervous system.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neurogenesis by striatal astrocytes can be reconstructed using single-cell RNA sequencing.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Deletion of the gene encoding the Notch-mediating transcription factor <italic>Rbpj</italic> activates a latent neurogenic program in striatal astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magnusson et al., 2014</xref>).

We found that, at the transcriptional level, <italic>Rbpj-</italic>deficient striatal astrocytes became highly similar to SVZ neural stem cells and that their neurogenic program was nearly identical to that of stem cells in the SVZ, but not the DG. Interestingly, astrocytes in the non-neurogenic somatosensory cortex also initiated a neurogenic program in response to <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion, but all stalled prior to entering transit-amplifying divisions and failed to generate neuroblasts. In the striatum, too, many astrocytes halted their development prior to entering transit-amplifying divisions. We found that stalled striatal astrocytes could be pushed into transit-amplifying divisions and neurogenesis by an injection of epidermal growth factor (EGF), indicating that it is possible to overcome roadblocks in the astrocyte neurogenic program through targeted manipulations. Taken together, we conclude that parenchymal astrocytes are latent neural stem cells. We posit that their intrinsic neurogenic potential is limited by a non-permissive environment. Recruiting these very abundant latent stem cells for localized therapeutic neurogenesis may be possible but is likely to require precise interventions that guide them through their neurogenic program.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptome-based reconstruction of neurogenesis by striatal astrocytes</title><p>To understand the cellular mechanisms underlying neurogenesis by parenchymal astrocytes, we decided to perform single-cell RNA sequencing of striatal astrocytes undergoing neurogenesis in vivo. To this end, we generated two separate single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, each with complementary strengths. For the first dataset, which we call the Cx30-CreER dataset, we used Connexin-30 (Cx30; official gene symbol <italic>Gjb6</italic>)-CreER mice to delete <italic>Rbpj</italic> and activate heritable <italic>tdTomato</italic> or <italic>YFP</italic> expression in astrocytes throughout the brain. This method targeted up to 100% of astrocytes in the striatum (tdTomato expression in 92 ± 10% of glutamine synthetase<sup>+</sup>, S100<sup>+</sup> cells; mean ± S.D.; <italic>n</italic> = 6 mice). These mice also target neural stem cells in the SVZ, but no other brain cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magnusson et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion in healthy mice was chosen as the means by which to activate the neurogenic program of astrocytes. That is because (1) it constitutes a single, precisely timed trigger throughout the brain, (2) it mimics the endogenous stimulus of reduced Notch signaling by which stroke induces neurogenesis by astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magnusson et al., 2014</xref>), and (3) it does not induce potentially confounding cellular processes like reactive gliosis or cell death. Striatal tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells were isolated by flow cytometry from mice homozygous for the <italic>Rbpj</italic> null allele 2, 4 and 8 weeks after tamoxifen administration, and from control mice with intact <italic>Rbpj</italic>, 3 days after tamoxifen administration (hereafter called ground-state astrocytes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–d</xref>). Sequencing libraries were prepared using Smart-seq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Picelli et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition to parenchymal astrocytes, Cx30-mediated recombination also targets SVZ neural stem cells, whose progeny might be sorted along with striatal astrocytes and, thus, confound our results. We therefore generated a second single-cell RNA sequencing dataset, for which labeling of cells was restricted to the striatum. Striatal astrocytes were selectively recombined via injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing Cre under the control of the astrocyte-specific GFAP promoter into the striatum of <italic>Rbpj</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; R26-loxP-Stop-loxP-tdTomato mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We isolated tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells 5 weeks after virus injection, a time point at which Ascl1<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, transit-amplifying cells and neuroblasts are all present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magnusson et al., 2014</xref>). We sequenced these cells using 10X Chromium by 10X Genomics. Despite the GFAP promoter, the AAV-Cre dataset also contained oligodendrocytes and some microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These were excluded from the final dataset based on our previous finding that they are not involved in a neurogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magnusson et al., 2014</xref>). The AAV-Cre dataset contained a somewhat higher proportion of transit-amplifying cells than the Cx30-CreER dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>), likely because the AAV-Cre dataset only contained cells from 5 weeks after <italic>Rbpj</italic>-KO, near the peak of transit-amplifying divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magnusson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We first asked whether we could reconstruct striatal astrocyte neurogenesis computationally using the AAV-Cre dataset. Using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), we found that the sequenced cells indeed included <italic>Rbpj-</italic>deficient astrocytes (<italic>Cx30</italic><sup>+</sup>), activated astrocytes and transit-amplifying cells (<italic>Egfr</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>Ascl1</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>Mki67</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>Dcx</italic><sup>+</sup>) and neuroblasts (<italic>Dcx</italic><sup>+</sup>), up until the migratory neuroblast stage (<italic>Nav3</italic><sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>). We conclude that it is possible to use single-cell RNA sequencing to study the transcriptional mechanisms underlying the astrocyte neurogenic program.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Neurogenesis by astrocytes is dominated by early transcriptional changes associated with metabolism and gene expression</title><p>We were interested in the transcriptional changes that take place as astrocytes first initiate the neurogenic program. For this question, we primarily used the Cx30-CreER dataset, which included astrocytes both at ground state and at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Furthermore, the Cx30-CreER mice allowed us to study the neurogenic process in the uninjured brain, without the potentially confounding effects of a needle injection. Two weeks after <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion, astrocytes had upregulated genes mostly related to transcription, translation and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, S1g, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To study in detail how gene expression changed over the course of neurogenesis, we next reconstructed the differentiation trajectory of these astrocytes computationally using Monocle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Trapnell and Cacchiarelli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; Methods). This analysis captured the progression from astrocyte to neuroblast in pseudotime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The pseudotemporal axis reflected neurogenesis, as revealed by plotting along pseudotime the expression of genes that are dynamically induced in canonical neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). This analysis confirmed the previous finding that neurogenesis by parenchymal astrocytes involves transit-amplifying divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magnusson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Niu et al., 2013</xref>), and does not occur through direct transdifferentiation, a process during which intermediate stages of differentiation are skipped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briggs et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neurogenesis by astrocytes is dominated by early transcriptional changes associated with metabolism and gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) We prepared a second single-cell RNA sequencing dataset using SmartSeq2.

(<bold>b</bold>) Two weeks after <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion, astrocytes have upregulated genes mainly associated with metabolism and gene expression.

(<bold>e</bold>) Gene clustering and GO analysis shows distinctive dynamics of functional gene groups with example genes shown in (<bold>f</bold>). Genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism are upregulated initially but downregulated as cells enter transit-amplifying divisions. Genes involved in transcription and translation are expressed at steadily increasing levels. Accordingly, the number of genes detected per cell increases initially (<bold>g</bold>) – an increase not explained by a mere increase in cell size (<bold>h</bold>). A gene cluster with remarkable dynamics contains genes involved in synapse organization (<bold>e</bold>), presumably important for both astrocytes and neurons. (i) All these findings are supported by a pseudotemporal analysis of the AAV-Cre dataset. The AAV-Cre dataset, however, only contains cells from the 5-week time point and thus does not show changes that happen early in the neurogenic program.

These gene clusters were then characterized using the gene ontology (GO) tool DAVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). This approach enabled us to see which biological processes changed as differentiation proceeded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We found that, as astrocytes initiated their neurogenic program, genes associated with metabolism, particularly lipid (e.g. <italic>Fabp5</italic>, <italic>Fasn</italic>, <italic>Elovl5</italic>) and carbohydrate metabolism (e.g. <italic>Gapdh</italic>, <italic>Aldoa</italic>, <italic>Aldoc</italic>) were at first upregulated but dramatically downregulated as cells entered transit-amplifying divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>, [<italic>Cluster 1</italic>]). This suggested that the neurogenic program requires high metabolic activity to prepare for transit-amplifying divisions. In addition to these metabolic genes, the expression of genes involved in the regulation of transcription (e.g. mRNA splicing genes <italic>Snrpb</italic>, <italic>Srsf5</italic>, <italic>Srsf3</italic>) and translation (e.g. ribosomal subunits <italic>Rpl17</italic>, <italic>Rpl23</italic>, <italic>Rps11</italic>) progressively increased throughout the neurogenic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>, [<italic>Cluster 2</italic>]). Accordingly, we found that the number of genes detected per cell increased in the initial stages of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>): pre-division astrocytes expressed 1.4 times as many genes as ground-state astrocytes (p=10<sup>−12</sup>; 95% C.I. 1.3–1.5; Materials and methods). In theory, such an increase in the number of detected genes could be an artifact caused by a simultaneous increase in cell size; however, no cell size increase was observed during this early phase of neurogenesis, as measured by flow cytometer forward scatter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>).</p><p>The changes to metabolism and gene expression activity described above were the two dominating transcriptional changes that occurred early in the neurogenic process of astrocytes.

Finally, as they exited transit-amplifying divisions, cells upregulated classical marker genes of neuroblasts (e.g. <italic>Cd24a</italic>, <italic>Dcx</italic>, <italic>Dlx1/2</italic>, <italic>Tubb3 [βIII tubulin]</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>, [<italic>Cluster 3</italic>]), indicative of early neuronal commitment and differentiation.</p><p>Interestingly, one group of genes showed a remarkable pattern of initial downregulation followed by upregulation as cells developed into neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref> [<italic>Cluster 4</italic>], S4a).

As a validation of the signaling entropy concept, we plotted signaling entropy versus pseudotime in the SVZ dataset and saw that SVZ cells exhibit their maximum signaling entropy as activated stem cells or transit-amplifying cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>).

This revealed the close transcriptional similarity between striatal and SVZ neuroblasts, suggesting that striatal astrocytes and SVZ stem cells are predisposed to generate very similar neuronal subtypes (GABAergic interneurons), different from those in the DG (excitatory granule neurons). In summary, the transcriptional program governing neurogenesis by striatal astrocytes is highly similar, but not identical, to that of SVZ cells, and less similar to that of DG stem cells. We speculate that this similarity likely reflects a shared developmental history. It has, for example, been shown that the region-specific transcriptional signature among astrocytes is conserved when astrocytes are reprogrammed directly into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Herrero-navarro et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Astrocytes outside the striatum initiate an unsuccessful neurogenic program in response to <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion</title><p>We previously found that, in addition to the striatum, <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion triggers astrocyte neurogenesis in layer 1 of the medial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magnusson et al., 2014</xref>). Now, we asked whether astrocytes in other parts of the brain also show signs of activating a neurogenic program, even though they do not complete neurogenesis. To detect faint signs of an initiated neurogenic program, we first performed an immunohistochemical staining against the early neurogenesis-associated transcription factor Ascl1 in Cx30-CreER; <italic>Rbpj</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, 4 weeks after tamoxifen administration. Importantly, we used tyramide-based signal amplification to boost the fluorescent signal in order to be able to detect low levels of Ascl1 protein. Intriguingly, this showed that many astrocytes throughout the brain had upregulated low levels of Ascl1 in response to <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>). This suggested that astrocytes in all brain regions initiate at least one early step in a neurogenic program in response to <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion. To learn more, we next performed single-cell RNA sequencing on astrocytes isolated from the non-neurogenic somatosensory cortex of the same Cx30-CreER mice that we had used for the striatum analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). We chose the Cx30-CreER model for this analysis because it induces <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion simultaneously throughout the brain, does not lead to any potentially confounding tissue damage, and does not suffer from viral tropism-induced differences in recombination efficiency between the striatum and cortex. We used Monocle to arrange the cortical cells in pseudotime together with the striatal cells and found that, regardless of brain region, cells from the different time points scored similarly along the initial stages of this pseudotime axis. However, all the cortical astrocytes halted their development prior to entering transit-amplifying divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). A density plot of cortical astrocytes from the different time points helped better illustrate the gradual progression along this neurogenic axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Two weeks after <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion, cortical astrocytes had upregulated genes mainly associated with metabolism and gene expression, just like striatal astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Given this intrinsic capacity to activate neurogenic properties, we therefore wondered whether it might instead be the environment of the cortex that prevents these astrocytes from completing their neurogenic program in vivo. To gauge the neurogenic permissiveness of the striatal and cortical environments, we isolated neural progenitor cells by sorting tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells from the SVZ and DG of Cx30-CreER; tdTomato mice (with or without <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion) 3–6 days after tamoxifen administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These cells were then immediately grafted into the striatum or cortex of littermate mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l</xref>), to see how many of the grafted cells would form neuroblasts and neurons. When the recipient mice were sacrificed and analyzed 4 weeks later, we found that more of the transplanted cells had developed into Dcx<sup>+</sup> neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5m</xref>) and NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5n</xref>) in the striatum than in the cortex (Dcx: striatum 52 ± 21%, cortex 20 ± 22%, mean ± S.D.; NeuN: striatum 10 ± 9%, cortex 2 ± 3%). This suggested that the cortex has an environment less permissive to neurogenesis than the striatum. Such a hostile environment may help explain why <italic>Rbpj</italic>-deficient astrocytes in the cortex fail to complete the neurogenic program that they initiate. Although we focused our analysis on the somatosensory cortex, our immunohistochemical staining of Ascl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) suggests that an aborted neurogenic program may occur throughout the entire brain in response to <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Stalled neurogenic astrocytes in the striatum can resume neurogenesis if exposed to EGF</title><p>Although <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion does trigger neurogenesis by astrocytes in the striatum, this process is most active in the medial striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This uneven distribution suggests that in addition to Notch signaling, other mechanisms regulate astrocyte neurogenesis. We wanted to know if our RNA sequencing datasets could help us learn why many striatal astrocytes fail to complete neurogenesis. We noted that, after <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion, it takes approximately 3–4 weeks until the first striatal astrocytes enter transit-amplifying divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Yet, many cells isolated even 8 weeks after <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion remained as astrocytes that seemed to have halted their development immediately prior to the transit-amplifying cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We asked whether stalled striatal astrocytes could resume their neurogenic program if they were stimulated to enter transit-amplifying divisions. Striatal astrocytes upregulate <italic>Egfr</italic> in response to <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). We performed a single injection of the mitogen EGF directly into the lateral striatum of Cx30-CreER; <italic>Rbpj</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice 7 weeks after tamoxifen administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). In <italic>Rbpj</italic><sup>wt/fl</sup> control mice, EGF injection on its own was not enough to induce striatal neurogenesis; neither did it induce any neuroblast migration from the SVZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,d</xref>) or any detectable increase in the amount of SVZ neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). In wild-type mice, EGF did not trigger cell divisions in striatal astrocytes or non-astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>). We concluded that EGF injection into the lateral striatum did not perturb SVZ neurogenesis or trigger confounding striatal proliferation. Interestingly, however, EGF injection into the striatum of <italic>Rbpj</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice did lead to a doubling in the number of reporter-positive neuroblasts compared to the vehicle-injected contralateral striatum (216 ± 90 [EGF hemisphere, mean ± S.D.], 110 ± 61 [vehicle hemisphere]; p=0.023 [paired t-test]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c–d</xref>). This increase was the result of an increased number of astrocytes entering transit-amplifying divisions rather than increased proliferation by the same number of astrocytes: EGF-injected striata contained on average twice as many neuroblast clusters as vehicle-injected striata (21 ± 10 [EGF hemisphere, mean ±S.D.], 8 ± 5 [vehicle hemisphere]; p=0.049 [paired t-test]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>), but cluster size did not differ (p=0.59 [Mann-Whitney test]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Some animals also showed a dramatic increase in the number of Ascl1<sup>+</sup> transit-amplifying cell clusters in the EGF-injected striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g–h</xref>). This increase, however, was less pronounced (p=0.132 [paired t-test]) than that of Dcx<sup>+</sup> cells, possibly because most of the EGF-stimulated astrocytes had already passed the transit-amplifying stage and developed into neuroblasts 2 weeks after the EGF injection. To investigate the local astrocyte origin of these Ascl1<sup>+</sup> clusters, we used residual S100β protein as a short-term lineage-tracing marker of striatum-generated transit-amplifying cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3d–g</xref>). We found that S100β protein levels were the same in Ascl1<sup>+</sup> clusters in the EGF- and vehicle-injected striata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>; p=0.159 [unpaired t-test], with a trend toward more S100β<sup>high</sup> clusters in the EGF-injected striatum). This showed that EGF had caused no influx of S100β-negative cells from the SVZ into the striatum.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that EGF administration can enable stalled neurogenic astrocytes in the striatum to initiate transit-amplifying divisions and resume neurogenesis. This effect was easily measurable even after a single, localized EGF injection. Yet, striatal neurogenesis was still primarily localized to the medial striatum, suggesting that many stalled astrocytes may require a stronger stimulus than a single injection to re-initiate neurogenesis. Further studies would be needed to tell whether longer and more broadly localized EGF exposure could recruit an even larger proportion of stalled striatal astrocytes. EGF exposure in the somatosensory cortex was not sufficient to make stalled <italic>Rbpj</italic>-deficient astrocytes enter transit-amplifying divisions there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e</xref>).

Although the SVZ and DG do contain neural stem cells, it is not feasible to use these regions as sources of replacement neurons for the rest of the brain. That is mainly because neurons generated in the SVZ or DG would need to migrate unfeasibly far to reach distant injury sites in the human brain. However, a therapeutic workaround could be to artificially stimulate neurogenesis by cells close to an injury. Astrocytes could be such a reservoir for new neurons because they have an intrinsic neurogenic potential and are very abundant. However, it will be necessary to understand the mechanisms governing astrocyte neurogenesis before the process can be harnessed and tailored to generate specific neuronal subtypes of significant amounts.</p><p>Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to study the transcriptional program of parenchymal astrocytes as they initiate neurogenesis in response to deletion of the Notch-mediating transcription factor <italic>Rbpj</italic>. We find that the neurogenic program of parenchymal astrocytes is almost identical to that of SVZ neural stem cells. Based on the analyses in this study, we propose a model where parenchymal astrocytes are regarded as latent neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model summarizing the main findings of this study.</title><p>We propose a model in which striatal astrocytes can be viewed as highly quiescent neural stem cells that, upon <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion, activate a neurogenic program very similar to that of SVZ stem cells. Some features of the neurogenic program are unique to these parenchymal astrocytes: Their distinct astrocyte morphology is partly retained even after initiation of transit-amplifying divisions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Furthermore, S100β protein is found in many parenchymal astrocytes, but not in SVZ stem cells, and lingers at low levels in astrocyte-derived transit-amplifying cells even when the <italic>S100b</italic> gene is no longer expressed (dashed line), acting as a short-term lineage tracing marker. Other features are instead unique to the SVZ stem cells, such as expression of <italic>Gfap, Thbs4, Vim</italic> and <italic>Prom1</italic>, although markers of reactive astrogliosis, such as <italic>Gfap</italic>, are upregulated in neurogenic striatal astrocytes after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magnusson et al., 2014</xref>). Astrocytes all over the brain initiate the neurogenic program in response to <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion, but all astrocytes in the somatosensory cortex, and many in the striatum, halt their development prior to entering transit-amplifying divisions. In the striatum, stalled astrocytes can resume neurogenesis if exposed to EGF.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59733-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Specifically, we find that initiation of the neurogenic program in astrocytes is dominated by a steady upregulation of genes associated with transcription and translation, as well as a transient wave of metabolism-associated genes. These findings fit well with what is known about neural stem cell activation in the DG and SVZ, where expression levels of genes associated with transcription and translation steadily increase throughout the neurogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shin et al., 2015</xref>). Our data suggest that parenchymal astrocytes start off at an even lower baseline level of gene expression than neural stem cells, and that they have increased the number of expressed genes ~ 1.4 fold by the time they reach their most stem cell-like state, prior to transit-amplifying divisions.</p><p>Metabolic gene expression peaked right before striatal astrocytes entered transit-amplifying divisions, suggesting that the rapid burst of cell divisions is the most metabolically demanding step of the neurogenic program. In the DG, exit from quiescence requires increased lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Knobloch et al., 2013</xref>), and once activated stem cells enter transit-amplifying divisions, metabolic genes are downregulated, both in the DG and SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shin et al., 2015</xref>). This similarity suggests that, like parenchymal astrocytes, neural stem cells in the DG and SVZ experience a metabolic peak prior to entering transit-amplifying divisions. We find that it takes 2–4 weeks for astrocytes to reach this pre-division state. One possible interpretation of this is that the most time-consuming portion of the astrocyte neurogenic program is the initial exit from deep quiescence, as is the case in quiescent muscle stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Siegel et al., 2011</xref>). Another (and compatible) interpretation is that <italic>Rbpj</italic> protein may remain bound at its target promoters long after the <italic>Rbpj</italic> gene has been deleted, and that the neurogenic program is initiated only when the protein level has fallen below a certain threshold. Such stable transcription factor-DNA interaction is a mechanism by which some transcription factors buffer against fluctuating transcription levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Traets et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>One of our main findings is that all astrocytes in the striatum and somatosensory cortex initiate a neurogenic program in response to <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion, even though only some astrocytes in the striatum and medial cortex manage to enter transit-amplifying divisions. This suggests that <italic>all</italic> astrocytes in the striatum and somatosensory cortex, and perhaps in other regions as well, are latent neural stem cells. We hypothesize that the inability of most astrocytes to enter transit-amplifying divisions is due to a lack of proper environmental signals rather than an intrinsic inability. This hypothesis is based on four observations: 1) A large body of literature has demonstrated that parenchymal astrocytes isolated from the injured mouse cortex can generate neurospheres in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shimada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buffo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sirko et al., 2013</xref>), proving that astrocytes have intrinsic neural stem cell potential but lack the proper in vivo environment to realize this potential. 2) We here transplanted neural stem cells to the cortex and striatum and found that fewer developed into neuroblasts and neurons in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l–n</xref>), showing that the cortex has a non-permissive environment. 3) A single injection of EGF into the striatum was enough to make some astrocytes, which had stalled in a pre-division state, enter transit-amplifying divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), showing that extracellular signals can bolster and improve the astrocyte neurogenic program. 4) In Cx30-CreER; <italic>Rbpj</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, most astrocyte-derived transit-amplifying cells and neuroblasts appear in the medial striatum, close to the SVZ. It is possible that the nearby SVZ provides a gradient of neurogenic factors into the medial striatum and establishes a more permissive environment there. Such a gradient has indeed been shown to appear if growth factors are infused into the lateral ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we use <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion as our trigger to induce neurogenesis by astrocytes. We propose that our results apply also to injury-induced astrocyte neurogenesis even in the absence of <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion, such as that observed in the stroke-injured striatum. Decreased Notch signaling is the mechanism that triggers neurogenesis by striatal astrocytes in stroke-injured mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magnusson et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion model is a biologically relevant way to activate the astrocyte neurogenic program without triggering confounding tissue processes that occur in response to injury, such as inflammation and reactive astrogliosis. Indeed, the precision afforded by our <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion model allowed us to observe here that the astrocyte neurogenic program is not dependent on simultaneous reactive gliosis. Instead, neurogenesis and reactive astrogliosis are likely controlled by two independent, but compatible, transcriptional programs.</p><p>Is there practical usefulness in designating parenchymal astrocytes as latent neural stem cells? We argue that there is. This nomenclature highlights an aspect of astrocyte biology that exists in parallel to the normal important functions of astrocytes in the healthy brain. Labeling parenchymal astrocytes as latent neural stem cells can help focus research efforts toward activating and fine-tuning the inherent neurogenic capacity of these cells to generate therapeutically useful neuronal subtypes. It is likely that astrocytes in different brain regions use different mechanisms to lock their astrocyte identity in place. Our study demonstrates that it is feasible to identify such mechanisms and seek to target them for enhancing neurogenesis by astrocytes throughout the central nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

From each brain, a ~ 1 mm thick coronal slice was isolated, spanning rostrocaudal levels Bregma −0.2 to +1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). From this section, the SVZ was isolated and discarded. The striatum and cortex were then isolated from both hemispheres. Tissue was cut into fine pieces and incubated with papain solution (20 units/ml) containing L-cysteine (1 mM), EDTA (0.5 mM) and DNase (2000 units/ml) (Papain Dissociation System [LK003160], Worthington, Lakewood, NJ), dissolved in EBSS (Thermo Fisher), at 37°C for 30 min, with occasional agitation. Then, the tissue was triturated with smaller and smaller pipet tips and filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). After a 10 min centrifugation at 200*g in a swing-bucket rotor at 4°C, supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 3 ml sterile-filtered washing buffer (Dulbecco’s PBS containing sodium pyruvate, streptomycin sulfate, kanamycin monosulfate, glucose and calcium chloride; Sigma-Aldrich, D4031) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, A9418). To remove debris, we then used gradient centrifugation and myelin removal beads in the following way. The cell suspension was carefully layered on top of 4 ml of 90% Percoll (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL; 17-0891-01, diluted in 1.5 M sterile-filtered NaCl) in a 15 ml Falcon tube and centrifuged at 200*g for 15 min in a swing-bucket rotor at 4°C. After removing the small top phase, the large bottom phase (including the white interphase) was resuspended in 17.5 ml washing buffer in a 50 ml Falcon tube and repeatedly aspirated with a Pipette Boy. This cell suspension was then centrifuged at 200*g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was set aside, and to maximize cell yield the supernatant was again repeatedly aspirated and centrifuged. Then, the two pooled cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml sterile-filtered MACS buffer (5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA in PBS). The cell suspension was incubated with 80 μl myelin removal beads II (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-096-731) for 15 min. Meanwhile, a MACS Large Cell Column (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; 130-042-202) was placed in a Magnetic MACS Multistand (Miltenyi Biotec) and activated by allowing 500 μl of MACS buffer to drop through. The cell suspension was passed through the MACS column and the flow-through was collected in a FACS tube pre-coated with 1% sterile-filtered BSA. MACS buffer (500 μl) was then passed through the column twice to increase cell yield. The cell suspension was then incubated with LIVE/DEAD Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher, L23105) for 30 min. Immediately afterwards, an a BD Influx FACS machine (86 μm nozzle) was used to sort live tdTomato<sup>+</sup> single cells into 96-well skirted PCR plates (Thermo Fisher) containing lysis buffer (containing dNTP [2.5 mM], oligo-dT [2.5 mM], RNAse Inhibitor [Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan; 1:40] and ERCC [Ambion, TX; 1:4,000,000]) with the machine set on 'Index Sort' mode to record cell size information and fluorescence parameters used. Plates were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until processing. For preparation of single-cell cDNA libraries, the plates were thawed at 72°C for 4 min and immediately placed on ice. A reverse transcription of mRNA was performed and the resulting cDNA libraries were immediately subject to amplification for 19 cycles according to the Smart-Seq2 protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Picelli et al., 2014a</xref>). The final libraries were subjected to bead purification (AMPure, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA; 0.6:1 bead-to-sample ratio) to remove excess primers and primer dimers. Library quality was checked using an Agilent Bioanalyzer and DNA High Sensitivity microfluidics chips. After determining that libraries were of sufficiently high quality for downstream sequencing, 0.5–1.5 ng of cDNA from each single-cell library was used for tagmentation reactions with a custom Tn5 enzyme/oligo (comparable to the Nextera XT protocol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Picelli et al., 2014b</xref>). Nextera XT dual indexes were used (96 index kit) and each library was subjected to an additional 10 cycles of amplification. The final products were again subjected to bead cleaning to remove excess primers and monitored for successful amplification by random sampling of different wells and visualization of library size and quality on the Bioanalyzer. Successful tagmentation reactions were pooled as individual 96-well plates and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 machine with 2*125 bp sequencing on High Output mode.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Read mapping, quality control and computational analyses for the Cx30-CreER dataset</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Read mapping and quality control for striatal cells (Cx30-CreER dataset)</title><p>Raw reads were processed with Nesoni clip v. 0.132, removing sequencing adapters and bases with a per-base quality value lower than 20 (‘-quality 20’) and reads shorter than 64 nucleotides (‘-length 64’).

Five weeks later, mice were sacrificed and the brain collected for isolation of single cells. We used a brain slicer to produce 1.5 mm thick sections spanning the rostrocaudal region transduced by the virus. Prior to isolating striata for tissue dissociation, we inspected fluorescent labeling at the microscope to ensure that only striatal cells (and not SVZ cells) had been transduced. At this stage, two mice were excluded because they had recombined cells in the SVZ. For the remaining 11 mice, striata were microdissected from each slice following the same approach outlined above (sample preparation for the Cx30-CreER experiment), pooled as one sample, and digested using Miltenyi’s Adult Brain Dissociation kit. Single cells were finally FAC-sorted based on tdTomato signal as described above (i.e. for the Cx30-CreER dataset). Library preparation was performed using Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library and Gel Bead Kit (v3, 10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Both SVZ and DG datasets were processed separately, in order to identify distinct cell types and retain only clusters implicated in the neurogenic program. Specifically, we ran PCA on highly variable genes (n = 6497 for SVZ and n = 2224 for DG), followed by tSNE and clustering performed on the top 15 PCs, and selected clusters of cells based on expression of classic neurogenesis-related markers (e.g. <italic>Aqp4, Thbs4, Sox4, Top2a, Dcx</italic>) for downstream analysis. Filtered datasets were integrated with striatal data by means of canonical correlation analysis (CCA, Seurat) considering the top 2000 HVGs merged across samples. Datasets were aligned using the first 13 dimensions of CCA and visualized in UMAP space. To investigate the relative distance of cell types across samples we ran hierarchical clustering based on a distance matrix constructed in the aligned space (i.e. using CCA dimensions), followed by differential expression analysis that allowed insight into shared and unique transcriptional programs active in the different neurogenic niches. Finally, we ran correlation analysis on the average expression of each gene to determine similarities in cell-specific transcriptional profiles across brain regions (data were visualized as scatterplots using ggplot 3.3.0).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cell transplantation</title><p>Donor mice (Cx30-CreER; R26-tdTomato, either with or without inducible <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), were sacrificed 3–6 days after intraperitoneal tamoxifen administration. The SVZ and DG were dissected and cells isolated using the same protocol used to isolate cells for the Cx30-CreER dataset. Live tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted using an 86 µm nozzle into a FACS tube pre-coated with 1% BSA, containing 250 µl wash buffer (see cell isolation protocol for the Cx30-CreER dataset). Cell suspensions were kept on ice at all times and chilled during cell sorting. After sorting, cell suspensions were transferred to pre-coated microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 200*g for 10 min in a swing-bucket rotor at 4°C. The swing-bucket rotor was important as it enabled the small cell pellet to collect at the bottom of the tube. Supernatant was removed carefully. Tubes were then briefly centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge to bring down a few extra microliters of fluid from the walls of the tube. This amount of liquid was enough to resuspend the cell solutions, which was done by carefully flicking the tubes. If more volume needed to be added, wash buffer was used. Cell suspension was transferred to 0.2 ml tubes, placed on ice and immediately transplanted to the brains of littermate mice. One microliter of this solution was injected into each of the following coordinates (relation to bregma): Striatum: 0.5 mm anterior, 2.0 mm lateral, 3.0 mm deep.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joseph Gleeson as the Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jianwei Jiao (Reviewer #2); Sebastian Jessberger (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have been given the opportunity to discuss the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript studies the mechanisms by which specialized astrocytes in distinct anatomic regions, triggered by stoke and decreased notch signaling, initiate a neurogenic program. <italic>Rbpj</italic>, a Notch-mediating transcription factor, is used to modulate Notch signaling with temporal and spatial control. This is a very well executed study that looks at understanding the neurogenic potential of astrocytes in vivo. The authors use scRNAseq to profile genetically traceable astrocytes that have been &quot;induced&quot; to reprogram into neurons. The authors show that deletion of <italic>Rbpj</italic> induces molecular programs that resemble expression profiles of endogenous, neurogenic NSCs (from the SVZ) when <italic>Rbpj</italic> is deleted in striatal areas (more so in the medial parts of the striatum) that are permissive for neurogenesis. In contrast, they find that cortical astrocytes upon <italic>Rbpj</italic> deletion initially enter a NSC-like program but become stalled before differentiating into a transit-amplifying state. Two distinct labeling methods are used and the work is very extensive in its characterization. There are two main findings: 1. That as astrocytes initiate neurogenesis they first become transcriptionally similar to SVZ progenitors; 2. That astrocytes that do not progress to a progenitor state can be induced to do so by administration of EGF (in vivo).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– Can the authors provide a better molecular definition of the astrocyte-derived progenitors. It is clear that they cluster closer to SVZ progenitors, but what are their core genetic signatures (I imagine they will be 30-40 genes)?</p><p>– In the induction (by EGF) experiment, how many astrocytes can now enter the trans-amplifying progenitor stage? Is this a tissue-level effect? What happens to other cells around the astrocytes in response to EGF.</p><p>– The serial numbers in some figure legends are confused and misleading. The authors should consider to put the numbers in front of each sentence rather than at the end of sentence and keep them in series.</p><p>– The description of these figures should be short and clear, which will be easier to read. I suggest that some legend details are better to write in the main text.</p><p>– Figure 5C seems not the regions labeled in B. The signal pattern is different.</p><p>– For Figure 1A, authors need to provide some details about how they analyze DCX+ signal and the standard they used to represent DCX+ with red dots in the Materials and methods.</p><p>– Of course, it would be interesting to see if also cortical astrocytes can be induced to overcome a pre-TAP roadblock by infusion of EGF. This somewhat obvious experiment is missing – at the same time it is not absolutely critical to support the main conclusions of the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59733.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– Can the authors provide a better molecular definition of the astrocyte-derived progenitors.

We now include a list of all genes differentially expressed between striatal astrocytes at ground state versus their stem cell-like pre-division state. This list is included as a tab in Supplementary file 1 and is referred to in the main text (subsection “Parenchymal astrocytes are located upstream of a neural stem cell state and acquire a transcriptional profile of neural stem cells upon their activation”). This gene list provides a detailed view of which genes have been both up- and downregulated compared to ground state astrocytes, which may provide both a better understanding for the astrocyte neurogenic program as well as putative marker genes for the astrocyte stem cell state. For example, one conspicuous group of genes that emerge as highly specific to the astrocytes’ stem cell state are multiple paralogs of the serine-protease inhibitor Serpina3 (Serpina3c, Serpina3f, Serpina3k, Serpina3m, Serpina3n).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the induction (by EGF) experiment, how many astrocytes can now enter the trans-amplifying progenitor stage?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers ask a very interesting question: How many astrocytes can now enter the transit-amplifying stage, i.e. <italic>are now capable</italic> of doing so? Our scRNA-seq data suggest that all astrocytes are <italic>capable</italic> of entering transit-amplifying divisions. Our EGF experiment shows that even a single injection of EGF is enough to double the number of astrocytes that do so. That number is still relatively small: In each brain section analyzed, we find evidence that on the order of tens of striatal astrocytes per brain section have entered transit-amplifying divisions at the time point of our analysis (Ascl1+ clusters plus Dcx+ clusters). There are on the order of 500-1000 striatal tdTomato+ astrocytes per brain section and hemisphere (data not shown). Thus, most <italic>Rbpj</italic>-KO astrocytes had not entered transit-amplifying divisions at the time point of our analysis. However, our EGF administration was highly localized and of very short duration.</p><p>The reviewers’ question can also be interpreted to mean: “If EGF could be administered with optimal concentration, duration and distribution within the striatum, would EGF be capable of recruiting every single stalled <italic>Rbpj</italic>-KO astrocyte into transit-amplifying divisions, or would some astrocytes still be stuck in their stalled state?” Unfortunately, the results from our experiment cannot address this highly interesting question. We have now added a sentence in the manuscript (subsection “Stalled neurogenic astrocytes in the striatum can resume neurogenesis if exposed to EGF”) to mention this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is this a tissue-level effect?</p></disp-quote><p>Our experiment does not provide evidence that EGF induces a tissue-wide re-initiation of astrocyte neurogenesis. We administered EGF very locally using stereotaxic surgery. Even so, the distribution of neurogenic astrocytes remained quite similar as before, with more neurogenic cells in the medial striatum. This suggests that, although EGF manages to push many striatal astrocytes into transit-amplifying divisions, additional mechanisms are likely to regulate this step, and may be identified in the future. We have included a sentence in the manuscript (subsection “Stalled neurogenic astrocytes in the striatum can resume neurogenesis if exposed to EGF”) to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What happens to other cells around the astrocytes in response to EGF.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a panel in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, and a sentence in the main text (subsection “Stalled neurogenic astrocytes in the striatum can resume neurogenesis if exposed to EGF”) to show what happens to both astrocytes and non-astrocytes 48 hours after a striatal EGF injection in wild-type mice. Neither astrocytes nor non-astrocytes show any increased cell division after EGF injection. Figure legends and the Materials and methods have been updated to reflect these additions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The serial numbers in some figure legends are confused and misleading.

The square in Figure 5B has now been adjusted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For Figure 1A, authors need to provide some details about how they analyze DCX+ signal and the standard they used to represent DCX+ with red dots in the Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a relevant point. Because Dcx is a microtubule-binding protein, it shows a filamentous staining pattern that can stretch quite far from the cell nucleus. However, the red dots in Figure 1A represent only the nuclei of Dcx+ cells. (By the way, the same is true for all other Dcx quantifications in the study) Dcx+ cells always show a very bright Dcx signal, so there was no need to define signal-to-noise cutoff levels. We have now specified in the figure legend of Figure 1A that red dots represent nuclei of Dcx+ cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Of course, it would be interesting to see if also cortical astrocytes can be induced to overcome a pre-TAP roadblock by infusion of EGF. This somewhat obvious experiment is missing – at the same time it is not absolutely critical to support the main conclusions of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>EGF injection did not show the same effect in the somatosensory cortex as in the striatum. We now include these data as a panel in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and an explanatory sentence in the main text (subsection “Stalled neurogenic astrocytes in the striatum can resume neurogenesis if exposed to EGF”). Interestingly, however, just inserting a thin syringe needle into the cortex was sufficient to push some cortical <italic>Rbpj</italic>-KO astrocytes into transit-amplifying divisions. We have thoroughly explored the effect of injury in recruiting astrocytes to neurogenesis in two separate studies and found that a stab wound injury in the cortex as well as a striatal stroke promotes this process when Notch signaling is blocked. We now include references to these studies in the aforementioned subsection (Zamboni et al., in press; Santopolo et al., 2020).</p></body></sub-article></article>
