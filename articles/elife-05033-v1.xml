Strikingly, ISRIB addition to stressed cells with pre-formed SGs induced their rapid disassembly, liberating mRNAs into the actively translating pool.

The ISR is mediated by diverse stress-sensing kinases that converge on a common target, serine 51 in eukaryotic translation initiation factor alpha (eIF2α) eliciting both global and gene-specific translational effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wek et al., 2006</xref>). Mammalian genomes encode four eIF2α kinases that drive this response: PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) is activated by the accumulation of unfolded polypeptides in the lumen of the ER, general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase by amino acid starvation and UV light, protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) by viral infection, and heme-regulated eIF2α kinase (HRI) by heme deficiency and redox stress. The eIF2α kinase PERK is also part of the unfolded protein response (UPR). This intracellular stress signaling network is comprised of three ER-localized transmembrane sensors, IRE1, ATF6, and PERK, which initiate unique signaling cascades upon sensing an increase in unfolded proteins in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pavitt and Ron, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The common mediator of the ISR, eIF2α, is a subunit of an essential translation initiation factor conserved throughout eukaryotes and archaea. The heterotrimeric eIF2 complex (composed of subunits α, β and γ) brings initiator methionyl tRNA (Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>) to translation initiation complexes and mediates start codon recognition. It binds GTP along with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> to form a ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>) that assembles, along with the 40S ribosomal subunit and several other initiation factors, into the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC). The 43S PIC is recruited to the 5′ methylguanine cap of an mRNA and scans the 5′UTR for an AUG initiation codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hinnebusch and Lorsch, 2012</xref>). Start site codon recognition triggers GTP hydrolysis and phosphate release, which is followed by release of eIF2 from the 40S subunit, allowing binding of the 60S ribosomal subunit to join. After these events, the elongation phase of protein synthesis ensues. To engage in a new round of initiation, the newly released eIF2 complex has to be re-loaded with GTP, a reaction catalyzed by its dedicated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), the heteropentameric eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B). Phosphorylation of eIF2α does not directly affect its function in the PIC, but rather inhibits eIF2B, thereby depleting ternary complex and reducing translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2001</xref>). eIF2B complex is limiting in cells, present in lower abundance than eIF2; a small amount of phospho-eIF2α therefore acts as a competitive inhibitor with dramatic effects on eIF2B activity. When eIF2B is inhibited and ternary complex is unavailable, the rate of translation initiation decreases.</p><p>Unimpaired elongation in the face of reduced initiation allows translating ribosomes to run off of their mRNAs, generating naked mRNAs that can then bind to RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and form messenger ribonucleoproteins, which can further assemble into stress granules (SGs). These cytoplasmic, non-membrane bounded organelles contain translationally stalled and silent mRNAs, 40S ribosomal subunits and their associated pre-initiation factors and RBPs; these RBPs facilitate the nucleation and reversible aggregation of SGs through reversible, low-affinity protein–protein interactions mediated by their low complexity domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchan and Parker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kedersha and Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kato et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Paradoxically, under conditions of reduced ternary complex formation and protein synthesis, a group of mRNAs is translationally up-regulated. These mRNAs contain short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5′ UTRs, which are required for their ISR-responsive translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). These target transcripts include mammalian ATF4 (a cAMP response element binding transcription factor) and CHOP (a pro-apoptotic transcription factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vattem and Wek, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palam et al., 2011</xref>). ATF4 regulates the transcription of many genes involved in metabolism and nutrient uptake and thus is a major regulator of the transcriptional changes that ensue upon eIF2α phosphorylation and ISR induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding et al., 2003</xref>). Although activation of this cellular program can initially mitigate the stress and confer cytoprotection, persistent and severe stress and its associated reduction in protein synthesis and CHOP activation lead to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In animals, the ISR has been implicated in diverse processes ranging from the regulation of insulin production to learning and memory. These effects were studied first using genetics by generating knock-out mice lacking individual eIF2α kinases as well as a knock-in of the non-phosphorylatable allele eIF2α<sup>S51A</sup> (Eif2s1<sup>S51A</sup>). Homozygous loss of eIF2α phosphorylation leads to perinatal death but heterozygous eIF2α<sup>+/S51A</sup> animals, which have reduced levels of eIF2α phosphorylation, grow into healthy adults showing phenotypes that demonstrate the importance of translation initiation in establishment of long-term memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheuner et al., 2001</xref>). Behavioral tests demonstrated that PKR<sup>−/−</sup>, GCN2<sup>−/−</sup> and eIF2α<sup>+/S51A</sup> animals display enhanced memory consolidation in learning paradigms of light training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). Pharmacological modulation of eIF2α phosphorylation represented an important advance, allowing easier discrimination between developmental and acute effects of ISR reduction and circumventing the lethal phenotype of homozygous eIF2α<sup>S51A/S51A</sup>. Recent work identified small molecules that modulate the ISR pathway at distinct steps: (1) kinase inhibitors that target PERK or PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jammi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atkins et al., 2013</xref>); (2) an activator of HRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2011</xref>); (3) salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2α phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyce et al., 2005</xref>); and (4) ISRIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>). By a yet unknown mechanism, ISRIB blunts the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation in cells and thus represents the first bona fide ISR inhibitor acting downstream of all eIF2α kinases.</p><p>Here, we show that ISRIB reverses comprehensively and specifically the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation. By profiling the genome-wide translational program downstream of the ISR, we present the application of ribosome profiling to the ISR in mammalian cells, which allowed us to identify and quantify the translational changes that take place upon its induction and ISRIB treatment. Moreover, live cell imaging revealed that ISRIB addition can trigger a remarkably fast dissolution of phospho-eIF2α-dependent SGs in stressed cells, restoring translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ribosome profiling of ER stress in mammalian cells</title><p>We used ribosome profiling to characterize translational changes induced by ER stress.

We triggered the UPR in HEK293T cells by treating them with tunicamycin (Tm), a toxin that blocks N-linked glycosylation of ER-resident proteins. We chose to analyze an early time point (1 hr) in order to focus on translational changes preceding the extensive transcriptional induction that takes place upon activation of the three branches of the UPR (for a time course of UPR induction, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> in 10.7554/eLife.00498). After 1 hr of Tm or mock treatment, we added cycloheximide (CHX) to arrest translating ribosomes, lysed the cells, and digested the extract with nuclease to degrade mRNAs not protected by ribosomes. In parallel, we isolated total mRNAs to monitor any changes in mRNA levels. Ribosome profiling data revealed a discrete subset of mRNAs that were translationally up- or down-regulated more than twofold after UPR induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, above or below box) as seen by changes in abundance of ribosome-protected fragments (RPF) (‘Ribo-Seq’, y-axis) without corresponding changes in mRNA levels (‘mRNA-Seq’, x-axis).

The mRNAs encoding the closely paralogous transcription factors ATF4 and ATF5 are known translational targets of the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vattem and Wek, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). They contain two uORFs (the second one overlapping with the coding sequence [CDS]) that govern their enhanced translational efficiency. The mRNAs encoding the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP and the regulatory subunit of the eIF2α phosphatase GADD34 were also significantly upregulated at the translational level. Although both CHOP and GADD34 are also known transcriptional targets of ATF4, we did not detect significant induction of their mRNAs at this early time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lack of displacement along x-axis) indicating that at the time point chosen our analysis exclusively reports on translational effects. CHOP and GADD34 mRNAs also contain uORFs that allow for translational regulation upon eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palam et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We identified a total of 78 mRNAs whose translation changed significantly and substantially (more than twofold) upon ER stress in HEK293T cells (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2A</xref>). GO term analysis revealed the involvement of these genes in diverse functions and several encode for proteins with entirely unknown functions.

Analysis of RPFs in the uORFs of the SLC35A4 and ATF4 mRNAs revealed significant ribosome density, further confirming that these regulatory uORFs are normally translated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, ISRIB comprehensively blocked the translational changes that take place upon ER-stress. A large number of genes with a significant change in expression upon stress collapsed to the center of the plot with ISRIB and Tm co-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, highlighted in black). Importantly, ISRIB abolished the induction of the known phospho-eIF2α-dependent translational targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, colored pink) and the seven ISR-translational targets with previously identified uORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, colored green).

Taken together, these data strongly support the notion that ISRIB does not have global effects on translation, transcription, or mRNA stability in non-stressed cells and underscores its remarkable ability to counteract selectively the translational changes elicited by eIF2α phosphorylation in stressed cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ISRIB prevents formation of stress granules exclusively triggered by eIF2α phosphorylation</title><p>Phosphorylation of eIF2α and reduction of ternary complex formation are tightly linked to the formation of stress granules (SGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kedersha et al., 2002</xref>). ISRIB renders cells insensitive to the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation, thus leading to the prediction that it prevents SG formation as well. We tested this hypothesis by inducing SG formation using thapsigargin (Tg), a potent ER stressor that inhibits the ER calcium pump and was recently shown by ribosome profiling to yield analogous translational effects to tunicamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reid et al., 2014</xref>). Microscopic detection of SGs required a stronger induction of ER stress than commonly achieved with Tm, making Tg the preferred inducer. We monitored SGs by performing immunofluorescence on eIF3a, a translation initiation factor that is recruited into SGs. As expected, we found that ISRIB significantly reduced their assembly upon co-treatment with Tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). In addition, ISRIB prevented SG formation induced by arsenite (Ars), another widely used inducer of eIF2α phosphorylation via activation of HRI. As expected, both treatments induced eIF2α phosphorylation but only Tg induced the ER-resident kinase, PERK, as seen by its shift in mobility that is due to its extensive auto-phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Both the PERK mobility shift and eIF2α phosphorylation elicited by Tg treatment were blocked by a PERK inhibitor (GSK707800; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Axten et al., 2012</xref>) but not by ISRIB.

This observation as well as other pharmacological and microscopy data revealed that SGs are highly dynamic structures with mRNAs quickly shuttling in and out. When these mRNAs leave SGs, translation is reinitiated; CHX then immobilizes elongating ribosomes and prevents mRNA re-entry into SGs. Because polyribosome disassembly is blocked by CHX yet required for SG assembly, CHX treatment dissolves pre-formed SGs.

We showed that ISRIB administration enhances long-term memory in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, we showed by electrical recordings in brain slices that by preventing AMPAR down-regulation in the post-synaptic neuron, ISRIB blocks mGluR-mediated long-term depression (LTD), an effect that is dependent on eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Prisco et al., 2014</xref>). Comprehensive analyses of the cellular effects and kinetics of action of ISRIB are critical for interpretation of its in vivo effects and assessment of its therapeutic potential.</p><p>Our translational and transcriptional profiling confirmed that ISRIB treatment of ER-stressed cells substantially and comprehensively blocks the translational effects of eIF2α phosphorylation.

The stress-induced, uORF-mediated regulation of GCN4 translation in yeast established the paradigm for this mode of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dever et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grant et al., 1995</xref>). As in mammalian cells, GCN2 is activated in amino acid-starved yeast by the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs, catalyzing eIF2α phosphorylation. The transcript encoding GCN4, a bZIP transcription factor with homology to mammalian ATF4, has four uORFs that modulate translation of its coding sequence upon stress. GCN4 induction is thought to occur via a re-scanning mechanism that allows 40S ribosomal subunits to remain mRNA-bound after completing the translation of short reading frames and subsequently reinitiate in the downstream coding sequence after reloading with ternary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). The select mRNAs that are translationally upregulated in mammalian cells have uORFs that vary in number, length, and distance from the coding sequences. As was observed for GCN4, the uORF2 of ATF4 mRNA showed ribosome density, supporting the notion that it is translated under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>). Whether the same mechanism of rescanning is utilized by all these mRNAs is not known but, like ATF4, their regulation depends on their uORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vattem and Wek, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palam et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>SLC35A4 is a novel translational target of the ISR. Ribosome profiling of HEK293T cells upon arsenite treatment, a potent inducer of eIF2α phosphorylation, also revealed the increased synthesis of SLC35A4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreev et al., 2015</xref>). It belongs to a large family of nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) that are highly conserved transmembrane antiporters localized to the ER or Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song, 2013</xref>). The role of SLC35A4 in cells is unknown but it may function as the elusive ER-localized UDP-glucose transporter. This hypothesis is particularly attractive in the context of our data because unfolded ER proteins, which trigger the ISR, are continuously de- and re-glucosylated on their N-glycans using UDP-glucose as the glucose donor. Proteins with monoglucosylated N-glycans bind calnexin or calreticulin which promote protein folding. Translational induction of SLC35A4 may thus quickly enhance UDP-glucose transport into the ER lumen upon the accumulation of unfolded proteins in order to promote this pro-folding pathway.</p><p>Ribosome profiling upon activation of the UPR uncovered additional mRNAs induced upon eIF2α phosphorylation (our data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reid et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreev et al., 2015</xref>). Several of these mRNAs encode for proteins with entirely unknown functions and the remaining targets are involved in a wide range of cellular processes. Whether these ISR-induced translational targets are similarly regulated by the presence of uORFs in their 5′ UTRs remains to be determined with the construction of synthetic translational reporters. ISRIB blocked their differential translation, suggesting that these changes were due to phospho-eIF2α. There may be additional transcripts that are synthesized later during ISR activation, downstream of the early transcription factor targets such as ATF4, as well as tissue-specific mRNAs that are controlled by phospho-eIF2α. For example, OPHN1 is a neuron-specific mRNA containing uORFs that is translationally upregulated after mGluR engagement and eIF2α phosphorylation and induces LTD. By blocking the effects of phospho-eIF2α in cells, ISRIB also blocks mGluR-dependent LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Prisco et al., 2014</xref>). Ribosome profiling of glutamatergic neurons upon ISR induction may reveal additional transcripts whose translational control contributes to the molecular events underlying memory.</p><p>The ribosome profiling data presented here revealed that eIF2α phosphorylation modestly, yet significantly, decreased translation of a large number of ribosomal proteins and elongation factors. Although the decrease in translation of ribosomal proteins and elongation factors upon eIF2α phosphorylation is small in magnitude, its effects on bulk protein synthesis in the cell are significant as these represent a large number of highly expressed proteins. Translation of these mRNAs was previously shown to be under control of mTOR kinase, which regulates mRNA cap-binding factor eIF4E via phosphorylation of inhibitory eIF4E-binding proteins, thereby adjusting protein synthesis in cells in response to the cell's energy and nutrient status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma and Blenis, 2009</xref>). In this way, mTOR preferentially regulates translation of a group of mRNAs characterized by 5′ TOP motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsieh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thoreen et al., 2012</xref>). Upon mTOR inhibition, translation of 5′ TOP mRNAs is reduced and the expression of factors required for protein synthesis is diminished.</p><p>The observed effect that eIF2α phosphorylation preferentially decreased translation of 5′ TOP mRNAs could, in principle, be due to inhibition of mTOR in response to ER stress. However, ISRIB reversed the translational changes, indicating that they are likely to be downstream consequences of eIF2α phosphorylation. Thus, if these translational changes do reflect altered mTOR activity, then the change in mTOR signaling must result from reduced translation mediated by eIF2α phosphorylation. Alternatively, eIF2α phosphorylation may lead to silencing of these mRNAs by recruiting them into SGs. The RNA binding proteins TIA-1 and TIAR, which are prominently SG-associated, were previously shown to bind to TOP mRNAs, leading to their translational downregulation upon amino acid starvation. This effect required both mTOR inhibition and GCN2 activation, the latter resulting in eIF2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Damgaard and Lykke-Andersen, 2011</xref>). SGs also have been shown to recruit signaling molecules including upstream negative regulators of mTORC1 (raptor and DYRK3) and mTORC1 itself, and thus, SG formation may reduce their presence in the cytosol and impede translation of 5′ TOP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thedieck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wippich et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Stress granule dynamics and ISRIB</title><p>The dynamic nature of SGs allowed us to monitor the action of ISRIB upon its addition to live cells in real time. Strikingly, addition of ISRIB to stressed cells with pre-formed SGs lead to their quick dissolution (less than 5 min), liberating mRNAs back into the translational pool. A pulse of [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine confirmed the fast recovery in protein synthesis even in the presence of stress. Although the molecular target of ISRIB remains unknown, its quick action suggests a direct effect on translation initiation. Phospho-eIF2α resistance has been observed both in yeast and in mammalian cells. In yeast, mutations in eIF2B (the GEF for eIF2) and eIF5 (the 48S PIC-associated GTPase-activating protein for eIF2) have been reported to make cells insensitive to this phosphorylation event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vazquez de Aldana and Hinnebusch, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavitt et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">1998</xref>). In mammalian cells, TLR4 engagement in macrophages leads to increased eIF2B activity by removal of an inhibitory phosphorylation and insensitivity to ISR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woo et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, ISRIB may directly or indirectly enhance the activity of eIF2B, eIF5, or other initiation factors, thus quickly reversing the cellular effects of phosphorylated eIF2α.</p><p>SGs contain a large number of RBPs that harbor low complexity sequence domains that nucleate through transient, low affinity interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). These RBPs usually contain several RNA-binding domains and can associate with more than one mRNA; this multi-valency further favors the coalescence of RNA-protein granules. A conspicuous feature of some degenerative diseases is the cytoplasmic or nuclear aggregation of RBPs, driven in some cases by pathogenic mutations. TDP-43 and FUS mutations are found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2013</xref>), and mutations in hnRNPA1 and hnRPNPA2/B1 have also been found in ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Recent reports have also described the presence of RNA and RBPs in aggregates that form in prion disease, tauopathies, and Alzheimer's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vanderweyde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ash et al., 2014</xref>). The impact of these cytosolic aggregates on SG dynamics is not known, though they may hamper the ability of SGs to properly dissolve, thereby contributing to sustained translational attenuation and neurodegeneration. By quickly disassembling SGs even in the presence of stress, ISRIB may provide a useful therapeutic intervention in these diseases by antagonizing the cellular effects of pathogenic RNA-protein assemblies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Tunicamycin was obtained from Calbiochem EMB Bioscience.

Your article has been evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers recognized the significance of your attempt to further characterize the consequences of ISRIB application to stressed cells and the potential for such a study to serve as an important advance. The methodology you chose to evaluate the impact on mRNA translation by ribosome profiling and on stress granule formation, by imaging, was likewise deemed appropriate to the task. However, the individual reviews and the consultative process that followed uncovered important problems concerning the interpretability of the data and the validity of the conclusions drawn. These problems are rather pervasive and it will not be possible for the Reviewing editor to decide alone if a revised version would be suited for publication. Thus, if you decide to revise your paper in accordance with the stipulations below, please bear in mind that it will need to be reviewed again by all three reviewers.</p><p>1) Detailed information concerning the Ribo-Seq experiments is missing: How many million mapped reads and how many replicates were done for each sample? The worry that data set may be inadequate is compounded by an impression that the read density for those elements of data that are presented in detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, for example) is rather low.</p><p>2) Significance figures for RNA transcript abundance are not reported.</p><p>3) The full power of single base resolution of the RPF analysis is not harnessed to de-convolute the effects of stress and ISRIB on the translation of uORFs in ATF4 and ATF5. It should be possible to assign reads to either the uORF or the main ORF even when they are overlapping as the reading frame is different.</p><p>4) The central conclusions of the paper, that ISRIB eliminated the effects of stress on translational regulation and that ISRIB is equivalent to mutations that abolish the ISR are not supported by the data. Numerous mRNA are differentially engaged by ribosomes in stressed &amp; ISRIB treated sample(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) compared to the stressed PERK<sup>-/-</sup> cells (the benchmark used here for an ISR-inhibited system, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These experiments may be further confounded by a methodological issue in that the cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> were apparently treated with tunicamycin for 1 hour, whereas those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> for 30 minutes. These issue needs to be dealt with in some detail.</p><p>5) The effects of ISRIB on stress granule formation in the images shown seem convincing. But these need to be quantified and analyzed with appropriate statistical tools.</p><p>The reviewers’ individual comments are noted below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>This manuscript provides new experiments building on those published in a 2013 <italic>eLife</italic> article concerning the mechanism of action of an ISR inhibitor compounds called ISRIB.</p><p>The authors use complimentary techniques to those used in their original study to provide additional support to their model that ISRIB acts to nullify the downstream signalling events following induction of eIF2 phosphorylation. Two experimental strategies are employed here: 1) Ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) of cells to examine global translational control responses to ISR and its inhibition and 2) cell imaging via immunofluorescence and also live-cell GFP to examine the appearance of stress granules and P bodies-markers of cellular stress. Both of these analyses appear to confirm and extend the findings reported in the original study, but do not yet identify the mechanism by which the inhibitor ISRIB nullifies the ISR.</p><p>My major concerns are with the robustness of the data reported. In its present version this is not possible to fully assess.</p><p>1) For RNA and Ribo-Seq experiments, there is no information given concerning the depth of sequencing. How many million mapped reads and how many replicates were done for each sample?</p><p>2) The significant changes in ribosome occupancy are reported in supplementary tables, but changes in RNA transcript abundance are not reported. This data should also be added to the manuscript.</p><p>3) For the Ribo-Seq fold changes reported, how are reads mapping to overlapping ORFs handled? Eg <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, shows reads covering the uORFs (green) and main ORFs (blue) that overlap.</p><p>4) Is the read density data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> reporting a single representative sample, total summed reads from replicates (if done) or mean reads from multiple replicates? The read density is not very high for any of the genes shown, except for ATF4.</p><p>5) Can the authors confirm and comment on the presence of RPFs between the annotated uORF and main ORF for CHOP mRNA?</p><p>6) One perhaps unexpected finding was an apparent increase in uORF RPFs following stress. The authors have chosen not to elaborate on this point. The usual translational control models depicted often show an all or nothing extreme response, but it is not surprising at all that there are still ribosomes on uORFs that may get skipped more frequently under stress conditions. Perhaps an important measure of control is the proportion of ribosomes that skip uORF2 in ATF4 and 5. This could be quantified as the Ribo-Seq read data for the overlapping ORF regions should be in separate reading frames. It should be possible to assign reads to either the uORF or the main ORF. As a measure of stress mediated translational control, the authors could quantify the number and proportion of RPF within the ORFs key for translational control. For ATF4 and ATF5 ORF/uORF2 reads would give an alternative readout of the relative translational control.</p><p>7) Blots showing eIF2 phosphorylation relative to total eIF2 should be in each type of cell used (plus minus) treatment for the time points used in the Ribo Seq study. This could be added to the ATF4 blot which uses different time points.</p><p>8) For the immunofluorescence experiments and for the GFP experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and 4 and Figure 4–figure supplement 1, each experiment requires quantification of a larger number of cells than are shown in each representative image. For example in 100 cells in each of three separate experiments what proportion of cells (plus minus) error contain stress granules or P bodies as appropriate. Such an analysis would enable statistical treatment of the significance of the observations made.</p><p>9) What is the effect of the ISR and ISRIB on the other arms of the UPR at the times used here. Are sampling times too early to observe XBP1 splicing and changes in ribosome binding? If they are this should be stated, if they are not it would helpful to show XBP1 reads.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors study the role of ISRIB, a small molecule targeting the integrated stress response (ISR) in two experimental systems: Ribosome profiling and stress-granules formation. The study of the ISR by ribosome profiling essentially confirms earlier studies. The effect of ISRIB and stress granules is surprising and novel, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. While the study is potentially interesting, there are some important issues to address.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, there is a disconnection between the data and the conclusions. I will only highlight the major ones here:</p><p>1) One of the central conclusions of the paper is that ISRIB eliminated the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation. The authors wrote: “The translational output of ISRIB-treated cells to ER stress was remarkably similar to that of cells with a genetically ablated ISR”. This contradicts the data. In fact, there are major differences between the two data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and 2C</xref>). I recommend providing a complete list of genes that change after ISRIB treatment and to study these changes, as it may shed light on ISRIB's function and/or target.</p><p>Supporting the idea that the changes caused by ISRIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) are actually tractable, ISRIB caused more changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) than Tm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The secret of ISRIB's function may be hidden in this dataset. This needs to be documented and exploited.</p><p>A related issue: The authors conclude that “ISRIB does not have general off-targets effects on translation, transcription or mRNA stability.”</p><p>Again, this contradicts the data. Beside, “off-target” is a not suitable here, since we don't know what is the target of ISRIB.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>: What are the vertical lines on PERK blots? Between first and second lane in the top blot and between the 9th and 10th lane in the bottom blot.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>: It would be good to see images with better resolution to appreciate the localization of eIF3α, which looks very interesting. I still see some stress-granules on Ars+ISRIB in some cells but in most cells, the signal is too strong to be analyzed. It would be good to see images of better resolution and some quantitative assessment of the effects.</p><p>4) The disappearance of stress-granules is the impressive finding of the manuscript but how does this all happen? It is difficult to follow what might be going on because of the lack of consistency in the conditions used and because adequate controls are not presented. From this paper and the previous one, it would appear that ISRIB acts upstream of ATF4 translation and is dependent upon eIF2α-P (but without affecting the latter)? This needs to be explored further to get some understanding of what is happening.</p><p>Figure 4C: It would be good to present gels to show the effects, as the authors have the images already. It would be interesting to appreciate the qualitative changes in translation. Does this match, what is seen by ribosome profiling?</p><p>5) The Discussion is very broad and not connected to the current dataset. The first sentence of the Discussion is incorrect, as there are other antagonists of the ISR. I suggest two options for a revised discussion: Either to focus the discussion on the current dataset or to provide additional data inline with the discussion (mTOR signaling and the ISR, memory and stress granules, memory and ribosome profiling data).</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: I didn't understand this panel. It needs to be clarified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p>This study provides an important extension validating the compound ISRIB as a highly specific inhibitor of the canonical eIF2α-phosphorylation-dependent Integrated Stress Response. Given that original report was published in <italic>eLife</italic>, this present paper is most suitable as a linked research advance.</p><p>The most important finding is that the effects of ISRIB on mRNA translation, revealed by the unbiased tool of ribosome foot-print profiling and mRNA sequencing, are limited to effacement of the translational induction of a small set (five in total) of mRNAs that are translationally upregulated by the ISR. In this regard, ISRIB discretely mimics the effects of mutations that block eIF2α phosphorylation, either by interfering with the action of the upstream kinase (PERK-KO) or by precluding substrate phosphorylation in cis (eIF2α<sup>S51A</sup>).</p><p>Further support for a comprehensive defect in the ISR, introduced by ISRIB, is provided by evidence that stress granules (these are mysterious collections of mRNA binding proteins and translation factors that assemble in cells experiencing high levels of phosphorylated eIF2α) are rapidly disassembled by ISRIB.</p><p>In passing, this paper makes an important contribution to the study of the ISR: By confirming that its known positively regulated targets, cobbled together from biased searches (ATF4, ATF5, CHOP, GADD34), comprise a nearly complete list; the single newcomer being SLC35A. And by drawing attention to the fact that their translational induction by the ISR does not entail the loss of footprints on the short repressive uORFs (as predicted by the regulated translation re-initiation model).</p><p>An important caveat to these complementary comments is that this reviewer lacks the expertise to judge the technical validity of the RNA seq and ribosome footprinting and defers to other reviewers' expertise in this regard.</p><p>The lack of any measureable effect of ISRIB on baseline translation is surprising as there is evidence for basal activity of the ISR: For example PERK_KO, eIF2a_S51A and ATF4_KO cells all share a strong baseline requirement for amino acid supplementation (likely indicating that the ISR contributes to baseline ATF4-mediated gene expression). The authors may wish to comment on this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05033.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All three reviewers recognized the significance of your attempt to further characterize the consequences of ISRIB application to stressed cells and the potential for such a study to serve as an important advance.

Due to the intrinsic differences in kinetics and degree of UPR induction between MEFs and HEK293T cells, we now focus only on the ribosome profiling data generated in the latter. As reported in our previous <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript (10.7554/eLife.00498), in HEK293T cells, we observe a complete block both in ATF4 translational induction and bulk translational down regulation upon co-treatment with ISRIB, making it our cell line of choice to study the genome-wide effects of ISRIB. As requested by the reviewers, we include biological replicates for both Ribo-Seq and paired mRNA seq-data in all conditions reported in this cell type. Correlation coefficients between replicates and mRNA abundance for all genes are provided in new supplementary figures.</p><p>2) We included uORF ribosome occupancy for only the two highest expressed ISR-translational targets for which we obtained sufficient coverage in reads for both mRNA and Ribo-Seq data. We removed the uORF ribosome occupancy upon ER-stress plots as new insights pertaining to the mechanism of translation and rescanning of the uORFs in translationally stress-induced genes will require substantial further experimentation and would extend beyond the scope of this work. The primary goal of this Research Advance is to further characterize the biological effects of the small molecule ISRIB.</p><p>3) We have quantitated all stress granule data.</p><p>As requested, we have reworded the title to read “The Small Molecule ISRIB Reverses the Effects of eIF2α Phosphorylation on Translation and Stress Granule Assembly”.</p><p><italic>1) Detailed information concerning the Ribo-Seq experiments is missing: How many million mapped reads and how many replicates were done for each sample? The worry that data set may be inadequate is compounded by an impression that the read density for those elements of data that are presented in detail (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, for example) is rather low</italic>.</p><p>The Ribo-Seq and mRNA-seq data in HEK293T cells was performed in duplicate (biological replicates) for each condition.

We will prepare a GEO submission for all datasets.</p><p>We have now included only ATF4 and SLC35A4, the two highest expressed ISR-targets, in our ribosome footprinting and mRNA read density plots along the genes (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>), for which we have sufficient coverage.</p><p><italic>2) Significance figures for RNA transcript abundance are not reported</italic>.</p><p>We have included mean normalized counts for all transcripts in all conditions tested in Figure 1–figure supplement 9.</p><p><italic>3) The full power of single base resolution of the RPF analysis is not harnessed to de-convolute the effects of stress and ISRIB on the translation of uORFs in ATF4 and ATF5. It should be possible to assign reads to either the uORF or the main ORF even when they are overlapping as the reading frame is different</italic>.</p><p>Due to the fact that all Ribo-Seq data in this manuscript was generated using cycloheximide to freeze translating ribososomes, and this may lead to an artifactual increase in 5’UTR ribosome occupancy, we have not quantitatively analyzed changes in uORF occupancy. Carefully de-convoluting uORF occupancy upon stress and ISRIB treatment will require further experimentation (including the use of a translation initiation inhibitor treatment to generate libraries). This analysis extends beyond the scope of the current Research Advance.</p><p><italic>4) The central conclusions of the paper, that ISRIB eliminated the effects of stress on translational regulation and that ISRIB is equivalent to mutations that abolish the ISR are not supported by the data. Numerous mRNA are differentially engaged by ribosomes in stressed &amp; ISRIB treated sample(s) (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref><italic>) compared to the stressed PERK</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> <italic>cells (the benchmark used here for an ISR-inhibited system,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref><italic>). These experiments may be further confounded by a methodological issue in that the cells shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref> <italic>were apparently treated with tunicamycin for 1 hour, whereas those in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref> <italic>for 30 minutes. These issue needs to be dealt with in some detail</italic>.</p><p>We have excluded the MEF data, and, because of differences observed between cell lines, we no longer benchmark PERK<sup>-/-</sup> or eIF2α as an ISR-inhibited system. Importantly, we show that ISRIB comprehensively blocks translational upregulation of the vast majority of the mRNAs in HEK293T cells, including the well-established ISR translational targets ATF4, ATF5, CHOP and GADD34. Both the previously submitted manuscript as well as the current one contain tables that list for each condition the translationally upregulated mRNAs.</p><p><italic>5) The effects of ISRIB on stress granule formation in the images shown seem convincing. But these need to be quantified and analyzed with appropriate statistical tools</italic>.</p><p>We have quantified all stress granule data and added the corresponding quantitation panels to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref> with their corresponding statistics in each figure legend.</p><p><italic>The reviewers’ individual comments are noted below</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p><italic>[…] My major concerns are with the robustness of the data reported.

The read density is not very high for any of the genes shown, except for ATF4</italic>.</p><p>The read density represents the total reads of two replicates. We have only included ATF4 and SLC35A4, which have sufficient overall higher read density to draw strong conclusions.</p><p><italic>5) Can the authors confirm and comment on the presence of RPFs between the annotated uORF and main ORF for CHOP mRNA</italic>?</p><p>The data have been removed.</p><p><italic>6) One perhaps unexpected finding was an apparent increase in uORF RPFs following stress. The authors have chosen not to elaborate on this point. The usual translational control models depicted often show an all or nothing extreme response, but it is not surprising at all that there are still ribosomes on uORFs that may get skipped more frequently under stress conditions. Perhaps an important measure of control is the proportion of ribosomes that skip uORF2 in ATF4 and 5. This could be quantified as the Ribo-Seq read data for the overlapping ORF regions should be in separate reading frames. It should be possible to assign reads to either the uORF or the main ORF. As a measure of stress mediated translational control, the authors could quantify the number and proportion of RPF within the ORFs key for translational control. For ATF4 and ATF5 ORF/uORF2 reads would give an alternative readout of the relative translational control</italic>.</p><p>The data are no longer presented in the manuscript. The analysis of remaining uORF occupancy in the face of downstream ORF translation will require extensive additional studies.</p><p><italic>7) Blots showing eIF2 phosphorylation relative to total eIF2 should be in each type of cell used (plus minus) treatment for the time points used in the Ribo-Seq study. This could be added to the ATF4 blot which uses different time points</italic>.</p><p>The ATF4 blot has been removed as it related to the MEFs data. We have reported time courses of eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 production in HEK293T cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> of our original <italic>eLife</italic> paper (10.7554/eLife.00498). We do not detect phospho-eIF2α phosphorylation or ATF4 production after only 1 hour of Tm treatment by Western blot analysis, which is the condition used for ribo and mRNA-seq analysis. Ribo-Seq analysis is a more sensitive method than Western blotting to detect the early translational changes upon ER-stress.</p><p><italic>8) For the immunofluorescence experiments and for the GFP experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figures 3</italic></xref> <italic>and 4 and Figure 4</italic>–<italic>figure supplement 1, each experiment requires quantification of a larger number of cells than are shown in each representative image. For example in 100 cells in each of three separate experiments what proportion of cells (plus minus) error contain stress granules or P bodies as appropriate. Such an analysis would enable statistical treatment of the significance of the observations made</italic>.</p><p>The quantitation was added to the stress granule data.</p><p><italic>9) What is the effect of the ISR and ISRIB on the other arms of the UPR at the times used here. Are sampling times too early to observe XBP1 splicing and changes in ribosome binding? If they are this should be stated, if they are not it would helpful to show XBP1 reads</italic>.</p><p>At the time points analyzed, it is too early to detect changes in XBP1 mRNA splicing. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> of our original <italic>eLife</italic> paper (10.7554/eLife.00498), we looked at XBP1s induction upon Tm treatment in HEK293T cells. XBP1s production lags ATF4 translational upregulation and is not detected at 1 hour of Tm treatment. We also reported in our previous manuscript that ISRIB treatment or blocking the PERK branch of the UPR does not alter activation of IRE1 and XBP1 splicing but it prolongs activation of this branch as measured both by IRE1-GFP foci formation and XBP1 splicing (Figure 5C and Figure 5–figure supplement 2).</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p><italic>[…] While the study is potentially interesting, there are some important issues to address</italic>.</p><p><italic>Major issues</italic>:</p><p><italic>Throughout the manuscript, there is a disconnection between the data and the conclusions. I will only highlight the major ones here</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) One of the central conclusions of the paper is that ISRIB eliminated the effects of eIF2</italic>α <italic>phosphorylation. The authors wrote: “The translational output of ISRIB-treated cells to ER stress was remarkably similar to that of cells with a genetically ablated ISR”. This contradicts the data. In fact, there are major differences between the two data sets (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A and 2C</italic></xref><italic>). I recommend providing a complete list of genes that change after ISRIB treatment and to study these changes, as it may shed light on ISRIB's function and/or target</italic>.</p><p>We have removed the MEF data and thus we do no longer compare ISR-ablated cells with ISRIB-treated cells. In both the original submitted <italic>eLife</italic> Research Advance and in the revised manuscript, we have provided a list of genes that are significantly and substantially translationally upregulated in all conditions reported (Tm, Tm + ISRIB and ISRIB alone). We have carefully analyzed the genes that remain translationally upregulated in the presence of Tm + ISRIB. Unfortunately they are all hypothetical proteins with unknown functions and thus do not shed light on ISRIB function. Some of these uncharacterized genes are also down regulated in the presence of ISRIB alone.</p><p><italic>Supporting the idea that the changes caused by ISRIB (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>) are actually tractable, ISRIB caused more changes (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>) than Tm (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref><italic>). The secret of ISRIB's function may be hidden in this dataset. This needs to be documented and exploited</italic>.</p><p>As stated above, ISRIB changes have been documented. Compared to Tm treatment, ISRIB induced changes are small.</p><p><italic>A related issue: The authors conclude that “ISRIB does not have general off-targets effects on translation, transcription or mRNA stability.” Again, this contradicts the data. Beside, “off-target” is a not suitable here, since we don't know what is the target of ISRIB</italic>.</p><p>We have removed off-target from the text. The ribosome and mRNA genome-wide profiling data demonstrates that ISRIB comprehensively blocks the translational effects driven by UPR activation and eIF2α phosphorylation and does not lead to overall and spurious changes in mRNA levels or translation.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref><italic>: What are the vertical lines on PERK blots? Between first and second lane in the top blot and between the 9th and 10th lane in the bottom blot</italic>.</p><p>All lanes were contiguous in the blots.

I still see some stress-granules on Ars+ISRIB in some cells but in most cells, the signal is too strong to be analyzed. It would be good to see images of better resolution and some quantitative assessment of the effects</italic>.</p><p>Quantitative assessment was included for all stress granule data. Immunofluorescence data of <italic>eIF3α</italic> with all stressors used in this paper has been previously published.</p><p><italic>4) The disappearance of stress-granules is the impressive finding of the manuscript but how does this all happen? It is difficult to follow what might be going on because of the lack of consistency in the conditions used and because adequate controls are not presented. From this paper and the previous one, it would appear that ISRIB acts upstream of ATF4 translation and is dependent upon eIF2</italic>α<italic>-P (but without affecting the latter)? This needs to be explored further to get some understanding of what is happening</italic>.</p><p>The goal of using different stressors was to distinguish between phospho-eIF2α-dependent (thapsigargin and arsenite) and independent (panteamine A and hippuristanol) stress granule formation. As expected by the ability of ISRIB to make cells resistant to the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation, the small molecule was able to block only phospho-eIF2α-dependent stress granule formation. ATF4 is downstream of eIF2α phosphorylation and thus it is also blocked by ISRIB. The mechanism of action of the drug will await identification of its molecular target.</p><p><italic>Figure 4C: It would be good to present gels to show the effects, as the authors have the images already. It would be interesting to appreciate the qualitative changes in translation. Does this match, what is seen by ribosome profiling</italic>?</p><p>We have included the gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>. The live cell imaging and <sup>35</sup>S-methionine incorporation and recovery experiments were performed in U2OS cells expressing G3BP-GFP using the potent ER-stressor, thapsigargin. It is not the same cell type or the same ER-stressor (tunicamycin) used in the ribosome footprinting analysis.</p><p><italic>5) The Discussion is very broad and not connected to the current dataset. The first sentence of the Discussion is incorrect, as there are other antagonists of the ISR. I suggest two options for a revised discussion: Either to focus the discussion on the current dataset or to provide additional data inline with the discussion (mTOR signaling and the ISR, memory and stress granules, memory and ribosome profiling data)</italic>.</p><p>We have substantially rewritten the Discussion. To the best of our knowledge however, ISRIB is indeed the first and to date only known ISR inhibitor. Although there are inhibitors of specific eIF2α kinases (PERK and PKR inhibitors), ISRIB is the only molecule that can block signaling downstream of all eIF2α kinases by making cells resistant to eIF2α phosphorylation. An ISR agonist exists, salubrinal, which prolongs eIF2α phosphorylation. An HRI activator also exists which can also act as an agonist of the ISR in cells that express HRI.</p><p><italic>6)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>: I didn't understand this panel.

The authors may wish to comment on this point</italic>.</p><p>HEK293T cells were only treated with ISRIB for one hour and thus the basal levels of ISR activation may not be as evident as in cells under prolonged ablation of PERK (PERK<sup>-/-</sup>), ATF4 (ATF4<sup>-/-</sup>) or non-phosphorylatable eIF2α (eIF2α <sup>S51A/S51A</sup>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
