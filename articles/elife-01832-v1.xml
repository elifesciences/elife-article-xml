We took advantage of the zebrafish sensory lateral line to define niche-progenitor interactions to understand how integration of diverse signaling pathways spatially and temporally regulates the coordination of these processes. Our previous studies demonstrated that Schwann cells play a crucial role in negatively regulating lateral line progenitor proliferation. Here we demonstrate that ErbB/Neuregulin signaling is not only required for Schwann cell migration but that it plays a continued role in postmigratory Schwann cells. ErbB expressing Schwann cells inhibit lateral line progenitor proliferation and differentiation through non-cell-autonomous inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Subsequent activation of Fgf signaling controls sensory organ differentiation, but not progenitor proliferation. In addition to the lateral line, these findings have important implications for understanding how niche-progenitor cells segregate interactions during development, and how they may go wrong in disease states.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01832.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01832.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01832.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All the different types of cells that make up the body of an animal are descended from a single fertilized egg. As this egg develops into an embryo, the cells divide and specialize to become a specific type of cell, such as: a liver cell, a muscle cell or a nerve cell. The cells in the embryo that are destined to become specific cell types are called progenitor cells. However, these cells are also found within adult tissues, where they wait until they are needed to replace old or damaged cells.</p><p>Zebrafish are commonly used in scientific research and, like other fish, they have a ‘lateral line’ that runs along both sides of the body and contains cells that detect movements in the surrounding water. During its development, the lateral line contains many progenitors that are primed to form more of these sense organs. The lateral line is also connected to nerve cells that relay information about water movements to the central nervous system, while other cells called Schwann cells support the nerve cells. The local environment or ‘niche’ created by the Schwann cells is known to prevent the progenitor cells within the lateral line from becoming their specific cell type too early. However, the molecules that cause progenitor cells to stop dividing, and later restart dividing and change in to their predestined cell type is not well understood.</p><p>Now Lush and Piotrowski have discovered that signaling through a protein called ErbB causes the Schwann cells to multiply, but has the opposite effect on nearby progenitor cells in the lateral line. ErbB signaling in the Schwann cells inhibited various signaling pathways in the progenitor cells; and whilst some of these pathways normally encourage the progenitors to multiply, others cause them to change into their specific cell type.</p><p>The findings of Lush and Piotrowski have important implications for understanding how the interactions between progenitor cells and the cells around them affect their development. These findings may be useful for understanding diseases caused when the control of cell multiplication or cell-type changes goes awry—such as developmental abnormalities or cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01832.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01832.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neuromast</kwd><kwd>glia</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Huntsman Cancer Institute Multidisciplinary Cancer Research Training Program Grant, University of Utah</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32CA093247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lush</surname><given-names>Mark E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institutional Support from the Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piotrowski</surname><given-names>Tatjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Schwann cell induced quiescence of mechanosensory progenitor cells is mediated by inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cell signaling events that govern progenitor quiescence, activation and differentiation are incompletely understood, but emerging data in many tissues indicate that dynamic interactions between progenitors and specialized niche environments play key roles in regulating the properties of progenitor pools. Hence, understanding niche-progenitor interactions at the cellular level is crucial for building a general understanding of this process. The development of the zebrafish lateral line is an excellent model system to study progenitor cell regulation, as it consists of relatively few cells that are easily accessible and amenable to experimental manipulations.</p><p>The sensory organs of the lateral line are called neuromasts. Neuromasts contain support and mechanosensory hair cells that detect water motion. The first set of neuromasts is laid down by a migrating primordium (primI) that develops from a placode just posterior to the otic vesicle. As the primordium migrates posteriorly along the trunk of the embryo it deposits five to six primary neuromasts and a chain of interneuromast cells that connects each neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudiere, 2007</xref>). Before the placode becomes migratory, its anterior portion splits off and forms the posterior lateral line ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Northcutt and Brandle, 1995</xref>). Lateral line axons closely follow the migrating primordium and eventually innervate deposited neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilmour et al., 2004</xref>). In turn, neural crest-derived Schwann cells migrate along the axons which they eventually myelinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilmour et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lyons et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, interneuromast cells, axons and Schwann cells are in close contact during the early stages of lateral line development (see diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Whitfield, 2005</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01832.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Illustration of cell types in the migrating lateral line.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) As the primordium migrates it deposits neuromasts and a chain of interneuromast cells (green cells).

These additional ‘secondary’ neuromasts originate from several sources. (A) A second primordium, primII, develops at 40 hr post fertilization (hpf) and deposits neuromasts in between the previously deposited sensory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sapede et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nunez et al., 2009</xref>). (B) Intercalary neuromasts arise during the first 2 weeks of development by proliferation and differentiation of primI deposited interneuromast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sapede et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grant et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lopez-Schier and Hudspeth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nunez et al., 2009</xref>). and (C) During juvenile stages neuromast stitches arise through budding from primary neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ledent, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wada et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p>We and others have previously shown that Schwann cells play a crucial role in negatively regulating the timing of differentiation of interneuromast cells into intercalary neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grant et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lopez-Schier and Hudspeth, 2005</xref>). In zebrafish that lack Schwann cells along the lateral line, such as in mutants for <italic>sox10</italic> and the ErbB pathway members <italic>erbb2</italic>, <italic>erbb3b and nrg1-3,</italic> intercalary neuromasts form precociously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grant et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rojas-Munoz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perlin et al., 2011</xref>). As Schwann cells require axons for migration along the lateral line, <italic>neurogenin</italic> mutants that lack a posterior lateral line ganglion, also show extra neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lopez-Schier and Hudspeth, 2005</xref>). Likewise, extra neuromasts form after posterior lateral line ganglion extirpation or Schwann cell ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grant et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lopez-Schier and Hudspeth, 2005</xref>). These experiments suggest that Schwann cells contribute to an inhibitory niche that keeps lateral line progenitor cells from undergoing precocious proliferation and differentiation.</p><p>The signaling pathways that orchestrate intercalary neuromast formation are currently unknown. In contrast, the early development of the migrating lateral line has been extensively studied. Complex cell signaling interactions between Wnt/β-catenin, Fgf, Notch and chemokine pathways regulate proliferation, neuromast formation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aman and Piotrowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma and Raible, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chitnis et al., 2012</xref>). Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the leading region of the primordium initiates and restricts Fgf signaling to the trailing region. In turn, Fgf signaling upregulates <italic>dkk1b</italic>, a secreted Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor, that restricts Wnt/β-catenin signaling to the leading region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aman and Piotrowski, 2008</xref>). Fgf signaling induces apical constriction in clusters of cells resulting in the morphogenesis of rosette shaped protoneuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lecaudey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</xref>). Fgf signaling is also required for hair cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Millimaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</xref>), and both Wnt/β-catenin and Fgf signaling are required for proliferation within the migrating primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aman et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>This study focuses on the development of intercalary neuromasts to elucidate the molecules that regulate progenitor cell proliferation and development. We characterize the signaling pathways required for precocious intercalary neuromast formation downstream of ErbB signaling. In the absence of Schwann cells, or ErbB/Neuregulin signaling, Wnt/β-catenin and Fgf signaling are increased. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for interneuromast proliferation while Fgf signaling is required for subsequent rosette formation and cellular differentiation. Schwann cells maintain interneuromast cells as quiescent progenitors by expressing a, as yet unidentified Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor. These findings illustrate the intricate manner in which diverse signaling pathways coordinate distinct aspects of the niche-progenitor interaction needed to maintain the proper balance and timing of this dynamic cell population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutations in ErbB/Neuregulin pathway members cause precocious differentiation of intercalary neuromasts</title><p>Intercalary neuromasts arise during a 2-week period from interneuromast cells, which are initially deposited by primI as a chain of single cells in between primary neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grant et al., 2005</xref>).

Interestingly, ErbB inhibition is able to increase neuromast numbers even in the presence of Schwann cells, if supplied between 50–59 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The presence of Schwann cells is based on detection of <italic>myelin basic protein</italic> (<italic>mbp)</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, arrows). These data suggest that ErbB signaling not only regulates Schwann cell migration but also plays a continued role in post-migratory Schwann cells in inhibiting interneuromast cell proliferation.</p><p>A potential caveat for that interpretation is that ErbB signaling is also required for Schwann cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lyons et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raphael et al., 2011</xref>), and pharmacologically lowering the number of Schwann cells could secondarily affect interneuromast proliferation. To test when Schwann cell numbers are reduced upon ErbB inhibition at 48 hpf we used the <italic>Tg(foxd3:gfp)</italic> zebrafish line that expresses EGFP in neural crest derived tissues including Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilmour et al., 2002</xref>). Using BrdU labeling in control and AG1478 treated <italic>Tg(foxd3:gfp)</italic> fish, we counted BrdU positive <italic>Tg(foxd3:gfp)</italic> Schwann cells at 6, 14 or 24 hr post treatment. ErbB inhibition induces a decrease in BrdU incorporation in Schwann cells at 6 hr post treatment, however the total Schwann cell number remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). A reduction in Schwann cell proliferation continues at 14 and 24 hr post treatment, at which point it is accompanied by a decrease in total Schwann cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C–F</xref>). The finding that Schwann cell numbers are not affected at 6 hr post treatment is important, as the first molecular changes in interneuromast cells are already observed at this stage (see below, 'Wntβ-catenin signaling activation occurs prior to Notch and Fgf activation within interneuromast cells after ErbB inhibition'). This suggests that ErbB signaling affects lateral line proliferation directly, rather than indirectly via the regulation of Schwann cell number. Thus, ErbB signaling has independent functions in Schwann cell migration and lateral line progenitor proliferation and differentiation. To elucidate if ErbB signaling controls progenitor proliferation cell-autonomously or non-cell-autonomously, we performed transplantation experiments between mutant and wild type embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ErbB2 is required in Schwann cells and Nrg1-3 is required in lateral line axons to inhibit precocious formation of intercalary neuromasts</title><p>Transplantation experiments revealed that <italic>erbb3b</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic> act cell-autonomously in Schwann cells to regulate their migration and inhibit precocious interneuromast proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grant et al., 2005</xref>).

Schwann cells keep interneuromast cells in a quiescent state via the action of an unknown inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). After deposition, interneuromast cells migrate ventrally away from the midline, which coincides with the commencement of proliferation in interneuromast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). Simultaneously, Schwann cells migrate medially, crossing the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raphael et al., 2010</xref>). Both of these steps likely contribute to the release of the Schwann cell inhibitory signal during normal development. The release of this inhibitory signal causes the upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling leading to interneuromast proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>). Eventually, Notch and Fgf signaling is initiated inducing rosette formation and differentiation.</p><p>In zebrafish, ErbB signaling serves several functions during the lifetime of a Schwann cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lyons et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raphael et al., 2011</xref>). Our ErbB inhibitor treatment, after Schwann cell migration is complete, suggests that ErbB signaling plays an additional role in Schwann cells by regulating an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in interneuromast cells. As pharmacological inhibition of ErbB signaling also causes a reduction in Schwann cell proliferation, it is possible that this secondarily affects interneuromast proliferation via reduction of the number of Schwann cells. However, pharmacological inhibition of ErbB signaling induces an increase in Wnt/β-catenin signaling before we observe a decrease in Schwann cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that ErbB signaling directly regulates the expression or activity of the Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor.

The Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor controlling interneuromast progenitor proliferation should be expressed in wild type Schwann cells until at least 48 hpf, when intercalary neuromasts begin to form. In embryos in which ErbB signaling is abrogated and interneuromast cells proliferate, the Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor should be downregulated.

Therefore we conclude that, similar to Fgf, Notch signaling is only playing a later role in intercalary neuromast development, likely regulating the choice between support or hair cell specification as in primary neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Itoh and Chitnis, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it was shown that non-myelinating Schwann cells constitute part of a niche, non-cell-autonomously controlling the quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamazaki et al., 2011</xref>).

Based on our recent results it would be interesting to examine if these molecules or pathways interact with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. For example, Perlecan interacts with Wnt/β-catenin and Fgf signaling, however the other pathways have not been examined yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Park et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamimura et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Developmental and postembryonic intercalary neuromast formation relies on similar but not identical mechanisms</title><p>We find that a set of the same signaling pathways are involved in neuromast differentiation from interneuromast cells as in neuromast formation in the primordium. However, primary neuromasts form within the migrating primordium and are deposited, whereas interneuromast cells proliferate to form a cluster of progenitor cells that eventually differentiate (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Therefore some differences exist. Both Fgf and Wnt/β-catenin are required for proliferation in the primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aman et al., 2011</xref>), whereas interneuromast proliferation depends on Wnt/β-catenin signaling only. Nevertheless, both neuromast types require Fgf signaling for rosette formation and hair cell specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10 fig11">Figure 10A–F; 11E–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lecaudey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</xref>).

Also, activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by GSK-3 inhibition does not induce <italic>pea3</italic> in interneuromast cells during the first 24 hr post treatment (data not shown). Therefore, in contrast to the primordium, Fgf may not be a direct target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in interneuromast cells. Neuromast formation in the primordium occurs in an existing and migrating tissue whereas intercalary neuromasts form from a string of cells. Therefore, it is not surprising that some of the signaling interactions between these two modes of neuromast formations are different.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>ErbB signaling can exert oncogenic or tumor suppressive functions</title><p>A detailed analysis of ErbB receptor functions is important as upregulation of ErbB family receptor tyrosine kinases is characteristic of many human cancers, notably breast cancer, resulting in enhanced tumorigenesis.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This work adds to our understanding of the mechanism of formation of intercalary neuromasts in the zebrafish lateral line system. The authors show that Wnt signaling-mediated proliferation in interneuromast cells is an early step in intercalary neuromast formation from these cells, which serve as a quiescent progenitor population. The study is a nice follow up of previous work from this group and others, which demonstrated a role for ErbB signaling in preventing premature intercalary neuromast formation. The figures are clear and easy to follow, and in general, the study is careful and thorough.</p><p>The following points should be addressed before publication:</p><p>1) Wnt signalling in the interneuromast cells. It is very interesting that the authors describe the expression of <italic>wnt10a</italic> in the context of intercalary neuromast formation, especially since no Wnt homologue has yet been shown to play a clear role primary neuromast formation. However, the role of <italic>wnt10a</italic> has not been tested rigorously. Which cells express it? Which signaling pathway determines its expression? Though obviously its expression contributes to Wnt signaling, is its transcription dependent on Wnt, FGF or Notch signaling?</p><p>2) Is the pattern of induced expression of <italic>fgf3</italic> and <italic>fgf10</italic> consistent with its dependence on Wnt signaling as in the leading end of the primordium or is it determined by <italic>atoh1a</italic> expression?</p><p>3) Which cells express <italic>her4.1</italic>?</p><p>4) Why does Wnt signaling reduce prematurely following AG1478? Does the down regulation of Wnt activity correlate with an upregulation of some other signaling system at this time?</p><p>5) Continued role of ErbB signalling in Schwann cells. The data supporting this claim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref>) are not entirely clear. A graph of cell counts indicates a significant difference between 0.035 and 0.025 cells/µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref>), and the methods indicate that counts of cells were taken between the first and second neuromasts. In the first place, the distance between first and second neuromasts will be very different between wild-type and inhibitor-treated embryos (and can be variable even in wild-type). The authors should state the actual distance and the numbers of cells counted, which must be quite small. Later experiments merely seem to confirm the requirement for Schwann cells, rather than the requirement for continued ErbB signalling in Schwann cells, and so this conclusion should be toned down. In particular, the authors should remove the words 'ErbB signaling in' from the sentence “In conclusion, the absence of ErbB signaling in Schwann cells, leads first to interneuromast cell proliferation…”, as this particular experiment uses a transgenic line in which Schwann cells are depleted.</p><p>6) Neuregulin mutant. The authors should change the wording of the sentence:</p><p>“Here we show that a mutation in <italic>neuregulin 1-3 (nrg1-3)</italic> also exhibits precocious neuromast formation”. The authors have previously reported that this mutant was isolated through a screen for supernumerary neuromasts, so this finding was effectively reported in their previous publication (Perlin et al., 2011), which is not cited on this page.</p><p>7) Statistical tests. Student's t-tests are the only statistical tests mentioned in the manuscript, but there are a number of instances throughout (e.g., control vs multiple experimental treatments) where t-tests would not be appropriate. All the statistical tests should be re-evaluated carefully to make sure that appropriate tests are chosen for each experimental situation.</p><p>8) A reference for the PD173074 Fgf inhibitor should be given. This is not widely used, and it is surprising that it affects the lateral line ganglion so differently to SU5402 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10–figure supplement 1</xref>). The authors state that “likely, the two inhibitors affect a different set of Fgf receptors or pathways”, but this is not backed up with a citation or other precedent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01832.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Wnt signalling in the interneuromast cells.

Likewise <italic>wnt10a</italic> was induced from 6-24 hours post treatment (Figure 6–figure supplement 2, G-L, described within the paragraph ‘Wnt and Fgf ligands are dependent on Wnt/β-catenin signaling’). These results support the conclusion of the loss of function studies that Wnt/β-catenin signaling acts upstream of <italic>wnt10a</italic>, whereas Fgf and Notch signaling do not affect <italic>wnt10a</italic> expression.</p><p><italic>2) Is the pattern of induced expression of</italic> fgf3 <italic>and</italic> fgf10 <italic>consistent with its dependence on Wnt signaling as in the leading end of the primordium or is it determined by</italic> atoh1a <italic>expression?</italic></p><p>We have now performed experiments that reveal that in interneuromast cells Fgf signaling depends on Wnt/β-catenin signaling as in the leading region of the primordium. However, Fgf ligand activation takes 12-24h suggesting that Fgf signaling might not be a direct target. To determine which signaling pathways induce <italic>fgf3</italic> and <italic>fgf10</italic>, we treated 32hpf control siblings or <italic>Tg(sox10:DNerbb4)</italic> embryos with Wnt/β-catenin, Fgf or Notch signaling inhibitors. We subsequently fixed the embryos at 48hpf and performed in situ hybridization with <italic>fgf3</italic> and <italic>fgf10</italic>. Both <italic>fgf3</italic> and <italic>fgf10</italic> expression are reduced in <italic>Tg(sox10:DNerbb4)</italic> embryos after blocking Wnt/β-catenin signaling but not after inhibition of Fgf or Notch signaling (Figure 6–figure supplement 1, M-P and U-X, described within the paragraph ‘Wnt and Fgf ligands are dependent on Wnt/β-catenin signaling’).</p><p>Our new experiments also demonstrate that Wnt/β-catenin activation induces transcription of <italic>fgf3</italic> and <italic>fgf10</italic> in interneuromast cells (Figure 6–figure supplement 2M-X, described within the paragraph ‘Wnt and Fgf ligands are dependent on Wnt/β-catenin signaling’).

Does the down regulation of Wnt activity correlate with an upregulation of some other signaling system at this time</italic>?</p><p>As noted by the reviewer Wnt/β-catenin signaling is upregulated at 6 and 12 hours post treatment but returns close to wild type levels at 24 hours post AG1478 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It is possible that other signaling pathways are induced at this later stage and are responsible for inducing a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor in interneuromast cells. One Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor, <italic>dkk1b,</italic> is an Fgf target in the primordium (Aman and Piotrowski, 2008). However, Fgf signaling, as judged by <italic>pea3</italic> expression, is not induced until after 24 hours of AG1478 treatment. We also performed an expression analysis with <italic>dkk1b</italic> and <italic>dkk2</italic> after AG1478 addition and neither gene was induced by 36 hours post treatment (data not shown), illustrating that <italic>dkk1b</italic> and <italic>dkk2</italic> are likely not the responsible Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitors at the AG1478 24 hour time point. This suggest that if Fgf is also regulating <italic>dkk</italic> expression during intercalary neuromast formation, as it is in the primordium, it is acting at a time point later than 24 hours post AG1478 treatment. Therefore, Fgf signaling is not a likely candidate to cause the decrease in Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6X</xref>).</p><p>Based on our experiments with the Notch inhibitor LY411575 (Figure 6–figure supplement 1D,L,T), and the absence of Notch signaling in wild type interneuromast cells, we concluded that Notch signaling is not required for keeping interneuromast cells quiescent by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling in wild type embryos. However, Notch signaling, as judged by <italic>her4.1</italic> expression, is induced at 24 hours after AG1478 and could therefore be responsible for the upregulation of a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6EE</xref>). To investigate if Wnt/β-catenin signaling persists if Notch signaling is inhibited at 24 hour post AG1478 treatment we soaked embryos simultaneously in AG1478 and LY411575. Unfortunately, the combination of these two drugs had toxic effects on the embryos. We think this down regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is interesting; however, it would require more elaborate experiments that are beyond the focus of this study.</p><p><italic>5) Continued role of ErbB signalling in Schwann cells. The data supporting this claim (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 4</italic></xref><italic>) are not entirely clear. A graph of cell counts indicates a significant difference between 0.035 and 0.025 cells/µm (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 4</italic></xref><italic>), and the methods indicate that counts of cells were taken between the first and second neuromasts. In the first place, the distance between first and second neuromasts will be very different between wild-type and inhibitor-treated embryos (and can be variable even in wild-type). The authors should state the actual distance and the numbers of cells counted, which must be quite small. Later experiments merely seem to confirm the requirement for Schwann cells, rather than the requirement for continued ErbB signalling in Schwann cells, and so this conclusion should be toned down. In particular, the authors should remove the words 'ErbB signaling in' from the sentence “In conclusion, the absence of ErbB signaling in Schwann cells, leads first to interneuromast cell proliferation…”, as this particular experiment uses a transgenic line in which Schwann cells are depleted</italic>.</p><p>We counted Schwann cells between the first and second deposited neuromasts, L1 and L2. We re-worded the methods section to make this clearer. We agree that the distance between neuromasts L1 and L2 varies and therefore we chose to calculate the number of Schwann cells per μm to control for the variation in distance between neuromasts. We have added within the figure legend the average number of Schwann cells counted for each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref>). At 6 hours post DMSO treatment we counted an average of 12 Schwann cells and the average distance between L1 and L2 was 531μm. In AG1478 treated larvae we counted on average 13 Schwann cells over 546 μm. At 14 hours post DMSO treatment we counted an average of 20 Schwann cells over 576 μm and 14 Schwann cells over 536 μm after AG1478 treatment. At 24 hours post DMSO treatment we counted an average of 14 Schwann cells over 511 μm and 6 Schwann cells over 508 μm after AG1478 treatment.</p><p>We have removed 'ErbB signaling in' from the sentence indicated, as we agree the experiment described is examining Schwann cell deficient zebrafish.</p><p><italic>6) Neuregulin mutant. The authors should change the wording of the sentence</italic>:</p><p><italic>“Here we show that a mutation in neuregulin 1-3 (nrg1-3) also exhibits precocious neuromast formation”. The authors have previously reported that this mutant was isolated through a screen for supernumerary neuromasts, so this finding was effectively reported in their previous publication (Perlin et al., 2011), which is not cited on this page</italic>.</p><p>We have deleted this sentence from the manuscript and added <italic>nrg1-3</italic> to the preceding sentence of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) Statistical tests. Student's t-tests are the only statistical tests mentioned in the manuscript, but there are a number of instances throughout (e.g., control vs multiple experimental treatments) where t-tests would not be appropriate. All the statistical tests should be re-evaluated carefully to make sure that appropriate tests are chosen for each experimental situation</italic>.</p><p>We have re-evaluated the statistical analysis and have performed a one-way ANOVA with Tukey pairwise comparison for experiments that have multiple experimental treatments. This new analysis was performed on data graphed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig10">Figures 7A, 10G, 10O-P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">1–figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">10–figure supplement 1</xref>. For two of these experiments the results are now no longer significant, as the p-value is greater than 0.05. One of these experiments is the test of neuromast formation after AG1478 is added at different developmental time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1–figure supplement 1F</xref>). The 72 hour time point is no longer significantly different from the DMSO treated group. We have updated the text and figure to reflect this change. This does not change the main conclusion of this experiment which is AG1478 induces an increase in neuromast number, even if given after Schwann cell migration is completed at 50 or 59 hpf.</p><p>The second experiment is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10O</xref>. The difference in BrdU incorporation within <italic>Tg(SqET20:gfp)</italic> cells between DMSO and SU5402 treated control siblings is not significant. We have updated the text to reflect this change. Again this does not change the conclusion of the experiment that Fgf pathway inhibition, either by SU5402 or PD173074, does not block interneuromast cell proliferation in <italic>Tg(sox10:DNerbb4)</italic> fish.</p><p>For the remaining experiments we continue to use a Student’s t-test<bold>,</bold> as we are comparing only two groups<bold>.</bold> We now state within the figure legends which statistical analysis was used for each graph.</p><p><italic>8) A reference for the PD173074 Fgf inhibitor should be given. This is not widely used, and it is surprising that it affects the lateral line ganglion so differently to SU5402 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1"><italic>Figure 10–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>). The authors state that “likely, the two inhibitors affect a different set of Fgf receptors or pathways”, but this is not backed up with a citation or other precedent</italic>.</p><p>We have not found a reference that directly compares the two different FGFR inhibitors with different FGF receptors and we therefore only reference the original paper that describes PD173074 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohammadi et al., 1998</xref>). As mentioned in the text, the fact that PD173074 causes an increase in posterior lateral line ganglion cell number matches the results the Riley laboratory acquired using a heat-shock dominant negative FGFR transgenic in the zebrafish statoacoustic ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vemaraju et al., 2012</xref>). As dominant negative Fgfr is likely a more specific inhibitor than pharmacological inhibitors we suspect that PD173074 is more specific in blocking Fgf signaling within the posterior lateral line ganglion than SU5402 that is possibly affecting other receptor tyrosine kinases. We would like to emphasize that this difference in drug effect was only seen in the posterior lateral line ganglion. SU5402 and PD173074 induced the same phenotypes during primordium migration (data not shown) as well as intercalary neuromast formation described in this paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
