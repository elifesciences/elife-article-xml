peripheral tolerance, the mature B cell compartment contains cells reactive for self-antigen. How these cells are poised not to respond and the mechanisms that restrain B cell responses to low-affinity endogenous antigens are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for the glycan-binding protein galectin-9 in setting the threshold of B cell activation and that loss of this regulatory network is sufficient to drive spontaneous autoimmunity. We further demonstrate a critical role for galectin-9 in restraining not only conventional B-2 B cells, but also innate-like B-1a cells. We show that galectin-9-deficient mice have an expanded population of B-1a cells and increased titers of B-1a-derived autoantibodies. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that galectin-9 regulates BCR and distinct TLR responses in B-1a cells, but not B-1b cells, by regulating the interaction between BCR and TLRs with the regulatory molecules CD5 and CD180, respectively. In the absence of galectin-9, B-1a cells are more readily activated and secrete increased titers of autoantibodies that facilitate autoantigen delivery to the spleen, driving autoimmune responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>galectin-9</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>B-1a cells</kwd><kwd>nanoclusters</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-13608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treanor</surname><given-names>Bebhinn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-165938</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treanor</surname><given-names>Bebhinn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>905-231134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treanor</surname><given-names>Bebhinn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Galectin-9-deficient mice develop spontaneous autoimmunity, driven by a decreased threshold of B cell activation and enhanced auto-antigen delivery to the spleen by increased B1a-derived autoantibodies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>B cells contribute to host immunity through their potent capacity to activate T cell responses, modulate inflammatory profiles, produce high-affinity antibodies, and provide lasting immunological memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffman et al., 2016</xref>). Many of these functions are initiated by binding antigen to the B cell receptor (BCR), triggering downstream signaling and ultimately shaping cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasler and Zouali, 2001</xref>). BCR signaling, however, must be tightly regulated to prevent aberrant B cell activation to low-affinity self-antigens and development of autoimmunity. Indeed, since the specificity of the BCR is stochastically generated, B cells with specificity for self-antigen arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kurosaki et al., 2010</xref>). Receptor editing, clonal deletion, and anergy limit the generation and activation of autoreactive B cells; yet despite these mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance, the mature B cell compartment contains cells reactive for self-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). How these cells are restrained from responding to low-affinity endogenous antigen, and the mechanisms that regulate antigen affinity discrimination are not fully understood.</p><p>BCR signal transduction is regulated by the nanoscale distribution of the BCR with respect to co-stimulatory molecules that antagonize or enhance signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Treanor, 2012</xref>). Loss or engagement of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD45, CD19, and CD22 dramatically alter the intensity of BCR signaling and ultimately shape B cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasler and Zouali, 2001</xref>). These regulatory networks play a key role in tuning B cell responses in secondary lymphoid organs and help to restrain inappropriate activation to innocuous antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodnow et al., 1990</xref>). In fact, co-stimulatory molecules such as CD19 and CD45 have been shown to alter the threshold of B cell activation, and perturbations in their function can lead to autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodnow et al., 1989</xref>). However, the mechanisms that establish the molecular interaction between BCR and positive and negative co-stimulatory molecules are not fully clear.</p><p>Galectin-9 (Gal9) is a soluble, bivalent glycan-binding protein that binds directly to IgM-BCR and CD45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giovannone et al., 2018</xref>). Binding of Gal9 alters the organization of the BCR, enhancing interactions with inhibitory co-receptors CD45 and CD22, thereby reducing BCR signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2018</xref>). These findings raise the question of whether Gal9 acts as a rheostat for antigen affinity discrimination, ultimately restraining B cells from responding to low-affinity antigens and therefore limiting autoimmune responses. Moreover, many B cell subsets have unique regulatory networks and play distinct roles in host immunity. For example, B-1a cells, which reside in the peritoneal and pleural cavities, are poised to rapidly respond to foreign antigen by producing natural IgM; yet their BCR polyspecificity and cross-reactivity for self has also implicated them in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wollenberg, 2011</xref>). Whether Gal9 exerts subset-specific roles on B cell function and the importance of these on the pathogenesis of autoimmunity is unknown.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that loss of Gal9 in mice results in a breakdown of peripheral tolerance and leads to spontaneous autoimmunity with age, marked by splenomegaly, spontaneous germinal center formation, autoantibody production, and nephritis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Gal9 regulates the threshold of follicular B cell activation, and loss of this regulatory network permits activation to low-affinity and low-density antigens. Additionally, we observe an expansion in the B-1a compartment in the absence of Gal9 and demonstrate that these B-1a cells, but not B-1b cells, are more sensitive to BCR and distinct toll-like receptor (TLR) stimuli. We identify that Gal9 directly regulates BCR and distinct TLRs by binding to IgM-BCR and CD5 on the surface of B-1a cells as well as TLR4 and the regulatory molecule CD180, dampening signal transduction by altering their nano-scale co-distribution. We demonstrate that enhanced activation of B-1a cells in the absence of Gal9 is detrimental and exacerbates autoimmunity by facilitating transfer of autoantigens to secondary lymphoid organs where they drive autoimmune responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gal9 regulates the threshold of B cell activation</title><p>BCR signal strength upon antigen binding is defined by a host of co-receptors that fine-tune and co-ordinate signal transduction.

Therefore, BCR co-receptors modulate BCR signaling and define the threshold of antigen required for B cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tedder et al., 1997</xref>).

To investigate whether Gal9 impacts the threshold of B cell activation, we first asked if Gal9 regulates the intensity of signal transduction downstream of BCR ligation.

To assess whether altered BCR signaling in Gal9-deficient B cells impacts BCR internalization, we stimulated WT and Gal9KO primary murine B cells with defined concentrations of anti-IgM F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> and measured surface expression of IgM-BCR over 20 min. Following stimulation with high concentrations of anti-IgM F(ab’)<sub>2</sub>, we see a sharp decrease in surface IgM that plateaus by 20 min, whereas stimulation with decreasing concentrations leads to less IgM internalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, in the context of reduced antigen concentrations, IgM internalization is increased in Gal9KO compared to WT B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To quantify the rate of IgM internalization, we plotted the rate of change (k) of the fitted decay curve, which revealed Gal9KO B cells internalize IgM at a faster rate than WT B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, this results in an increase in total BCR internalization at 20 min to limiting antigen concentrations in Gal9KO B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that increased BCR signaling in Gal9-deficient B cells leads to an increase in internalization of IgM-BCR.</p><p>To assess the relationship between BCR signal strength and BCR internalization, we used a Nur77-eGFP reporter system, in which GFP expression is driven by Nur77 and is rapidly upregulated upon BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zikherman et al., 2012</xref>). Following stimulation for 20 min with defined concentrations of anti-IgM F(ab’)<sub>2</sub>, WT and Gal9KO Nur77-eGFP B cells were washed of excess antigen and allowed to incubate for 16 hr to express GFP proportional to the extent of BCR signal transduction. Consistent with our previous findings, BCR signal transduction to low-dose stimuli, as measured by the gMFI of the GFP reporter, is enhanced in the absence of Gal9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Furthermore, the extent of BCR signaling (gMFI of GFP) correlates with the rate of BCR internalization over the same interval (k, over 20 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Gal9 regulates BCR internalization through modulating BCR signal strength.</p><p>BCR signal transduction leads to a B cell activation program, marked by upregulation of activation markers and a change in transcriptional and metabolic profiles. We then asked if enhanced BCR signaling in response to limiting antigen concentrations in Gal9KO B cells affects the threshold of B cell activation as assessed by the upregulation of the co-receptor CD86. To address this, we stimulated primary naïve B cells from WT or Gal9 deficient mice with titrated concentrations of anti-IgM F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> for 16 hr and assessed upregulation of CD86 by flow cytometry. Following 16 hr of stimulation we see increased B cell activation proportional to increasing concentration of anti-IgM; however, in the absence of Gal9 B cells respond to lower concentrations of antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), quantified by the decreased EC<sub>50</sub> value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Gal9 restrains B cell activation when antigen concentrations are limiting.</p><p>Gal9 is a pleiotropic protein with many described roles in a variety of immune cells. Because of its secreted nature, Gal9 can be produced by one cell and act on another. This enhanced layer of complexity prompted us to ask which cell types within the spleen can produce Gal9 and contribute to extrinsic sources of Gal9 in the tissue? To address this, we compared Gal9 expression on the surface of a variety of splenic immune cell populations by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Additionally, to delineate cells which may be excreting Gal9, we quenched the surface Gal9 with an unlabeled monoclonal antibody, then permeabilized cells, and stained for intracellular Gal9 using a fluorescent conjugation of the same monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Importantly, following quenching with unlabeled antibody, unpermeabilized cells did not stain with fluorescent antibody, demonstrating effective saturation of the quenching antibody in this assay (data not shown). Interestingly, we see high levels of intracellular and extracellular Gal9 expression from many myeloid cell populations, with little detectable Gal9 from the T cell compartment. The contribution of subset-derived Gal9 is a factor of both the expression of Gal9 by a given subset and the overall abundance of that subset within the splenic environment. As such, we normalized the total Gal9 expression (intra- and extracellular) against the relative abundance of each cell subset in the spleen, providing a metric of Gal9 expression that considers the size of specific populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We see that when we factor in subset abundance, B cells appear to have the highest Gal9 expression relative to abundance within the spleen.</p><p>We next asked which cell types within the spleen contribute to the Gal9 detected on the surface of B cells. To investigate this, we performed adoptive transfer experiments using Gal9KO B cells transferred into WT hosts, µMT hosts (which lack B cells), and clondronate liposome-treated WT hosts (which results in selective depletion of phagocytic cells, predominantly macrophages/monocytes). We then stained for Gal9 expression on transferred cells to assess the cell type-specific contribution to surface Gal9 expression on B cells. Following treatment with clondronate liposomes, we see approximately 50% reduction in splenic macrophage and monocyte populations compared to control liposome-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Interestingly, when we compare the expression of Gal9 on transferred Gal9KO B cells with endogenous WT B cells in the same host, we see full reconstitution of Gal9 expression on follicular B cells when transferred into WT hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Notably, however, Gal9 expression is only partially restored when gating on marginal zone B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>), suggesting that B cells may have subset-specific requirements for intrinsic vs extrinsic sources of Gal9. Additionally, Gal9 expression was only partially restored when Gal9KO B cells were transferred into macrophage depleted or B cell-deficient hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>), demonstrating that both B cell-derived and macrophage-derived Gal9 contribute to extrinsic sources of Gal9 within the splenic environment. Lastly, we asked if these perturbations in Gal9 expression affect the threshold of B cell activation. To address this, we stimulated cells with titrated concentrations of anti-IgM F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> for 16 hr and assessed upregulation of CD86 by flow cytometry. With reconstitution of Gal9 expression by transfer into WT hosts, we see that Gal9KO B cells have similar threshold of activation compared to endogenous WT cells in the same host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G,H</xref>). In contrast, we see a decrease in the threshold of activation of Gal9KO B cells transferred into macrophage-depleted or B cell-deficient hosts, which is proportional to Gal9 expression.

In this model, B cells express an IgM-BCR specific for model antigen hen egg lysozyme, HEL (HyHEL10, K<sub>a </sub>= 4.5 × 10<sup>10</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>). MD4 B cells bind to lysozymes from other avian species with reduced affinity, such as Bobwhite Quail (QEL, K<sub>a </sub>= 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>) and Duck (DEL, K<sub>a </sub>= 1.7 × 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lavoie et al., 1992</xref>). To investigate a role for Gal9 in antigen affinity discrimination, we first settled WT or Gal9KO MD4 B cells on artificial planar lipid bilayers displaying HEL, QEL, or DEL antigens, allowing us to simulate antigen presentation in a similar fashion to how B cells interact with antigen in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harwood and Batista, 2008</xref>). At 90 s post-interaction, the point of maximal B cell spreading, cells were fixed and imaged using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Gal9KO B cells appear to spread more and accumulate more antigen in response to lower affinity antigens compared to WT B cells. To quantify this, we measured the contact area and total amount of antigen accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Indeed, Gal9KO B cells spread more and accumulate more antigen in response to low-affinity antigens presented on lipid bilayers compared to WT B cells. It is well established that the B cell spreading response, and thus the amount of antigen accumulated is regulated by BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fleire et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Weber et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, to assess the impact of Gal9 on BCR signaling in the context of an antigen presenting cell, we labeled OP9 stromal cells and deposited lysozyme containing immune complexes onto their surface at three different densities, covering a fourfold range, corresponding to low, medium, and high density. OP9 stromal cells were incubated with WT or Gal9KO MD4 B cells for 5 min, and cell conjugates were then permeabilized, stained for total tyrosine phosphorylation, and analyzed by flow cytometry. In the absence of Gal9, BCR signaling is increased in response to low-affinity and low-density membrane-bound antigens compared to WT B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Gal9KO B cells respond more readily to low-affinity antigens.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of primary WT and Gal9KO B cells fixed on planar lipid bilayers containing fluorescently conjugated antigen, as indicated, after 90 s of spreading and imaged by TIRF microscopy.

Given our observation of enhanced B cell activation to low-affinity antigens in Gal9-deficient B cells, we then asked, does loss of Gal9 result in spontaneous autoreactivity and the development of autoimmunity in mice? To investigate this, we examined aged (&gt;8 months) WT and Gal9KO mice for evidence of spontaneous autoimmunity. We find that aged Gal9KO mice have enlarged spleens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), with detectable germinal center (GC) B cells in the absence of immunization, suggesting they are driven toward autoantigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).

To assess whether there is a breakdown in peripheral tolerance in Gal9KO B cells, we crossed Gal9KO mice onto the MD4/ML5 mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goodnow, 2009</xref>). In this system, B cells express a transgenic BCR specific for HEL, as well as soluble HEL secreted by somatic cells. Upon binding antigen in this context, B cells undergo a process of peripheral tolerance called anergy where they become refractory to BCR stimulation, downregulate surface IgM, and have a decreased half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodnow et al., 1989</xref>). Therefore, in this model of anergy, there is little to no secretion of antibodies toward the pseudo-autoantigen HEL. We observed a distinct population of cells in the spleen of Gal9KO MD4/ML5 mice that retain high levels of surface IgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>). Furthermore, following IgM stimulation, this population induces robust signaling compared to both anergic WT cells and IgM-low anergic-like cells in Gal9KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J,K</xref>). Additionally, we detect higher titers of HEL-specific antibodies in the serum of Gal9KO MD4/ML5 mice compared to MD4/ML5 WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1L</xref>).

B-1a cells, defined by their expression of the T cell regulatory protein CD5, along with CD5-negative B-1b cells are typically found at barrier sites such as the lining of the gastrointestinal tract and peritoneal (PerC)/pleural cavities.

We find that loss of Gal9 leads to enhanced activation of B-1a cells in response to lower concentrations of agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). Notably, this increased activation upon loss of Gal9 is specific to B-1a cells, as we did not observe any difference in B-1b cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Therefore, Gal9 regulation of B-1a cells must occur through a unique mechanism. To investigate this, we performed pull-down assays to identify Gal9 ligands in B-1a B cells by incubating protein lysates from sorted B-1a and B-1b PerC B cells or conventional splenic B-2 cells with rGal9-coated beads. We then washed and stained these beads with antibodies targeting various co-receptors and assessed protein enrichment by flow cytometry. We find that Gal9 interacts with IgM-BCR in B-1a, B-1b, and B-2 B cells, but uniquely interacts with the inhibitory glyco-protein CD5 on the surface of B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly, we observed only slight enrichment of other known B-1 cell regulators such as Siglec-G or FcγRIIB on Gal9 coated beads, suggesting that Gal9 preferentially interacts with other protein species such as CD5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Gal9 binds to B-1a cells and regulates their activation, likely through the inhibitory co-receptor CD5.</p><p>The nanoscale organization of molecules on the cell surface allow for interactions between receptors and important regulatory co-receptors that enhance or restrain signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Treanor, 2012</xref>). We have shown previously that Gal9 modulates BCR responses in B-2 B cells by altering the nano-scale distribution of the BCR and its association with inhibitory co-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wasim et al., 2019</xref>). To assess the impact of Gal9 on the nanoscale organization of IgM-BCR and inhibitory co-receptor CD5, we performed dual-color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) to achieve single-molecule resolution of the cell surface. Upon visual inspection of dSTORM images, IgM appears to be more clustered on B-1a cells in the absence of Gal9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Quantification of cluster area demonstrated that IgM clusters are larger in the absence of Gal9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). To quantify clustering tendency, we calculated the Hopkins index, which assesses clustering tendency relative to a random distribution (0.5). We find that IgM on the surface of Gal9KO B-1a cells has a higher clustering tendency compared to WT B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Upon visual inspection of dSTORM images of CD5, we note that it is more highly clustered compared to IgM; however, we do not observe striking differences between WT and Gal9KO B-1a cells. However, quantification of CD5 cluster area and degree of clustering revealed an increase in Gal9KO B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J,K</xref>). We hypothesized that Gal9 crosslinks IgM and CD5 to regulate BCR signaling in B-1a cells. Dual-dSTORM provides the advantage of single-molecule coordinate-based colocalization analysis to examine whether there are differences in the colocalization of these molecules on the surface of B-1a cells in the absence of Gal9. Visually, we can discern a loss of colocalized IgM and CD5 clusters in the absence of Gal9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). To quantify this, we performed coordinate-based colocalization (CBC) analysis, which ranges from −1 (perfectly segregated) to +1 (perfectly colocalized). The frequency distribution of CBC values shifts to the left (i.e. toward negative values) in the absence of Gal9, indicating an increase in the segregation of IgM-BCR and CD5, compared to WT B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). This results in a decrease in the mean CBC value per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>) and a corresponding increase in the mean nearest neighbor (NN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>). In contrast, but consistent with the lack of effect of Gal9 deficiency on B-1b B cell activation, we find no difference in the organization of IgM on the surface of B-1b cells in the absence of Gal9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>).

To assess whether Gal9 influences innate-like responses of B-1 cells, and to identify TLRs potentially regulated by Gal9, we stimulated PerC cells from WT or Gal9KO mice with titrated concentrations of various TLR ligands and measured the proportion of cells activated by upregulation of CD86. Interestingly, we find that B-1a cells from Gal9KO mice are more sensitive to LPS and CpG stimulation, but not imiquimod or zymosan stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). In contrast, but consistent with BCR stimulation, Gal9 appears to be dispensable for TLR activation of B-1b cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). We then asked if enhanced CD86 upregulation in the absence of Gal9 was due to a similar enhancement of TLR signaling in B-1a cells. To address this, we stimulated WT or Gal9KO PerC cells with LPS and assessed total-tyrosine phosphorylation at 10 min by phospho-flow cytometry. We find that Gal9KO B-1a cells, but not B-1b cells, have increased total tyrosine phosphorylation at 10 min post-LPS stimulation, which can be reduced to levels comparable to WT cells by pre-treatment with rGal9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

These observations are further exacerbated in Gal9KO mice, which have a reduced threshold for B cell activation, and subsequently develop a more exaggerated autoimmune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L–P</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Gal9 regulates BCR-driven and unique TLR-driven B-1a responses by regulating the association of these receptors with negative co-receptors, loss of which enhances B-1a-derived antibody production and consequently autoantigen delivery to splenic B cells to drive autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Gal9 regulates disease onset in the NZB/W model of murine lupus</title><p>Loss of Gal9 leads to enhanced TLR4 signal transduction in B-1a cells, allowing for enhanced activation and systemic antibody secretion. Similarly, loss of Gal9 decreases the threshold of B cell activation, allowing for B cell responses against low-affinity antigens. We therefore asked if loss of Gal9 would lead to more rapid disease onset in the NZB/W F1 model system for lupus-like disease in mice. To address this, we backcrossed the Gal9KO allele onto the NZB and NZW backgrounds for five generations. We subsequently crossed heterozygous NZB and NZW mice to generate WT and Gal9-deficient NZB/W F1 littermate controls, which develop spontaneous autoimmunity with age. Indeed, we find that Gal9-deficient mice produce anti-dsDNA IgG antibodies earlier in life compared to WT littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Furthermore, mice lacking Gal9 expression develop accelerated proteinuria compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Consistent with these observations, Gal9-deficient mice have a larger population of splenic GC B cells early in disease progression compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>). We see a similar increase in the proportion of splenic ASCs in Gal9-deficient mice early in disease onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>). These ASCs skew toward B220<sup>−</sup> long-lived ASCs, and consistent with this, we see enhanced immune complexes in circulation in mice lacking Gal9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,H</xref>). We then asked if loss of Gal9 would lead to an expanded pool of B-1a cells in the peritoneal cavity, as we observed in the C57BL/6 background. Indeed, NZB/W F1 mice deficient in Gal9 have a larger population of peritoneal B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>).

Our previous work demonstrated that Gal9 binds exclusively to IgM-BCR, with no evidence to support the interaction between Gal9 and other BCR isotypes. Through binding to the IgM-BCR and important co-receptors of BCR signaling, Gal9 alters the nano-scale organization of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2018</xref>). Herein, we show that loss of this regulation leads to spontaneous autoimmunity in mice, consistent with an expanded population of B-1a cells. Interestingly, we identify Gal9 as a regulator of B-1a cell activation through interactions with IgM-BCR, CD5, TLR4, and CD180, likely through interactions between the carbohydrate recognition domain of Gal9 with specific glycan-moieties on these glycoproteins. However, the specific glycosylation sites and structural constraints of these interactions remain to be fully resolved. Branching of N-glycans has been shown to regulate aspects of B cell activation with respect to TLR-induced B cell functional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mortales et al., 2020</xref>). Branched complex N-glycans serve as a ligand for galectins, including Gal9. Our findings, in conjunction with the growing appreciation for the role of glycan modifications in regulating B cell responses, highlight the complex nature of B cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mortales et al., 2020</xref>). We find that loss of Gal9 leads to decreased colocalization between receptors IgM/TLR4 and their cognate regulators, CD5 and CD180, on the surface of B-1a cells. This coincides with enhanced signal transduction and a reduced threshold for activation. We demonstrate that B-1a-derived antibodies promote development of autoimmunity in mice, likely due to their capacity to bind and transport autoantigens to secondary lymphoid tissues.</p><p>Our findings suggest that Gal9 modulates antigen affinity discrimination in B cells, a critical regulatory step in peripheral tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basten and Silveira, 2010</xref>). Unchecked signal transduction leads to autoimmunity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zikherman and Lowell, 2017</xref>). In fact, aberrations in CD19 or BTK signaling, both of which are known to play important roles in defining this threshold of activation, lead to autoantibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zikherman and Lowell, 2017</xref>). Additionally, it is well established that negative regulators such as CD45 and CD22 play central roles in restraining B cell activation and are critical for antigen affinity discrimination in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zikherman and Lowell, 2017</xref>). We have previously shown that Gal9 binds directly to IgM-BCR and the negative regulators CD45 and CD22, thereby dampening BCR signal transduction. Here, we demonstrate that by fine-tuning these signal transduction networks, Gal9 coordinates affinity discrimination of B cells and that loss of this regulation leads to the development of autoimmunity in mice.</p><p>Our data indicates that Gal9 suppresses B cell responses to low-affinity autoantigens; yet the role of Gal9 in autoimmunity may be cell type specific and multifaceted. For example, administration of rGal9 to NZB/W F1 mice prior to disease manifestation led to a reduction in disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Panda et al., 2018</xref>). In this work, the authors elucidated a role for Gal9 in restraining TLR7 and TLR9 responses in pDCs, important drivers of type I IFNs and the inflammatory profile that supports autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Panda et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, we show that loss of Gal9 leads to accelerated spontaneous autoimmunity in NZB/W F1 mice. Mechanistically, we show that Gal9 regulates TLR4 and TLR9 responses specifically in B-1a cells, but not B-1b cells, although unlike in pDCs, we see no effect of Gal9 on TLR7 responses in B-1 cells. This cell type disparity in the requirement or role of Gal9 in regulating receptor signaling and therefore cellular activation may be due to differential protein glycosylation and expression of Gal9 between different cell types and subsets. For example, Gal9 seems to be essential for development of autoimmune disease in the pristane-induced model, where Gal9KO mice have significantly reduced disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moritoki et al., 2013</xref>). This may result, in part, from impaired DC activation, which is essential for disease onset in pristane-induced autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Richard and Gilkeson, 2018</xref>). In this case, intracellular Gal9 interacts with the cortical actin cytoskeleton to facilitate phagocytosis and DC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Querol Cano et al., 2019</xref>), and therefore, genetic deletion of Gal9 may be detrimental for DC-dependent models of autoimmunity. The growing compendium of data suggest that Gal9 may have pleotropic effects that result in context-dependent and cell-type-specific regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Panda and Das, 2018</xref>).</p><p>B-1a cells are expanded in several models of autoimmunity; however; their role in disease pathology remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duan and Morel, 2006</xref>). Their autoreactive repertoire and heightened capacity for T cell activation suggest that these cells may be drivers of autoimmunity. Here we demonstrate that Gal9 regulates activation of B-1a cells specifically through regulating IgM and TLR4 signal transduction by increasing the colocalization of these receptors with inhibitory co-receptors CD5 and CD180, respectively. Furthermore, we show that Gal9 restrains ASC differentiation of B-1a cells and antibody production. Transfer of apoptotic bodies into mice is sufficient to drive autoantibody production, likely through increasing the density of autoantigens in secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mevorach et al., 1998</xref>). Similarly, mutations that impair efferocytosis of circulating immune complexes can lead to autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdolmaleki et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that enhanced production of B-1a-derived antibodies increases circulating immune complexes in mice and that these immune complexes transit to secondary lymphoid organs and are captured by SCS macrophages. This then results in the development of autoimmune disease, highlighting the potential pathogenic role of B-1a cells in the onset of autoimmunity. Notably, the development of autoimmune disease is exacerbated in Gal9KO mice, in large part due to the reduced threshold of activation of both B-1a and B-2 B cells.</p><p>Our findings suggest that changes in the level of Gal9 could be sufficient to reduce the threshold of IgM-BCR and distinct TLR signaling, driving strong BCR and TLR signaling upon binding of low-affinity and/or low-density ligands. There is ample evidence that expression of Gal9 is altered in a variety of disease conditions, including viral infection, inflammation, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chagan-Yasutan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chou et al., 2018</xref>). In the context of autoimmunity, emerging evidence has suggested that Gal9 is elevated in the serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matsuoka et al., 2020</xref>); however, these results should be interpreted with caution, as degraded Gal9 in the serum could obscure the interpretation of these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is not clear whether elevated serum Gal9 is reflective of functional Gal9 or whether it represents a decrease in bound and functional Gal9. Moreover, glycosylation of cell surface proteins is regulated by a variety of factors including cell metabolism, ER and Golgi nucleotide sugar-donor transporters, and the expression and activity of glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, and glycan-modifying enzymes. Indeed, selective glycosyltransferase expression may be a mechanism to disparately regulate that activity of galectin binding in B cells, as recent work has demonstrated upregulation of the I-branching enzyme GCNT2 in GC B cells, but not naïve and memory B cells, with a concomitant decrease in Gal9 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giovannone et al., 2018</xref>). How these varied factors may be altered in the context of autoimmunity to modify the glycan profile of BCR, TLR, and key regulatory co-receptors, and thus galectin binding, has yet to be elucidated.</p><p>In summary, the present work demonstrates that Gal9 plays a critical role in tuning the outcome of receptor–ligand interactions. Loss of Gal9 leads to robust activation of B cells to low-affinity and low-density antigens. Additionally, Gal9 regulates BCR and unique TLR-driven B-1a cell activation through a unique molecular mechanism, important in the regulation of autoantigen transit to secondary lymphoid organs. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Gal9 may serve as a therapeutic target to help mitigate the onset of autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 (WT) mice were obtained from Charles River, <italic>Lgals9<sup><italic>–</italic>/–</sup></italic> (Gal9KO) mice were obtained from Steven Beverley (Washington University) on behalf of The Scripps Research Institute, <italic>Nr4a1</italic>-eGFP (Nur77-eGFP; C57BL/6-Tg(Nr4a1-EGFP/cre)820Khog/J; Stock No. 016617), NZB/BlNJ (Stock No. 000684), NZW/LacJ (Stock No. 001058), MD4 (C57BL/6-Tg(IghelMD4)4Ccg/J; Stock No. 002595), and µMT (B6.129S2-<italic>Ighm<sup>tm1Cgn</sup></italic>/J; Stock No. 002288) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at eLife&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors studied the role of the soluble glycan-binding protein galectin-9 which can be produced by B cells and binds to B cell surface proteins such as membrane IgM and CD45. They used galectin-9 (Gal-9) KO mice to study the consequence of loss of this protein on B cell activation. They convincingly show that Gal-9 KO B cells react with higher BCR signaling and react to lower concentrations of antigens. This is true both for conventional B-2, as well as for B-1a cells. For B-1a cells not only BCR-induced signaling, but also TLR-signaling is enhanced. These studies on signaling, B cell activation and antigen internalisation are thoroughly done. For B-1a cells, direct binding of Gal-9 to CD5, TLR4 and CD180 is identified. Here some controls of other receptors and a discussion how this binding could happen would be useful. The authors also show that Gal-9 KO mice develop autoimmunity upon ageing or that in autoimmune models, the disease occurs more early. These parts are also generally done well. Overall it is an impressive amount of work with many interesting novel data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It is important to clarify what is the cellular source of galectin-9 secretion in regard to development of autoimmunity in Gal9KO mice. Do B cells themselves secrete galectin-9 which binds to B cell surface to mediate signals, or is there any contribution of other cell types? Analysis of B cell-specific Gal9 KO mice (such as mixed BM chimera with B cell-deficient μMT mice) may help to address this question.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64557.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It is important to clarify what is the cellular source of galectin-9 secretion in regard to development of autoimmunity in Gal9KO mice.

In the revised manuscript we have included a series of adoptive transfer experiments to help elucidate the source of Gal9 on the B cell surface within the spleen. In Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 we show the expression of intracellular and extracellular Gal9 on a variety of splenic immune cell populations as well as a metric of Gal9 expression that considers population size. From these data we noted that macrophages and B cells appear to be likely sources of Gal9 in situ. To further elucidate this, we performed an adoptive transfer of Gal9 KO B cells into WT, macrophage-depleted, or B cell deficient μMT hosts and measured Gal9 expression and the effect of Gal9 reconstitution on the threshold of activation. From this we conclude that both macrophages and B cells contribute to exogenous sources of Gal9 and that these are sufficient to alter the threshold of B cell activation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
