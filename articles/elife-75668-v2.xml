reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Here we apply ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and parallel RNA sequencing (RNASeq) to characterise the transcriptome and translatome of both species of PRRSV and to analyse the host response to infection. We calculated programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF) efficiency at both sites on the viral genome. This revealed the nsp2 PRF site as the second known example where temporally regulated frameshifting occurs, with increasing −2 PRF efficiency likely facilitated by accumulation of the PRF-stimulatory viral protein, nsp1β. Surprisingly, we find that PRF efficiency at the canonical ORF1ab frameshift site also increases over time, in contradiction of the common assumption that RNA structure-directed frameshift sites operate at a fixed efficiency. This has potential implications for the numerous other viruses with canonical PRF sites. Furthermore, we discovered several highly translated additional viral ORFs, the translation of which may be facilitated by multiple novel viral transcripts. For example, we found a highly expressed 125-codon ORF overlapping nsp12, which is likely translated from novel subgenomic RNA transcripts that overlap the 3′ end of ORF1b. Similar transcripts were discovered for both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2, suggesting a potential conserved mechanism for temporally regulating expression of the 3′-proximal region of ORF1b. We also identified a highly translated, short upstream ORF in the 5′ UTR, the presence of which is highly conserved amongst PRRSV-2 isolates. These findings reveal hidden complexity in the gene expression programmes of these important nidoviruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses have tiny genomes. Rather than carry all the genetic information they need, they rely on the cells they infect. This makes the few genes they do have all the more important. Many viruses store their genes not in DNA, but in a related molecule called RNA. When the virus infects cells, it uses the cells’ ribosomes – the machines in the cells that make proteins – to build its own proteins. One of the central ideas in biology is that one molecule of RNA carries the instructions for just one type of protein. But many viruses break this rule.</p><p>The ribosomes in cells read RNA instructions in blocks of three: three RNA letters correspond to one protein building block. But certain sequences in the RNA of viruses act as hidden signals that affect how ribosomes read these molecules. These signals make the ribosomes skip backward by one or two letters on the viral RNA, restarting part way through a three-letter block. Scientists call this a ‘frameshift’, and it is a bit like changing the positions of the spaces in a sentence. The virus causes these frameshifts using proteins or by folding its RNA into a knot-like structure. The frameshifts result in the production of different viral proteins over time. The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) uses frameshifts to cause devastating disease in pigs. Besides the sequences in its RNA that allow the ribosomes to skip backwards, the viral enzyme that copies the RNA can also skip forward. This results in shortened copies of its genes, which also changes the proteins they produce.</p><p>To find out exactly how PRRSV uses these frameshifting techniques, Cook et al. examined infected cells in the laboratory. They monitored the RNA made by the virus and looked closely at the way the cells read it using a technique called ribosome profiling. This revealed that frameshifting increases over the course of an infection. This is partly because the viral protein that causes frameshifts builds up as infection progresses, but it also happened with frameshifts caused by RNA knots. The reason for this is less clear. Cook et al. also discovered several new RNAs made later in infection, which could also change the proteins the virus makes.</p><p>RNA viruses cause disease in humans as well as pigs. Examples include coronaviruses and HIV. Many of these also have frameshift sites in their genomes. A better understanding of how frameshifts change during infection may aid drug development. Future work could help researchers to understand which proteins viruses make at which stage of infection. This could lead to new treatments for viruses like PRRSV.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>arterivirus</kwd><kwd>porcine reproductive </kwd><kwd>PRRSV</kwd><kwd>ribosome profiling</kwd><kwd>programmed ribosomal frameshifting</kwd><kwd>subgenomic mRNAs</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>translatome</kwd><kwd>gene expression regulation</kwd><kwd>respiratory syndrome virus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Nidovirus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>203864/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>Georgia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102163/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soday</surname><given-names>Lior</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106207/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Firth</surname><given-names>Andrew E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202797/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brierley</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>646891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Firth</surname><given-names>Andrew E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-67015-22969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combining ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing illuminates novel features of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus gene expression, including the regulation of polyprotein stoichiometry through temporal modulation of ribosomal frameshifting and the synthesis of non-canonical transcripts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus in the family <italic>Arteriviridae</italic> (order: <italic>Nidovirales</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Meulenberg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cavanagh, 1997</xref>), and the aetiological agent of the disease from which it takes its name: porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). Attempts to control PRRS by vaccination have had limited success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Nan et al., 2017</xref>), and it remains one of the most economically devastating diseases of swine, causing reproductive failure in adult sows and respiratory failure in young pigs, at an estimated cost of $664 million a year in the US alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Holtkamp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kappes and Faaberg, 2015</xref>). The two lineages of PRRSV, formerly known as ‘European’ (Type 1) and ‘North American’ (Type 2) PRRSV, share just ~60% pairwise nucleotide similarity and were recently reclassified as two separate species, <italic>Betaarterivirus suid 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> (viruses named PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kappes and Faaberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Collins et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Wensvoort et al., 1991</xref>). For ease of reference, PRRSV-1 is herein referred to as EU (European) and PRRSV-2 as NA (North American) PRRSV, although both lineages are observed worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Guo et al., 2018a</xref>). Despite the substantial genetic and antigenic diversity between the two species, the overall clinical symptoms are similar, although there is also considerable (~20%) genetic diversity within each species, rendering this isolate-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Nan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kappes and Faaberg, 2015</xref>). This is largely due to PRRSV’s rapid mutation rate, which leads to relatively frequent emergence of highly pathogenic strains capable of escaping existing immunity, particularly within the NA PRRSV species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Nan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kappes and Faaberg, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The PRRSV genome (14.9–15.5 kb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is 5′-capped, 3′-polyadenylated, and directly translated following release into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Snijder et al., 2013</xref>). Like most members of the order <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, PRRSV replication includes the production of a nested set of subgenomic (sg) RNAs by discontinuous transcription, where the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) jumps between similar sequences in the 3′-proximal region of the genome and the 5′ UTR, known as body and leader transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kappes and Faaberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Posthuma et al., 2017</xref>). These sgRNAs are 5′- and 3′-co-terminal and are translated to express the structural proteins encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kappes and Faaberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Posthuma et al., 2017</xref>). The 5′-proximal two-thirds of the genome contains two long ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, with a −1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF) site present at the overlap of the two ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Meulenberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Nelsen et al., 1999</xref>). Ribosomes that frameshift at this site synthesise polyprotein (pp)1ab, while the remainder synthesise pp1a, both of which are cleaved by viral proteases into several non-structural proteins (nsps) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kappes and Faaberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Snijder et al., 1994</xref>). The proteins encoded by ORF1b include the RdRp and the helicase, and frameshifting at this site is thought to set the stoichiometry of these proteins relative to those encoded by ORF1a, a prevalent expression strategy in the <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gorbalenya et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An overview of the experimental set-up and the quality of the datasets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome map of the North American porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (NA PRRSV) isolate used in this study (SD95-21, GenBank accession KC469618.1).

Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) contamination is expected to affect both the CDSs and the UTRs but would be more visible in the UTRs due to the lower density of genuine RPFs (largely originating from multi-mapping reads aligning to transcript variants with identical regions annotated as CDS for some isoforms and 3′ UTR for others; multi-mapping reads were randomly assigned to a unique site). The uncontaminated 3′ UTR read length distribution should match the CDS-mapping read length distribution, but with lower relative density, as observed here in most samples.

This is thought to present a ‘roadblock’ which impedes ribosome processivity over the slippery sequence and stimulates frameshifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Rodnina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atkins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Firth and Brierley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Plant and Dinman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Namy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caliskan et al., 2014</xref>).

This PRF signal is unusual in that it stimulates both −1 and −2 PRF, enabling production of three variants of nsp2 and rendering it the first example of efficient −2 PRF in a eukaryotic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li et al., 2014</xref>). These three proteins share the N-terminal two-thirds of nsp2 (the 0-frame product), which encodes a papain-like protease (PLP) 2 domain – an ovarian tumour domain (OTU) superfamily protease with deubiquitinase (DUB) and deISGylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">van Kasteren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Frias-Staheli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Sun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Li et al., 2018</xref>). This has an immune antagonistic effect, and interferon (IFN)-β signalling inhibition has been demonstrated for all three variants of nsp2, most strongly for the frameshift products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Li et al., 2018</xref>). After the PRF site, nsp2 contains a multi-spanning transmembrane (TM) domain, thought to promote formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) in the peri-nuclear region and anchor nsp2 to these membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kappes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Snijder et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Knoops et al., 2012</xref>). Ribosomes which undergo −2 PRF at this site translate 169 codons in the –2 frame to produce nsp2TF. This contains an alternative putative multi-spanning TM domain, thought to be responsible for targeting nsp2TF to the exocytic pathway, where it deubiquitinates the PRRSV structural proteins GP5 and M, preventing their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Guo et al., 2021</xref>). Nsp2N, the product of −1 PRF, is a truncated form of nsp2, which is generated following termination of translation at a −1-frame stop codon immediately downstream of the slippery sequence, and is predicted to be cytosolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A second unique feature of the nsp2 PRF site is its non-canonical nature. Rather than an RNA secondary structure, the stimulatory element is a complex of a cellular protein, poly(rC) binding protein (PCBP), and the viral protein nsp1β, bound at a C-rich motif (CCCANCUCC) located 10 nt downstream of the slippery sequence (G_GUU_UUU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Napthine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Li et al., 2019</xref>). How binding of this motif by the protein complex stimulates PRF is uncertain, but it may act as a roadblock analogous to the RNA structures of canonical PRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Napthine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Patel et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to RNA structure-directed PRF sites, which are commonly assumed to operate at a fixed efficiency, the <italic>trans</italic>-acting mechanism of PRF stimulation at the nsp2 site presents a potential mechanism for temporal regulation, as observed for cardioviruses – the only other known example of protein-stimulated PRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Loughran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Finch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Napthine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Napthine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hill et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hill et al., 2021a</xref>).

Host differential gene expression analysis revealed that many of the transcriptional changes upon infection were counteracted by reductions in translation efficiency (TE), indicating a dampened host response, and highlighting the importance of looking beyond transcription when analysing gene expression. On the viral genome, our studies reveal, for the first time, a significant increase in frameshift efficiency over the course of infection at the nsp2 −2 PRF site, highlighting arteriviruses as the second example of temporally regulated frameshifting during infection. In addition, we identify several novel viral ORFs, including a highly expressed upstream ORF (uORF), the presence of which is conserved amongst NA PRRSV isolates. In both species of PRRSV, related non-canonical sgRNAs overlapping ORF1b were identified and characterised. These likely facilitate the expression of several of the novel ORFs which overlap ORF1b, and the observation of increased ribosome density in the 3′-proximal region of ORF1b suggests they may also function to temporally regulate expression of the C-terminal region of ORF1b itself. This first application of RiboSeq to an arterivirus uncovers hidden layers of complexity in PRRSV gene expression that have implications for other important viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental set-up</title><p>PRRSV gene expression was investigated using three viruses: an EU PRRSV isolate based on the Porcilis vaccine strain (MSD Animal Health; GenBank accession OK635576.1), NA PRRSV SD95-21 (GenBank accession KC469618.1), and a previously characterised mutant variant (NA PRRSV SD95-21 KO2) which bears silent mutations in the nsp2 PRF site slippery sequence and C-rich motif rendering it unable to bind PCBP, induce −1 or −2 PRF, or produce nsp2N or nsp2TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, inset) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Napthine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Li et al., 2018</xref>).

MARC-145 cells (a cell line derived from MA-104) were infected with NA PRRSV (WT or KO2 mutant) at MOI 5 or mock-infected and harvested at 3, 6, 9, or 12 hpi by flash-freezing without CHX pre-treatment.

The length distribution of coding sequence (CDS)-mapping RPFs is observed to peak at ~21 nt (where fragments of this length were purified) and at ~29 nt, with RPFs of these lengths thought to originate from, respectively, ribosomes with an empty A site or an A site occupied by aminoacyl-tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Steitz, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Wolin and Walter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lareau et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the proportion of ‘short’ (19–24 nt) RPFs is significantly lower in the NA PRRSV-infected libraries than mock libraries at late timepoints (9 and 12 hpi grouped; p=0.03; see Materials and methods). In yeast, this phenotype has been attributed to stress-induced phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF) 2, leading to inhibition of translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), which suggests a similar regulatory response may be triggered here by the stress of PRRSV infection. The predominant distance between the 5′ end of an RPF and the P site of the ribosome is 12 nt in these datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6B</xref>), resulting in CDS-mapping RiboSeq reads showing clear triplet periodicity, known as ‘phasing’, with the majority of RPF 5′ ends mapping to the first position within the codon, known as phase 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6B and C</xref>). Together with the observed characteristic length distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>), this indicates that a high proportion of these reads are genuine RPFs. In contrast, the length and 5′ end position of RNASeq reads is determined by alkaline hydrolysis and size selection, leading to a broader length distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>) and lack of a clearly dominant phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6B and C</xref>).

These libraries are therefore excluded from all analyses except those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, where they provide an upper bound. The subtle flattening of the length distribution and phase composition of virus-mapping reads compared to host-mapping reads in some NA PRRSV RiboSeq libraries at late timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggests that a small proportion of viral reads originate from non-RPF sources, such as protection from RNase I digestion by viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex formation. This non-RPF fraction of the library (henceforth referred to as RNP contamination although it could originate from several sources) is predominantly noticeable among reads mapping to the ORF1b region of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>), where the read depth from genuine translation is lowest.

RNP contamination is not a relevant concern for RNASeq libraries (as proteins are enzymatically digested before RNA purification), and it does not noticeably affect the EU PRRSV RiboSeq libraries, nor RPFs mapping to the host transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). Overall, we inferred that these datasets have a high proportion of RiboSeq reads representing genuine RPFs, and where RNP contamination is evident in lowly translated regions of the viral genome its effects will likely be ameliorated by stratification of read lengths.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>An overview of viral transcription and translation over a timecourse of infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome map of North American porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (NA PRRSV), reproduced from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

RNASeq plots revealed a predictable pattern of PRRSV replication and transcription, with low read levels at 3 hpi, likely corresponding to input genomes, evidence for genome replication at 6 hpi, with the appearance of negative-sense reads, and high-level synthesis of sg mRNAs at later timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The observed profile of general virus translation was also consistent with expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). At 3 hpi (plot not shown), a small number of genuine RPFs were observed (see previous paragraph), indicating that translation of the NA PRRSV genome is just beginning to reach the level detectable by RiboSeq under these conditions. At 6 hpi, translation of ORF1ab is robustly detectable and comprises the majority of viral translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; mean sgRNA:ORF1a RPF density ratio 0.08), consistent with the lack of significant sgRNA production at this timepoint. At 9 hpi, translation of sgRNAs dominates the landscape, and viral translation represents a sizeable proportion of ongoing translation in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with this, viral nsp1β expression at 9 hpi is clearly detectable by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>) and other studies have shown robust expression of viral replicase proteins and viral RNA (vRNA) replication at this timepoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Kreutz and Ackermann, 1996</xref>). Positive-sense vRNA continues to accumulate between 9 and 12 hpi, although accumulation of the negative-sense counterpart appears to reach a plateau and, at both timepoints, production and translation of sgRNAs are highly favoured over gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). This likely represents a transition towards virion formation, for which the main components required are positive-sense gRNA and structural proteins, expressed from sgRNAs. At all timepoints, a large RiboSeq peak in the NA PRRSV 5′ UTR is seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which results from translation of a novel upstream ORF, discussed below. With the exception of this highly expressed uORF, the transcriptional and translational profile of EU PRRSV at 8 hpi is similar to that of NA PRRSV at 9 hpi, although the production and translation of sgRNAs relative to ORF1a are slightly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). In all RiboSeq libraries, we noted a variable proportion of negative-sense reads that mapped to the viral genome; however, they do not display the characteristic length distribution or phasing of genuine RPFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that they originate from other sources (discussed above). They are therefore excluded from plots and analyses hereafter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Characterisation of the PRRSV transcriptome</title><p>As described above, discontinuous transcription by the viral RdRp is an integral part of the nidoviral life cycle.

Canonical sgRNAs are the most abundant transcripts, although reasonably abundant transcript variants are present, which differ only in the length of 5′ UTR between the acceptor site and the CDS start, and are expected to produce the same protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). A study on another arterivirus, simian haemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), suggests such transcripts may contribute to refining the overall stoichiometry of structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Di et al., 2017</xref>). For the N transcript, NA PRRSV isolates VR-2332 and tw91 have each been shown to have a (different) abundant secondary transcript variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Nelsen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Lin et al., 2002</xref>). Both of these are observed in our NA PRRSV dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), although the VR-2332-like transcript was much more abundant than the tw91-like transcript, consistent with the fact that SD95-21 is more closely related to VR-2332. This more abundant secondary transcript, herein termed N-short, has a 5′ UTR 114 nt shorter than that of the NA PRRSV primary transcript (herein termed N-long), presenting a potential opportunity for differential translation regulation. If such regulation exists, it is unlikely to be temporal as the ratio of N-long to N-short remains constant, at approximately 6:1, between 9 and 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Any such regulation would also likely be isolate-dependent as the N-short body TRS is not completely conserved amongst NA PRRSV isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further, it would likely be restricted to NA PRRSV as the N-long body TRS is neither highly conserved nor highly utilised in EU PRRSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), for which N-short is ~60-fold more abundant than any other N transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>) and its body TRS is absolutely conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the numerous novel sgRNAs predicted to express full-length structural proteins, we found that most canonical sgRNAs have transcript variants with body TRSs downstream of the start codon, which are expected to express truncated forms of the structural proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A and B</xref>). One of these was also observed for VR-2332 PRRSV: the ‘5-1’ transcript variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Nelsen et al., 1999</xref>), which is thought to express a truncated form of GP5, and is present in our NA PRRSV dataset at ~1.7% of the abundance of the primary GP5 transcript (based on the number of junction-spanning reads at the donor site). Similar GP5 transcript variants were observed in SHFV, and mutagenesis studies suggest that the truncated GP5 may be beneficial for viral fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Di et al., 2017</xref>), raising the possibility that the putative truncated forms of this and other PRRSV structural proteins could be functional.</p><p>In addition to the transcript variants for the structural proteins, a small number of non-canonical sgRNAs were discovered in both NA and EU PRRSV which have acceptor sites within ORF1b, herein termed ORF1b sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A and B</xref>). Despite their low abundance relative to the canonical sgRNAs, further analysis suggests that these make a significant contribution to viral translation, discussed later.</p><p>Deletions (in which the junction donor site is not the leader TRS) tend to have fewer junction-spanning reads than sgRNAs, but nonetheless may influence gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, non-TRS-spanning panels). Many of these likely represent defective interfering (DI) RNAs; however, several of the long-range deletions in the NA PRRSV 12 hpi dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, grey arcs) bear similarity to ‘heteroclite’ sgRNAs, a family of non-canonical transcripts found in several NA PRRSV isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Yuan et al., 2004</xref>). Heteroclite sgRNA formation is thought to be directed by short (2–12 nt) regions of similarity between the donor site, located within ORF1a, and the acceptor site, usually located within the ORFs encoding structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Yuan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). These transcripts can be packaged into virions but, unlike classical DI RNAs, they do not appear to interfere with canonical gRNA or sgRNA production, and are present in a wide range of conditions, including low MOI passage and samples directly isolated from the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Yuan et al., 2004</xref>). In our datasets, the most abundant deletion at 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, non-TRS-spanning) is identical to the junction that forms the ‘S-2’ heteroclite sgRNA for VR-2332 PRRSV, from which a fusion of the first 520 amino acids of ORF1a (nsp1α, nsp1β and part of nsp2) and the last 11 amino acids of 5a is thought to be expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Yuan et al., 2004</xref>). Although this junction is not present above the limit of detection at 6 hpi, it is observed at 9 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>; total read counts below the threshold for inclusion in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and at 3 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, upper), consistent with this transcript being packaged into virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Yuan et al., 2004</xref>). No transcripts resembling heteroclite sgRNAs were detected for EU PRRSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), although it is possible such transcripts might be observed if a later timepoint was sampled and/or longer RNASeq inserts were generated, as the shorter read lengths purified for these libraries (and NA PRRSV 9 hpi replicate 1; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>) are less amenable to detection of junctions.</p><p>The numerous novel transcripts described in this section not only present opportunities for regulation of the known PRRSV proteins, but also highlight considerable flexibility in the transcriptome, which provides a platform for expression of truncated protein variants and novel ORFs.

Most of the other novel ORFs overlap ORF1b and are likely expressed from the novel ORF1b sgRNAs described above, consistent with the fact that their translation is predominantly observed at late timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Some of these ORFs are highly translated – for example, the 125-codon NA PRRSV nsp12-iORF is translated at a level similar to nsp12 at 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To test whether these novel ORFs in either virus are subject to purifying selection (an indicator of functionality), we analysed synonymous site conservation within the known functional viral ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Overlapping functional elements are expected to place additional constraints on evolution at synonymous sites, leading to local peaks in synonymous site conservation. While such peaks were observed in the regions where the known viral ORFs overlap (and also within the M ORF and at the 5′ end of ORF1a), no large conservation peaks were observed in the vicinity of the novel, translated overlapping ORFs, indicating their functional relevance is debatable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The North American porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (NA PRRSV) translatome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Locations of novel ORFs (red) in the NA PRRSV genome, offset on the y-axis according to frame relative to ORF1a.

ORF1a translation declines by 12 hpi, despite the increase in transcript abundance, perhaps reflecting the sequestration of gRNA through genome packaging, reducing the pool available for translation. Consistent with this, ORF1a, which has relatively low TE throughout infection, is the only canonical NA PRRSV ORF for which TE decreases over time, decreasing from ~20 at 6 and 9 hpi to 4.4 at 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>; explored in more detail below).</p><p>Strikingly, the uORF is among the most highly translated NA PRRSV ORFs at all timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), although this may be somewhat inflated by the heightened termination peak having a proportionally greater effect on RPKM for a small ORF such as this. Its high expression at 6 hpi indicates that the uORF is expressed from gRNA, as this is by far the most abundant viral transcript at this timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The increase in the ratio of uORF compared to ORF1a translation at later timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), when sgRNAs become abundant, suggests that the uORF is also translated from the sgRNAs.</p><p>Except for the absence of a uORF, the relative translation levels of EU PRRSV ORFs are similar to those in NA PRRSV, although with less translation of 5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). This may reflect the different relative arrangements of GP5 and 5a for these two isolates, with 5a beginning 5 nt downstream of the beginning of GP5 for EU PRRSV and 10 nt upstream for NA PRRSV. TE values for EU PRRSV are slightly higher than those for NA PRRSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>); however, this may be influenced by reduced accuracy of transcript abundance quantification due to the shorter read lengths of the EU libraries.</p><p>Novel ORFs make up a relatively small proportion of total viral translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Nonetheless, they may represent a significant contribution to the viral proteome – for example, the novel ORFs overlapping the end of ORF1b have a similar density of ribosomes as ORF1a at 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). As described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), these overlapping ORFs are not subject to noticeable purifying selection, indicating that they are unlikely to produce functional proteins. This raises the possibility that their translation is tolerated as a side effect of ORF1b sgRNA production, which may primarily function to regulate expression of ORF1b itself (explored in the following section).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Examining the potential for non-canonical transcripts to modulate non-structural protein stoichiometry</title><p>After characterising the translation of novel ORFs present on some of the transcripts discovered in our junction-spanning read analysis, we wanted to determine whether non-canonical transcripts had the potential to modulate expression of canonical PRRSV proteins. Transcripts, such as the ORF1b sgRNAs and the heteroclite sgRNAs, which might permit expression of a portion of ORF1a or ORF1b could potentially result in modulation of the stoichiometry of the nsps which make up the polyprotein. Although these non-canonical sgRNAs are less abundant than gRNA, from which ORF1ab is canonically expressed, they are likely to be translated more efficiently. As described above, gRNA has poor TE, likely due to containing signals targeting it for replication and/or packaging, meaning only a fraction of the transcript pool is available for translation. The non-canonical sgRNAs may lack some of these signals and therefore be more available for translation, meaning they could have a considerable effect on the expression of polyprotein products, despite relatively low transcript abundance.</p><p>First, we investigated the possibility that C-terminal portions of ORF1b are translated from the ORF1b sgRNAs, inspired by the increased ORF1b-phase RiboSeq density in the 3′-proximal region of ORF1b at late timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2B</xref>). Correlating these density changes with the positions of ORF1b sgRNA body TRSs supported this conclusion, revealing step increases in ORF1b-phase ribosome density after some of the ORF1b sgRNA body TRSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was confirmed by quantification of density in the regions between these body TRSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). At 6 hpi, when no ORF1b sgRNAs are detected, read density remains reasonably constant throughout ORF1b, while at later timepoints, as ORF1b sgRNA expression increases, a pattern of increasing density towards the 3′ end of ORF1b emerges, with the 3′-most regions more highly translated than ORF1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Expression of specific regions of ORF1a and ORF1b.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of RNASeq (upper) and RiboSeq (lower) reads mapping to the ORF1b region of the North American porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (NA PRRSV) genome.

These body TRSs are also well-conserved, particularly the final two Cs, identified as the most highly conserved part of the canonical sgRNA body TRS consensus in this and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Nelsen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Lin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This raises the likelihood that such body TRSs may also produce ORF1b sgRNAs in other isolates of NA PRRSV. Indeed, while this article was under review, a study was published in which junction-spanning reads were analysed at 12 hpi in NA-PRRSV-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>). These authors found similar ORF1b sgRNAs, despite using isolates from divergent areas of the NA PRRSV phylogeny (XM-2020 and GD from lineages 1 and 8, respectively, compared to SD95-21 from lineage 5 in the present work). The similarity was most pronounced for ORF1b sgRNA 5, for which the GD isolate was found to use a body TRS in precisely the same genomic location as SD95-21, and the XM-2020 isolate used one just 24 nt upstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>). Furthermore, although the body TRSs for the EU PRRSV ORF1b sgRNAs are less well-conserved within the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), they are located at very similar positions on the genome compared to the NA PRRSV ORF1b sgRNA 2 and 5 body TRSs (which correlate with two of the greatest increases in ORF1b-phase RiboSeq read density for NA PRRSV). Strikingly, the resemblance is again greatest for NA PRRSV ORF1b sgRNA 5, which has a body TRS in a genomic location exactly equivalent to EU PRRSV ORF1b sgRNA 2, and both body TRSs have only a single mismatch compared to the leader TRS, despite this not being a requirement for maintaining the amino acid identities at this position. The conservation of these features of ORF1b sgRNAs between these highly divergent arterivirus isolates suggests that there may be a selective advantage in their production, which could result from temporal modulation of the stoichiometry of nsps 10–12.</p><p>Similarly, the heteroclite sgRNAs have the potential to modulate the stoichiometry of ORF1a. To examine this, the read density in ORF1ab was partitioned between gRNA and heteroclite sgRNAs (a distinction not made in the previous analyses) using a ‘decumulation’ procedure introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Irigoyen et al., 2016</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). This revealed evidence of heteroclite sgRNA translation at all timepoints, with the highest ratio of heteroclite:gRNA translation being reached at 12 hpi, consistent with the increased ratio of heteroclite:gRNA RNASeq density at this timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). This supports the hypothesis that the N-terminal region of ORF1a can be independently translated from heteroclite sgRNAs (besides from gRNA as part of pp1a/ab) during infection, which could function to increase the ratio of nsp1α and nsp1β compared to the other nsps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Consistent with the previous analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>), the TE of ORF1a decreases over time, on both the gRNA and the heteroclite sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). For NA PRRSV, the TE of the heteroclite sgRNAs is higher than that of gRNA at all timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), potentially due to differences such as the extent to which these transcripts are sequestered for replication. Despite the absence of detectable EU PRRSV heteroclite sgRNAs in the junction-spanning read analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), analogous calculations were performed to investigate heteroclite sgRNA and ORF1a expression in EU PRRSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), revealing RNASeq and RiboSeq outcomes consistent with the presence of translated heteroclite sgRNAs. These transcripts could potentially be present below the threshold of detection for the junction-spanning read analysis pipeline. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the non-canonical transcripts discovered in this study provide a potential mechanism to temporally regulate the stoichiometry of the polyprotein components, which may reflect changing requirements for the different nsps throughout infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Investigation of PRF on the viral genome</title><p>Another key mechanism by which the stoichiometry of the polyprotein components is controlled is PRF.

Commonly, from profiling data, frameshift efficiency is calculated using the ratio of the read density upstream of the PRF site compared to downstream, where density is expected to be lower due to termination of either the 0-frame or the transframe ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hill et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Irigoyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dinan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finkel et al., 2021b</xref>). However, at the NA PRRSV nsp2 PRF site, ribosome drop-off at the end of nsp2N and nsp2TF is not evident, and instead there is an increase in RiboSeq read density after the frameshift site at 9 and 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). The reason for this is unclear; perhaps it is a consequence of expressed non-canonical transcripts below the threshold of detection, or biological and/or technical biases. This increase is not seen in the counterpart RNASeq libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s5">Figure 10—figure supplement 5</xref>), and is not related to frameshifting, as it also occurs in the KO2 mutant, in which nsp2 frameshifting is prevented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). Initially, drawing on our previous work on cardioviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Napthine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hill et al., 2021a</xref>), we attempted to normalise potential biasing effects such as these density changes by dividing the RiboSeq profile for the WT virus by that of the KO2 mutant. However, calculations of nsp2-site PRF efficiencies using these normalised read densities were quite variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s6">Figure 10—figure supplement 6A and B</xref>; see Materials and methods for details). This may be due to the modest level of frameshifting at this site (see below), meaning ribosomal drop-off is low relative to the level of non-frameshift translation. This is in contrast to cardioviruses, where the frameshift efficiencies reach ~80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Napthine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hill et al., 2021a</xref>), and to frameshifting at the PRRSV ORF1ab site, where it is only frameshifted ribosomes (rather than non-frameshifted ribosomes) that contribute to downstream RiboSeq density.</p><p>Therefore, we instead quantified −2 PRF efficiency at the nsp2 site by comparing the proportion of reads in each phase in the upstream and transframe regions (see Materials and methods for details). This led to much greater reproducibility between replicates and revealed that −2 PRF efficiency increases significantly, from 23% at 6 hpi to 39% at 9 hpi, at which point it reaches a plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s6">Figure 10—figure supplement 6</xref>; p&lt;0.0005 based on bootstrap resampling). This is only the second known example of temporally regulated PRF (after cardioviruses; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Napthine et al., 2017</xref>) and supports a model of increasing −2 PRF efficiency as nsp1β, the viral protein responsible for stimulating PRF at this site, accumulates and then similarly starts to plateau at 9 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). The −2 PRF efficiency on the EU PRRSV genome at 8 hpi was estimated to be 26% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s6">Figure 10—figure supplement 6</xref>), which is similar to the 20% value determined by <sup>35</sup>S-Met radiolabelling of MARC-145 cells infected with the EU PRRSV isolate SD01-08 and harvested at 24 hpi (MOI 0.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fang et al., 2012</xref>). The efficiency of EU PRRSV −2 PRF at 8 hpi (26%) is significantly lower than the NA PRRSV efficiency at 9 hpi (39%; p&lt;0.0005 based on bootstrap resampling). This likely reflects differences between the two viruses as opposed to the difference in timepoints, as EU nsp1β has already accumulated by 8 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), and gene expression analyses suggest the 8 hpi EU PRRSV samples and 9 hpi NA PRRSV samples have progressed to a similar stage of infection (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although these higher levels (~39%) of −2 PRF have not previously been measured in the context of viral infection, nsp2-site frameshift efficiencies of up to ~50% have been previously recorded in various reporter systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Patel et al., 2020</xref>), confirming that this site is capable of facilitating the highly efficient −2 PRF observed here.</p><p>Frameshift efficiency at the arterivirus ORF1ab site has not previously been determined in the context of infection, although studies using transfected reporter constructs for PRRSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bekaert and Rousset, 2005</xref>) (in yeast) and EAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">den Boon et al., 1991</xref>) (in HeLa cells) estimated −1 PRF efficiency as 16% and 15–20%, respectively. We set out to quantify its efficiency in the context of PRRSV infection. Ribosomal drop-off is clearly evident at the ORF1ab −1 PRF site for both NA and EU PRRSV, corresponding to ribosomes which do not frameshift encountering the ORF1a stop codon shortly downstream of the frameshift site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We quantified the ratio of RiboSeq read density in the region downstream of the PRF site compared to that upstream to calculate frameshift efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). PRF efficiency at RNA structure-directed sites is commonly assumed to be fixed; however, surprisingly, −1 PRF efficiency at this site also increased over the course of infection, from 11% at 6 hpi to 19% at 9 hpi (p-value from two-tailed Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test = 8.5 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), and further increased to 32% at 12 hpi (p = 8.5 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). The same trend was not observed in the RNASeq libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>), which were processed as a negative control, indicating that it does not result from shared technical biases or an increase in non-canonical transcripts facilitating translation of ORF1b (note that all detected ORF1b sgRNAs are excluded from the regions used). The ORF1ab −1 PRF efficiency on the EU PRRSV genome at 8 hpi was 23%, which is similar to the calculated efficiency for NA PRRSV at 9 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). This is consistent with the replicase components being required at similar stoichiometries at this stage of infection for these two viruses.</p><p>Ribosomal pausing over the slippery sequence is considered to be an important mechanistic feature of PRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Plant and Dinman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Namy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brierley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2020</xref>), although it has been difficult to detect robustly on WT slippery sequences using ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Irigoyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dinan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finkel et al., 2021b</xref>). To determine whether ribosomal pausing occurs over the nsp2 slippery sequence, we plotted the RPF distribution on the WT genome in this region and compared this to the KO2 genome to control for shared biases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s7">Figure 10—figure supplement 7A</xref>). This revealed a peak on the WT genome, derived predominantly from 21-nt reads and corresponding to ribosomes paused with P site over the slippery sequence (G-G<underline>UU-U</underline>UU, P site pause location underlined, hyphens delineate 0-frame codons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s7">Figure 10—figure supplement 7A–C</xref>). The peak is not present on the KO2 genome, nor does it overlap the point mutations of KO2, indicating that the differences between the WT and KO2 profiles do not result from technical biases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s7">Figure 10—figure supplement 7D</xref>); however, its origin is unclear. The frameshift-associated pause is thought to occur at a late stage of the translocation event which begins with the GUU codon in the P site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caliskan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caliskan et al., 2017</xref>). The positioning of the short-read peak 1 nt downstream of this could be due to an unusual frameshift-intermediate conformation (e.g. a hyper-rotated state; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Qin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2014</xref>) protecting a shorter region of mRNA in the exit tunnel. However, short RPFs are thought to originate from post-translocation ribosomes without an aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lareau et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that this peak could instead represent ribosomes pausing while decoding the first codon of nsp2TF, which would not be translated on the KO2 genome. This UUG (Leu) codon is normally not expected to be slow to decode, as it is well-adapted to the cellular tRNA pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s7">Figure 10—figure supplement 7A</xref>, heatmap); however, other factors, such as incomplete dissociation of the PCBP/nsp1β complex shortly downstream, could hinder decoding after frameshifting. We found no convincing evidence of ribosomal pausing at the ORF1ab −1 PRF site, and it will be interesting to see whether future ribosome profiling studies which capture the population of short RPFs find similar pauses at other sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Host differential gene expression at 12 hpi</title><p>Finally, we interrogated our datasets to investigate the host transcriptional and translational response to NA PRRSV infection.

However, a comparison of transcriptional fold changes with those of TE reveals that the majority of transcriptionally upregulated genes in WT or KO2 compared to mock are downregulated in terms of TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>, top-left quadrants of right-column panels). Such an effect has previously been described as ‘translational buffering’ and is expected to result in little to no change in protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kusnadi et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that many of the observed transcriptional changes make only a minor contribution to the host response to infection. This is consistent with the observation that many of the GO terms enriched amongst the transcriptionally upregulated genes are also enriched in the translationally downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig11sdata1">Figure 11—source data 1</xref>, ‘GO_TE_down’ sheet).

As we expected relatively small differences in the gene expression programmes activated by the two viruses, we lowered the magnitude of the log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) required to qualify as a ‘differentially expressed’ gene (DEG) from 1 (in comparisons of infected vs. mock) to 0.7 to increase sensitivity. Many of the DEGs in the comparison between WT and KO2 also appear in the list of DEGs in the WT vs. mock comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig11sdata1 fig11sdata2">Figure 11—source data 1 and 2</xref>). These genes have fold changes in the same direction in both the WT vs. mock and KO2 vs. mock analyses, but those in the KO2 analysis are of a lower magnitude, likely representing the slightly slower replication kinetics of the mutant virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Li et al., 2018</xref>) as opposed to meaningful differences in the host response. An exception to this is thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, red). TXNIP is significantly more highly transcribed in KO2 than WT infection [log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) = 0.79, p=2.1 × 10<sup>−13</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, left column] and, although it is below our thresholds for qualification as a DEG in these analyses, it is transcriptionally regulated in opposing directions in the WT vs. mock [log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) = −0.43, p=0.055] and KO2 vs. mock [log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) = 0.64, p=7.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup>] comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>, left column), suggesting the difference is not related to replication kinetics. No genes generated significant p-values for the KO2 vs. WT TE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, middle column), in which the distribution of p-values was conservative, likely due to the similarity between the two datasets. Nonetheless, TXNIP clearly stands out in the comparison of RNA and TE fold changes as it is both more highly transcribed and more efficiently translated in KO2 than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, right column), further supporting the conclusion that increased TXNIP expression is a notable feature of KO2 infection.</p><p>The mechanism by which the presence of nsp2TF/nsp2N could lead to reduced TXNIP expression in WT infection is unclear. The frameshift products share a PLP2 protease domain with the 0-frame product, nsp2, although the DUB/deISGylase activity of this domain is most potent in nsp2N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Li et al., 2018</xref>). The frameshift proteins also have different sub-cellular distributions to nsp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Guo et al., 2021</xref>), which may grant them access to proteins involved in the transcriptional activation of TXNIP, allowing them to interfere with this signalling pathway (e.g. by de-ubiquitinating its components). While the mechanism remains elusive, there are several reasons why this downregulation may be beneficial to PRRSV. TXNIP is a key protein in metabolism and redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alhawiti et al., 2017</xref>), regulates cell survival/apoptosis via apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Xiang et al., 2005</xref>), and triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation in monocytes and innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Shalev, 2014</xref>). TXNIP largely exerts its functions by binding and inhibiting thioredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Nishiyama et al., 1999</xref>), an antioxidant which is central to redox signalling and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Lu and Holmgren, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Matsuzawa, 2017</xref>), and reduced cellular levels of TXNIP lead to lower concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Song et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). ROS are known to be induced by PRRSV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guo et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lee and Kleiboeker, 2007</xref>) and lead to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lee and Kleiboeker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Redza-Dutordoir and Averill-Bates, 2016</xref>), which would likely be detrimental to viral replication. Further, ROS, and by extension thioredoxin and TXNIP, have particular significance for the physiology and function of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Herb and Schramm, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Forman and Torres, 2001</xref>), the primary target for PRRSV in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>). As well as being integral to phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Herb and Schramm, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Forman and Torres, 2001</xref>), ROS exert a complex, context-dependent effect on macrophage polarisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Rendra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Tan et al., 2016</xref>), and high levels of thioredoxin have been found to favour polarisation of M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">El Hadri et al., 2012</xref>). These produce less antiviral cytokines and are less suppressive of PRRSV replication than their M1 counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, reducing cellular TXNIP concentrations during WT PRRSV infection may be favourable by allowing thioredoxin to function uninhibited and preventing excessive ROS concentrations, with potential implications for macrophage physiology and polarisation. Indeed, it has already been suggested that PRRSV infection induces a skew towards M2 polarisation, although the mechanism was uncharacterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we describe a high-resolution analysis of PRRSV replication through ribosome profiling and RNASeq.

This phenomenon of host transcriptional responses being counteracted by opposing changes in TE has also been observed in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, where it was attributed to inhibition of mRNA export from the nucleus, preventing translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Finkel et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2021</xref>). This activity is known to be associated with coronavirus nsp1, which inhibits nuclear export by interacting with the nuclear export factor NXF1 in SARS-CoV or the nuclear pore complex component Nup93 in SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gomez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>).

These findings suggest that nsp1β-mediated nuclear export inhibition may be responsible for the translational repression seen in our host differential gene expression analyses, which, analogously to conclusions drawn for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Finkel et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2021</xref>), may be a key mechanism by which PRRSV evades the host response to infection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The NA PRRSV 5′ UTR contains a highly expressed uORF</title><p>On the viral genome, numerous translated novel ORFs were discovered, including a short but highly expressed uORF in the NA PRRSV 5′ leader, which is shared by the gRNA and sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). The presence of this uORF is very well-conserved amongst NA PRRSV isolates, with an AUG in this position in 558/564 available NA PRRSV sequences, and a non-canonical initiation codon (GUG/AUA/ACG) present in the remainder. In many contexts, uORFs have been shown to regulate translation of the main ORF downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Zhang et al., 2019b</xref>) and, interestingly, uORFs have been found in many nidovirus genomes. For example, recent ribosome profiling studies of the coronaviruses MHV, IBV, and SARS-CoV-2 revealed translation of uORFs initiating within the 5′ leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Irigoyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dinan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finkel et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, the extent of translation initiation on the SARS-CoV-2 leader uORF differs on different viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finkel et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kim et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that the same could be true of the NA PRRSV uORF, and presenting a potential mechanism by which the uORF could differentially regulate translation of the canonical ORFs downstream. Looking to the <italic>Arteriviridae</italic> family, EAV has a highly conserved AUG within the leader (present in 94/95 available genome sequences), at genomic coordinates 14–16, predicted to permit expression of a 37-amino acid leader peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kheyar et al., 1996</xref>). In vitro translation of the N transcript demonstrated that the uORF is translated and found it downregulated translation of the downstream N ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Archambault et al., 2006</xref>). Mutations which disrupted this AUG or altered its predicted initiation efficiency were detrimental to viral fitness and led to rapid reversion to the WT sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Archambault et al., 2006</xref>), although the uORF was not essential for virus viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Archambault et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Molenkamp et al., 2000</xref>). Upstream ORFs in other arteriviruses have not been characterised, although it was noted that the SHFV 5′ leader contains a putative 13-codon uORF at genomic coordinates 35–73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998</xref>), which is conserved in all 37 available full genome sequences. This SHFV uORF is of a similar length and position to the NA PRRSV uORF (10 codons; genomic coordinates 24–36), with the uORFs in these two viruses ending, respectively, 126 nt and 128 nt upstream of the leader TRS. The similarity between these two putative uORFs suggests a possible conserved function, for example, conferring resistance to eIF2α-phosphorylation-mediated translation inhibition (as observed for some cellular uORFs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreev et al., 2015</xref>) or affecting re-initiation efficiency on the downstream ORF. The latter could help to modulate the ratio of overlapping ORFs (GP2:E and/or GP5:5a) in which the downstream AUG is thought to be accessed by leaky scanning. However, there is little evidence that EU PRRSV encodes a similar uORF as only 3 out of the 100 EU PRRSV genome sequences with any 5′ UTR have AUGs other than at the extreme 5′ end of the leader (although translation could potentially initiate from near-cognate start codons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Firth and Brierley, 2012</xref>). Further, we do not detect robust uORF translation in the EU PRRSV isolate used in this study, indicating that any putative function of the uORF is not conserved across the entire family.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Frameshift efficiency at the protein-directed nsp2 site increases over time</title><p>Our analysis of canonical PRRSV ORFs over a 12 hr timecourse revealed that the expression of many of these ORFs is controlled by additional mechanisms at both the transcriptional and translational levels beyond what was previously appreciated. A key observation is that −2 PRF at the NA PRRSV nsp2 PRF site is both highly efficient and temporally regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). At 6 hpi its efficiency is 23%, and this increases to ~40% at 9 and 12 hpi, likely due to accumulation of the frameshift-stimulatory viral protein, nsp1β. Such regulation may be a selective advantage for PRRSV by directing ribosomes to translate proteins which are most beneficial at each stage of infection, optimising the use of cellular resources. At early timepoints, lower nsp2 frameshift efficiency means more ribosomes continue to translate the remainder of pp1a or pp1ab, which encode components of the replication and transcription complex (RTC), which may be more important for establishing infection than translation of the accessory protein nsp2TF. Later in the replication cycle, higher −2 PRF efficiency likely corresponds to an increased requirement for nsp2TF to prevent degradation of GP5 and M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Guo et al., 2021</xref>), which are expressed from ~8 hpi and are essential for virion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Wissink et al., 2005</xref>). Further, nsp2TF is a more potent innate immune suppressor than nsp2, and downregulates expression of swine leukocyte antigen class I (swine MHC class I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2016</xref>), which may become critical later in infection as viral proteins and double-stranded RNA accumulate due to viral translation and replication. The only other known example of temporally regulated frameshifting is provided by cardioviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Napthine et al., 2017</xref>), which encode the only other known protein-stimulated PRF site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Loughran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Finch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Napthine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Napthine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hill et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hill et al., 2021a</xref>). This suggests that temporal regulation may emerge as a common feature of <italic>trans</italic>-activated PRF sites as more non-canonical PRF sites are discovered in future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Frameshift efficiency at the RNA structure-directed ORF1ab site increases over time</title><p>RNA structure-directed frameshift sites are commonly assumed to operate at a fixed ratio due to the lack of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors involved; however, we found that −1 PRF efficiency at the ORF1ab site increased over time, from 11% to 32% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>). As opposed to representing specific ‘regulation’ of PRF, we suggest that this is due to changes in gRNA translation conditions as infection progresses. Such changes could result from activation of pathways that globally regulate translation, such as the unfolded protein response (which is known to be activated by PRRSV infection; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Huo et al., 2013</xref>) or potential phosphorylation of eEF2 (discussed above). Additionally, changes in the localisation or availability of gRNA for translation could result in changing ribosome density as infection progresses, and decreases in ribosome load have been shown to increase −1 PRF efficiency in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Lopinski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). The mechanism responsible for this effect is not well characterised, although it has been suggested that frameshift-stimulatory RNA structures are more likely to have time to re-fold in between ribosomes if the transcript is more sparsely occupied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Lopinski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, we find a trend of decreasing gRNA TE over time, although this analysis may be confounded by, for example, the inability to discern translatable gRNA from that undergoing packaging. Whether the observed changes in PRF efficiency represent a selective advantage for PRRSV, or whether they are simply incidental, is unclear. The expected result is an increase in the ratio of ORF1b products to ORF1a products over time. This could be advantageous for PRRSV, for example, if there is a greater requirement for nsp2 and nsp3, which promote DMV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Snijder et al., 2001</xref>), early in infection to establish a protective environment for viral replication, followed by a later preference for producing more of the RdRp (nsp9) and helicase (nsp10) to promote replication itself. Alternatively, this could simply reflect that PRRSV can tolerate a reasonably wide range of ORF1a:ORF1b stoichiometries. Nonetheless, the finding that changes in the translational landscape during infection affect PRF efficiency is relevant to many other RNA viruses, and future studies may reveal temporal changes in PRF efficiency at other frameshift sites, such as those in coronaviruses and HIV. For MHV and SARS-CoV-2, previous results tentatively suggest that ORF1ab frameshift efficiency may increase over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Irigoyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Puray-Chavez et al., 2021</xref>), but temporal dependence was not assessed in detail, nor statistical significance determined, highlighting this as an interesting area for future coronavirus research.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Non-canonical ORF1b sgRNAs may modulate expression of ORF1b</title><p>In addition to changes in the ratio of ORF1b to ORF1a translation, we observed temporal changes in the relative translation of different regions within ORF1b, with increasing translation of the 3′-proximal region as infection progresses. This may result from translation of non-canonical sgRNAs, which we term ORF1b sgRNAs, in which the body TRS is within ORF1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref>). If the putative translated proteins are processed to produce functional nsps, this would be expected to increase the stoichiometry of nsps 10–12 compared to nsp9, and alter the relative stoichiometries of nsp10, nsp11, and nsp12. There are several possible reasons this could be beneficial to viral fitness. Although the stoichiometry of the arterivirus RTC is unknown, there is some evidence that the stoichiometry of the coronavirus replication complex varies, containing either one or two copies of the helicase for each copy of the holo-RdRp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). This highlights the possibility that the composition of the PRRSV RTC could change over time, for example, if extra copies of nsp10, 11, or 12 are supplied from ORF1b sgRNA translation (as well as the potential contribution of increased ORF1ab frameshift efficiency). This provides a potential mechanism of regulating viral replication, for example, by altering the ratio of gRNA to sgRNA production (as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), as both nsp10 (the helicase) and nsp12 are thought to be involved in promoting sgRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">van Dinten et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Song et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Nan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). Nsp11 (NendoU) is an endoribonuclease found in many nidoviruses, which has broad substrate specificity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Nedialkova et al., 2009</xref>), and is also an innate immune antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Its expression outside the context of infection is highly toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Shi et al., 2016</xref>), leading to the suggestion that its restricted perinuclear localisation during infection is important to prevent its expression becoming ‘suicidal’ for the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Snijder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it may be beneficial to maintain relatively low levels of nsp11 early in infection and increase production after the optimal microenvironment for its localisation has formed. However, such possibilities are clearly speculative at present.</p><p>Interestingly, ORF1b sgRNAs have been found in a number of other nidoviruses. Our results are highly consistent with a previous study on SHFV, in which several ORF1b sgRNAs were detected, which were predicted to produce in-frame portions of the ORF1b polyprotein, or in one case a novel overlapping ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Di et al., 2017</xref>). Quantitative mass spectrometry provided support for translation of both categories of ORF1b sgRNA and showed that peptides from nsp11 and nsp12 were 1.2- and 3.1-fold more abundant (respectively) than those from ORF1a-encoded nsp8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Di et al., 2017</xref>). ORF1b sgRNAs were also found in lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (predicted to express the C-terminal 200 amino acids of ORF1b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 1993</xref>), SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, and equine torovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Stewart et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finkel et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Viehweger et al., 2019</xref>). Whether this has evolved by virtue of conferring a selective advantage, or whether it is a neutral consequence of the promiscuous discontinuous transcription mechanism, this suggests that ORF1b sgRNAs are a conserved feature of the nidovirus transcriptome. Further characterisation of these non-canonical transcripts would be highly informative to determine potential initiation sites and ascertain whether any in-frame products are functional.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Non-canonical heteroclite sgRNAs may modulate expression of ORF1a</title><p>Another group of non-canonical transcripts with the potential to modulate polyprotein stoichiometry comprises those termed ‘heteroclite sgRNAs’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Yuan et al., 2004</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>).

Translation of these transcripts is supported by our ribosome profiling results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), in vitro experiments using PRRSV reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Yuan et al., 2004</xref>), and ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry studies of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finkel et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">St-Germain et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Grenga et al., 2020</xref>).

If they do produce functional proteins, this could serve as a mechanism to increase the levels of nsp1α and nsp1β, generally considered the most potent innate immune suppressors encoded by PRRSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Song et al., 2010</xref>), from early timepoints onwards to evade immune activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work is the first application of ribosome profiling to an arterivirus and has revealed a complex complement of PRRSV gene expression strategies, several of which permit stoichiometric modulation of the polyprotein proteins. At the level of translational control, the nsp2 −2 PRF site was found to be a rare example of temporally regulated frameshifting, while the finding that −1 PRF efficiency at the ORF1a/1b overlap also increased over time challenges the paradigm that RNA structure-directed frameshift sites operate at a fixed efficiency. At the transcriptional level, numerous non-canonical transcripts were characterised, some of which bear similarities to those found in other nidoviruses. Among these transcripts, the ORF1b sgRNAs and the heteroclite sgRNAs encode portions of the polyprotein and may provide an additional method of regulating the stoichiometry of its components. Further, some ORF1b sgRNAs likely facilitate the surprisingly high levels of translation we observed for several novel ORFs overlapping ORF1b. Although there is no evidence that these overlapping ORFs produce functional proteins, the lability in the translatome that is afforded by the heterogeneous transcriptome potentially paves the way for similar ORFs to gain functions and become fixed in the viral population. Further expanding the PRRSV translatome, a short but highly translated uORF was discovered in the NA PRRSV 5′ UTR, the presence of which is highly conserved. This presents another opportunity for regulation of viral translation, potentially allowing adaptation in response to infection-induced cellular stress. This is the most comprehensive analysis of PRRSV gene expression to date and presents new paradigms for understanding arterivirus gene expression and the wider field of PRF, with potential ramifications for a range of viruses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>PRRSV-2</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT NA PRRSV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23761406/">23761406</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SD95-21;

The greater length range of 9 hpi replicate 2 RiboSeq libraries was selected to investigate the potential presence of long fragments protected by disomes or stable structures/complexes at frameshift sites (analyses not included herein due to inconclusive results). Ribosomal RNA depletion was carried out solely using the Ribo-Zero Gold Human/Mouse/Rat kit (Illumina). Adapter sequences were based on the TruSeq small RNA sequences (Illumina) and, for most libraries, additional randomised bases were added to the end destined for ligation: 7 randomised bases on both adapters for all NA PRRSV libraries, no randomised bases on EU PRRSV replicate 1, and 14 randomised bases on the 3′ adapter for EU PRRSV replicate 2. Randomised bases allow identification of PCR duplicates and are expected to reduce technical biases. Libraries were deep sequenced as a single-end run on the NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina) or a paired-end run using a Mid Output v2 kit (150 cycles: 2 × 75) for 9 hpi replicate 2 RiboSeq libraries.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Core analysis pipeline</title><p>For single-end libraries, fastx_clipper (FASTX Toolkit version 0.0.14, parameters: ‘-Q33 -l 33 -c -n -v’) was used to trim the universal adapter sequence from reads and to discard adapter-only reads, non-clipped reads, and ‘too-short’ reads (inferred original fragment lengths shorter than the minimum intended length experimentally purified – see library preparation description for lengths). Adapter dimers were counted using the grep command line utility and added to the adapter-only read count. For paired-end libraries, adapter trimming, read pair merging, and removal of adapter-only reads were carried out using LeeHom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Renaud et al., 2014</xref>) (v.1.1.5) with the --ancient-dna option specified (as the expected fragment lengths of such DNA are in the same range as ours). Pairs of reads which LeeHom was unable to merge were put in the ‘non-clipped’ category for the purposes of library composition analysis, and ‘too-short’ reads were removed using awk. For libraries prepared using adapters with randomised bases, PCR duplicates were removed using awk, and seqtk (version 1.3) was used to trim the randomised bases from the reads. Bowtie1 (version 1.2.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) was used to map reads to host and viral genomes using parameters ‘-v n_mismatches --best’, where n_mismatches was 1 for RiboSeq and 2 for RNASeq libraries. Reads were mapped to each of the following databases in order, and only reads that failed to align were mapped to the next database: ribosomal RNA (rRNA), virus RNA (vRNA), mRNA, non-coding RNA (ncRNA), genomic DNA (gDNA). Viral genome sequences were verified by de novo genome assembly using Trinity (version 2.9.1). The rRNA database comprised the following GenBank accessions: NR_003287.2, NR_023379.1, NR_003285.2, NR_003286.2, AY603036.1, AF420058.1, AF420040.1, AY633510.1, AF352382.1, L35185.1, DQ983926.1, KJ193255.1, M30951.1, M30950.1, M30952.1, KJ193272.1, KJ193259.1, KJ193258.1, KJ193256.1, KJ193255.1, KJ193045.1, KJ193042.1, KJ193044.1, KJ193041.1, KJ193019.1, KJ193018.1, KJ193017.1, and AF420040.1. The mRNA database was compiled from the available <italic>C. sabaeus</italic> RefSeq mRNAs after removing transcripts with annotated changes in frame. The ncRNA database was Chlorocebus_sabaeus.ChlSab1.1.ncrna.fa, and the gDNA database was the ChlSab1.1 genome assembly, both from Ensembl. The position of vRNA within the database mapping order was altered to confirm that significant numbers of viral reads were not erroneously mapping to host databases or vice versa. All analyses were carried out using reads mapped by bowtie as described above, except for running PRICE, analyses using junction-spanning reads, or host differential gene expression.</p><p>Quality control plots and analyses were performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Irigoyen et al., 2016</xref>, modified for the timecourse libraries to account for the longer RNASeq reads, so that a 3′ UTR of at least 90 nt (as opposed to 60 nt) was required for inclusion of transcripts in the metagene analysis of 5′ end positions relative to start and stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For quality control analyses of read length and phasing, reads mapping to ORF1ab (all phases, nsp2TF excluded) were used for the virus versus host analyses (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), while for analyses of specific regions (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>), overlapping regions of ORFs were permitted for the length distribution but not phasing analyses. For these phasing plots, phase 0 was designated independently for each region, relative to the first nucleotide of the ORF in that region. For the negative-sense read analysis, reads mapping to anywhere on the viral genome were used, and phase was determined using the 5′ end of the read (the 5′ end of the reverse complement reported by bowtie plus the read length).

For plots of the percentage of reads in each phase across ORF1a, positive-sense RiboSeq reads were separated according to phase and a 183-codon running mean filter applied to avoid any instances of zero across ORF1a (excluding the halfwindow at each end) after sliding window application.

To avoid junction clusters becoming inflated, late timepoint libraries (8 hpi onwards) were filtered to remove junctions with fewer than four supporting reads. Reads were split into two categories, TRS-spanning and non-TRS-spanning, according to whether the donor site of the junction overlapped the leader TRS (genomic coordinates in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Junctions were clustered so that all junctions within a cluster had acceptor coordinates within 7 (for TRS-spanning junctions) or 2 (for non-TRS-spanning junctions) nucleotides of at least one other junction in the cluster, with the same requirement applied to donor coordinates. This was to group highly similar junctions together and account for the fact that the precise location of a junction is ambiguous in cases where there is similarity between the donor and acceptor sites (such as between the 6-nt leader and body TRSs). The junctions within each cluster were merged, with donor and acceptor sites defined as the midpoints of the ranges of coordinates observed in the cluster, and the number of reads supporting the merged junction defined as the sum of the supporting read counts for all the input junctions in the cluster.</p><p>Then, junctions were filtered to keep only those present in multiple libraries and merged to generate one dataset per timepoint. Merged junctions from individual libraries were filtered so that only junctions which were present in more than one replicate (considering WT and KO2 as one group) passed the filter. Junctions were defined as matching if the ranges of the donor and acceptor coordinates for the junction in one library overlap with those of a junction in a second library. Matching junctions from all replicates were merged as described above to make the final merged junction. For the NA PRRSV M junction, there is a stretch of six bases that is identical upstream of the leader TRS and the body TRS, leading to separation of the two alternative junction position assignments by a distance greater than the seven bases required to combine TRS-spanning junctions into clusters. The two junction clusters that are assigned either side of this stretch of identical bases were specifically selected and merged at this stage. To ensure this merging strategy did not lead to clusters spanning overly wide regions, widths of merged junction donor and acceptor sites were assessed, and the mean and median junction width for all analyses was found to be &lt;3 nt (maximum width 17 nt, for the NA PRRSV M junction). TRS-spanning junctions were designated as ‘known’ junctions if they were the major junction responsible for one of the known canonical sgRNAs of PRRSV. Non-TRS-spanning junctions were filtered according to whether they represent local (≤2000 nt) or distant (&gt;2000 nt) deletions.</p><p>The proportion of junction-spanning reads at donor and acceptor sites was calculated as junction-spanning/(junction-spanning + continuously aligned to reference genome). The number of non-junction-spanning reads at the junction site was defined as the number of bowtie-aligned reads (from the core pipeline) spanning at least the region 12 nt either side of the midpoint position of the donor or acceptor site (note that for sgRNA acceptor sites the denominator will include not only gRNA but also sgRNAs with body TRSs upstream). For all TRS-spanning junctions, the donor midpoint was set according to the known leader TRS sequence (genomic coordinate 188 for NA PRRSV and 219 for EU PRRSV).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Scaling ORF1b sgRNA transcript abundance for presentation alongside RiboSeq density plots</title><p>To enable easier comparison of ORF1b sgRNA transcript abundance with changes in ribosome profile in RiboSeq density plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), the usage frequency of the indicated body TRS for each ORF1b sgRNA was compared to that of the major body TRS for the canonical sgRNA with the fewest junction-spanning reads (GP4 for NA PRRSV and GP3 for EU PRRSV). The total number of reads, from all 12 hpi libraries combined (NA PRRSV) or all libraries combined (EU PRRSV), spanning the ORF1b sgRNA body TRS was divided by the number spanning the canonical sgRNA body TRS to give the relative abundance of the non-canonical transcript compared to the canonical transcript (denoted as ‘abund.’ on plots).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Detection of novel viral ORFs</title><p>Novel ORF discovery was performed using PRICE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Erhard et al., 2018</xref>) (version 1.0.3b).

The custom viral gtf files were each individually concatenated with the host gtf file (ChlSab1.1.101, downloaded from Ensembl) to make the input of known ORFs (treating the viral genome as an additional host chromosome). The reference fasta files for the host and viruses were similarly concatenated to make the input reference sequences.

For analyses of NA PRRSV genomes ‘representative of NA PRRSV diversity’, the NA PRRSV sequences were clustered using CD-HIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Li and Godzik, 2006</xref>) (version 4.8.1) based on the whole genome and with a nucleotide similarity threshold of 95% (all other parameters set to default), and one representative sequence from each cluster was selected to make a sequence alignment of 137 sequences. For the uORF amino acid conservation plot, the nucleotide sequence of the CDS was extracted from a multiple sequence alignment and frame 0 was translated, with a 28-codon extension in KY348852 omitted from the plot for space considerations. Logo plots and mini-alignment plots were generated using CIAlign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Tumescheit et al., 2022</xref>) and, for the uORF analyses, genome sequences which began partway through the ORF were excluded, as was KT257963 which has a likely sequencing artefact in the 5′ UTR.

Each ORF was paired with the transcript(s) most likely to facilitate its expression (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and junction coordinates in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1 fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 1–2</xref>). For some ORFs (NA PRRSV nsp10-iORF2, nsp11-iORF3, GP3-iORF, and GP4-iORF), this included transcripts which are expected to produce slightly N-terminally truncated ORFs compared to the PRICE designation. ORFs overlapping ORF1ab for which there were no novel transcripts expected to facilitate expression were paired with gRNA. All ORF1b sgRNAs, defined as sgRNAs with body TRSs within ORF1b and ≥50 or ≥ 10 junction-spanning reads at 12 hpi (NA PRRSV) or 8 hpi (EU PRRSV), were included in the transcript abundance analysis regardless of whether they are expected to result in expression of a novel ORF.</p><p>To estimate transcript abundance, reads aligned to the viral genome by STAR (see junction-spanning read analysis pipeline) were normalised by library size using the same library size normalisation factors as the core pipeline. In cases where multiple body TRSs are expected to give rise to two different forms of a transcript that express the same ORF(s), these were treated as a single transcript for the purposes of this analysis, and read counts for all junctions were combined. Abundance of the gRNA transcript was defined as the number of bowtie-aligned reads which span 12 nt either side of the midpoint of the leader TRS (genomic coordinate 188 for NA PRRSV and 291 for EU PRRSV). This is analogous to the 12-nt overhang required either side of a junction to qualify for mapping by STAR; however, these reads are not junction-spanning and map specifically to gRNA (and a small proportion of non-canonical transcripts such as heteroclite sgRNAs). Leader abundance was defined as the total number of reads for all other transcripts in the analysis combined, as the leader is present on all sgRNA species and the gRNA. TE was calculated by dividing RiboSeq RPKM values by RNASeq junction-spanning read RPM values, excluding conditions where the denominator was zero.</p><p>For plots with logarithmic axes, datapoints with a value of zero were excluded from the plot, but not from mean calculations. WT and KO2 were treated as equivalent unless specified. For libraries with shorter read lengths (EU libraries and NA 9 hpi replicate 1 libraries) junction-spanning read counts are lower (and also subject to greater inaccuracies as a result of less dilution of possible read start- and end-point-specific ligation biases) due to the requirement for a 12-nt overhang either side of the junction effectively representing a much larger proportion of the total read length. As such, these libraries are not directly comparable to the remaining NA PRRSV libraries and were plotted separately and not included in NA PRRSV mean calculations.</p><p>To calculate the percentage of the viral transcriptome represented by each transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), transcript abundances (estimated from junction-spanning read RPM values) within each library were converted to a percentage of the total RPM of all transcripts plotted for that library. Mean percentages for each group were calculated, treating WT and KO2 as equivalent. A similar process was used to calculate the percentage of the viral translatome represented by each ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), converting the RPKM value of each ORF (calculated from the PRICE output) to a percentage of the total sum of RPKM values of all ORFs plotted.</p><p>For the estimation of translation of different regions of ORF1b, sections were designated as the regions between the downstream-most body TRS of one ORF1b sgRNA and the upstream-most body TRS of the next (all region coordinates given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Bowtie-aligned RiboSeq reads (from the core pipeline) which mapped in-phase with ORF1b in the designated regions were counted using only read lengths with minimal RNP contamination (NA PRRSV) or good phasing (EU PRRSV). Total read counts were normalised by library size and region length to give RPKM. The same process was applied to the region of ORF1a between the major heteroclite junction and the nsp2 PRF site for comparison, counting reads mapping in-phase with ORF1a.</p><p>For investigation of gene expression in different regions of ORF1a, transcript abundance for the heteroclite sgRNAs was calculated by ‘decumulation’: subtracting the gRNA RNASeq RPKM (measured in the region between the major [S-2] heteroclite sgRNA junction and the first ORF1b sgRNA body TRS) from the RPKM in the region between the leader TRS and the major heteroclite sgRNA junction (‘heteroclite’). This provides an averaged result for all heteroclite sgRNAs, although it does not take into account the reduced transcript length for the minor heteroclite sgRNAs compared to S-2. RiboSeq read density (calculated as described above for sections of ORF1b) was similarly decumulated to assess ribosome occupancy of the heteroclite sgRNAs by subtracting the RiboSeq RPKM in the gRNA-only region (between the major heteroclite junction and the nsp2 PRF site) from that in the heteroclite region (all coordinates in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). For TE of the heteroclite region, the decumulated RiboSeq RPKM was divided by the decumulated RNASeq RPKM, whereas for the gRNA TE the raw RPKM values were used (as no decumulation is required). These TE values are intended for internal comparison with other TE values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> – due to the different denominators (RPKM versus RPM), they are not comparable to TE values presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>nsp2 site PRF efficiency calculations based on phasing</title><p>The proportion of reads in each phase in the upstream and transframe regions (coordinates in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) was calculated, where in both regions phase is taken relative to the ORF1a reading frame. It was assumed that all ribosomes in the upstream region were translating in the 0 frame, and the phase distribution in this region was used to estimate what proportion of 0-frame ribosomes generate reads attributed to the 0 phase (upstream<sub>0</sub>) and the −2 phase (upstream<sub>−2</sub>). This was extrapolated to determine what proportion of reads are expected to be in the −2 phase in the transframe region (transframe<sub>−2</sub>) in the absence of frameshifting (which is expected to be the same as in the upstream region). A proportion (FS_proportion) of ribosomes undergoing −2 PRF is expected to mean that, between the upstream and downstream region, FS_proportion of phase 0 reads change from the 0 to the −2 phase and FS_proportion of −2 phase reads move to the −1 phase (leaving 1 – FS_proportion in the −2 phase).

Each WT library was paired with its corresponding KO2 library (as described for the KO2-normalised strategy above), with matched codons selected for the two libraries in each resampling, and reads with 5′ ends mapping to these codons were used as input for the PRF efficiency calculations. Calculation of nsp2 −2 PRF efficiency for each resampling was performed using the phasing-based method as described above, with the results of individual libraries recorded, and then the mean of all libraries in each group calculated.

PRRSV gene expression over the time course of infection. The study not only identifies multiple non-canonical mechanisms of PRRSV gene expression regulation, but also shows that the frameshifting efficiency at the canonical ORF1ab frameshifting site changes with time. This finding provides new insights into the viral gene expression and into the regulation of programmed ribosome frameshifting, which has important implications for understanding viral biology and for developing antiviral drugs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75668.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Rodnina</surname><given-names>Marina V</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03e76ya46</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.11.17.468997">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.17.468997v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

My only concern is the design of a few figure panels which could be improved in my opinion before the final publication. Specifically, in Figure 6D, the nucleotide sequence is somewhat sandwiched and is hard to read. The issue is easily solvable by giving it more space on top and the bottom. I didn't find the multiple sequence alignment in Figure 6E to be very useful. Since we don't know what colours are assigned to what amino acids, the only information that could be obtained from this is on the degree of conservation, but I am not sure that this specific representation is particularly useful for the assessment of conservation.

The ribosome run-off in these libraries is clearly reflected in the metagene profiles presented (Figure S1) and in the translation profiles of most viral ORFs, especially in the late time points samples (seen in Figure 2B and S8), meaning the distribution of reads within ORFs is unlikely to represent true biology but rather a technical artifact. As a result, comparison of footprint densities between different regions of the same ORF should be done with great caution.

This issue should be clarified and the conclusions toned down where appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>For context, we start by clarifying our decision to omit a CHX pre-treatment step in the preparation of the majority of the libraries in this manuscript:</p><p>Early profiling papers on <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> found that pre-treatment with CHX exacerbated a “ramp” in the 5′ ~200 codons of CDSs in the host meta-gene profile (Gerashchenko and Gladyshev 2014; Ingolia et al., 2009), although the ramp was still present to some extent in the absence of CHX pre-treatment (Ingolia et al., 2009). In mammalian cells, the ramp was only detectable after CHX pre-treatment, leading to the conclusion that it is not a physiological feature of translation in mammalian cells (Ingolia, Lareau, and Weissman 2011). Although this conclusion has been challenged by recent work (Sharma et al., 2021), the general best practice in harvesting mammalian cells for ribosome profiling is still to avoid CHX pre-treatment where possible, to avoid such potential artefacts (Ingolia et al., 2012, 2011; Sharma et al., 2021). CHX-induced artefacts are a particular issue when observing stressed cells. In yeast cells harvested with CHX pre-treatment, the 5′ ramp becomes greatly enhanced under stress conditions compared to non-stressed conditions, whereas in yeast cells harvested without CHX pre-treatment, the ramp is unchanged between these conditions (Gerashchenko and Gladyshev 2014). This led to the conclusion that the increase in the ramp under stress was an artefact of CHX pre-treatment and further spoke against its use in harvesting protocols. Unpublished mammalian cell data from our labs and the lab of Dr Nerea Irigoyen (see page 32 of G. M. Cook’s PhD thesis, Figure 1.12, https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.77982) indicates that the same is true for the murine cell line 17 Cl-1. For the libraries described in the present work, it was particularly pertinent to consider artefacts that might be enhanced under stress conditions, as viral infection exerts considerable stress on the cell. A CHX-induced artefact that affects RPF distribution in stressed (e.g. late-timepoint infected) cells more than unstressed (e.g. mock or early-timepoint infected) cells could confound interpretation of the results. Therefore, we opted to omit the CHX pre-treatment step, judging that any bias introduced by a small amount of ribosome run-off (which should be comparable across all libraries) would be more favourable than the potential bias introduced by an artefactual ramp specifically enhanced in stressed cells. To minimise ribosome run-off, we harvested these cells as rapidly as was feasible, by snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>Regarding the extent to which the run-off in our libraries has the potential to affect our conclusions, we believe this to be minimal. Reviewer three is correct in pointing out that there is some run-off observable in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 (formerly Supplementary Figure 1); however, its magnitude is relatively small, and it only noticeably affects the first ~100 nt of host CDSs. It occurred to us while drafting this response that it may not have been clear that the x axis on this host meta-gene profile denotes nucleotides as opposed to codons, so this has been clarified on this and other similar plots. The fact that the visible run-off in our libraries covers such a short region makes it unlikely that its effect is observable in viral ORFs at the scale depicted in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 (formerly Supplementary Figure 8), as both of these Figures show the full viral genome, which is ~15,000 nt long. Figure 2B displays RNASeq data, to which ribosome run-off is not relevant (and the increasing density towards the 3′ end represents sgRNA transcription); however, we presume the reviewer meant to cite Figure 2C here. Although it is probable that the first ~100 nt of viral CDSs are affected by run-off in a similar way to the host CDSs in the meta-gene profile, we do not believe there is evidence that run-off affects the ribosome profile of viral ORFs beyond this point. Taking ORF1ab as an example (more clearly seen in Figure 10A and Figure 10—figure supplement 1 [formerly Supplementary Figure 17], which show only this ~12,000-nt long ORF), the reviewer may have interpreted the increasing RPF density shortly after the nsp2 frameshift site (originally discussed in lines 700-705 but since relocated to lines 761-769) as ribosome run-off due to the similarity in shape. This could also lead to their conclusion that run-off is more pronounced on viral ORFs at later timepoints, as the density in this region is relatively stable at 6 hpi. However, this region in which density increases at late timepoints begins ~4,000 nt downstream of the ORF1ab start codon, a distance 40× greater than the ~100-nt distance over which run-off is observed in host CDSs, making this an unlikely cause for the observed profile. Furthermore, run-off being more pronounced at later timepoints in viral ORFs would be surprising, as it would be inconsistent with the observed patterns in host CDSs, in which there is no clear trend over time (Figure 1—figure supplement 1 [formerly Supplementary Figure 1]).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that caution is required when comparing RPF densities in different regions of an ORF on which ribosome run-off is evident. However, this is only likely to have a significant effect when one of the regions under comparison is close enough to the initiation codon to be noticeably affected by run-off. This is not the case for any of the regions of ORF1ab that we used to calculate frameshift efficiency or putative translation from ORF1b sgRNAs – the shortest distance between the ORF1ab initiation codon and the beginning of any of these regions was 1,551 nt (all region coordinates given in Supplementary file 2 [formerly Supplementary Table 1]; ORF1ab initiation codon begins at genomic coordinate 191). This is well beyond the ~100 nt region over which run-off has a pronounced effect, and therefore we do not expect ribosome run-off to have a significant impact on our conclusions in these sections. For our analysis of putative heteroclite sgRNA translation (Figure 9D), the “heteroclite” region used in our calculations began at the very beginning of ORF1ab, and therefore does include the first ~100 nt and may be affected by ribosome run-off. In contrast, the downstream region (“before FS” in the original manuscript, “gRNA” in the revised submission) is too far downstream of the ORF1ab initiation codon for run-off to have an observable effect. Therefore, for the heteroclite sgRNA translation analysis, run-off could potentially have a small impact on our results (although we expect this to be minor, as the 100 nt run-off region represents only a small proportion of the 1,550-nt “heteroclite” region). However, any effect that this would have would be to artefactually reduce RPF density in the heteroclite region relative to the gRNA region. If this is indeed occurring, it would mean our analysis under-estimates heteroclite sgRNA translation. Taking run-off into consideration therefore strengthens our conclusion that our data support translation of this non-canonical heteroclite sgRNA, as we still see evidence of its translation in spite of this potential bias towards its under-estimation. However, we do not feel it is necessary to modify the manuscript to clarify this somewhat nuanced point, particularly as the reviews will be made publicly available for any specialist readers who are interested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The non-canonical sgRNA would require extremely high translation efficiency to be detected above translation from the gRNA. This is surprising and the authors should provide more explanations to clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we appreciate that the translation of the in-frame regions of ORF1ab is slightly less obvious at first glance, the novel ORFs overlapping ORF1b provide compelling evidence that the ORF1b sgRNAs are indeed translated with high enough efficiency to be observable against the gRNA background. These ORFs (for example nsp12-iORF) are highly translated at late timepoints, reaching levels comparable to that of ORF1b itself, and this is very clear in the Figures (e.g. Figure 6B) as the RPF density is in an overlapping phase. It is extremely unlikely that these ORFs are expressed from the canonical PRRSV transcripts (from which the only potential candidate would be gRNA), as this would mean their 5′ UTRs were at least 8,000 nt long and contained over 100 AUGs. By far the most parsimonious explanation is that these novel ORFs are expressed from the ORF1b sgRNAs, indicating that these transcripts are translated efficiently enough to be observable in our analyses against the background of canonical gRNA translation.</p><p>As for how this is the case – although the gRNA transcript is more abundant than the non-canonical heteroclite/ORF1b sgRNAs, an important factor to consider is that gRNA contains signals (for example packaging and/or replication signals) which likely cause a large proportion of the gRNA transcript pool to be sequestered and unavailable for translation. The translation efficiency (TE) calculations in our study are not able to distinguish these sequestered transcripts from the transcripts available for translation, and gRNA has very low TE relative to the other viral transcripts in our analysis (as seen in Figure 8—figure supplement 3 [formerly Supplementary Figure 15] and mentioned in the text in lines 552-555). This is consistent with observations for coronaviruses in other studies (Finkel et al., 2021; Irigoyen et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2021). The non-canonical transcripts, however, likely do not contain all the same packaging/replication signals as the genomic RNA – for example, there is no evidence that the ORF1b sgRNAs are packaged into virions – so they likely spend a much higher proportion of time available for translation. Although heteroclite sgRNAs do retain at least the essential signals required to facilitate packaging into the virion (Yuan et al., 2004; Yuan, Murtaugh, and Faaberg 2000), it is possible/likely that sequestration and packaging of these heteroclite transcripts occurs at lower efficiency than for the gRNA. Further, the heteroclite sgRNAs and the non-canonical ORF1b sgRNAs may be less frequently subjected to replication than gRNA due to differences in the presence/absence of replication signals. Differences, such as these, in the proportion of the transcript pool that is available for translation likely give rise to higher TE values for these non-canonical transcripts.</p><p>This is a concept we tried to highlight in our original manuscript (lines 399-402); however, we agree with this reviewer that we did not explain this clearly enough. We have moved the explanation of this concept to lines 644-649, so it is grouped together with the main discussion of ORF1b and heteroclite sgRNA translation and appears after we have mentioned the low TE of gRNA. We have also expanded the text to explain some of the above points.</p><p>Further, in line with this reviewer’s comment, and also taking into account suggestions from the other reviewers to streamline the manuscript, we have edited Figure 9D to try and make its meaning clearer. We removed the “after FS” region (instead moving the discussion of density variations in this region to the frameshifting section, where they are more relevant). We renamed the “before FS” region to “gRNA” to simplify its interpretation, and we applied the decumulation procedure to the RiboSeq read density as well as the RNASeq, to make these results more easily comparable, re-calculating the TE using the decumulated density. Hopefully these changes to the Figure make it clear that the heteroclite sgRNAs do indeed have considerably higher TE than the gRNA, an observation which we have now also added to the main text (lines 696-700).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. To test the potential mechanism of changing PRF efficiency, can the authors correlate the PRF efficiency at different time points with the expression of the tRNA isoacceptors (or isodecoders) that are required to read the slippery sequence?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very astute comment and, indeed, such knowledge would potentially be informative about the frameshift process and how the process may be regulated during the viral replication cycle. Unfortunately, the RNASeq method employed is not tailored for tRNAs and whilst the datasets do contain tRNA reads, it is certain that they will have biased representation and we cannot easily determine the range of isoacceptors present. In future work, this might be addressed using tRNA profiling methods (Behrens, Rodschinka and Nedialkova, 2021), but this is beyond the scope of the present work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Whenever conservation data regarding a specific nucleotide is used to claim it is conserved, it will be useful to present background conservation to demonstrate whether the position is conserved more than expected.</p></disp-quote><p>For the uORF initiation codon, it is somewhat difficult to obtain a fair measure of background conservation because this is complicated by the presence of multiple predicted RNA secondary structures in the PRRSV 5′ UTR (Gao et al., 2013), which are expected to be subject to selection pressure. The A and U of the uORF AUG are in the loop of a predicted stem loop, so the effect of selection pressure to maintain the secondary structure is expected to be reduced as there are no base pairs to maintain, and the conservation of these residues may represent selection pressure to maintain the initiation codon. To avoid adding further detail/complexity, we did not include the following analysis in the manuscript, but to address this reviewer’s point more systematically, we compared the conservation of the uORF AU residues to that of other unpaired residues. We made a multiple sequence alignment of the 5′ UTRs of the available NA PRRSV sequences (using MUSCLE with default parameters), after removing sequences with incomplete 5′ UTRs. We used mfold to predict the secondary structure of the SD95-21 5′ UTR, to determine which regions are predicted to be base paired and which are loops/bulges/unpaired regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). We mapped these structural predictions to the positions on the multiple sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and calculated the average Shannon entropy for the bases in each unpaired region. The AU of the uORF AUG had lower entropy, indicating greater sequence conservation, than 14 out of the 17 unpaired regions, showing that it is more conserved than comparable regions of the NA PRRSV 5′ UTR.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Structure and conservation of the NA PRRSV 5′ UTR.

However, the body TRSs are in different frames relative to ORF1b, and are only six nucleotides long, so may not all contain highly degenerate codons. This would make this a rather detailed and complicated analysis to include in the manuscript, given it is already very long. Although we do mention the nucleotide conservation of the ORF1b sgRNA body TRSs (particularly the final two Cs; lines 664-665), the more compelling evidence for the conservation of these transcripts is that body TRSs in similar (or sometimes identical) genomic locations are used in isolates from diverse areas of the phylogeny, including different species (lines 667-684). We do not think that adding an assessment of background nucleotide conservation to the manuscript would be worth the increase in length, given the detail it would require to perform this accurately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f.

In several cases, comparisons between data presented on two separate graphs are performed.

This means that comparisons of the absolute transcript or RiboSeq read density levels between timepoints are not always the most informative or interesting interpretations of the data, as we expect these to increase due to replication. We do show these large-scale changes in plots where all timepoints are displayed together (for example Figure 2D and E, Figure 8); however, the main focus of our analyses is often on observing the trends between transcripts/ORFs within each timepoint and comparing how these trends change over time. For example, in Figure 9C, the key result is that the overall ribosome distribution in ORF1b is approximately uniform at 6 hpi but becomes more skewed towards higher density at the 3′ end at late timepoints. These changes in the shape of the data are more clearly seen when plotting each timepoint on a separate panel, and the 6 hpi results would be difficult to discern if the bars were rearranged to be plotted without separation by timepoint.</p><p>Taking the reviewer’s example of the RNA transcript levels: As mentioned above, we show the different timepoints on the same plot in Figure 8, where the overall trend of increasing read density over time can be seen. In the bar chart in Figure 8—figure supplement 1 (formerly Supplementary Figure 13), we expand on this by including the non-canonical transcripts and separating the results into timepoints. Many of the key points of this analysis (such as showing there is a skew towards gRNA transcription at 6 hpi and then sgRNA transcription at later timepoints, or that the abundance of sgRNAs relative to each other is similar at 9 hpi and 12 hpi), are observations of within-timepoint trends, which are better highlighted when timepoints are separated (see paragraph starting at line 534 for discussion of this Figure). To aid comparisons between timepoints, in Figure 8—figure supplements 1-3 (formerly Supplementary Figures 13-15) the sub-plots are plotted at the same scale if the data is suitable for comparison (noting that, for analyses involving junction-spanning read counts, libraries must have similar RNA insert lengths to be unbiasedly comparable).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h. Multiple sequence alignment in Figure 6E are not very useful, as the color code for amino acids is not assigned; at the minimum, clarify the color code. In Figure 6D, the nucleotide sequence is somewhat sandwiched and is hard to read. The issue is easily solvable by giving it more space on top and the bottom. Sequence logos in Figures6C, F, G and Figure 7 contain text (on axes) that is of unintelligible size. If it cannot be enlarged, it could be simply removed since the logos are easily interpretable without it.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions, we have incorporated all of them into the relevant Figures and increased the space above and below the nucleotide sequence in Figure 10—figure supplement 7 (formerly Supplementary Figure 23) as well as Figure 6D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i.

Which infected time points are analyzed in Figure 11? Showing a time course of the genes of interest may be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 11 shows an analysis of differential gene expression at 12 hpi (lines 893, 898, 921, and 1008). We did not include differential gene expression analyses of other timepoints, but we have included in this response a plot of TXNIP expression over the timecourse covered by our libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), which shows that TXNIP is slightly up-regulated in the infected libraries at 9 hpi, a trend which continues in the KO2 libraries but is sharply curbed in the WT libraries. The translation efficiency of TXNIP in the infected samples starts to decrease at 9 hpi, and continues to decrease in the WT libraries but recovers in the KO2 libraries. These profiles are consistent with a model in which TXNIP expression is inhibited by the WT virus but not the KO2 virus.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>TXNIP expression over a timecourse of NA PRRSV infection.

From the analysis of RNA and TE in Figure 11, it is concluded that translation of transcriptionally upregulated genes does not go up. The footprint data can be used to directly show the change in translation, and even an increase in translation that is lower than expected from the increase in RNA levels can point to translation inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that, even if overall translation levels increased, this could still correspond to translation inhibition if they didn’t increase in line with the increase in transcript levels. However, the main focus of this WT vs mock analysis (paragraphs beginning lines 899 and 1008) is on whether transcription or translation control makes the greater contribution to the host response, a question which is addressed more appropriately by analysing TE as opposed to total RPF counts (which would measure the outcome of these two levels of regulation combined). Although it is possible to use DESeq2 to process solely the RPFs, we feel that the manuscript is already rather long and detailed, and the benefit of adding this extra analysis to confirm a point already evident in the existing analyses would be outweighed by the addition of further length and complexity to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o.

I think References 49,117 and 128 do not support the claim that frameshift efficiency changes with time of infection.</p></disp-quote><p>To summarise the parts of these papers to which we were referring when saying there is previous work which suggests an increase in ORF1ab PRF efficiency during coronavirus infection:</p><p>Reference 49 is Irigoyen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016 (a previous study from our laboratories). We calculated ORF1ab PRF efficiency for murine coronavirus in 17 Cl-1 cells at 5 hpi (MOI 10), giving values of 48% and 70% for the first and second replicates, respectively (Figure 8B, RiboSeq bars). Despite both replicates having been harvested at the same timepoint, other analyses in the paper indicated that the second replicate had advanced further in infection than the first (clearest in Figure 3B), hence our suggestion in the present work that these results support an increase in PRF efficiency over time.</p><p>Reference 117 is Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021. These authors calculated SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab PRF efficiency at 4, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 hpi in Calu-3 cells (MOI 10). They found a great increase in PRF efficiency, from ~20% to ~70%, between 4 and 12 hpi, after which it remained roughly stable (60-80%) until 48 hpi, when it decreased to ~35% (Supplementary Figure 2j).</p><p>Reference 128 is Puray-Chavez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021. Specifically, we reference version 3 of this bioRxiv pre-print (posted on October 7<sup>th</sup>, 2021, and the most recent version at the time of writing). These authors calculated ORF1ab PRF efficiency for SARS-CoV-2 at 6, 12 and 24 hpi in Vero E6 cells at MOI 2 pfu/cell. They found that the average PRF efficiency at 6 hpi was ~45%, whereas it was ~75% at 12 and 24 hpi, however they have considerable variation between their replicates, particularly at 6 hpi (Figure 1F). This may be due to library quality issues in their first replicate (out of three), for example as indicated by the substantial difference in RPF length distribution for host and viral CDSs (Figure S2A), suggesting viral RNP contamination. The variation at 6 hpi means the range of values from this timepoint overlaps those at the later timepoints, so they would not obtain statistical significance for the differences observed (nor do they do claim to in the text of their paper), however, their average efficiency does increase from the early to late timepoints.</p><p>In our submitted manuscript, our intention was to ensure we gave due acknowledgement to previous work in this area. We did not intend to claim that any of these papers stated in their text that there was a temporal increase in frameshift efficiency (as none address this directly), nor to give the impression that any one paper had strong enough evidence to support this conclusion without further investigation. For all three papers, assessment of potential RNP contamination within ORF1b and specific statistical assessment of any observed differences between timepoints (in some cases needing additional replicates) would be required to formally evaluate the hypothesis. To try and soften our statement about previous work supporting temporal modulation of coronavirus ORF1ab PRF, we have edited the text in our manuscript (line 1100), changing “previous results suggest ORF1ab frameshift efficiency may increase over time” to “previous results tentatively suggest ORF1ab frameshift efficiency may increase over time”.</p><p>References</p><p>Behrens, Andrew, Geraldine Rodschinka, and Danny D.
