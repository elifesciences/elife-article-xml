telacebec, also known as Q203, is one of only a few new classes of compounds in more than 50 years with demonstrated antituberculosis activity in humans. Telacebec inhibits the mycobacterial respiratory supercomplex composed of complexes III and IV (CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>). In mycobacterial electron transport chains, CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> replaces canonical CIII and CIV, transferring electrons from the intermediate carrier menaquinol to the final acceptor, molecular oxygen, while simultaneously transferring protons across the inner membrane to power ATP synthesis. We show that telacebec inhibits the menaquinol:oxygen oxidoreductase activity of purified <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> at concentrations similar to those needed to inhibit electron transfer in mycobacterial membranes and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> growth in culture. We then used electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to determine structures of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> both in the presence and absence of telacebec. The structures suggest that telacebec prevents menaquinol oxidation by blocking two different menaquinol binding modes to prevent CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic></kwd><kwd>telacebec (Q203)</kwd><kwd>cryoEM</kwd><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT162186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubinstein</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wallenberg Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019.0043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brzezinski</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-04619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brzezinski</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PGS-M</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yanofsy</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PDF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Di Trani</surname><given-names>Justin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubinstein</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000196</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubinstein</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012171</institution-id><institution>Ontario Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubinstein</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003579</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yanofsy</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of the <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> respiratory supercomplex with telacebec (Q203) bound shows how this tuberculosis drug candidate blocks respiration in mycobacteria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Numerous bacteria from the strictly aerobic genus <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> are human pathogens. In particular, infection by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and closely related species results in the disease tuberculosis (TB). In most years, TB is the leading cause of death by infectious disease internationally, with an increasing incidence of drug-resistant infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Global Tuberculosis Report, 2020</xref>). Nontuberculosis mycobacterial pathogens include <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>, which causes leprosy, <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic>, which causes Buruli ulcer, and <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic>, which infect immunocompromised and cystic fibrosis patients, respectively. The discovery of bedaquiline from a phenotypic screen with non-pathogenic <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>, and its subsequent development into an effective therapeutic, has revolutionized the treatment of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Global Tuberculosis Report, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">World Health Organization, 2019</xref>). Bedaquiline binds the membrane region of mycobacterial ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andries et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preiss et al., 2015</xref>), blocking proton translocation and ATP synthesis. Thus, in addition to providing an invaluable therapeutic tool, bedaquiline established oxidative phosphorylation as a target space for antibiotics against mycobacteria. Subsequent to the discovery of bedaquiline, numerous compounds have been identified that target either ATP synthase or the electron transport chain complexes that establish the transmembrane proton motive force (PMF) that drives ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cook et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian mitochondrial electron transport chains, complexes I and II oxidize NADH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and succinate, respectively. The electrons from these substrates are used to reduce a membrane-bound pool of ubiquinone (UQ) to ubiquinol (UQH<sub>2</sub>). Electrons from UQH<sub>2</sub> are then passed successively to CIII (also known as cytochrome [cyt.] <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>), soluble cyt. <italic>c</italic>, and CIV (also known as cyt. <italic>c</italic> oxidase or cyt. <italic>aa</italic><sub>3</sub>) before ultimately reducing molecular oxygen to water. Complexes I, III, and IV couple electron transfer to proton transfer across the membrane, thereby generating the PMF that drives ATP synthesis. In contrast to mitochondria and many bacteria, mycobacteria possess a branched electron transport chain (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cook et al., 2017</xref>). Rather than UQ, mycobacterial respiration relies on menaquinone (MQ) as an intermediate electron carrier. MQH<sub>2</sub> can reduce molecular oxygen via two MQH<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> oxidoreductases: cyt. <italic>bd</italic> and cyt. <italic>bcc-aa</italic><sub>3</sub>, the latter being equivalent to a combination of canonical CIII and CIV with the stoichiometry CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>. The CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> supercomplex and cyt. <italic>bd</italic> branches of the mycobacterial electron transport chain are bioenergetically not equivalent, while CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> transfers three protons across the membrane for each electron used to reduce O<sub>2</sub>, cyt. <italic>bd</italic> transfers the equivalent of only one proton across the membrane for each electron. Enzyme utilization in mycobacterial electron transport chains can adapt to changes in environmental conditions and treatment with respiratory complex inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berney and Cook, 2010</xref>), which complicates targeting of respiration by antimycobacterial drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beites et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Structural analysis of the CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> supercomplex from <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> led to the discovery that a dimeric type C superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an integral component of the assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wiseman et al., 2018</xref>). The SOD dimer is found on the periplasmic side of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> and is held in place by its two N-terminal tails, which bind to the complex’s QcrA subunits. Both QcrA and the SOD subunits are highly conserved between <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, with 81.4% and 71.0% sequence similarity and 73.2% and 64.8% sequence identity, respectively, suggesting that a similar association occurs in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> enzyme. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> mutants that lack SOD are susceptible to killing within macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piddington et al., 2001</xref>), emphasizing the importance of the subunit. Given its position within CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>, it is possible that the SOD subunit abstracts electrons from reactive oxygen species formed during respiration or generated by host-defense mechanisms in the phagolysosome upon phagocytosis of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and directs them through the respiratory chain to contribute to the PMF and ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wiseman et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although killing of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> with electron transport chain inhibitors may require simultaneously blocking both the CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> and cyt. <italic>bd</italic> branches for oxygen reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beites et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsoso et al., 2005</xref>), high-profile candidate TB therapeutics have been identified that bind to CIII within CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pethe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rybniker et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, while CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> is not essential in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, its disruption causes severe growth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsoso et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> is essential in <italic>M. leprae</italic> and <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, which lack the cyt. <italic>bd</italic> branch of the electron transport chain entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demangel et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Rather than pumping protons, CIII contributes to the PMF by separating positive and negative charges across the membrane through a mechanism known as the Q cycle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarewicz and Osyczka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xia et al., 2013</xref>). Each CIII contains two sites where redox reactions with MQ occur: a Q<sub>P</sub> site near the positive (periplasmic) side of the membrane where MQH<sub>2</sub> is oxidized and a Q<sub>N</sub> site near the negative (cytoplasmic) side of the membrane where MQ is reduced. In the current understanding of the Q cycle in mycobacteria, oxidation of MQH<sub>2</sub> in the Q<sub>P</sub> site leads to release of two protons to the positive side of the membrane. The first electron from this oxidation reaction is passed to a [2Fe–2S] Rieske center (FeS) in subunit QcrA where it consecutively reduces the cyt. <italic>cc</italic> domain of the QcrC subunit and the Cu<sub>A</sub> di-nuclear center of CIV. The second electron from the MQH<sub>2</sub> in the Q<sub>P</sub> site is transferred first to heme <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> and then heme <italic>b</italic><sub>H</sub>, both in subunit QcrB of CIII, before reducing a MQ molecule in the Q<sub>N</sub> site to MQ<sup>•-</sup>. Oxidation of a second MQH<sub>2</sub> in the Q<sub>P</sub> site and repetition of this series of events lead to reduction of MQ<sup>•-</sup> to MQH<sub>2</sub> in the Q<sub>N</sub> site, upon abstraction of two protons from the negative side of the membrane, thereby contributing to the PMF and the pool of reduced MQH<sub>2</sub> in the membrane. Within CIV, electrons are transferred from the Cu<sub>A</sub> di-nuclear center to O<sub>2</sub> bound at the heme <italic>a</italic><sub>3</sub>-Cu<sub>B</sub> binuclear catalytic site via heme <italic>a</italic>, driving proton pumping across the membrane.</p><p>Telacebec (also known as Q203) was identified in a screen of macrophages infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pethe et al., 2013</xref>). Generation of resistance mutants bearing T313I and T313A mutations in the <italic>qcrB</italic> gene indicated that telacebec targets CIII of the CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> supercomplex. A recent Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated a decrease in viable mycobacterial sputum load with increasing dose of telacebec, supporting further development and making telacebec one of only a few new drug classes in more than 50 years with demonstrated antituberculosis activity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Jager et al., 2020</xref>). Telacebec may also have clinical utility in treating nontuberculosis mycobacterial infections, such as Buruli ulcer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Der Werf et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to investigate how telacebec inhibits purified CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> from <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. We develop conditions for CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> activity assays that limit the spontaneous autoxidation of MQH<sub>2</sub> analogues, which has hampered previous analysis of MQH<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> oxidoreductase activity with purified CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>. The assays show that telacebec inhibits CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> activity at concentrations comparable to those that inhibit electron transfer in mycobacterial membranes. CryoEM of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> demonstrates both the presence of the LpqE subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2018</xref>) and different conformations of the cyt. <italic>cc</italic> domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wiseman et al., 2018</xref>), which have previously been observed separately but not together. Three-dimensional variability analysis (3DVA) of the structure shows that the SOD subunit can move toward cyt. <italic>cc</italic>, supporting the possibility of direct electron transfer from superoxide to CIV. CryoEM of the CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>:telacebec complex allows localization of the telacebec binding site with the imidazopyridine moiety and A-benzene ring of telacebec forming most protein-inhibitor contacts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> reveals movement of SOD subunit and cyt. <italic>cc</italic> domain</title><p>In order to facilitate isolation of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>, we used the ORBIT (oligonucleotide-mediated recombineering followed by Bxb1 integrase targeting) strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>) to introduce sequence for a 3×FLAG affinity tag into the chromosomal DNA of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> immediately 3′ to the <italic>qcrB</italic> gene.

The mycobacterial electron transport chain uses MQH<sub>2</sub> as the electron donor for CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> while in canonical mitochondrial electron transport chains UQH<sub>2</sub> donates electrons to CIII<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cook et al., 2017</xref>).

MQH<sub>2</sub> analogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>) capable of reducing CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> suffer from autoxidation at neutral or basic pH, which leads to oxygen reduction even in the absence of enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munday, 2000</xref>). This background oxygen-reduction rate is typically subtracted from oxygen reduction observed in the presence of enzyme to calculate the enzyme-catalyzed oxidoreductase activity. Previous measurement of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> activity employed 2-methyl-[1,4]naphthohydroquinone (menadiol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2018</xref>) or 2,3-dimethyl-[1,4]naphthohydroquinone (DMWH<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wiseman et al., 2018</xref>) as the electron donor. Although both substrates are susceptible to autoxidation, the rate of autoxidation was proposed to be ~30% slower for DMWH<sub>2</sub> compared to menadiol at the pH 7.5 of our oxygen consumption assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munday, 2000</xref>). In contrast to these earlier studies, we found that menaquinol autoxidized more slowly than DMWH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, we also found that mendiol was substantially less efficient than DMWH<sub>2</sub> as an electron donor for CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>, likely due to its less favorable redox potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fieser and Fieser, 1934</xref>), supporting the choice of DMWH<sub>2</sub> as the substrate in assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Initial activity assays led to anomalous results where addition of low concentrations of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> to the assay mixture appeared to decrease the rate of oxygen reduction below the background autoxidation rate. On subsequent investigation, we realized that at low concentrations of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> the SOD subunit suppresses autoxidation of DMWH<sub>2</sub> more than CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> catalyzes oxidation of DMWH<sub>2</sub>. This suppression of quinol autoxidation by SOD, which has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadenas et al., 1988</xref>), can lead to apparent negative activities for CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> when the background autoxidation is subtracted. Autoxidation of quinols is believed to involve a superoxide anion intermediate, with the SOD-catalyzed dismutation of the intermediate to hydrogen peroxide removing this reactant to slow the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munday, 2000</xref>). To remove error introduced by the effect of the SOD subunit on the observed oxygen reduction signal, we established that bovine C-type SOD can similarly limit the autoxidation of DMWH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>blue</italic> and <italic>orange</italic> curves), as well as menadiol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, by adding an excess of exogenous bovine SOD to assays, the CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>’s DMWH<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> oxidoreductase activity can be measured with suppression of DMWH<sub>2</sub> autoxidation (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>green</italic>).

This distance contrasts the deeper binding position adopted by UQ in ovine CIII<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Letts et al., 2019</xref>).

CryoEM of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> in the presence of DMWH<sub>2</sub> but without telacebec confirmed that under these conditions the density in the Q<sub>P</sub> site was indistinguishable from MQ seen with the enzyme at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). We then incubated CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> with both DMWH<sub>2</sub> and telacebec to produce an inhibited complex and determined the structure of this complex to a nominal resolution of 3.0 Å by cryoEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The inhibitor’s imidazopyridine moiety, amide linker region, and A-phenyl and B-piperidinyl moieties are all resolved clearly, with weaker density toward the end of the tail, which points into the lipid bilayer toward the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>pale blue surface</italic>). These densities show that telacebec binds with its head group deep within the Q<sub>P</sub> binding pocket in a pose similar to UQ and the UQ-analogue inhibitors bound within the canonical CIII<sub>2</sub> as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Telacebec’s imidazopyridine moiety forms multiple interactions with the protein to stabilize inhibitor binding. Although hydrogen bonds cannot be detected with complete confidence at the present resolution, the position of the N1 nitrogen in telacebec’s imidazopyridine moiety is consistent with formation of a hydrogen bond with the His368 from the QcrA subunit, which also binds the FeS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <italic>dashed teal line</italic>). The occurrence of a similar hydrogen bond between UQ and the equivalent histidine residue in canonical CIII<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>) has been proposed to coordinate the Q cycle (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarewicz and Osyczka, 2015</xref>). The 2-ethyl group from the imidazopyridine is ~4 Å away from Ile178 from the QcrB subunit, providing hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <italic>dashed green line</italic>), while the 6-chloro group from the imidazopyridine is close to the backbone carboxyl group of Leu166 from the QcrB subunit, enabling formation of a possible halogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <italic>dashed purple line</italic>).</p><p>In addition to its imidazopyridine moiety, the amide linker and tail of telacebec also contact subunit QcrB, stabilizing binding.

However, the structural analysis reported here provides constraints and minimal requirements for activity of imidazopyridines and isosteric heterocycles with improved pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties. Optimized physicochemical properties are important for drug production, including synthesis and purification. Improved pharmacokinetic properties could be enabled by design of analogues that retain target activity but are not recognized by mycobacterial efflux pumps, which are known to remove telacebec from bacterial cells to attenuate its antimycobacterial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The structure also suggests how mutations can provide resistance to telacebec and why telacebec selectively inhibits mycobacterial CIII<sub>2</sub>. The mutation T313A in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (T308A in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>) confers resistance to telacebec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pethe et al., 2013</xref>), likely by removing the stabilizing hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group from the linker region of the inhibitor proposed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> grown in the presence of the telacebec analogue TB47 developed the mutation H190Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2019</xref>), which is adjacent to the cd1 helix and may alter the shape of the Q<sub>P</sub> binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The selectivity of telacebec for mycobacterial CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> may derive, in part, from the lack of Thr308 in mammalian mitochondrial CIII<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, there may be clashes between the rigid telacebec tail and both Leu150 and Ile146 in mammalian CIII<sub>2</sub> (bovine numbering) due to the different location of the cd1 helix and the bulkier side chains in this region of the mammalian protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the mutation I147F (<italic>M. smegmatis</italic> numbering) results in resistance to the inhibitor stigmatellin in the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> CIII<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">di Rago et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>The telacebec-bound structure also provides insight into the basic mechanism of MQH<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> oxidoreductase activity by CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>. Multiple MQ binding sites were modeled in an earlier 3.5 Å resolution cryoEM density map of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>, but the significance of these sites was not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2018</xref>). The structure presented here shows that telacebec, which can inhibit MQH<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> oxidoreductase activity completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), binds only at the Q<sub>P</sub> site. Therefore, it is unlikely that MQ binding other than within the Q<sub>P</sub> site is involved in electron transfer to oxygen. During the Q cycle, two molecules of MQH<sub>2</sub> are oxidized to MQ at the Q<sub>P</sub> site for each molecule of MQ reduced to MQH<sub>2</sub> at the Q<sub>N</sub> site. It is possible that MQ is channeled between the Q<sub>P</sub> and Q<sub>N</sub> sites by staying loosely bound to the supercomplex surface, with the additional MQ sites serving as intermediate positions along the channeling pathway. A similar model was suggested for the spinach <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> complex, which is structurally and functionally related to CIII and carries out a Q cycle in plant chloroplasts with the hydrophobic electron carrier plastiquinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malone et al., 2019</xref>). It is also possible that these alternative MQ sites sequester MQ, increasing the local concentration of substrate near its two binding sites, which has been seen to increase the local concentration of ligands in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vauquelin and Charlton, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Within the Q<sub>P</sub> site different positions for both UQ and MQ have been described previously, both for canonical CIII and for CIII within a CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> supercomplex, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moe et al., 2021</xref>). Although the endogenous MQ found in the structure is most likely oxidized, the position it occupies is along the access path to the FeS center. We speculate that reduced MQH<sub>2</sub> also adopts the same position, at least transiently, during turnover. This binding site within Q<sub>P</sub> is denoted the Q1b position. As discussed above, the Q1b position is too far for rapid transfer of protons and electrons from MQH<sub>2</sub> to His368 and the FeS center, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, movement of MQH<sub>2</sub> deeper within the Q<sub>P</sub> site to a Q1a position would bring it less than 10 Å from FeS, close enough to donate electrons to the redox center and protons to His368 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The oxidized MQ could then return to the Q1b position, as observed in the present structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), before it is exchanged for MQH<sub>2</sub> from the membrane. In an emerging model for CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> function, the Q1b position serves as a ‘stand-by’ site for MQH<sub>2</sub>, with oxidation of the substrate occurring only upon relocation to Q1a (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mulkidjanian, 2005</xref>). The structure of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> with telacebec bound shows that the compound serves as dual site inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), with the imidazopyridine group bound to the Q1a position and A-phenyl portion of the tail bound to the Q1b position. Indeed, the possible hydrogen bond between Thr308 and the carboxyl group in the linker region of telacebec could also occur between Thr308 and MQ, stabilizing it in the Q1b position. Therefore, the observed pose of the inhibitor within the enzyme not only blocks MQ access to the FeS center but fills the Q<sub>P</sub> site entirely.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Model for oxidation of MQH<sub>2</sub> in the Q<sub>P</sub> site and how telacebec blocks it.</title><p>An emerging model for MQH<sub>2</sub> reduction at the Q<sub>P</sub> site proposes that the substrate binds in the Q1b position where it is too far from FeS to donate protons and electrons (<bold>A</bold>).

The resulting structure was refined to remove clashes and optimize geometry with the OPLS3e force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roos et al., 2019</xref>). These changes did not noticeably affect the fit of the model within the experimental cryoEM density map.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional

The work provides a new molecular blue print for improving and developing more inhibitors of this essential respiratory complex in the fight against the global pandemic of drug resistant tuberculosis disease.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structure of mycobacterial CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> respiratory supercomplex bound to the tuberculosis drug candidate telacebec (Q203)&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: James A Letts (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please correct geometry violations in the some of your lipids – see Reviewer 1 for details.</p><p>2) Ensure activity assays are performed with biological replicates (separate protein preparation etc). – see Reviewer 2 for details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The discussion of the new activity assay conditions could be strengthened by a Figure supplement comparing the structures of menaquinone, menadiol and 2,3-dimethyl-[1,4]naphthpquinone. The relative importance of the switch from menadiol to 2,3-dimethyl-[1,4]naphthpquinone vs. the addition of SOD to the reaction conditions is unclear. Does the addition of SOD to the menadiol assay result in a similar reduction of autoxidation? If known, the proposed mechanism by which SOD slows autoxidation should also be briefly mentioned as this activity is key to the improved assay and interpretation of the results.</p><p>Videos from the 3D variability analysis showing the movement of the SOD subunit and loss of the LpqE subunit would aid this section.</p><p>Page 6, paragraph 2 the authors state &quot;The increased IC50 in the current assay compared to assays with inverted membrane vesicles or bacterial growth in liquid culture may be due to the binding affinity or high concentration of DMW, which could allow DMW to compete with telacebec for binding to the complex.&quot; Are the authors able to use their assay to determine the KM for DMW? Have they attempted IC50 measurements at different DMW concentrations? Is the mode of telacebec inhibition well characterized? How would the differences between detergent and membrane environments impact the measured IC50?</p><p>On page 6, paragraph 4, sentence 1, the authors reference &quot;strong density for the endogenous MQ&quot;, the term &quot;strong density&quot; is ambiguous and should be quantified. If the map is normalized, at what σ value is the density clearly visible? How does this σ value compare to those of other map features, such as heavy metals, core side chains, other lipids or the detergent micelle? When looking at the map it is difficult to trace many of the modeled lipid and isoprenoid tails in the density. Also the orientation of the menaquinone head group in the QP site appears ambiguous, the isoprenoid tail could be as modeled or could go towards Met189 with the menaquinone head flipped 180 degrees. Why did the authors choose the current orientation? Given the symmetry of the menaquinone head are both binding orientations possibly present and averaged out in the structure? Would this help explain the ambiguity in the density for the isoprenoid chain?</p><p>There are many geometry violations in the isoprenoid chains of the modeled menaquinones (see chain F MQ9 607 C34 for an extreme example), the authors should double check their ligand restraints file. Overall the density for chain F MQ9 607 is unconvincing that it belongs to a menaquinone. The density for the isoprenoid tail for chain F MQ9 609 is very weak and difficult to follow why it was traced in the way it was (regions of it are not in density, whereas significant density in the same vicinity remains unmodeled). This issue is also seen in other regions of the map/model, i.e. there are several clear densities for lipids that are not modeled and modeled acyl chains that are not in clear density. The authors should carefully reevaluate their lipid and menaquinone modeling before publication.</p><p>The authors first mention His368 on page 6 but do not discuss its significance until pages 7 and 8.

The reviewer’s comment prompted us to compare menaquinol and DMWH<sub>2</sub> experimentally and investigate the effect of SOD on autoxidation of menaquinol. We found that in our conditions, menaquinol autoxidizes more slowly than DMWH<sub>2</sub> and the autoxidation can be limited by SOD, but even more importantly we confirmed in multiple experiments that menaquinol is not as effective as an electron donor for CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> as DMWH<sub>2</sub>. We have updated the relevant text (p. 5, 3<sup>rd</sup> paragraph):</p><p>“The midpoint potentials of the redox centers in mycobacterial CIII<sub>2</sub> are lower than those of canonical mitochondrial CIII<sub>2</sub> (Kao et al., 2016), and as a result UQH<sub>2</sub> analogues typically used in CIII<sub>2</sub> assays are not able to reduce CIII<sub>2</sub> of the <italic>M.</italic> <italic>smegmatis</italic> supercomplex. MQH<sub>2</sub> analogues (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1A-C) capable of reducing CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> suffer from autoxidation at neutral or basic pH, which leads to oxygen reduction even in the absence of enzyme (Munday, 2000). This background oxygen-reduction rate is typically subtracted from oxygen reduction observed in the presence of enzyme to calculate the enzyme-catalyzed oxidoreductase activity. Previous measurement of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> activity employed 2-methyl-[1,4]naphthohydroquinone (menadiol) (Gong et al., 2018) or 2,3-dimethyl-[1,4]naphthohydroquinone (DMWH<sub>2</sub>) (Graf et al., 2016; Wiseman et al., 2018) as the electron donor. Although both substrates are susceptible to autoxidation, the rate of autoxidation was proposed to be ~30% slower for DMWH<sub>2</sub> compared to menadiol at the pH 7.5 of our oxygen consumption assays (Munday, 2000). In contrast to these earlier studies, we found that menaquinol autoxidized more slowly than DMWH<sub>2</sub> (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1D). However, we also found that mendiol was substantially less efficient than DMWH<sub>2</sub> as an electron donor for CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>, likely due its less favorable redox potential (Fieser and Fieser, 1934), supporting the choice of DMWH<sub>2</sub> as the substrate in assays (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1D).”</p><p>We have added a panel to Figure 2 – Supplement 1 that compares the behaviour of menadiol and DMWH<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>As seen in Figure 2 – Supplement 1, SOD does limit autoxidation of menaquinol (but does not solve the problem of menaquinol being a poor electron donor to CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>).

Have they attempted IC50 measurements at different DMW concentrations? Is the mode of telacebec inhibition well characterized? How would the differences between detergent and membrane environments impact the measured IC50?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we are not able to reliably measure the KM for DMW due to technical limitations with the oxygen consumption assay. First, the assays are extremely low throughput, with each measurement done separately and requiring extensive measurement time and a large quantity of purified protein. Further, measuring the activity at lower DMW concentrations is both technically and practically prohibitivly challenging. Even though the autoxidation rate is decreased in the presence of SOD, it is not eliminated completely (see Figure 2A and Figure 2 —figure supplement 1). Lowering the DMW concentrations decreases the measured CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> activity such that it approaches the autoxidation rate, which introduces large errors into the determination of the activity. Furthermore, because each activity measurement requires monitoring the O<sub>2</sub>-reduction rate for tens of seconds, the simultaneous formation of oxidized DMW by autoxidation results in accumulation of oxidized DMW that, at low DMW concentrations, yields non-linear O<sub>2</sub>-oxidation kinetics and prevents reliable determination of the slope of the O<sub>2</sub> concentration curve. While we agree that a highly detailed analysis of telacebec inhibition of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> at varying conditions would be desirable, we consider measuring a reliable IC<sub>50</sub> at even one condition an important advance.</p><p>The reviewer raises a good point that differences in IC<sub>50</sub> can also be due to measuring activity in detergent micelles rather than lipid bilayers.

However, even with this strong density, the symmetry of the head group (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1) makes it difficult to determine which of two poses, related by a 180º rotation, is correct. This ambiguity is exacerbated by weak density for the MQ tail, which is visible at 2.6σ, closer to the 1.7σ threshold used for visualizing lipids in the map. Figure 3B depicts the MQ pose that appears to match the density slightly better than the rotated pose, and is also the same pose as modelled previously (Gong et al., 2018). It is also possible that MQ could bind the structure in either pose, with the experimental map showing the average of both orientations.”</p><p>This paragraph makes clear that there is still some ambiguity in the pose of the endogeneous MQ.

We agree that the co-purified endogenous menaquinone is most likely oxidized. Hence, the cryoEM structure almost certainly shows the position of the oxidized menaquinone. The Q1b position is along the only entry/exit path to/from the Q1a position where menaquinol oxidation can take place. Therefore, we speculate that during turnover, when the menaquinone pool is mostly reduced, MQH<sub>2</sub> would have to access the Q1b position, at least transiently, because this position is found along the MQH<sub>2</sub> transfer trajectory. We have updated the text and figure to show the model where reduced MQH­<sub>2</sub> accesses the Q1b position, moves to the Q1a position to transfer its electron to the FeS group, and then returns to the Q1b position (p. 9, 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph):</p><p>“Although the endogenous MQ found in the structure is most likely oxidized, the position it occupies is along the access path to the FeS center. We speculate that reduced MQH<sub>2</sub> also adopts the same position, at least transiently, during turnover. This binding site within Q<sub>P</sub> is known asthe Q1b position. As discussed above, the Q1b position is too far for rapid transfer of protons and electrons from MQH<sub>2</sub> to His368 and the FeS center, respectively (Figure 4A). In contrast, movement of MQH<sub>2</sub> deeper within the Q<sub>P</sub> site to the Q1a position would bring it less than 10 Å from FeS, close enough to donate electrons to the redox center and protons to His368 (Figure 4B). The oxidized MQ could then return to the Q1b position, as observed in the present structure (Figure 4C), before it is exchanged for MQH<sub>2</sub> from the membrane. In an emerging model for CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> function, the Q1b position serves as a &quot;stand-by&quot; site for MQH<sub>2</sub>, with oxidation of the substrate occurring only upon relocation to Q1a (see (Moe et al., 2021; Mulkidjanian, 2005)). The structure of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> with telacebec bound shows that the compound serves as dual site inhibitor (Figure 4D), with the imidazopyridine group bound to the Q1a position and A-phenyl portion of the tail bound to the Q1b position. Indeed, the possible hydrogen bond between Thr308 and the carboxyl group in the linker region of telacebec could also occur between Thr308 and MQ, stabilizing it in the Q1b position. Therefore, the observed pose of the inhibitor within the enzyme not only blocks MQ access to the FeS center but fills the Q<sub>P</sub> site entirely.”</p><p>We have updated Figure 4 to show both the reduced and oxidized forms of MQ accessing the Q1b position.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My only recommendation is using multiple biological replicates (at least two, better three) for the activity assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not making clear that the measurement were indeed from multiple samples of purified proteins.
