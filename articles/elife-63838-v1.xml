to develop but this only applies to defense mechanisms that function to eliminate parasites (resistance). In contrast, immunity to severe disease can be acquired quickly and without the need for improved pathogen control (tolerance). Using <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic>, we show that a single malaria episode is sufficient to induce host adaptations that can minimise inflammation, prevent tissue damage and avert endothelium activation, a hallmark of severe disease. Importantly, monocytes are functionally reprogrammed to prevent their differentiation into inflammatory macrophages and instead promote mechanisms of stress tolerance to protect their niche. This alternative fate is not underpinned by epigenetic reprogramming of bone marrow progenitors but appears to be imprinted within the remodelled spleen. Crucially, all of these adaptations operate independently of pathogen load and limit the damage caused by malaria parasites in subsequent infections. Acquired immunity to malaria therefore prioritises host fitness over pathogen clearance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria is a parasitic infection spread by mosquitoes that causes hundreds of millions of cases each year. People are most likely to die from malaria the first time they are infected – usually when they are young children. Among those who survive, however, few will develop severe symptoms again, even though they are often reinfected with as many (or even more) parasites. This indicates that people do not get better at eliminating the parasite. Instead, protection from severe malaria is a form of tolerance - the body learns to limit the damage the infection causes. But exactly which mechanisms have to be engaged to tolerate malaria is unclear.</p><p>One way to achieve tolerance may be to switch off damaging inflammation. Nahrendorf et al. explored this possibility by comparing the immune response of mice to their first and second infection with malaria parasites. During the first infection of life, immune cells release harmful inflammatory molecules that activate the lining of blood vessels, causing tissue damage and severe symptoms. During the second infection, these immune cells shut down inflammation and instead actively promote tissue health to reduce damage and improve outcome. This change in the immune response occurs despite the fact that the number of parasites is the same in both infections.</p><p>Nahrendorf et al. also found that the mouse’s immune cells ’remembered’ to tolerate subsequent infections, even after treatment with a drug that kills all malaria parasites. This was possible because malaria permanently altered the spleen, which reprogrammed the response of the immune cells. A single infection is therefore enough to induce long-lived mechanisms of tolerance that can prevent life-threatening disease.</p><p>These findings have the potential to change the understanding of immunity to malaria, which currently emphasises the importance of killing parasites. New ways to treat and vaccinate people - and to protect young children from severe malaria - may arise by treating tolerance as an equally important form of host defense.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>disease tolerance</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>monocytes</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>innate memory</kwd><kwd>tissue niche</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship (107668/Z/15/Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Philip J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship (107668/Z/15/Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Philip J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>University of Edinburgh Institutional Strategic Support Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Philip J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Malaria remodels the spleen to imprint tolerance and reduce pathology in subsequent infections.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanisms of host resistance can eliminate pathogens, but it is disease tolerance that functions to preserve life. Tolerance mechanisms of host defense do not have a direct impact on pathogen load and instead act to minimise tissue damage caused by the pathogen and the immune response targeting it. They also function to protect vital homeostatic processes, such as energy metabolism, under conditions of infection-induced stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martins et al., 2019</xref>). We have taken tremendous steps to understand acquired resistance mechanisms that can eliminate pathogens and provide sterile immunity. On the other hand, it is unclear whether mechanisms of disease tolerance can persist after pathogen clearance to provide an alternative strategy of acquired immunity. And it is these mechanisms that are likely to be at the forefront of host defense when sterile immunity cannot be generated.</p><p>We propose that immunity to severe life-threatening malaria is underpinned by acquired mechanisms of disease tolerance. The majority of malaria-induced deaths occur in children under the age of 5 infected with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weiss et al., 2019</xref>). A landmark prospective study in Tanzania followed 882 children from birth and showed that the risk of developing severe malaria is highest in the first few infections of life, and very few children (&lt;1.8%) have more than one severe episode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gonçalves et al., 2014</xref>). These data therefore support the longstanding view that immunity against severe malaria is acquired rapidly – often before 12 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gupta et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marsh and Snow, 1999</xref>). Crucially, this study further showed that children who survive severe malaria are frequently reinfected and experience episodes of febrile malaria with similar or even higher parasite densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gonçalves et al., 2014</xref>). Immunity to severe forms of malaria is therefore not due to improved parasite elimination (resistance) but instead underpinned by the improved ability of the host to limit the pathological consequences of infection (tolerance).</p><p>There is a growing body of evidence that shows mechanisms of disease tolerance are required to survive a first malaria episode: for example, acute infection causes hypoglycaemia and so the ability to maintain blood glucose levels within dynamic range – in crosstalk with iron metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weis et al., 2017</xref>) – can determine life or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cumnock et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the induction of heme oxygenase-1 by nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jeney et al., 2014</xref>) leads to the detoxification of free heme, which is released from ruptured red cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Seixas et al., 2009</xref>) – this protects renal proximal tubule epithelial cells and prevents acute kidney injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ramos et al., 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, whilst these metabolic adaptations are doubtless essential for the survival of naive hosts there is no evidence as yet that they can be recalled and applied more effectively in subsequent infections to provide clinical immunity.</p><p>Instead, the most effective way to induce persisting mechanisms of disease tolerance may be through host control of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Medzhitov et al., 2012</xref>), which can limit collateral tissue damage and avert fatal metabolic perturbations. In malaria, the ability to control systemic inflammation may also minimise the detrimental effects of parasite sequestration by reducing activation of the endothelium and restricting available binding sites in the microvasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schofield and Grau, 2005</xref>). Field data support the idea that dampening the inflammatory response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> affords protection; lower levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines are found in children in Malawi who survive severe malaria compared to those who succumb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mandala et al., 2017</xref>). And critically, inflammation can be reduced in the absence of improved parasite control; Ghanaian children in a high transmission area have higher parasite densities but less systemic inflammation and fewer febrile episodes than children in a lower transmission setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ademolue et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The blood cycle in malaria unleashes a plethora of parasite-derived as well as host tissue damage-associated signals, all of which can be sensed by innate immune cells. Additionally, pronounced changes in host physiology (such as hypoxia and acidaemia) are hallmarks of severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">von Seidlein et al., 2012</xref>). Together these diverse signals trigger monocytes and macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory molecules, many of which have been associated with a poor prognosis including the prototypical myeloid-derived cytokines TNF and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mandala et al., 2017</xref>). Macrophages can even directly cause severe anaemia through extensive bystander phagocytosis of healthy uninfected red cells in the spleen and impairment of erythropoiesis in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jakeman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pathak and Ghosh, 2016</xref>). Given these key roles in pathogenesis, it may be possible to quickly reduce the risk of severe malaria by modifying the myeloid response to blood-stage infection. Importantly, an emerging body of literature shows that the response of myeloid cells is not hardwired but can be reprogrammed by pathogens and their products. This was first demonstrated by stimulating bone marrow-derived macrophages with LPS in vitro, which reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases the release of antimicrobial effector molecules upon re-stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foster et al., 2007</xref>). The ability of monocytes and macrophages to adapt their response to repeated pathogen encounters through cell intrinsic modifications is termed innate memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Netea et al., 2016</xref>). And although myeloid cells are usually short-lived and terminally differentiated, memory can nevertheless be imprinted through the epigenetic reprogramming of either long-lived tissue-resident macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wendeln et al., 2018</xref>) or progenitor cells in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Innate memory has been shown to operate independently of pathogen load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dominguez-Andres and Netea, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Seeley and Ghosh, 2017</xref>) and human monocytes produce less pro-inflammatory cytokines when stimulated after an episode of febrile malaria as compared to before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Portugal et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that they are intrinsically modified by infection. We therefore hypothesised that innate memory – leading to the functional specialisation of monocytes and macrophages to limit inflammation and associated pathology – offers the most compelling explanation for how immunity to severe malaria can be acquired so quickly and without the need for enhanced parasite control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate acquired mechanisms of disease tolerance and the role of innate memory in vivo, we needed to examine monocyte progenitors in the bone marrow and long-lived tissue-resident macrophages in the spleen. And since these tissues are not readily accessible in human malaria, we needed a model that would recapitulate at least some key features of human infection. Given that a meta-analysis of malariotherapy data shows naive hosts quickly adapt to tolerate chronic parasitaemia (for example, by increasing their pyrogenic threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gatton and Cheng, 2002</xref>]), we chose a rodent malaria parasite (<italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic>) that establishes chronic recrudescing infections in laboratory mice. Importantly, experimental infections were initiated with sporozoites, since we have previously shown that mosquito transmission resets expression of the large sub-telomeric multi-gene families that control parasite virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spence et al., 2013</xref>). And furthermore, we used two parasite genotypes to try and uncouple the relative contribution of parasite-derived versus damage-associated signals in promoting mechanisms of tolerance. <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS causes a mild infection, characterised by a low pathogen load and few clinical symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AJ (which has more than 140,000 SNPs cf. <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Otto et al., 2014</xref>]) leads to acute hyperparasitaemia and severe anaemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>), accompanied by hypothermia and prostration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). AJ shares many key features with AS such as synchrony, chronicity and a persisting low-grade anaemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), and yet whilst AS sequesters in key immune sites such as bone marrow and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brugat et al., 2014</xref>) we find no evidence that AJ sequesters in host tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Malaria triggers emergency myelopoiesis and obliterates tissue-resident macrophages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) C57Bl/6 mice were infected with <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> AJ or AS sporozoites; the blood-stage of infection started 2 days later after the release of merozoites from the liver. Mice were chronically infected for 40 days, at which point we administered the antimalarial drug chloroquine.

We found that the bone marrow quickly prioritises myelopoiesis by increasing the number of granulocyte monocyte progenitors (GMP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for gating strategies). Consequently, an increased number of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils are released into circulation and recruited into their target organ – the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors (MEP) appear de novo in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>); this extramedullary mechanism of erythropoiesis likely represents a division of labour in an attempt to compensate for the loss of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pathak and Ghosh, 2016</xref>). We also observed major histological changes in tissue structure and integrity with reduced cellularity in the bone marrow contrasting starkly with marked splenomegaly, which was accompanied by a complete loss of organisation between red and white pulp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, we found that long-lived prenatally seeded tissue-resident macrophages in bone marrow and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashimoto et al., 2013</xref>) rapidly disappear during acute infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Since red pulp macrophages are the only cells that can store and recycle iron in the spleen their disappearance thus means that ferric iron, which can be revealed histologically with Prussian Blue staining, is completely absent at the peak of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>). We could further demonstrate that patrolling monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlin et al., 2013</xref>), often regarded as the tissue-resident macrophages of the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mildner et al., 2017</xref>), also disappear early in infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These findings therefore place inflammatory monocytes at the centre of the acute phase response, since they now provide the only route through which to phagocytose and clear infected red cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Monocytes differentiate into inflammatory macrophages in naive hosts</title><p>We therefore carefully characterised the fate and function of inflammatory monocytes in the spleen by RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and used clueGO to reveal the complexity of their response to a first encounter with malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bindea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mlecnik et al., 2014</xref>).

This revealed that monocytes initiate a transcriptional programme that is typical of terminally differentiated inflammatory macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). They upregulate their ability to sense parasite- and host-derived danger signals by increasing transcription of diverse pattern recognition receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and upregulate expression of the hallmark cytokines and chemokines associated with a type I inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, they enhance their capacity to engage T cell immunity by upregulating all major components of the antigen processing and presentation machinery (for class I and class II MHC), and attempt to fine-tune T cell activation by increasing their expression of co-stimulatory molecules and checkpoint inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). Notably, a clear Warburg effect – the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis described when monocytes are stimulated with LPS in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>) – was not observed in vivo in response to malaria. Instead, the key enzymes involved in both metabolic pathways were transcriptionally induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>).</p><p>We next looked at all of these parameters of monocyte and macrophage biology in our mild model of malaria. Surprisingly, despite substantial differences in parasite density and patterns of sequestration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) the response of myeloid and progenitor cells in bone marrow, blood, and spleen was remarkably similar between AS and AJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Moreover, the fate and function of spleen monocytes was essentially identical – a direct pairwise comparison identified only a single differentially expressed gene (<italic>Kelch34</italic>) between the two models. In turn, clueGO analysis revealed that the four largest supergroups in monocytes isolated from AJ-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>) also dominated the response to AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>). It therefore appears that parasite genotype, pathogen load, and the sequestration of infected red cells in immune tissues does not fundamentally alter the myeloid response to acute infection. Instead, the haematopoietic switch that promotes myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (and relocates erythropoiesis to the spleen), the disappearance of tissue-resident macrophages and the differentiation of monocytes into inflammatory macrophages may all be part of an emergency response that is unavoidable in a naive host.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Naive hosts adapt to tolerate chronic infection</title><p>Malaria parasites can persist for many months (or even years) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Felger et al., 2012</xref>) and the fitness costs of maintaining emergency myelopoiesis over these time frames would be exceptionally high. We therefore asked how the host adapts to an ongoing infection that can not be cleared. In the chronic phase of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>, the pathogen load can reach up to 1000 parasites per μl blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and insoluble malaria pigment accumulates throughout the red pulp of the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Despite this abundance of parasite-derived signals, the spleen stops extramedullary erythropoiesis and creates new structural demarkations between red and white pulp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Furthermore, the bone marrow reduces the production of granulocyte monocyte progenitors, which in turn reduces the number of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils trafficking into the blood and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). At the same time, resident macrophages begin to repopulate their tissue niches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and ferric iron stores are re-established in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). These data provide compelling evidence that naive hosts quickly adapt to tolerate malaria parasites and return the myeloid compartment towards a healthy uninfected baseline.</p><p>In agreement, the transcriptome of monocytes during chronic infection is almost indistinguishable from uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Monocytes are no longer programmed to differentiate into inflammatory macrophages upon their arrival in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and they silence transcriptional signatures of the acute phase response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Notably, we find no evidence that they engage mechanisms to suppress inflammation, such as regulatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGFβ) or inhibitors of T cell activation (PD-L1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>). And furthermore, we find no evidence that they have an alternative fate such as inflammatory hemophagocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which have been implicated in chronic anaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akilesh et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, monocytes simply adopt a state of quiescence during chronic infection despite persisting parasitaemia.</p><p>Importantly, we can show that quiescence is reversible – when monocytes are removed from the spleen of chronically infected mice and stimulated in vitro with LPS their inflammatory response is comparable to monocytes from uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). In both cases, we clearly observe the Warburg effect and transcription of a plethora of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and co-stimulatory molecules, together with the induction of <italic>Nos2</italic> – the best biomarker of an inflammatory macrophage fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>). Clearly, monocytes are not in a permanent refractory state during chronic infection; instead, their activation and differentiation in response to parasites and their pyrogenic products must somehow be silenced in the remodelled spleen. This likely represents just one mechanism through which the host minimises inflammation to resolve collateral tissue damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Tolerance persists to protect host tissues during reinfection</title><p>We next asked whether tolerance could persist in the absence of live replicating parasites to provide long-lived protection. To answer this question, we developed a novel reinfection model that allowed us to exactly match parasite densities between first and second infection.

One month later, mice were infected for a second time but now with the virulent genotype AJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In this model, parasite burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and the dynamics of red cell loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) are both matched between first and second infection – this eliminates pathogen load as a confounding factor when analysing acquired mechanisms of disease tolerance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tolerance persists to protect host tissues during reinfection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Malaria reinfection model: C57Bl/6 mice were first infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS sporozoites.

First off, they upregulate the expression of two alarmins (<italic>S100a8</italic> and <italic>S100a9</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) that form the heterodimer calprotectin; this acts as an endogenous TLR4 ligand to silence the inflammatory response to pathogen-derived or damage-associated signals. Notably, increased expression of these alarmins in early life prevents hyperinflammation to protect neonates from sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ulas et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Chi3l1</italic> (encoding the prototypical chitinase-like protein) is also upregulated in second infection and can attenuate inflammasome activation to minimise collateral tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dela Cruz et al., 2012</xref>). In both cases, these mechanisms promote host control of inflammation without impairing pathogen clearance.</p><p>Monocytes also appear to minimise the effects of hypoxia and oxidative stress on their environment. For example, in first infection monocytes upregulate <italic>Sod2</italic>, which encodes a mitochondrial protein required to safeguard inflammatory macrophages from the reactive oxygen species that they produce. But in second infection they instead upregulate <italic>Sod3</italic>, which can be secreted to inactivate extracellular reactive oxygen species in the surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In much the same way, monocytes minimise host stress by upregulating <italic>Ednra</italic>, which can scavenge endothelin-1 to prevent vasoconstriction and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Czopek et al., 2019</xref>), and they increase expression of <italic>Vegfa</italic> to promote angiogenesis. Evidently, the transcriptional profile of spleen monocytes suggests that they take on a tissue protective role in second infection.</p><p>In support of this argument, monocytes differentially regulate heme-iron metabolism to deal with the release of toxic free heme and reactive iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) from ruptured red cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In brief, they increase their transcription of a core set of genes required to sequester extracellular iron (<italic>Ltf</italic> encoding lactotransferrin), import sequestered iron for detoxification (<italic>Tfr1/Tfr2</italic> encoding the transferrin receptors) and then export detoxified iron for use in the production of new red cells (<italic>Slc40a1</italic> encoding ferroportin). Notably, monocytes do not appear to increase their iron storage capacity, which has been associated with tissue damage in malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gozzelino et al., 2012</xref>). And nor do they upregulate expression of heme oxygenase-1 (<italic>Hmox1</italic>), which is required to detoxify free heme. These data therefore indicate that monocytes specifically enhance iron recycling to promote tolerance to hemolysis – a major source of stress in malaria. Crucially, this only occurs during reinfection, despite an identical red cell loss in naive and tolerised hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data clearly show that spleen monocytes initiate a transcriptional programme designed to promote tolerance to malaria parasites upon reinfection. This is achieved in two ways – first by minimising inflammation to reduce collateral tissue damage and second by engaging pathways that can impart stress tolerance on their environment. Significantly, mice were first infected with the avirulent parasite genotype AS, suggesting that parasite-derived signals may be sufficient to redirect monocyte fate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Metabolic rewiring underpins monocyte fate</title><p>We moved on to ask whether the fate and function of monocytes could be underpinned by metabolic reprogramming. Cellular metabolism has emerged as a key determinant of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O'Neill et al., 2016</xref>) and so we looked again at transcriptional control of the key enzymes involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. We found that both pathways were comparably induced during first and second infection with one notable exception: monocytes switched from upregulating the glucose transporter <italic>Slc2a1</italic> in first infection to <italic>Slc2a3</italic> in second infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). <italic>Slc2a3</italic> encodes the facilitative GLUT3 transporter, which unlike most other transporters can continue to import glucose under hypoglycaemic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>). Switching to GLUT3 may therefore constitute a cell-intrinsic adaptation that allows monocytes to tolerate infection-induced stress. When we looked deeper into the transcriptional control of cell metabolism we found that monocytes also differentially expressed their mitochondrial carrier proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These membrane-embedded proteins provide the cellular wiring that connects metabolic reactions in the cytosol with the mitochondrial matrix by transporting metabolites, nucleotides, and co-enzymes across the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Palmieri, 2013</xref>); in this way, mitochondrial carrier proteins facilitate the complex crosstalk between all major metabolic pathways. In first infection, spleen monocytes primarily upregulate a carrier protein (encoded by <italic>Slc25a1</italic>) whose major substrate is citrate, a metabolite known to accumulate in inflammatory macrophages. In contrast, monocytes upregulate <italic>Slc25a29</italic> during reinfection and this carrier protein shuttles arginine, which can be fluxed through the arginase pathway to promote tolerance and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O'Neill et al., 2016</xref>). By re-wiring their mitochondria, monocytes may thus be enabling their specialised tissue protective functions in tolerised hosts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Disease tolerance is established after one malaria episode</title><p>Host control of inflammation may provide a quick and effective way to establish disease tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Medzhitov et al., 2012</xref>); so far, we have shown that inflammation is minimised in the bone marrow (preventing emergency myelopoiesis), blood (decreasing plasma interferon), and spleen (diverting monocyte fate). To directly show that this coincides with a reduction in pathology we measured circulating levels of Angiopoietin-2. This vascular growth factor is the best biomarker of endothelium activation and dysfunction in human malaria and the most accurate prognostic marker of mortality in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yeo et al., 2008</xref>). We found that in first infection Angiopoietin-2 levels increased by more than an order of magnitude but in second infection – with an identical parasite burden – levels did not deviate from a healthy uninfected baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). A single malaria episode can therefore induce host adaptations that promote disease tolerance and provide long-lived clinical immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Malaria does not induce epigenetic reprogramming of bone marrow monocytes</title><p>So how do tolerised hosts control inflammation independently of pathogen load? To begin to answer this question, we looked once again at the functional specialisation of monocytes in second infection. Our data are consistent with a model of innate memory, whereby myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow are epigenetically reprogrammed during first infection to intrinsically modify the response of monocytes to reinfection. To test this hypothesis, we asked if malaria induces heritable histone modifications that alter the epigenetic landscape of inflammatory monocytes before their release from the bone marrow. And since tolerance can persist in the absence of parasitaemia, we isolated monocytes from once-infected mice one month after drug cure (day 70, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Crucially, this was exactly the same time-point at which we had performed all of our reinfection studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In this experiment, we interrogated the distribution of histone modifications genome-wide using ChIPseq and asked whether (i) transcription start sites were marked with H3K27ac to activate transcription (ii) enhancers or superenhancers were marked with H3K4me1 to promote gene expression or (iii) DNA was condensed into heterochromatin by H3K9me3 to silence gene expression.</p><p>We used the motif discovery software HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) to identify peaks and visualised peaks with the genomics exploration tool Integrative Genomics Viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013</xref>). In the first instance, we looked at the histone modification profiles of genes that define monocyte function in first and second infection; for example, genes associated with inflammation versus proliferation. Subscribing to the notion that ChIPseq reveals qualitative (not quantitative) differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Orlando et al., 2014</xref>), we simply asked whether these genes were marked or not marked. Our prediction was that genes that were upregulated during first infection but silenced during reinfection (tolerised genes) would lose marks associated with active transcription or be condensed into inactive heterochromatin. Conversely, specialised genes (those upregulated exclusively during second infection) would gain marks to promote transcription. Remarkably however, we found that in almost every case the histone modification profiles of tolerised and specialised genes were identical between monocytes isolated from once-infected mice and uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Malaria does not induce epigenetic reprogramming of bone marrow monocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)seq of bone marrow monocytes flow-sorted from once-infected mice (AJ, memory, 70 days p.i.) and uninfected controls.

We therefore looked for transcriptional evidence of long-lived changes in spleen monocytes that can persist after parasite clearance. We found 111 differentially expressed genes in monocytes isolated from once-infected mice compared to uninfected controls; remarkably, most of these genes were not differentially expressed during acute or chronic infection. Instead, this transcriptional signature was unique to the memory phase and was further enhanced upon reinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This included the transcription factor <italic>Maf</italic>, which regulates macrophage programming in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), and <italic>Sirpa</italic>, which regulates recognition of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian et al., 2016</xref>).

Indeed, we found remarkable overlap in the top GO terms identified in memory and second infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). A critical part of the transcriptional programme designed to promote tolerance to malaria parasites is therefore already engaged in monocytes prior to reinfection. And this transcriptional signature does not appear to require epigenetic reprogramming in the bone marrow. These data thus provide compelling evidence that malaria may remodel the spleen to imprint tolerance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Monocytes are transcriptionally reprogrammed in the remodelled spleen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNA sequencing of spleen monocytes flow-sorted from AJ-infected mice (7 and 40 days p.i. for acute and chronic, respectively), once-infected mice (memory, 70 days p.i.), and reinfected mice (acute, 7 days p.i.).

These inducible mechanisms of tolerance therefore provide memory and constitute an alternative strategy of acquired immunity. Crucially, these adaptations function to preserve key homeostatic processes and protect life, and are therefore likely to be the primary form of host defense when sterile immunity can not be generated. This is particularly relevant in malaria, where even partial control of parasite densities is not usually demonstrable until adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marsh and Kinyanjui, 2006</xref>). It seems likely that many complementary strategies of tolerance will need to cooperate to provide protection and we identify three mechanisms in the myeloid compartment alone – emergency myelopoiesis is disarmed; tissue-resident macrophages become resistant to malaria-induced ablation; and spleen monocytes eschew an inflammatory macrophage fate to take on a tissue protective role. These adaptations operate independently of pathogen load and coincide with a reduction in systemic inflammation; what's more, tissue integrity is preserved, ferric iron stores are maintained and endothelium activation/dysfunction is avoided during reinfection. Acquired mechanisms of disease tolerance can therefore avert hallmark features of severe malaria.</p><p>Host control of inflammation thus appears to provide an effective route to disease tolerance and monocyte activation is clearly not hardwired. However, their functional specialisation in tolerised hosts is not underpinned by epigenetic reprogramming of progenitor cells in the bone marrow but instead seems to be imprinted within the remodelled spleen. Tissue printing of immune cell function is well recognised, and allows monocytes to take on a remarkably diverse range of organ-specific roles. This has been best characterised during the differentiation of monocytes into long-lived tissue resident macrophages, in which local signals imprint specialised functions that are unique to every tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scott et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van de Laar et al., 2016</xref>). In this way, tissue printing maximises the plasticity of myeloid cells. One of many challenges when resolving the acute phase response to malaria is to refill the red pulp macrophage niche, which was obliterated by acute infection; this is achieved through the recruitment and differentiation of bone marrow-derived monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lai et al., 2018</xref>). We find that red pulp macrophages isolated from once-infected mice are transcriptionally identical to those from uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), which shows that tissue printing can precisely match the transcriptional programme of recruited monocytes with the functional requirements of the tissue – in this case, to re-establish ferric iron stores. It is clear then that the tissue niche imprints organ-specific identity onto monocytes that take residence to maintain homeostatic processes. But similar mechanisms must also operate to control the fate of monocytes that do not take residence and instead are recruited to deal with injury or infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guilliams et al., 2018</xref>). In this scenario, how might the tissue niche be remodelled by malaria to promote tolerance?</p><p>A niche is often considered to be a small self-contained tissue scaffold that provides the physical structure required to target specialised signals to resident cells or cells transiting the niche. Nevertheless, a niche can also be a dynamic and expansive space, such as the open circulatory system created by the pulp cords and sinuses of the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guilliams et al., 2020</xref>). Malaria causes pronounced splenomegaly and disruption of architecture, including a complete loss of boundaries between red and white pulp. During chronic infection, splenomegaly begins to resolve and these boundaries are re-established but the spleen may not be put back exactly as it was before – it may acquire new and altered features. For example, malaria pigment accumulates throughout the red pulp, and these persistent insoluble deposits may regulate the activation and differentiation of monocytes arriving in the remodelled spleen. In support of this idea, malaria pigment can suppress the oxidative burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schwarzer et al., 1992</xref>) and interferon-induced upregulation of class II MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schwarzer et al., 1998</xref>) in human monocytes in vitro. Alternatively, re-assembly of the stromal cell networks that compartmentalise the spleen may alter cell patterning and thereby change the distribution and density of key signals that control monocyte fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnardel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koliaraki et al., 2020</xref>). Or perhaps the tissue niche required to promote tolerance is already present in the spleen (even in a naive host) but is lost when the spleen becomes enlarged and disorganised in first infection. In this example, it is the preservation of spleen architecture that facilitates the functional specialisation of monocytes in tolerised hosts. In every scenario, monocytes arriving in the remodelled spleen receive a new combination of signals that can minimise inflammation and induce their tissue protective functions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> for a working model). Importantly, tissue remodelling and the accumulation of malaria pigment is observed in the human spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buffet et al., 2011</xref>), and we therefore suggest that this is a conserved strategy through which malaria imprints tolerance. This will almost certainly benefit the parasite as well as the host; after all, if you can minimise host sickness behaviour you will likely maximise the probability of onward transmission.</p><p>Other changes to the niche include the appearance of malaria-specific memory B and T cells, which provide effective adaptive immunity in our reinfection model (peak AJ parasitaemia is reduced from 25% in naive hosts to 0.5% in tolerised hosts). Nonetheless, this relatively low pathogen load is more than sufficient to promote the differentiation of spleen monocytes into inflammatory macrophages, as demonstrated in naive hosts infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS. So how might adaptive mechanisms of immunity influence the myeloid response independently of pathogen load? One route through which B cells may regulate monocyte fate is through the production of opsonising antibodies, which recognise merozoites and/or infected red cells. Indeed, it has been shown that phagocytosis of immune complexes in the context of Toll-like receptor signaling can induce M2 (or regulatory) macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guilliams et al., 2014</xref>). However, in these experiments M2 macrophages increased production of the pyrogenic cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF, and malaria-specific opsonising antibodies have been directly shown to promote inflammation in human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Osier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Instead, the generation of memory T cells that reduce the production of IFNɣ may be a more simple explanation; in agreement, we find that circulating levels of IFNɣ are substantially reduced in second infection. Nevertheless, signaling through the IFNɣ receptor is not a prerequisite for the differentiation of inflammatory macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xue et al., 2014</xref>) and the early source of IFNɣ in naive hosts is not T cell-derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artavanis-Tsakonas and Riley, 2002</xref>). Changes in cytokine production may therefore need to be much more extensive if T cells are to push monocytes away from an inflammatory fate. In this context, it is notable that malaria-specific memory T cells have been shown to adopt new effector functions upon recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zander et al., 2017</xref>); as such, they may be well placed to modify the availability of diverse signals within the tissue niche.</p><p>Future studies should therefore aim to uncouple the relative contribution of T cell signals versus structural changes (inc the appearance of malaria pigment) in redirecting monocyte fate. This may be achieved by transplanting spleens from tolerised to naive hosts and then infecting with the avirulent parasite genotype AS. In this setting, it will be possible to a) provide definitive evidence that monocyte fate is imprinted within the spleen and b) assess the role of memory T cells by injecting donor mice with a depleting anti-CD3 antibody prior to transplantation. Interpretation of these experiments may be complicated however by the fact that recipient mice would still be expected to trigger emergency myelopoiesis and lose their tissue resident macrophages. Systemic inflammation (and the disruption of homeostatic processes) may override any local signals in the spleen that favour tolerance – reinfection is characterised by diverse adaptations in distinct tissues after all, and presumably these will need to work in unison to provide clinical immunity.</p><p>It is therefore important that we consider how other host adaptations might be established. Emergency myelopoiesis can be disarmed in the bone marrow; how is this avoided second time around despite an identical pathogen load? It could be that changes to the tissue niche promote tolerance, in much the same way as described in the spleen, as first infection leads to a loss of cellularity and tissue integrity in the bone marrow, which inevitably requires repair. But it is also possible that cell-intrinsic changes establish tolerance in this case. Current evidence indicates that systemic inflammation, which can push haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) down the myeloid path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mitroulis et al., 2018</xref>), is triggered in the bone marrow by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which produce type I interferon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Spaulding et al., 2016</xref>). Can you intrinsically modify pDC to attenuate their function (e.g. by increasing their activation threshold)? Or limit their access to parasites and their pyrogenic products? Or perhaps tolerance operates further upstream – the expression of pattern recognition receptors on HSC could be restricted to prevent their direct activation by malaria parasites. Whatever the mechanism, we believe that disarming emergency myelopoiesis in the bone marrow is just as important as imprinting monocytes with tissue protective functions in the spleen.</p><p>We also show that long-lived prenatally seeded tissue-resident macrophages become resistant to malaria-induced ablation. Tissue-resident macrophages were often considered to be immune sentinels that provide a first line of defence against invading pathogens but actually they have been shown time and again to be sensitive to stress, and their disappearance in response to injury or infection is well recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aegerter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blériot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Machiels et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scott et al., 2016</xref>). Their functions instead mainly relate to development, tissue repair, and homeostasis. So how does malaria cause the death of tissue-resident macrophages in naive hosts and why are they protected in tolerised hosts? We suggest that the release and catabolism of free heme from ruptured red cells can explain this phenomenon. Free heme is toxic to tissue-resident macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cambos and Scorza, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferreira et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haldar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Theurl et al., 2016</xref>) and the detoxification of free heme is known to confer disease tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Seixas et al., 2009</xref>). In our model, heme accumulation is likely to be similar between first and second infection as parasite burden and red cell loss are comparable. The preservation of tissue-resident macrophages could therefore be a consequence of more efficiently detoxifying free heme to reduce its bioavailability and pathogenicity. Since we find no evidence that monocytes transcriptionally regulate their capacity to metabolise heme during reinfection (they exclusively upregulate iron recycling) other cell types would need to carry out this role, including hepatocytes and renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ramos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Theurl et al., 2016</xref>). In this scenario, metabolic adaptations that operate in non-lymphoid tissues must also be inducible, and would persist after pathogen clearance to provide memory and clinical immunity.</p><p>Acquired immunity to malaria is often considered to be slow and ineffective – but this is only true if we consider resistance (the ability to eliminate parasites) in isolation. Despite being an equally important part of host defense, the central role of disease tolerance in acquired immunity to malaria has not been fully appreciated. We demonstrate that disease tolerance can be attained after a single malaria episode and can persist in the absence of parasitaemia to allow the host to tolerate subsequent infections. We therefore argue that mechanisms of disease tolerance provide an alternative strategy of acquired immunity that functions not to kill parasites but to limit the damage that they can cause. Adaptations in the myeloid compartment minimise inflammation and promote stress tolerance, and it is likely that these will need to be complemented by adaptations in other immune compartments such as memory T cell reservoirs, which orchestrate innate and adaptive immunity. Furthermore, changes to the immune response will need to be complemented by long-lived metabolic adaptations that maintain homeostasis and preserve organ function. Together, all of these adaptations can work in concert to protect host tissues and minimise pathology. The mechanisms of disease tolerance uncovered in this study are therefore likely just the tip of the iceberg but they can begin to explain how children in endemic areas acquire immunity to severe malaria so quickly and without the need for improved pathogen control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gonçalves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gupta et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marsh and Snow, 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> C57Bl/6J female)</td><td>C57Bl/6</td><td><italic>The Jackson Laboratory</italic></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td>Bred and housed in individually ventilated cages <break/>(SPF conditions) at the University of Edinburgh</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Plasmodium</italic> <break/><italic>chabaudi chabaudi</italic> AS)</td><td><italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS</td><td rowspan="2" valign="middle"><italic>The European malaria reagent repository</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.malariaresearch.eu">http://www.malariaresearch.eu</ext-link></td><td>Clone 28AS11</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi</italic> AJ)</td><td><italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AJ</td><td>Clone 96AJ15</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> SD500)</td><td>Mosquitoes</td><td>Reared in-house at the University of Edinburgh</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-mouse B220 <break/>(rat monoclonal)</td><td>Clone RA3-6B2 <break/><italic>eBioscience</italic> -

Successful oocyst development was verified in mosquito midguts 8 days later and sporozoites were isolated from mosquito salivary glands on day 15 post-feed. Salivary glands were dissected under a stereomicroscope and transferred to a glass mortar; to maintain sporozoite viability, salivary glands were kept on ice in RPMI supplemented with 0.2% Glucose, 0.2% Sodium bicarbonate (<italic>Sigma-Aldrich</italic>), 2 mM L-Glutamine (<italic>Gibco</italic>), and 10% fetal bovine serum (<italic>Gibco,</italic> FBS Performance Plus, heat inactivated and filtered 0.22 μm) for a maximum of 2 hr.

In brief, we infected mice by intraperitoneal injection of 10<sup>5</sup> mosquito-transmitted <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS or AJ blood-stage parasites and measured circulating parasitaemia at the peak of schizogony (13:00 GMT) by counting at least 5000 red cells on Giemsa stained blood films. Immediately thereafter, mice were euthanised and exsanguinated – the spleen and both femurs were prepared for histology as described above (‘tissue preparation for histology’). In addition, the left lobe of the liver, the left lung and kidney, the duodenum and the heart were fixed in 10% neutral buffered Formalin (24 hr) and then stored in 70% Ethanol. All organs from each mouse were paraffin-embedded in a single block and 5 μm sections were cut and stained with H&amp;E (longitudinal section for bone and cross section for all other tissues). The percentage of infected red cells contained within the microvasculature of every organ was quantified by counting at least 1000 red cells in at least 20 blood vessels, and is displayed relative to peripheral parasitaemia.

Single cell suspensions were filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer and after red cell lysis leukocytes were counted on a haemocytometer; up to 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well were placed into a 96 well V bottom plate for staining. A Zombie Aqua Fixable Viability Dye (<italic>BioLegend</italic>) was used to identify dead cells, after which Fc receptors were blocked using TruStain FcX (anti-mouse CD16/32, <italic>BioLegend</italic>). Cell surface staining was performed at room temperature (antibody panels are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and for ChIPseq experiments cells were subsequently fixed in PBS with 1% paraformaldehyde and 10% FBS for 10 min at room temperature (reaction was quenched with 125 mM Glycine [<italic>Sigma-Aldrich</italic>]). Note that across experiments the viability of leukocytes always exceeded 93.8% (no viability stain for cell sorting).

Note that for each biological sample we pooled the femurs and tibias from two mice, and three tubes (each containing 50,000 cells) were collected for every sample so that we could perform chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with three different antibodies (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K9me3).</p><p>We performed ChIP using the True MicroChIP Kit (<italic>Diagenode</italic>). In brief, chromatin was sheared using a Bioruptor Pico Sonicator (five cycles: 30 s ON - 30 s OFF, fragments 100–300 bp, <italic>Diagenode</italic>) and 10% of sheared chromatin was kept as input control whilst 90% was immunoprecipitated overnight using antibodies against H3K27ac, H3K4me1 or H3K9me3 (all ChIP-grade from <italic>Diagenode</italic>). Protein-A-coated magnetic beads were then added to samples and after a 6 hr incubation unbound chromatin fragments were removed by thorough washing.

We then used the motif discovery software HOMER (v4.10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) to turn indexed bam files (generated using samtools idxstats) into tag directories of individual ChIP and input samples. Alignments were converted to bedgraph format using the HOMER script makeUCSCfile. Wig format outputs were converted to tdf files to view data in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV v.2.7.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013</xref>) using igvtools v2.3.93 (parameters: toTDF -z 7 f p98). In HOMER, we identified areas of the genome where ChIP read counts were significantly enriched over fragmented, non-immunoprecipitated input DNA (which indicates the presence of a histone mark) by calling peaks in ChIP relative to sample-matched input DNA using predefined parameters (H3K27ac and H3K9me3 used ‘regions’ and H3K4me1 used ‘typical’ and ‘supertypical’). Default settings were used in every case with the exception of fold change over input, which was set to &gt;3 fold for H3K9me3.</p><p>Individual samples were then combined in HOMER to create pooled ChIP tag directories. We selected only samples with a high IP efficiency (&gt;5% for H3K27ac and H3K9me3, and &gt;10% for H3K4me1) to generate pooled tag directories that comprised: four biological replicates for H3K27ac; 2 (once-infected) or 3 (uninfected) biological replicates for H3K4me1; and one replicate for H3K9me3. Bedgraphs of pooled ChIP tag directories were generated and converted to tdf format as above using more than 2.2 × 10<sup>8</sup> tags for H3K27ac, 1.1 × 10<sup>8</sup> tags for H3K4me1 and 7 × 10<sup>7</sup> tags for H3K9me3. Peaks were called on pooled ChIP samples relative to pool-matched input DNA using the parameters described above. We created tdf files that indicated the position of peaks across the genome with a fixed height bar and visualised the histone modification profile alongside peak location in IGV. To ask whether genes were marked or not marked we looked for the presence or absence of peaks within 10 kb (H3K27ac and H3K9me3) or 100 kb (H3K4me1) of the transcription start site.</p><p>To identify differentially modified regions (DMR) across the genome we again called peaks on pooled ChIP samples but this time instead of using non-immunoprecipitated input DNA to correct for background we called peaks in once-infected mice relative to uninfected controls (and vice versa). In this way, we identified areas of the genome where read counts were significantly enriched in one or the other experimental group. Low confidence peaks were removed by applying a peak score cut off &gt;3 and DMR were annotated to the nearest gene using the script annotatePeaks in HOMER. We then asked how many of the 2848 tolerised/specialised genes identified by RNAseq were annotated with a differentially modified region (if a gene was annotated with more than one DMR then the region with the highest peak score was retained).

This study provides novel important data to understand this process, proposing that innate immune memory contributes to the induction of long-term tolerance after a malaria infection, subsequently improving the survival of the host.

The authors indeed propose here that innate immune memory contributes to the induction of long-term tolerance after a malaria infection, subsequently improving the survival of the host.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>However, some aspects of the study need to be improved to strengthen the conclusions made here. Key comments/experiments are listed below:</p><p>To clarify by which markers the authors define their subsets of interest, such as monocytes or “specialized iron-recycling macrophages”. In Figure 1, What are inflammatory monocytes, how are they characterized? What are myeloid progenitors? Are these GMPs? cMOPS? No exact definition or gating strategy is provided. Have the authors excluded that the differences in myeloid cell progenitors are on the subset level and or on the level of functional surface molecules, such as CD131, as suggested in Mitroulis et al., 2018? These changes might not be evident in a general myeloid progenitor quantification. In this regard, the detailed phenotype of myeloid BM progenitors during tolerance induction should be provided.</p><p>The authors need to show that the parasite burden is equivalent between the primary and secondary infections. This is crucial to the interpretation of the findings. In Figure 3B, the parasitemia is only shown for day 6, likely the start of the primary parasitemia curve for this infection. The authors need to display the full parasitemia curves for both the first and second infections, to demonstrate that the parasite burden is equal (or very similar) over the full timecourse in the first and second infections.</p><p>The lack of epigenetic reprogramming in circulating monocytes is remarkable and it is indeed a potential argument that induction of long-term immune tolerance is taking place in the spleen, as hypothesize by the authors. But all reviewers think that the authors should present some basic data demonstrating long-term epigenetic/transcriptional reprogramming of spleen macrophages. Without such data, the title of Figure 6 is misleading.</p><p>All reviewers recommended to perform crucial experiments on splenectomized mice to support that spleen is crucial for the induction and maintenance of the tolerance. In addition, crucial experiments should also be done in RAG mice to at least control for adaptive immune-mediated control of the parasites, which may be significant. Indeed, given that AJ infection has a higher parasite burden in the primary infection (Figure 1B), but the parasitemias are described as equal between the primary and secondary infections in the model used, it is likely that there is substantial adaptive immune control of the parasites in the second infection. This is a confounding factor that is not mentioned at all in the manuscript but is likely to have a major impact on the way that the parasites are sensed in the second infection. Do opsonised merozoites inhibit inflammation in the myeloid population, when compared to non-opsonised merozoites or infected red blood cells? This may provide an alternative explanation for the phenomenon observed here. What about the role of regulatory populations? Would similar results be observed if the authors performed these experiments in RAG or Nude mice following drug cure of the first infection? Would transfer of monocytes or macrophages (if feasible) from the spleen of cured mice confer a level of tolerance to new hosts?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63838.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>However, some aspects of the study need to be improved to strengthen the conclusions made here.

We apologise that we did not effectively draw attention to this resource and have modified our revised manuscript to make it much easier for the reader to find this information. Details of all antibodies, staining panels and gating strategies in both uninfected and AJ-infected mice are provided in Supplementary file 1. We now explicitly refer to this in the Results (“see Supplementary file 1 for gating strategies”), all figure legends that include flow data and the Materials and methods (“antibody panels are detailed in Supplementary file 1” and “gating strategies are shown in Supplementary file 1”). To identify myeloid cells by flow cytometry we used the following gating strategies:</p><p>granulocyte monocyte progenitors (GMP)</p><p>(Lineage<sup>neg</sup> Sca1<sup>neg</sup> c-Kit<sup>pos</sup> CD34<sup>pos</sup> CD16/32 (FcɣRIII/II)<sup>pos</sup> CD27<sup>pos</sup> CD71<sup>int</sup>)</p><p>megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors (MEP)</p><p>(Lineage<sup>neg</sup> Sca1<sup>neg</sup> c-Kit<sup>pos</sup> CD34<sup>neg</sup> CD16/32 (FcɣRIII/II)<sup>neg</sup> CD27<sup>neg</sup> CD71<sup>pos</sup>)</p><p>inflammatory monocytes bone marrow *</p><p>(Lineage<sup>neg</sup> Ly6G<sup>neg</sup> CD115<sup>pos</sup> CD135<sup>neg</sup> cKit<sup>neg</sup> CD11b<sup>pos</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>)</p><p>* note that this gating strategy specifically excludes immature monocyte precursors like the common monocyte progenitor (cMoP: Lineage<sup>neg</sup> Ly6G<sup>neg</sup> CD115<sup>pos</sup> CD135<sup>neg</sup> cKit<sup>pos</sup> CD11b<sup>int</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>) and the macrophage dendritic cell progenitor (MDP: Lineage<sup>neg</sup> Ly6G<sup>neg</sup> CD115<sup>pos</sup> CD135<sup>neg</sup> cKit<sup>pos</sup> CD11b<sup>lo</sup> Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>)</p><p>inflammatory monocytes spleen</p><p>(Lineage<sup>neg</sup> Ly6G<sup>neg</sup> CD115<sup>pos</sup> CD11b<sup>pos</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>)</p><p>patrolling monocytes</p><p>(Lineage<sup>neg</sup> CD115<sup>pos</sup> CD11b<sup>pos</sup> Ly6C<sup>neg</sup> Nr4a1<sup>pos</sup> (most are also CX3CR1<sup>pos</sup>)</p><p>red pulp macrophages</p><p>(Lineage<sup>neg</sup> F4/80<sup>pos</sup> B220<sup>neg</sup> CD11b<sup>int</sup> CD11c<sup>int</sup> autofluorescent cells)</p><p>bone marrow iron recycling macrophages</p><p>(Lineage<sup>neg</sup> CD115<sup>pos</sup> CD11b<sup>int</sup> CD169<sup>pos</sup> CD11c<sup>int</sup> F4/80<sup>pos</sup>)</p><p>We devised these gating strategies according to the following key publications: Hey, 2015; Hettinger, 2013; Hanna, 2011; Hashimoto, 2013; and Paul, 2015.</p><p>In the Materials and methods, we specify the phenotype of every cell population flow-sorted for RNA sequencing, ChIPseq, microarray, cytospin and in vitro stimulation and clearly state that CD115 was not used when sorting monocytes: “Note that CD115 (Csf1r) was replaced with CD11c when sorting monocytes as engagement of the Csf1 receptor has been shown to induce transcriptional changes (Jung et al., 2000).”</p><p>We have also revised Figure 1 (and the accompanying legend) to clearly state that the myeloid progenitors that we quantify are GMP – their absolute number and proportion (relative to MEP) both increase during acute infection in naive mice. In a previous publication, Mitroulis et al., (2018) showed that myeloid cell production can also be increased in the bone marrow by injecting mice with β glucan. In this setting, myeloid expansion is driven by an increased frequency of CD131-expressing multipotent progenitors and haematopoietic stem cells. Unfortunately, we did not stain for CD131 and so are unable to comment as to whether emergency myelopoiesis in malaria may also be underpinned by changes in uncommitted progenitors upstream of GMPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to show that the parasite burden is equivalent between the primary and secondary infections.

In our original submission the data in Figure 3B represented the parasitaemia of those mice sacrificed for RNA sequencing of spleen monocytes on day 7 of first infection and reinfection (Figure 2 and Figure 4, respectively). We chose to display the data in that way to emphasise that the specialised functions of monocytes during reinfection could not be explained by a difference in pathogen load. However, we acknowledge that we did not communicate our reasoning in the manuscript and agree that showing a full course of infection would be more informative and transparent. We have therefore revised Figure 3B to show all data across the acute phase of first and second infection – importantly, this contains every time-point at which we performed analysis of the host response (including flow cytometry, histology, plasma analyte profiling and RNA sequencing). Furthermore, we now show the data as parasite density – calculated using the percentage parasitaemia and red cell counts for each mouse at each time-point – to give a more accurate measure of pathogen load. As can be seen in the revised figure, parasite burden is very similar throughout the acute phase of first and second infection. Moreover, there is no statistically significant difference at any time-point:</p><p>“No statistically significant difference was detected at any timepoint (p<sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney test corrected for multiple comparisons using Holm-Šidák method).”</p><p>Note that because we sacrificed mice for analysis along the way it would be misleading to represent the data as a continuous curve and we therefore show individual data points. Also note that Figure 3B shows chronically infected mice in second infection have a similar parasite burden to chronically infected mice in first infection (day 40 post-infection). We hope that by showing these data in full we are able to communicate the lengths to which we went to ensure pathogen load could not be a confounding factor in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The lack of epigenetic reprogramming in circulating monocytes is remarkable and it is indeed a potential argument that induction of long-term immune tolerance is taking place in the spleen, as hypothesize by the authors.

To emphasise the importance of this finding (and to more accurately state the conclusion supported by these data) we have changed the title of Figure 6 and the corresponding subheading in the Results section to: “Malaria does not induce epigenetic reprogramming of bone marrow monocytes”. This removes any reference to imprinting of monocyte function in the spleen, which could be misleading.</p><p>We now put forward the possibility that monocyte fate may be imprinted within the remodelled spleen in a new Results section. This section presents new data (Figure 7) showing that monocytes are transcriptionally reprogrammed in the spleen of once-infected mice. Importantly, this is exactly the same time-point at which we performed ChIPseq on bone marrow monocytes (Figure 6) and all of our reinfection studies. In brief, we found a persisting transcriptional signature of infection in spleen monocytes 30-days after drug cure. Remarkably, most of these genes were not differentially expressed during acute or chronic infection; instead, this transcriptional signature was unique to the memory phase and was further enhanced upon reinfection. GO term analysis then confirmed that many of the functional gene enrichment pathways unique to second infection were already present in spleen monocytes prior to reinfection. We believe these data provide strong support for the argument that the functional specialisation of monocytes in tolerised hosts takes place within the remodelled spleen. However, we acknowledge that these data do not provide definitive evidence and this is reflected in our choice of language throughout the manuscript, for example: Abstract “this alternative fate […] appears to be imprinted within the remodelled spleen”; Results “malaria may remodel the spleen to imprint tolerance”; Figure 7C “we therefore propose that the remodelled spleen imprints monocytes with tissue protective functions”; and Discussion “functional specialisation in tolerised hosts […] seems to be imprinted within the remodelled spleen”. We also explicitly state in the discussion that further experiments are required to provide definitive evidence that monocyte fate is imprinted within the spleen, as discussed in detail below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers recommended to perform crucial experiments on splenectomized mice to support that spleen is crucial for the induction and maintenance of the tolerance.

And what role does adaptive immunity play in disease tolerance?</p><p>We agree that effective mechanisms of adaptive immunity are operating in our reinfection model, reducing the peak of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AJ parasitaemia from 25% in first infection to 0.5% in second infection. This reduction in parasitaemia is an example of host resistance (improved clearance of parasites) and is presumably mediated by acquired mechanisms of humoral and/or T cell immunity. But as we show using the less virulent genotype AS 0.5% parasitaemia is still sufficient to promote systemic inflammation, tissue damage and the differentiation of inflammatory macrophages in naive hosts. The question should therefore be slightly re-framed – can adaptive immunity also contribute to acquired mechanisms of disease tolerance?</p><p>We have included a new paragraph in the Discussion that explores this question in detail. In brief, we think it unlikely that opsonising antibodies can explain the specialised functions of monocytes in tolerised hosts as phagocytosis of immune complexes or opsonised infected red cells leads to increased production of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF in human monocytes and macrophages (Osier, 2014 and Zhou, 2012). An alternative explanation may be that memory T cells modify the availability of key signals that can regulate monocyte fate (e.g. IFNɣ). Changing the availability of one cytokine may not be enough to drive the diverse host adaptations that we observe in second infection but more extensive changes in T cell function could make a significant contribution to disease tolerance. In the revised manuscript, we clearly state that adaptive mechanisms of immunity are operating in our reinfection model and provide partial host resistance. Furthermore, we propose that changes in T cell cytokine production may complement structural remodelling to create a tissue environment that can redirect monocyte fate; importantly, we point out that this hypothesis requires additional experimentation.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, one way to investigate the role of adaptive immunity in disease tolerance is to use RAG KO or nude mice. Unfortunately, we do not feel that these experiments can satisfactorily answer the questions raised. Infection of RAG KO mice leads to hyperparasitaemia and death within 8-10 days even when using the avirulent genotype AS (Spence, 2013). Drug cure would therefore have to be initiated extremely early and this model would not recapitulate the chronic recrudescing parasitaemia that is observed in human malaria. It is not clear whether disease tolerance could be established in this setting. An alternative to infecting immunodeficient mice would be to use antibodies to deplete T cells from wild-type mice prior to reinfection but this would lead to hyperparasitaemia upon rechallenge. We would therefore expect disease severity to increase in second infection but it would be impossible to know whether this results from a loss of tolerance or resistance mechanisms.</p><p>In much the same way, splenectomy would not be able to directly address whether monocyte fate is imprinted within the remodelled spleen. In this scenario, we would remove the only organ that can mechanically trap and filter infected red cells, and mice would therefore have an increased pathogen load in second infection (Safeukui, 2008). This has been clearly shown in <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> (Grun, 1985) and in semi-immune adults living in endemic areas (Bach, 2005). As pointed out by the reviewers, parasite burden needs to be equivalent between first and second infection to interrogate mechanisms of disease tolerance (“this is crucial to the interpretation of the findings”). We should also point out that splenectomy can alter the expression of parasite variant surface antigens leading to major changes in sequestration and histopathology (Del Portillo, 2012). Taking all of this into account, we would predict that tolerance would be broken by splenectomy but this would not conclusively show that monocyte fate needs to be imprinted within the remodelled spleen – our results would be confounded by hyperparasitaemia and changing sequestration patterns.</p><p>Instead, we propose that transplanting spleens from once-infected to naive mice (and then infecting recipient mice with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS) may be a better route through which to ask whether monocyte function is imprinted within the remodelled spleen. Nevertheless, we must caution that in this setting none of the other mechanisms of disease tolerance will be in place and it is possible that by triggering emergency myelopoiesis, systemic inflammation and endothelium activation recipient mice may override local mechanisms of tolerance that operate in the spleen. The same caveat applies to the adoptive transfer of spleen monocytes. Furthermore, these experiments would only reveal whether monocyte fate is imprinted within the spleen and would not provide any additional information that may help elucidate the relative contribution of structural changes versus T cell regulation. This could be teased apart in a transplantion model by giving drug-treated donor mice T cell depleting antibodies prior to removal of the spleen. Here, recipient mice would receive a remodelled spleen but no malaria-specific memory T cells. This is one reason why we favour spleen transplants over adoptive transfers and this is discussed at length in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have given all of these experimental approaches a lot of thought over the last few years but still feel that there is no simple experiment that can give a straightforward answer. The data presented in this study clearly show that disease tolerance is underpinned by diverse host adaptations that work together at whole-organism scale to provide long-lived clinical immunity. Changes in the myeloid compartment are likely to be accompanied by changes to the adaptive immune response and further complemented by metabolic adaptations (Discussion). The complex interplay between all of these adaptations will make it very difficult to dissect each mechanism in isolation. As such, we believe that a new dedicated programme of work will be required to take these next steps. Moreover, we believe that the absence of definitive evidence for imprinting in the spleen does not detract from the remarkable finding that there is no epigenetic reprogramming in the bone marrow.</p></body></sub-article></article>
