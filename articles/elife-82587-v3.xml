How can the visual system reliably extract local features from an input dominated by self-generated signals? In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, diverse local visual features are represented by a group of projection neurons with distinct tuning properties. Here, we describe a connectome-based volumetric imaging strategy to measure visually evoked neural activity across this population. We show that local visual features are jointly represented across the population, and a shared gain factor improves trial-to-trial coding fidelity. A subset of these neurons, tuned to small objects, is modulated by two independent signals associated with self-movement, a motor-related signal, and a visual motion signal associated with rotation of the animal. These two inputs adjust the sensitivity of these feature detectors across the locomotor cycle, selectively reducing their gain during saccades and restoring it during intersaccadic intervals. This work reveals a strategy for reliable feature detection during locomotion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>central visual pathways</kwd><kwd>suppression</kwd><kwd>spatial vision</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-MH118707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Maxwell H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99-EY032549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Maxwell H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-EY022638</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clandinin</surname><given-names>Thomas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS110060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clandinin</surname><given-names>Thomas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krieger</surname><given-names>Avery</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014037</institution-id><institution>National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pang</surname><given-names>Michelle M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurons responsible for detecting local visual features are modulated by visual and motor-related forms of gain control that increase the threshold for detection when self-generated movement signals would dominate visual input.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sighted animals frequently move their bodies, heads, and eyes to achieve their behavioral goals and to actively sample the environment. As a result, the image on the retina is frequently subject to self-generated motion. This presents a challenge for the visual system, as visual circuitry must extract and represent specific features of the external visual scene in a rapidly changing context where the dominant sources of visual changes on the retina may be self-generated. While this problem has been well studied in the context of motion estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Borst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Britten, 2008</xref>), the broader question of how visual neurons might extract local features of the scene under naturalistic viewing conditions is relatively poorly understood. How do visual neurons selectively encode local features of interest under these dynamic conditions?</p><p>Local feature detection during self-motion presents unique challenges. For detecting widefield motion, or large static features of the scene like oriented edges and landmarks, the visual scene is intrinsically redundant, as many neurons distributed across the visual field can encode information that is relevant to the feature of interest even as the scene moves. Conversely, local features like prey, conspecifics, or approaching predators engage only a small part of the visual field, dramatically reducing the redundancy of the visual input. In addition, neurons that selectively respond to small features could also be activated by high spatial frequency content in the broader scene, potentially corrupting their responses under naturalistic viewing conditions. Neurons that respond selectively to local visual features have been described in many species, including flies, amphibians, rodents, and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keleş and Frye, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kerschensteiner, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klapoetke et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lettvin et al., 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pasupathy and Connor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Piscopo et al., 2013</xref>). However, these studies have typically been conducted either in non-behaving animals, or under conditions of visual fixation. Here, we explore the neural mechanisms by which local feature detection is made robust to the visual inputs and behavioral signals associated with natural vision.</p><p>Strategies for reliable visual feature detection during self-motion fall into one of at least three categories. First, behavioral strategies can help mitigate the impact of self-motion on visual feature encoding by changing the nature of the neural encoding task at hand. For example, compensatory movements of the eyes, head, or body can stabilize the image on the retina during self-motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angelaki and Hess, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hardcastle and Krapp, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Land, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Walls, 1962</xref>), and saccadic movement dynamics compress the fraction of time during which large self-generated motion signals corrupt retinal input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martinez-Conde et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Van Der Linde et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wurtz, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cruz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geurten et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Collett and Land, 1975b</xref>). In other cases, behavior is shaped by the demands of a specific visual task. For example, dragonflies and other predatory insects often approach prey from below, increasing the likelihood that a target will be seen against a background of the low contrast sky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nordström and O’Carroll, 2009</xref>), and male hoverflies hover in place while monitoring for conspecific territorial trespassers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Collett and Land, 1975a</xref>), ensuring that self-generated motion signals are low during a demanding visual discrimination task.</p><p>Second, neural mechanisms can exploit the fact that self-generated motion produces characteristic sensory inputs. For example, visual surrounds can be tuned to the global motion signals characteristic of self-motion, allowing for self-motion signals to be subtracted from excitatory center signals that code for a feature of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aptekar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baccus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Olveczky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Egelhaaf, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Collett, 1971</xref>). However, in some flying insects, target-detecting neurons are tightly tuned for very small visual targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nordström and O’Carroll, 2006</xref>), even in the context of moving, cluttered backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nordström et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wiederman and O’Carroll, 2011</xref>), suggesting that multiple levels of spatial inhibition can work together to shape feature selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bolzon et al., 2009</xref>), and that robust feature detection need not rely on relative motion cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nordström, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nordström and O’Carroll, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wiederman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The third strategy for reliable vision during self-motion uses signals related to the animals’ motor commands or behavioral states to modulate neural response gain. For example, the motor commands that initiate primate saccades produce efference copy signals that are associated with neural gain changes and a perceptual decrease in sensitivity called saccadic suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Binda and Morrone, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bremmer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wurtz, 2018</xref>). In flies, efference copy signals can cancel expected motion in widefield motion-sensitive neurons during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fenk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), but can also provide independent information about intended movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fujiwara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fujiwara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cruz et al., 2021</xref>). In this way, neural response gain is modulated so that motion-sensitive neurons encode unexpected deviations in motion signals after accounting for behavior.</p><p>Previous studies have each examined these respective strategies in the context of single-cell types. However, how do these varied strategies work together across a population of disparately tuned visual neurons? We explore this issue using populations of visual projection neurons (VPNs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. VPNs are situated at a critical computational and anatomical bottleneck through which highly processed visual information moves from the optic lobes to the central brain. A subset of VPNs, the Lobula Columnar (LC) and Lobula Plate Lobula Columnar (LPLC) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) make up a large fraction of all VPN types, thus accounting for a substantial portion of the visual information available to guide behavior. These cell types encode distinct local visual features with behavioral relevance, including looming objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ache et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klapoetke et al., 2017</xref>) and small moving objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keleş and Frye, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>) (for a recent survey of VPN visual tuning, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klapoetke et al., 2022</xref>), and project to small, distinct regions in the central brain called optic glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Panser et al., 2016</xref>). Previous work has also implicated some types of LCs in figure-ground discrimination, that is, the ability to detect an object moving independently of a global background motion signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aptekar et al., 2015</xref>). Each optic glomerulus receives input from all of the individual cells belonging to a single-cell type, resulting in a functional map in the central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klapoetke et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, both stimulation and silencing experiments argue that at least some VPN classes strongly modulate specific visually guided behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hindmarsh Sten et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tanaka and Clark, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tanaka and Clark, 2022</xref>). Finally, the visual tuning of VPN types is heterogeneous across the population, allowing us to explore how strategies for reliable visual encoding during self-motion vary across differently tuned populations.</p><p>To explore how local visual features are represented across populations of VPNs, we developed a new method to register functional imaging data to the fruit fly connectome, allowing us to measure neural responses across many optic glomeruli simultaneously. We show that this method allowed for reliable and repeatable measurement of VPN responses. This population imaging method allowed us to measure the covariance of optic glomerulus population responses to visual stimuli. This analysis revealed strongly correlated trial-to-trial variability across glomeruli, which improves stimulus encoding fidelity. Importantly, this could not have been inferred from non-simultaneous measurements. We next demonstrate that walking behavior selectively suppressed responses of small object detecting glomeruli, leaving responses to looming objects unchanged. We then focus on body rotations as an example of self-motion that introduces large, uniform displacements in visual input during behavior to show that visual stimuli characteristic of rotational self-motion, including those produced by locomotor saccades, also suppressed VPN responses to small objects. Finally, we show that these two forms of gain control—visual and motor-associated—can be independently recruited and reinforce one another when both are active. Taken together, these results reveal that both visual and motor cues associated with self-motion can tune local feature detecting VPNs, adjusting their sensitivity to match the dynamics of natural walking behavior. This suggests a strategy for resolving the ambiguities associated with detecting external object motion in a scene dominated by self-generated visual motion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visual rotation complicates local feature detection</title><p>To build intuition about how self-generated motion might impact local feature selectivity, we designed a task inspired by VPN selectivity to small, moving objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keleş and Frye, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klapoetke et al., 2022</xref>), and by target discrimination tasks performed by other flying insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Egelhaaf, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nordström and O’Carroll, 2006</xref>). For this analysis, we focused on the impact of rotational self-motion, because it is a prominent component of self-generated optic flow during movement that causes large movement signals that are uniform across the visual field. In this detection task, a 15° dark patch moved on top of a grayscale natural image background, through a receptive field whose size was typical of small object detecting LCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When the natural image background was static, as would be the case if a stationary fly were observing an external moving object in a rich visual environment, detecting the moving patch is trivial given the change in local luminance and/or spatial contrast as the patch traverses the receptive field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). How is this detection task impacted by rotational self-motion? We simulated self-generated rotational motion by moving the background image at a single, constant velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This background motion caused large fluctuations in local luminance and spatial contrast, reflecting the heterogeneous spatial structure of the scene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, red traces). These fluctuations were often larger than the changes induced by the moving patch alone (e.g., compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, with an independently moving patch added to the foreground, the change in local luminance or contrast was negligible for this example image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, blue traces), making discrimination between these two conditions very difficult.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Small spot detection is unreliable during self-generated rotation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating the stimulus and detection task. A small dark spot on top of a grayscale natural image moved through a visual receptive field (white dashed circle). (<bold>B</bold>) When the background image was stationary, small spot detection was trivial using either local luminance (top) or spatial contrast (bottom) cues. Vertical dashed lines indicate the window of time that the spot passes through the receptive field. (<bold>C</bold>) To mimic an object detection task during self-generated rotation, we moved the background image independently of the spot with a variable speed. (<bold>D</bold>) Movement of the background image alone (red trace) caused dramatic fluctuations in luminance and contrast within the receptive field. The addition of the small moving spot (blue trace) caused relatively small changes in the luminance or contrast signal, which depends on the spatial structure of the image.

This metric captures the difference between the mean responses to ‘spot present’ versus ‘spot absent’ normalized by the standard deviation of the response traces (see Materials and methods). d′ reflects the z-scored difference between the responses to these two conditions, meaning that a d′ of 0 corresponds to chance under an ideal observer model. With a static or absent background, the discriminability of the patch is perfect. Across a collection of 20 natural images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">van Hateren and van der Schaaf, 1998</xref>), moving at velocities between 20°/s and 320°/s, small object detection was corrupted even for small amounts of background motion, and discriminability decreased further as background motion increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These observations suggest that as self-motion signals increase, neurons that respond selectively to local features like small moving objects might increase their response thresholds in order to avoid relaying false positive signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A connectome-based alignment method to measure population activity across optic glomeruli</title><p>To efficiently characterize the responses of individual VPNs to many visual stimuli, and to relate the gain of multiple VPNs with one another and to animal behavior, we needed to measure responses across different VPN types simultaneously. Presently, specific driver lines exist to target single VPN types in a single experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), but no approach exists to measure across many VPN types simultaneously.

We imaged the left PVLP/PLP using a two-photon resonant scanning microscope, which allowed for sampling of the volume of interest at ∼7 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, see Materials and methods). As previous work had demonstrated that individual VPN cells respond to visual stimuli with monophasic calcium responses that span several hundred milliseconds (as measured using GCaMP6f <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klapoetke et al., 2022</xref>), this volume rate provides dense temporal sampling of each VPN type.</p><p>Optic glomeruli contain neurites from many neuron types, including the presynaptic terminals of their dominant VPN input, but also postsynaptic targets of those cells as well as other local interneurons. We used a two-pronged approach to bias measured calcium signals toward those selective to presynaptic terminals of VPNs. First, we developed a GCaMP6f variant that preferentially localizes to presynaptic terminals (syt1GCaMP6f). This construct showed much brighter GCaMP6f fluorescence in axon terminals in the optic glomerulus compared to dendrites in the lobula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Second, as almost every LC and LPLC neuron is cholinergic, we specifically targeted cholinergic neurons using a ChAT-T2A knock-in Gal4 driver line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). Using this driver line, we expressed both syt1GCaMP6f as well as myr::tdTomato, a plasma-membrane bound red structural indicator that was used for motion correction and alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To extract glomerulus responses from our in vivo imaging volumes, we used techniques similar to other recent imaging alignment studies in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brezovec et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Turner et al., 2021</xref>). First, we generated a ‘mean brain’ volume by iteratively aligning and averaging a collection of high-resolution, in vivo anatomical scans of the volume of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, n=11 flies). Next, we used the syt1GCaMP6f channel of the mean brain to align to the JRC2018 template brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bogovic et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, we generated a glomerulus map using locations of the presynaptic T-bars belonging to LC and LPLC neurons, which we extracted from the hemibrain connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>), and aligned it to the JRC2018 template brain. Using the mean brain and mean brain-template alignment, we could consistently align individual volumes to the mean brain and to the glomerulus map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). This method, which we refer to as pan-glomerulus imaging, allowed us to assign voxels in a single fly’s in vivo volume to a specific optic glomerulus. In this paper, we focus on 13 glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To test whether pan-glomerulus imaging reliably captured visually driven calcium responses across glomeruli, we presented a suite of synthetic stimuli meant to explore VPN feature detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keleş and Frye, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klapoetke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klapoetke et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Our stimulus suite therefore consisted of small, moving spots, static flicker, looming spots, moving bars, and other stimuli (see Materials and methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows mean glomerulus responses across animals to these stimuli. As expected, the visual tuning measured in one glomerulus in one fly was very similar to tuning seen in corresponding glomeruli measured in other animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). To determine whether our pan-glomerulus imaging method accurately captured the visual tuning of the VPN that provides the major input to that glomerulus, we used cell-type-specific split-Gal4 driver lines for select VPN types (LC18, LC9, and LC4), chosen because together they span the anatomical volume of interest, and presented the same stimulus suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). We then compared these targeted recordings to those previously measured in the corresponding glomeruli, using our population imaging approach. For each of these VPN/glomerulus pairs, the responses and visual tuning looked qualitatively similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

To conveniently organize the results presented in subsequent analyses, we applied a hierarchical clustering approach to identify functional groupings of VPN types based on their responses to our synthetic stimulus suite. Group 1 was characterized by LCs that responded to moving spots 5° in diameter (the smallest stimuli presented here), and showed relatively weak responses to loom and vertical bars. Group 2 contained glomeruli that were not sensitive to very small objects and showed strong loom responses. Group 3 contained glomeruli that were typically only weakly driven by any of these stimuli but responded to looming stimuli. Finally, group 4 glomeruli had large responses to vertical bars and medium and large moving spots as well as some loom sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Population activity is modulated by a dominant gain factor which impacts stimulus coding fidelity</title><p>Previous characterization of VPNs relied on targeting each individual cell class using cell-type-specific driver lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klapoetke et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). This allows for the measurement of neural response mean and variance, but not the covariance among different VPNs, which requires simultaneous measurement. Trial-by-trial covariance can have a dramatic impact on stimulus encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Averbeck and Lee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Romo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zylberberg et al., 2016</xref>), and can shed light on the circuit mechanisms that govern sensory computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ala-Laurila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rabinowitz et al., 2015</xref>). To examine the covariance structure of optic glomerulus responses, we presented a subset of the synthetic stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and collected 30 trials for each stimulus. We observed significant trial-to-trial variability. Indeed, on some presentations of a stimulus which, on average, drives a strong response, many glomeruli failed to respond at all. Moreover, this large modulation in response gain was shared across many glomeruli on a trial-by-trial basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). When we averaged the trial-to-trial correlations across flies, we observed strong, positive pairwise correlations across the glomerulus population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and across stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because we also collected myr::tdTomato fluorescence through the red channel, we could use this structural signal to assess whether the trial covariance we observed in syt1GCaMP6f responses was due to other factors not associated with neural responses, like brain motion that was not removed during motion correction, or other imaging factors. As expected, myr::tdTomato signals showed very little modulation across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, gray traces), and as a result the trial to trial covariance was weaker and showed a qualitatively different structure than the covariance in syt1GCaMP6f signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To explore this issue, we implemented a multinomial logistic regression decoder to predict the identity of a stimulus given single-trial population responses. Since the animal does not have a priori information about when or where a local visual feature might appear, we did not want the model to be able to use different stimulus dynamics to trivially learn the decoding task based on response timing. Therefore, we trained the model using only the peak response amplitude from each glomerulus on each trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and tested the ability of the model to predict stimulus identity on held-out trials. This decoding model performed with an overall accuracy rate of around 40%, on average (compared to a chance performance of 7%), and performance for some stimulus classes was considerably higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). For example, for dark moving spots with diameter 5°, 15°, and 50°, performance was 55%, 67%, and 78%, respectively. For a slowly looming spot, performance was 72%. This high performance was surprising given that the model only had access to scalar response amplitudes on each trial, which themselves displayed high trial-to-trial variability.</p><p>We next asked how a model provided with different subsets of optic glomeruli performed on the decoding task by training the model using only responses from a single functional group (identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As expected, decoding models with access to responses from only a subset of the population performed more poorly than those with access to the full glomerulus population. Strikingly, however, subpopulations of glomeruli were unable to perform as well as the full population even for correctly classifying the stimuli to which they were most strongly tuned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). For example, group 1 contains the glomeruli that showed strong responses to small, 5° spots. Yet a model trained using the responses from that group alone was unable to encode information about this stimulus nearly as well as the full population model. To test whether similar distributed representation exists for a reduced subset of stimuli that are known to be discriminable by flies, we repeated this analysis focusing only on four stimuli that drive distinct visual behaviors: a drifting grating, a 15° spot, a looming spot, and a vertically oriented bar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). As expected because the task is easier, overall decoding performance across the population was higher. As with the larger stimulus set, many stimulus classes could be decoded at above chance level by multiple glomeruli groups, and for some stimuli, like the drifting grating and vertically oriented bar, decoding ability across the population was higher than for any individual group.</p><p>In other sensory systems, positive correlations in neural responses can mitigate the effects of trial-to-trial variability in cases of heterogeneous population tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Averbeck and Lee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Franke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Romo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zylberberg et al., 2016</xref>). This is because, relative to uncorrelated variability, correlated variability can be oriented in a direction in population response space where it does not interfere with stimulus decoding (see Discussion and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pruszynski and Zylberberg, 2019</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the strong trial-to-trial gain correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) were partly responsible for the high decoding performance for some stimuli in spite of the high response variance. To test this, we trained and tested the decoding model using trial-shuffled responses, such that for each glomerulus the mean and variance of each stimulus response were the same, but the trial-to-trial correlations were removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, left). With trial-to-trial correlations removed, the decoding model performed about 35% worse than the model trained on correlated single-trial responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, right). The decrease in performance upon trial shuffling was present across stimuli, indicating that this is a general feature of stimulus encoding for this population, and not specific for selected visual features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). This result highlights the importance of performing simultaneous measurements to characterize population responses: using independent measurements and assuming uncorrelated response variability in this case would suggest a significantly worse single-trial decoding ability than is present in the full population. Taken together, these results show that, rather than a single visual feature being encoded by one or a few VPNs, all visual features are likely represented jointly across the population. Moreover, positive correlations in response variance enhance stimulus decoding relative to uncorrelated variability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Walking behavior selectively suppresses responses of small-object detecting glomeruli</title><p>Because sensory neural activity has been shown to be modulated by behavior in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chiappe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fenk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Strother et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) and other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maimon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>), we wondered whether the trial-to-trial gain changes shown above were related to the behavioral state of the animal. To test this, we measured glomerulus population responses while the animal walked on an air-suspended ball (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>, see Materials and methods). Under this fictive walking paradigm, forward and rotational velocity components of movement were highly correlated. Because of this, we cannot disambiguate between contributions from forward and rotational velocity components in isolation. In sum, the fictive walking data show intermittent bouts of walking activity, and these movement bouts consisted of both forward and rotational velocity components. Because of this, we used total ball rotation as a measure of locomotor activity. To simplify the gain characterization, we showed a repeated probe stimulus on every trial, for 100 trials. First, we showed a 15° dark moving spot, since this stimulus drives strong responses in many glomeruli, including LC11, LC21, LC18, LC6, LC26, LC17, LC12, and LC15. We will refer to these glomeruli as ‘small object detecting glomeruli’, recognizing that they also respond to other stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Examining the single-trial responses to the probe alongside fictive walking behavior revealed a striking relationship: probe stimuli that appeared when the fly was walking drove much weaker responses in some glomeruli than stimuli that appeared while the fly was stationary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). On average, responses of the LC11, LC21, L18, LC12, and LC15 glomeruli showed significant negative correlation with behavior. Conversely, responses of the LC6, LC26, and LC17 glomeruli did not show significant negative correlation with behavior.

This suggests that the trial-to-trial shared gain was associated with the behavioral state of the animal. To test this idea, we examined the subset of flies from the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> where we also collected walking behavior. We found that for each fly, the first principal component of the population response, corresponding to the large shared gain factor, was negatively correlated with walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), with an average rank correlation coefficient of  <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>=–0.23. Thus, the shared gain modulation is associated with walking, but importantly, this relationship is incomplete. This means that one could not infer the population correlation structure seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> by leveraging information about walking behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Visual inputs associated with self-generated rotation modulate glomerulus sensitivity</title><p>Self-generated motion is associated with characteristic visual cues, including wide-field, coherent visual motion on the retina. In the next series of experiments, we set out to test the hypothesis that optic glomerulus gain might be modulated by these visual signatures of self-generated motion. To test whether glomeruli respond to visual cues characteristic of walking, we first created a complex visual stimulus designed to include several features thought to be components of natural visual inputs to walking flies, including objects at different depths (vertically oriented, dark bars), as well as images dominated by low spatial frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To move this scene, we measured fly walking trajectories using a 1 m<sup>2</sup> arena with automated tracking, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">York et al., 2022</xref>), and applied short segments of these walking trajectories to the camera location and heading in our visual environment, creating an open loop ‘play-back’ stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These VR stimuli drove very weak responses across all glomeruli, including the small object detecting glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), despite these glomeruli in the same flies responding very robustly to isolated vertical bars similar to those in the scene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The relatively weak responses of most glomeruli to these play-back stimuli suggested that some features characteristic of visual inputs during walking suppress glomerulus responses via the visual surround of each VPN. To test this idea, we focused on one prominent component of visual inputs during self-motion, namely the coherent visual rotation associated with body turns. We note that although we did not address it here, other components of self-motion, including forward translation, may also play an important role in shaping visual responses. To explore the spatial and temporal frequency tuning of this visual surround, we presented a 15° dark spot, a probe stimulus that many glomeruli respond to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), while drifting a sine wave grating in the background with variable spatial period and speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The LC11 glomerulus, which responds strongly to small moving objects on uniform backgrounds, showed strongly suppressed probe responses to gratings with low spatial frequencies, and across speeds chosen to span the typical range of angular speeds experienced during fly locomotor turning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This suppression by low spatial frequency gratings across a range of rotational speeds was seen for all small object detecting glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Thus, these glomerulus responses are subject to a suppressive surround that is sensitive to low spatial frequencies and to a broad range of retinal speeds.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Visual input associated with rotational motion suppresses optic glomerulus responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Still image from a VR stimulus.

We next designed a stimulus to test this idea. A prominent feature of self-generated visual motion, especially rotational turns, is widefield motion coherence. That is, when an animal turns, all local motion signals across the visual field are aligned along an axis defined by the axis of rotation. From a visual circuit perspective, coherent rotational motion concentrates activity of elementary motion detecting neurons T4/T5 within a single layer of the lobula plate, where as incoherent local motion would spread T4/T5 activity across all layers. To test whether motion coherence impacted surround suppression of optic glomeruli, we designed a stimulus inspired by random dot kinematograms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Britten et al., 1992</xref>). This stimulus was composed of a field of small dots, roughly 15° in size, that moved around the fly at constant speed. Individual spots of this size drive robust responses in most small object detecting glomeruli, and should also recruit elementary motion detectors T4/T5.</p><p>This moving dot field had a tunable degree of coherence, such that at a coherence level of 0, each dot moved at the defined speed, but in a random direction. At a coherence level of 1, every dot moved in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Intermediate coherence values correspond to the fraction of dots moving along the pre-defined ‘signal’ direction. Importantly, this stimulus has the same overall mean intensity, contrast and motion energy for every coherence level. As expected, at 0 coherence, small object detecting glomeruli responded strongly. However, as the motion coherence was increased, responses of many small object detecting glomeruli decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H, I</xref>). Taken together, these results are strong evidence that the suppressive surround of these glomeruli is sensitive to widefield motion cues that are characteristic of self-motion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Natural images recruit surround suppression</title><p>To test whether rotational self-motion cues derived from natural scenes can drive surround suppression in small object detecting glomeruli, we used a moving 15°spot to probe response gain while presenting natural images in the background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">van Hateren and van der Schaaf, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). When presented on top of a stationary image, the probe stimulus elicited a large response in LC11. However, when the probe was presented on top of a rotating natural image, LC11 glomerulus responses were strongly suppressed for rotational speeds spanning the range of locomotor turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), compared to a stationary image background. In agreement with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–J</xref>, this suggests that rotational motion recruits surround suppression. We next explored surround speed tuning across all eight small object detecting glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The LC11, LC21, and LC18 glomeruli showed strong suppression at all non-zero image speeds tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, left). The LC6 and LC26 glomeruli showed a shallower dependence of surround suppression on image speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, center), while the LC17, LC12, and LC15 glomeruli showed intermediate speed dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, right).

To test the effect of spatial frequency content of images on surround suppression, we repeated this experiment with filtered versions of the natural images. For each of three natural images, we presented the original (unfiltered) image, a whitened natural image, which has a roughly flat power spectrum at low spatial frequencies, a high-pass filtered image, and a low-pass filtered image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). For LC11, and all other small object detecting glomeruli, the natural image and its low-pass filtered version strongly suppressed responses to the probe, whereas the whitened and high-pass filtered images recruited much weaker suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). We note that this spatial and temporal frequency tuning of these suppressive surrounds is broadly consistent with the tuning properties of elementary motion detecting neurons T4 and T5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that local motion detectors provide critical input to the visual surrounds of small object detecting glomeruli. Moreover, the observation that surround speed tuning was similar for glomeruli that clustered together using the synthetic stimulus suite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) suggests that this functional clustering may reflect properties of the surround. More broadly, the differential speed sensitivities of these surrounds may further diversify feature selectivity across these groups of glomeruli in the context of natural visual inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Behaviorally and visually driven suppression independently modulate small object detectors</title><p>The results presented thus far show that the gain of small object detecting glomeruli was tuned by both locomotor behavior and widefield visual motion. Both of these cues are associated with self-generated movements of the animal. How can the fly reliably track external objects during self-motion if small-object detecting glomeruli are suppressed by visual and behavioral cues? We hypothesized that the answer might lie in the temporal dynamics of locomotor behavior. Natural fly walking behavior is saccadic, interspersing fast turns with periods of relatively straight walking bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cruz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geurten et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juusola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reynolds and Frye, 2007</xref>). We hypothesized that the saccadic structure of walking ensures that glomerulus gain is suppressed only transiently during a saccade, and once the saccade is over, visual response gain is restored to sample external objects.</p><p>To test this idea, we first examined the temporal dynamics of locomotor turns under conditions where animal movement is unconstrained. To do this, we examined walking trajectories from our open behavioral arena (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">York et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Walking trajectories in an open arena showed a wide range of angular speeds and forward velocities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Examining the angular velocity of a single walking trajectory revealed saccadic temporal dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Across all flies, the time between saccades (the ‘inter-turn interval’) showed a wide range, but there were few inter-turn intervals less than ∼0.5 s, a peak near 1 s, and a long tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We chose a threshold angular speed to classify saccadic turns, here 160°/s, but inter-turn interval distributions were similar across a range of threshold values that include the vast majority of turns. For all saccade thresholds, there was a low probability of a saccade within ∼0.5 s of the previous saccade. We next split up snippets of walking velocity trajectories based on whether they occurred within a 400 ms window around a saccade or during an intersaccade interval. As expected, angular speeds experienced during a saccade were large, and during intersaccade intervals, most angular speeds were very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, top). Interestingly, distributions of forward velocities were not different during a saccade compared to the intersaccade interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, bottom), meaning that saccades tend to occur while the fly is moving forward as well. Taken together, this means that a typical locomotor saccade is followed by at least a 500 ms, and often a ∼1-s period of relative heading stability.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Natural fly walking is punctuated by saccadic turns.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example unconstrained fly walking trajectory measured in an open behavioral arena.

We designed a stimulus meant to mimic the retinal input during a locomotor saccade. As before, we presented a probe stimulus on every trial to measure the response gain of small object detecting glomeruli. In the background was a grayscale natural image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), which underwent a lateral rotation of 70° in 200 ms at a variable time relative to the glomerular response to the probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). As a result, the saccade signal could precede, co-occur with, or lag the glomerulus response to the probe. When the saccade occurred within ∼500 ms of the probe response, the probe response was attenuated, suggesting that this saccade stimulus recruits the motion-sensitive suppressive surround. Across many small object detecting glomeruli, including LC11, LC21, LC17, LC12, and LC15, we saw strong gain suppression when the saccade occurred around the time of the probe response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and D</xref>). Interestingly, the other glomeruli, LC18, LC6, and LC26 showed much weaker and more variable saccade suppression, maintaining their response gain regardless of saccade timing. Note that because we presented only one saccade on each probe trial, and because we are quantifying gain using the response amplitude, the timing dependence measured here is independent of calcium indicator dynamics and therefore reflects dynamics associated with the glomerulus response. The timescale of this surround suppression, combined with the temporal dynamics of fly turning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) suggests that visually driven saccade suppression transiently reduces glomerulus response gain around the time of a locomotor saccade, but gain recovers while the fly’s heading is stable and before the next saccade occurs. We infer that this dynamic gain adjustment allows the fly to sample the scene during the inter-saccadic periods of heading stability.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Visually driven saccade suppression works in concert with behavioral suppression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stimulus schematic: A small moving probe is used to measure glomerulus response gain while a full-field natural image in the background undergoes a fast, ballistic lateral displacement meant to mimic fly walking saccades.

(<bold>H</bold>) For each small object detecting glomerulus, we compared the response gain when both visual-related and motor-related gain modulation were recruited (vertical axis) to the product of both response gains in isolation (horizontal axis).

One way to interpret these data is that motor signals suppress small object detecting glomeruli, and that widefield, coherent visual motion induces a turning response, recruiting the same motor-command derived suppression. Is the apparent visual suppression a result of the motor feedback, or are the visual-based and motor-based suppression mechanisms independent? To test this idea, we monitored walking behavior while presenting saccadic visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). We first examined the LC11 glomerulus response to the probe under both behavioral conditions (walking versus stationary), and under both visual conditions (saccade coincident with the probe response, vs. no saccade coincident with the probe response). Strikingly, when the fly was stationary, visual saccades still reduced the gain of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Interestingly, the glomeruli that were subject to stronger gain reductions by the visual saccade also showed stronger gain reductions by walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>, r=0.80). Finally, to test whether these two gain modulation mechanisms were independent, we compared the measured probe responses when the fly was receiving both saccadic visual input and was walking to the product of each gain change measured independently (i.e., when the fly was receiving either saccadic visual input or was walking, but not both) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref>). Across the small object detecting glomeruli, the prediction that these two gain mechanisms were independent accurately captured the jointly measured gain modulation. Taken together, these data indicate that visual suppression is not the indirect effect of an induced turning response and that saccadic visual modulation and behavior-related modulation are both balanced in magnitude and independent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that local feature detection is challenged by rotational self-motion signals in rich visual environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To determine how feature detecting neurons might maintain selectivity under natural viewing conditions, we first developed a new connectome-based method to segment functional imaging signals that allowed us to measure neural responses across a heterogeneous population of VPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Using this method, we found that information about different visual features is distributed across multiple VPN types, meaning that stimulus identity cannot be decoded from a single glomerulus alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Further, we found that strong trial-to-trial response correlations improve stimulus encoding fidelity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Strikingly, the locomotor behavior of the fly selectively modulated responses of small object detecting, but not loom detecting, glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We then showed that visual motion signals characteristic of walking also modulated the responses of glomeruli tuned to small objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Finally, we demonstrated that visual suppression occurs during naturalistic body saccades made by walking flies, and that behavioral and visual gain modulation are both balanced in magnitude and independent, such that these two cues combine linearly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Taken together, these two forms of gain control reduce the sensitivity of small object detectors to inputs that can diminish the discriminability of local features, thereby allowing for reliable feature detection during saccadic vision.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Population coding of local visual features</title><p>Our characterization of the optic glomeruli using solitary visual features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) largely agrees with what has been described previously, in that many glomeruli respond strongly to small moving objects, others respond to visual loom, and responses to stationary flicker or widefield motion are weak or nonexistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hindmarsh Sten et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keleş and Frye, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keleş et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klapoetke et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Städele et al., 2020</xref>). These data have been used as evidence that particular VPNs are linked to specific visual features and corresponding visually guided behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hindmarsh Sten et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>). At the same time, the responses of individual VPN classes overlap, in the sense that an individual visual stimulus will evoke responses from many VPN classes, suggesting a dense population code. We note, however, that how downstream circuits make use of the information available across VPNs to guide behavior is not well understood, and further work incorporating connectomics, targeted perturbations of VPN channels, and behavioral analyses might shed light on this question. For example, a recent study used genetic silencing, coupled with a goal-oriented neural network model, to show that VPNs jointly encode behaviorally relevant visual features during <italic>Drosophila</italic> courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cowley et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To what extent is it possible to decode stimulus identity based on the activity of a single VPN class? Our results show that population measurements are important to describe feature encoding by VPNs for two reasons. First, evaluation of stimulus decoding revealed that most visual features are encoded jointly across the population, not by single VPN types. This is because information about stimulus identity is contained not only in the responses of glomeruli that are strongly tuned to a particular feature but also in the weaker responses of glomeruli that have different tuning properties. Second, while responses in each VPN type showed high trial-to-trial variability, simultaneous measurements revealed that this variability was strongly correlated across the population, and that this improved coding fidelity across the population relative to uncorrelated variability. This is consistent with past experimental and theoretical work showing that positive correlations can help offset the deleterious effect of response variability by shaping the noise in directions in population response space that do not interfere with stimulus decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Franke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zylberberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pruszynski and Zylberberg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Averbeck and Lee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>). A similar structure of neural variability relative to population tuning permits accurate stimulus decoding in the face of large movement-related signals in mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rumyantsev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>). This effect relies on heterogeneous tuning across the population of neurons, and downstream decoders can extract information about the stimulus by comparing activation across differently tuned neurons. Indeed, in the case of a population of identically tuned neurons, positive noise correlations degrade rather than improve coding fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zohary et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The trial-to-trial variability we observed among VPNs was dominated by a single, shared population response gain that was associated with walking behavior, but only weakly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, this shared gain is likely modulated by other factors, for example, shared upstream noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ala-Laurila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zylberberg et al., 2016</xref>) or other behavioral or physiological states that we did not measure. How downstream circuits combine signals across glomeruli may provide insight into how the brain decodes VPN population responses to encode local features, and available connectomic data sets can accelerate progress on this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klapoetke et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Natural locomotor behavior modulates the sensitivity of small object detectors</title><p>Behavior-associated gain changes are widespread in visual systems across phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maimon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maimon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McAdams and Maunsell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McBride et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>). Recent work demonstrates that locomotor signals are prevalent throughout the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, including in the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aimon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brezovec et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schaffer et al., 2021</xref>), but has been examined most extensively in circuits involved in elementary motion detection and widefield motion encoding. Behavioral activity has been shown to modulate response gain in widefield motion detecting lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs) and some of their upstream circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chiappe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kohn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maimon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Strother et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Suver et al., 2012</xref>), and LPTC membrane potential tightly tracks walking behavior, even in the absence of visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fujiwara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fujiwara et al., 2022</xref>). During flight, efference-copy based modulation of LPTC membrane potential has been proposed to cancel expected visual motion due to self-generated turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fenk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). In each of these cases, behavioral signals adjust response gain according to expected visual inputs, for example faster rotational speeds during flight. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2015</xref> showed that flying saccades were associated with hyperpolarization of optic glomeruli interneurons, which the authors speculated could be useful for canceling spurious small object detector responses during self-motion, much like what we see in VPNs during walking behavior. The behavioral gain modulation we describe here selectively adjusts visual sensitivities to reflect the fact that specific visual inputs are particularly corrupted by self-motion. Small object detection is an especially challenging task during self-motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and consequently, gain modulation most strongly affects glomeruli involved in this task. Glomeruli that are tuned more strongly to looming visual objects were not modulated by walking behavior, suggesting that these larger visual features can be reliably extracted under walking conditions. During a high-velocity locomotor saccade, sensitivity to small objects is transiently decreased, and in the subsequent inter-saccade interval, small object detector gain is restored, allowing for selective encoding of visual features at different points in the locomotor cycle.</p><p>Interestingly, our estimates of visual gain suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) combined with the statistics of free walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), suggest that some small object detecting glomeruli may experience visual suppression due to the smaller rotational motion present during intersaccadic periods, as well. For example, LC11, LC21, and LC18 showed strong visual suppression even for image rotations of only 40°/s, which can be achieved in the time between saccades. This suggests that these cells operate best as small feature detectors during periods of high heading stability, which may be achieved during some periods of straight, forward walking or while the fly is stationary. We have chosen to focus on visual inputs during rotation because these movements cause rapid, uniform shifts in visual inputs, but we note that the more complex widefield motion inputs that are associated with forward translation, which produces nonuniform flow fields across the retina, likely also impact local visual feature encoding.</p><p>Importantly, our experiments measuring fictive walking on an air-suspended ball (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) are not able to decouple forward from rotational components of velocity, because these velocity components are highly correlated. During free walking, saccades nearly always co-occur with forward movement, making disambiguation of these walking components difficult even under natural conditions. However, free-walking flies do perform forward walking bouts without much rotational velocity component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Further work to recapitulate natural walking statistics under conditions of head fixation would help elucidate the relative contributions of specific locomotor components to motor-related visual gain control.</p><p>Is the behavioral modulation of small object detecting glomeruli related to the well studied modulation of widefield motion detecting circuits? A parsimonious explanation of both of these observations is that neurons in the elementary and widefield motion pathways feed into the suppressive surround of small object detecting glomeruli, as is the case for figure detecting neurons in blowfly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Egelhaaf, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Warzecha et al., 1993</xref>). This would endow optic glomerulus surrounds with both the widefield, coherent motion sensitivity as well as the behavioral modulation that we see. In support of this proposed mechanism, the glomeruli that show strong visual suppression are also subject to strong behavioral suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This hypothesis further predicts that glomeruli which derive their excitatory center inputs from elementary motion detectors (e.g., the loom-selective LPLC2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klapoetke et al., 2017</xref>) might be positively gain modulated under other behavioral conditions, such as flight. Taken together, these results demonstrate that understanding local feature detection during natural vision requires accounting for the structure of locomotion. More broadly, we have shown that walking behavior modulates a subset of glomeruli, raising the possibility that different behavioral states might selectively alter other glomeruli subsets, reshaping population coding of visual features to subserve different goals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Motor signals and visual cues provide independent inputs to feature detectors</title><p>In addition to the motor-related gain modulation, small object detecting glomeruli are modulated by a visual surround that is tuned to widefield, coherent visual motion that would normally be associated with locomotion. This is similar to motion-tuned surrounds in object motion-sensitive cells in the vertebrate retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baccus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Olveczky et al., 2003</xref>), and in figure detecting neurons of the blowfly, which are suppressed by optic flow produced by self-motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Egelhaaf, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kimmerle and Egelhaaf, 2000</xref>). Why would the fly visual system rely on these two seemingly redundant cues to estimate self-motion? One possibility is that either cue alone could be unreliable or ambiguous under some conditions. For example, a striking characteristic of natural scenes is their immense variability from scene to scene. As a result, detecting small moving objects could occur against a background of a dense, contrast-rich visual environment like a forest or a uniform, low-contrast background like a cloudy sky. These two scenes would be expected to be associated with very different wide-field motion signals, even given the same self-motion. Because of this, relying on visual cues alone for evidence of self-motion will be unreliable under the diversity of natural scenes. Thus, motor signals and visual cues characteristic of self-motion work together to provide a robust estimate of self-motion to feature detectors.</p><p>Our observation that small object detecting glomeruli are modulated by a visual surround tuned to widefield motion agrees with previous observations that flies use global motion as well as local figure information to support object tracking behavior during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aptekar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aptekar et al., 2015</xref>), where rotational velocities are much greater in magnitude than those associated with locomotor turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fry et al., 2003</xref>). How strategies for reliable object tracking during walking relate to flying conditions is not clear, and more work is needed to understand how small object detectors can support object tracking under these drastically different visual conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Saccade suppression as a general visual strategy</title><p>Visual motion is a prominent feature of realistic retinal inputs for both flies and vertebrates. Primates make frequent eye movements at different spatial scales during free viewing which can rapidly translate the image on the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rucci and Victor, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Van Der Linde et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zuber et al., 1965</xref>). Eye movements in primates are dominated by saccades, large movements that can shift the image on the retina by up to tens of degrees of visual angle. Walking flies perform locomotor saccades, which similarly rapidly shift the image impinging on the retina in a short time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cruz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geurten et al., 2014</xref>). We found that the responses of some small object detecting glomeruli were suppressed around the time of a simulated visual saccade, while others (LC18, LC6, and LC26) showed no visual saccade suppression. Similarly, saccades in primates induce variable changes in response gain across different brain regions, a physiological effect thought to underlie the perceptual phenomenon of saccadic suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Binda and Morrone, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bremmer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wurtz, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thiele et al., 2002</xref>). Our data show that in flies, a similar form of saccade-related suppression can be recruited selectively to circuit elements whose feature selectivity is most sensitive to the corrupting effect of self-motion on the visual input. More broadly, this work suggests that a saccade-and-sample visual strategy is shared between flies and primates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>Data collected for this study can be found on Dryad at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h44j0zpp8">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h44j0zpp8</ext-link>.

Flies were cold anesthetized and mounted in a custom-cut hole in an aluminum shim at the bottom of an imaging chamber before being immobilized with UV curing glue. The front left leg was removed to prevent occluding the left eye, and the proboscis was immobilized using a small drop of UV curing glue. The cuticle covering the left half of the posterior head capsule was removed using a fine dissection needle, and fat bodies and trachea covering the brain were removed. The prep was continuously perfused with room temperature, carbogen-bubbled fly saline throughout the experiment. We imaged the left optic glomeruli in each fly.</p><p>For in vivo imaging, we used a two-photon resonant scanning microscope (Bruker) with a 20× 1.0 NA objective (Leica) and a fast piezo-driven Z drive to control the focal plane during volumetric imaging. Two-photon laser wavelength was 920 nm and post-objective power was ∼15 mW. We collected red and green channel fluorescence to image myr::tdTomato and syt1GCaMP6f, respectively. For functional scans, to record GCaMP responses, we collected volumes with voxel resolution 1×1×4 µm<sup>3</sup> (x, y, z) at a sampling frequency of 7.22 Hz. For high-resolution anatomical scans, voxels were 0.5×0.5×1 µm<sup>3</sup>. The imaging volume for glomerulus imaging was 177×101×45 µm<sup>3</sup>. Each fly was typically imaged for approximately 30–45 min. For Split-Gal4 imaging, we used the same imaging parameters that we did for the pan-glomerulus imaging experiments.

The screens subtended approximately 60° in elevation and 140° in azimuth.

Each stimulus presentation period was 3 s long, and was preceded and followed by 1.5 s of pre- and tail time with a mean gray background. Note that we also presented uniform flashes of ±100% contrast, but these stimuli did not drive responses in any glomerulus so we have excluded these stimuli from this paper.

First, each volumetric image series, including both functional and anatomical scans, was motion corrected using the myr::tdTomato signal. We then created a ‘mean brain’ using high-resolution anatomical scans from 11 different animals, which we aligned to one another using the myr::tdTomato channel, and averaged iteratively until a clean, crisp mean brain of the PVLP/PLP was produced. The syt1GCaMP6f channel of the mean brain was then used to register the mean brain to a hand-cropped subregion of the JRC2018 template brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bogovic et al., 2020</xref>).

This yielded masks for each glomerulus in our in vivo mean brain space. Finally, each fly’s functional image was registered to that fly’s own high-resolution anatomical scan, and this anatomical scan was aligned to the mean brain. We could then bring each glomerulus mask into the functional image space of each individual fly. These masks were used to collect voxels corresponding to each distinct glomerulus, and the included voxel signals were averaged over space to yield the glomerulus response.

For the decoding model, responses for each glomerulus were z-scored to standardize the mean and variance across glomeruli. To train the model, we used 90% of trials, and the remaining 10% of trials were used to test performance. We iterated training/testing 100 times and we present averages across all iterations. For the trial shuffling analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we shuffled response amplitudes across trials of the same stimulus identity independently for each glomerulus, such that the stimulus-dependent means and variances of responses were the same, but the covariance structure was removed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of behavior data</title><p>To measure fictive walking behavior from video recordings of flies on an air-suspended ball, we used FicTrac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 2014</xref>) to process videos post hoc.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Claude Desplan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Terufumi Fujiwara (Reviewer #1); Cristopher M Niell (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers appreciate the quality of the work presented in this interesting manuscript. The combination of neural imaging, visual stimulus manipulations, and behavioral analysis elegantly demonstrates that two different mechanisms, one based on motor signals and the other based on visual input, serve to suppress local features during movements that would corrupt these features. In spite of the high quality of the work, the reviewers raised several technical concerns that should be addressed prior to the publication of the manuscript. It is very likely that most of these points can be resolved through the analysis of existing data and/or appropriate editing of the main text. The reviewers agree that the addition of new experimental data can be minimized.</p><p>1) You should rule out that the correlated gain modulation observed in Figure 4 (and subsequent) is not due to motion artifacts or other factors that might vary during imaging. This control could be achieved by showing/analyzing red channel traces that you might already have. Alternatively, you could add a few caveats in the discussion about whether other factors might influence correlations across the population of VPNs.</p><p>2) In Figure 5, could the walking behavior be decomposed into forward and angular velocity components? This would strengthen the association between visual signals and specific behaviors. Through this analysis, it would be important to clarify the scope of &quot;self-motion&quot; by defining whether the visual inputs associated with rotations and forward movements are processed in the same way. Could the angular velocity range be computed during inter-saccade intervals of free-moving behavior to estimate the corresponding visual responses?</p><p>3) We encourage you to split the data in Figure 3D based on walking versus stationary states to demonstrate that the VPNs projecting to LC18 show the modulation seen in Figure 5C. This result would mitigate the possibility that the modulation by self-motion results from other inputs into the glomeruli that weren't completely eliminated by the genetic manipulations.</p><p>4) If possible, please complement the data presented in Figure 6 with a comparison of the activity observed upon rotational motion and stationary gratings.</p><p>5) Please motivate the idea that stimulus identity is encoded at the level of population activity and that positive correlations enhance stimulus decoding. The enhancement in stimulus decoding appears counter-intuitive. Related to this point, it would be helpful to improve the representation of the trial-to-trial correlations in a stimulus-dependent manner.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 4</p><p>Even though the analysis looks quite reasonable, I have difficulty understanding how exactly the trial-to-trial activity correlation among glomeruli improves decoding visual feature identity. If the trial-to-trial correlation is totally random across identical visual stimulations, it will not provide extra information on visual feature identity. Therefore, the trial-to-trial correlation needs to be organized such that the shared activity (amplitude) is somehow specific to each visual feature stimulus. For example, the shared activity amplitude is always around 0.8 for looming and always 0.3 for single stripe, etc. Then, isn't such consistent activity already reflected in the total activity at each glomerulus? Alternatively, one possibility I could imagine is like following:</p><p>The activity of glomerulus A to looming: total activity = 1 (glomerulus-specific activity=0.2 + shared activity=0.8).</p><p>The activity of glomerulus A to single stripe: total activity = 1 (glomerulus-specific activity=0.7 + shared activity=0.3).</p><p>In this case, we cannot decode if the visual stimulus was looming or a single stripe from the total activity of glomerulus A, but we can decode if the total activity is divided into glomerulus-specific + shared activities. Is this the correct direction to interpret the result? Anyway, I wonder if the authors could provide a bit more intuitive explanation of how the shared activity contributes to the decoding.</p><p>Figure 8</p><p>Authors elegantly demonstrated that responses to local visual features are largely suppressed during visual and body saccades. On the other hand, it is not clear yet if the responses are not disturbed by suppression during inter saccade intervals or when the fly wants to process it. I wonder if the authors could estimate the angular velocity range during inter saccade interval from free moving behavior and estimate how many visual responses can be maintained in that range.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the study was well-designed and the data was presented clearly.</p><p>1. The authors make a compelling argument that they have restricted the glomerular signals to the PN terminals, and Fig 3 verifies that they match up in terms of mean response. However, it seems possible that some of the modulations by self-motion could represent either pre-synaptic modulation, or other inputs into the glomeruli that weren't completely eliminated with their genetic approach. Splitting the data in Fig 3D based on walking vs stationary and demonstrating that the VPNs projecting to LC18 also show the modulation seen in 5C would be a good way to confirm this.</p><p>2. The data in Fig 6A-G compellingly demonstrates that low SF stimuli suppress the response, but it's not clear that it is the rotational motion that is important since there is no comparison to stationary gratings. If that data is available (as it is for Fig 7) it would be very helpful, otherwise, it might be best to clarify that this data supports low SF stimuli suppressing, and the rotational effect is only shown later. On a related point, it is a little surprising that the coherent dots suppress the response since I would expect these to be more like the high SF / whitened stimuli of Fig 7.</p><p>3. The fact that visual stimuli can be decoded from the population in the presence of modulation by movement signals is quite similar to the findings of Stringer et al 2021 and Rumyantsev et al 2020, so it might be worth noting these.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) My first concern is about whether any of the correlated gain modulations the authors observe could be due to motion artifacts or other factors that might vary during imaging but might not reflect actual neural signal intensity variations. This is a particular concern in Figure 4 where such shared variability is first introduced. Ideally, the authors would show imaging of the red channel from the same trials showing that this is not modulated by the shared gain factor. At the very least the authors should mention possible confounds that could give rise to this variability and discuss measures taken to rule these out.</p><p>2) Although the manuscript is framed in terms of &quot;self-motion,&quot; most of the analysis and experiments focus on fast rotational motion evoked by body saccades. For example, the analysis in Figure 1 deals only with rotational motion, as do the visual suppression experiments in Figures 6 and 7. However, Figure 5 shows suppression driven by walking (not necessarily turning) and it is not clear from the figure if these represent rotations or forward movements. Therefore, it is not clear if the two inputs discussed are &quot;working together&quot; as suggested in the Discussion, or cover different types of input (during forward motion versus turns).</p><p>Although this does not detract from the interest of the work, it is confusing, as self-motion also includes large translational components which are not discussed (much) here and as saccadic suppression of visual signals has been discussed elsewhere. The authors should clarify in the Abstract and Introduction that their focus will be on rotational motion related to body saccades, and should address the differences between these types of motion in the Discussion.</p><p>3) The authors perform a decoding analysis of stimulus identity to argue that stimulus identity is encoded at the level of population activity and that positive correlations enhance stimulus decoding. This seems strange to me because classical studies of correlations in visual encoding (e.g. Shadlen Newsome) emphasized the way that correlated variability <italic>reduces</italic> the encoding capacity of a network. The emphasis on encoding stimulus identity within the particular stimulus set presented also seemed strange to me because it is not clear that the fly needs to discriminate between each of these stimuli in order to make appropriate behavioral responses. For example, flies are known to respond differently to vertical stripes versus short spots, however, it is not clear if they care about the difference between spots of slightly different sizes, or between spots moving on a gray versus grating background. Presumably, psychophysics experiments combined with connectomics can help determine which combinations of glomerular responses are actually used by the fly to shape its behavior. At any rate, I find that the conclusions about how VPNs encode visual features (e.g. Discussion line 439) rest on an assumption about what the fly is trying to do with these stimuli that may not be accurate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82587.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) You should rule out that the correlated gain modulation observed in Figure 4 (and subsequent) is not due to motion artifacts or other factors that might vary during imaging.

We have added example single trial red channel (myr::tdTomato) traces to Figure 4A, underneath the corresponding example syt1GCaMP6f traces. These structural signals show very little modulation from trial to trial relative to visually driven responses in GCaMP. We have also added a new Figure 4 —figure supplement 2 showing the trial covariance matrix for both red and green channel signals, showing much lower covariances in red channel signals compared to green channel signals, and a qualitatively different covariance structure. We address this concern and the results of these control analyses in the main text, beginning at line 231. To specifically look for an impact of animal movement on motion artifacts, we examined the correlation between red channel traces and animal walking behavior, and found no significant correlation for any glomerulus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82587-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 5, could the walking behavior be decomposed into forward and angular velocity components? This would strengthen the association between visual signals and specific behaviors. Through this analysis, it would be important to clarify the scope of &quot;self-motion&quot; by defining whether the visual inputs associated with rotations and forward movements are processed in the same way.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent question, and it has prompted us to substantially expand our analysis of free walking behavior. We have moved these data to a main figure (new Figure 8) to give them the focus they deserve. During free walking behavior, saccadic turns nearly always occur while the animal is also running forward, and forward velocities during a saccade are often no different than during an intersaccadic interval (Figure 8E). Because of this, periods of high rotational velocity cannot be isolated from forward velocity in freely moving animals. On the other hand, free walking flies do run forward without much rotational velocity, creating straight runs, but such runs are generally not seen in our fictive walking on the ball data, where movement bouts are interspersed with stationary periods. In our experience, these periods of “rest” are relatively common when flies are tethered. Because of this, we cannot decompose fictive rotational from translational velocity components in any way that allows us to associate response gain changes with one or the other component in isolation. What the ball locomotion measurements do provide is a measure of when the fly is standing still and when it is engaged in a movement bout, which consists of both rotational and forward translational components. We have updated the text to reflect the fact that in Figure 5 we cannot disambiguate between these two specific types of movement (line 297), and we later use free walking statistics in the new Figure 8 to better motivate the focus on the rotational components of saccades. We also modified the discussion (line 595) to note the inability to disambiguate forward from rotational velocity using fictive ball walking data, as well as the idea that these locomotor components are not fully separable even under natural walking conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the angular velocity range be computed during inter-saccade intervals of free-moving behavior to estimate the corresponding visual responses?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question, and one that we have explored extensively in response. We will address it first as it relates to the visual gain suppression, and then as it relates to the motor-related suppression. As noted above, because of differences in walking behavior between free walking and fictive ball walking it is difficult to make a direct comparison, but two pieces of evidence shed light on how much suppression would be expected to be associated with intersaccadic walking. First, our new Figure 8 now shows forward and rotational velocities conditioned on saccadic vs. intersaccadic interval. During intersaccadic periods, rotational velocities are typically small (&lt;40 deg/sec), but they do occasionally extend into quite fast rotations (long tail of gray distribution in Figure 8E). Comparing this to the image-driven suppression we measured in Figure 7, it indicates that some glomeruli (LC11, 21, and 18) could experience visual suppression during intersaccadic intervals, whereas other glomeruli (LC6 and 26) would be relatively unaffected by the typical intersaccadic run. We now note this interesting difference in the discussion (line 584).</p><p>To address the motor-related gain control component of this question, we added a new Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 showing the relationship between population response gain and walking amplitude, which shows minimal gain suppression up until ~10 deg/sec walking amplitude, and strong gain suppression being reached by ~40 deg/sec. Again, because of the differences between free walking and fictive ball walking it’s difficult to make absolute comparisons of these numbers to rotational velocities seen during free walking, but it does</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) We encourage you to split the data in Figure 3D based on walking versus stationary states to demonstrate that the VPNs projecting to LC18 show the modulation seen in Figure 5C. This result would mitigate the possibility that the modulation by self-motion results from other inputs into the glomeruli that weren't completely eliminated by the genetic manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>While we don’t have behavioral tracking data for an LC18-specific driver line, we do have such data using a split-Gal4 driver line for LC11, which also showed behavioral modulation in our pan-glomerulus imaging experiments. We have added these data to the new Figure 5 —figure supplement 2, and address this important control in the main text (line 316). This genetically targeted approach recapitulated what we saw using the population imaging approach, giving us confidence that the behavioral modulation we saw came from VPNs, not some other, unidentified, ChAT-positive cell types that have neurites in the glomerulus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If possible, please complement the data presented in Figure 6 with a comparison of the activity observed upon rotational motion and stationary gratings.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have data for probe responses on top of stationary gratings, but as reviewer 2 notes, the distinction between rotating and stationary backgrounds is made in Figure 7 using natural images. We have updated the text to reflect the fact that the gratings experiments alone are not evidence that the surround is selective for rotational motion (lines 368, 358). We also clarify how the experiments using natural images in Figure 7 and the coherent dots stimulus was designed to test for selectivity for coherent, rotational motion (lines 372, 396).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please motivate the idea that stimulus identity is encoded at the level of population activity and that positive correlations enhance stimulus decoding. The enhancement in stimulus decoding appears counter-intuitive. Related to this point, it would be helpful to improve the representation of the trial-to-trial correlations in a stimulus-dependent manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion about the decoding effect of positive correlations. The original manuscript did not do a good job explaining what is known about the effect of positive correlations in heterogeneously tuned populations and how this is related to what we see in VPNs. We have modified the text to highlight two key aspects of how this works: First, we have better highlighted that correlations improve decoding ability given a set amount of total variance. The overall variability itself is not helpful, only its correlation structure relative to a null model with no correlations (see paragraph starting at line 273). Second, previous work (e.g. that of Zohary, Shadlen and Newsome) that shows a deleterious effect of positive noise correlations is based on a homogeneously tuned population of neurons that use averaging across many cells to estimate the stimulus. In the case of heterogeneously tuned populations, like VPNs, correlations can “shape” noise along directions in population response space such that it does not interfere with estimates of the stimulus. This relies on a decoding strategy that is different from arithmetic averaging, for example a decoder that can compare differences or relative activations of differently tuned populations (see updated text at line 539). We have also added some more references to theoretical results in the literature on this topic, as our decoding results are in line with this past work and we think what we are seeing is the result of these previously-described impacts of noise correlations.</p><p>Related to this issue, and in response to feedback from reviewer 3, we have also added a new Figure 4 —figure supplement 3 showing decoding model performance on a discrimination task using only four visual stimulus classes that are known from previous behavioral work to elicit distinct visual behaviors (grating, spot, loom and vertical bar). That is, these are stimulus classes that the fly certainly can distinguish. Similar to the main figure, this new analysis also shows that most glomerulus groups encode information about most stimuli, and that for at least some stimuli, the population contains significantly more information than a single group alone. This is in line with our conclusion that VPNs encode most visual features in a distributed fashion, rather than single glomeruli being responsible for encoding single visual features.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 4</p><p>Even though the analysis looks quite reasonable, I have difficulty understanding how exactly the trial-to-trial activity correlation among glomeruli improves decoding visual feature identity.

Anyway, I wonder if the authors could provide a bit more intuitive explanation of how the shared activity contributes to the decoding.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising this point of confusion, which is the result of our poor explanation in the original manuscript. We have updated the text to better explain how positively correlated response variability can improve stimulus decoding relative to uncorrelated variability. See response to essential revision (5) above and updated text around lines 273 and 539.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 8</p><p>Authors elegantly demonstrated that responses to local visual features are largely suppressed during visual and body saccades. On the other hand, it is not clear yet if the responses are not disturbed by suppression during inter saccade intervals or when the fly wants to process it. I wonder if the authors could estimate the angular velocity range during inter saccade interval from free moving behavior and estimate how many visual responses can be maintained in that range.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. See response to major revision (2) above. We now address this point in the updated discussion (line 584) and with a new Figure 5 —figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the study was well-designed and the data was presented clearly.</p><p>1. The authors make a compelling argument that they have restricted the glomerular signals to the PN terminals, and Fig 3 verifies that they match up in terms of mean response. However, it seems possible that some of the modulations by self-motion could represent either pre-synaptic modulation, or other inputs into the glomeruli that weren't completely eliminated with their genetic approach. Splitting the data in Fig 3D based on walking vs stationary and demonstrating that the VPNs projecting to LC18 also show the modulation seen in 5C would be a good way to confirm this.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion and an important control. We did not collect behavioral tracking data during the split-Gal4 experiments in Fig. 3, but we do have behavioral tracking data using an LC11 split-Gal4 driver line, which shows a very similar behavioral modulation as we saw in the pan-glomerulus imaging approach. As noted above, we have added these new data to the new Figure 5 – supplement 2. As LC11 and LC18 both show strong behavioral modulation, we hope that these data address the main thrust of this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The data in Fig 6A-G compellingly demonstrates that low SF stimuli suppress the response, but it's not clear that it is the rotational motion that is important since there is no comparison to stationary gratings. If that data is available (as it is for Fig 7) it would be very helpful, otherwise, it might be best to clarify that this data supports low SF stimuli suppressing, and the rotational effect is only shown later. On a related point, it is a little surprising that the coherent dots suppress the response since I would expect these to be more like the high SF / whitened stimuli of Fig 7.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you - we were not clear on this in the original text. We have updated the text to clarify that the gratings experiments do not demonstrate a selectivity for rotational motion (line 368), they only characterize the spatial frequency and speed tuning of the surround (line 358). As you say, this point is made using coherent dots stimuli in Fig. 6 and natural images in Fig. 7 (updated text around line 390).</p><p>With regards to the suppression by coherent dots, it’s hard to make a direct comparison to gratings or filtered natural images, but it is important to note that the high spatial frequency gratings that fail to recruit strong surround suppression are composed of bars that are 2.5-5 degrees, whereas the individual dots that make up the coherent dots stimulus are close to 15 degrees. This is consistent with what we would expect to drive elementary motion detecting neurons T4/T5 given the spatial frequency tuning of those cells: 2.5-5 degree bars elicit weak T4/T5 responses, whereas a 15 degree spot will nearly fill the center of a T4/T5 receptive field. We have updated the text introducing this experiment (lines 372 &amp; 378) to clarify the logic behind the experiment and more explicitly lay out that this stimulus was designed to recruit different subpopulations of T4/T5, and that we have some idea of what stimuli should drive T4/T5 from previous work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The fact that visual stimuli can be decoded from the population in the presence of modulation by movement signals is quite similar to the findings of Stringer et al 2021 and Rumyantsev et al 2020, so it might be worth noting these.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks - we have added this to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) My first concern is about whether any of the correlated gain modulations the authors observe could be due to motion artifacts or other factors that might vary during imaging but might not reflect actual neural signal intensity variations. This is a particular concern in Figure 4 where such shared variability is first introduced. Ideally, the authors would show imaging of the red channel from the same trials showing that this is not modulated by the shared gain factor. At the very least the authors should mention possible confounds that could give rise to this variability and discuss measures taken to rule these out.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important concern. We have added traces from the red channel for the same trials shown in Figure 4A and added Figure 4 —figure supplement 2 which shows the covariance matrices for the green and red channels. The covariance in the red signal is across the board weaker than what is seen in the green channel, and its structure across the population looks different than the shared gain revealed by covariance analysis of GCaMP signals, indicating that the apparent shared gain is the result of visually driven responses, not motion correction errors or other imaging factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although the manuscript is framed in terms of &quot;self-motion,&quot; most of the analysis and experiments focus on fast rotational motion evoked by body saccades. For example, the analysis in Figure 1 deals only with rotational motion, as do the visual suppression experiments in Figures 6 and 7. However, Figure 5 shows suppression driven by walking (not necessarily turning) and it is not clear from the figure if these represent rotations or forward movements. Therefore, it is not clear if the two inputs discussed are &quot;working together&quot; as suggested in the Discussion, or cover different types of input (during forward motion versus turns).</p><p>Although this does not detract from the interest of the work, it is confusing, as self-motion also includes large translational components which are not discussed (much) here and as saccadic suppression of visual signals has been discussed elsewhere. The authors should clarify in the Abstract and Introduction that their focus will be on rotational motion related to body saccades, and should address the differences between these types of motion in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. We have clarified in the abstract, introduction (line 100), results (lines 115, 355, 372, 390), figure legend titles and subsection headings that our focus is on rotational visual motion specifically. We also discuss this choice and the differences between rotational and translational motion in the discussion (line 590). Finally, we have also modified the text to reflect the fact that forward and rotational components of self motion cannot be completely dissociated in natural walking or in our fictive walking data (see response to major revision (2) above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors perform a decoding analysis of stimulus identity to argue that stimulus identity is encoded at the level of population activity and that positive correlations enhance stimulus decoding. This seems strange to me because classical studies of correlations in visual encoding (e.g. Shadlen Newsome) emphasized the way that correlated variability reduces the encoding capacity of a network. The emphasis on encoding stimulus identity within the particular stimulus set presented also seemed strange to me because it is not clear that the fly needs to discriminate between each of these stimuli in order to make appropriate behavioral responses. For example, flies are known to respond differently to vertical stripes versus short spots, however, it is not clear if they care about the difference between spots of slightly different sizes, or between spots moving on a gray versus grating background. Presumably, psychophysics experiments combined with connectomics can help determine which combinations of glomerular responses are actually used by the fly to shape its behavior. At any rate, I find that the conclusions about how VPNs encode visual features (e.g. Discussion line 439) rest on an assumption about what the fly is trying to do with these stimuli that may not be accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for poorly explaining the effect of positive noise correlations in heterogeneous populations. See response to essential revision (5) above. Of particular note, we highlight that the information limiting correlations explored by Zohary, Shadlen and Newsom are in the case of a homogeneously tuned population, and as you say positive correlations in such a population limit the accuracy with which the population average response can be estimated, thereby interfering with stimulus decoding. Our decoding model, however, can compare activations across differently tuned populations, thereby taking advantage of the fact that in a heterogeneously tuned population, correlations can shape noise in response space so as to not limit the information available about the stimulus. We have improved the explanation for this result and its relation to currently existing theoretical work on this topic (see lines 273 and 539).</p><p>Regarding the second point, we have added a new Figure 4 —figure supplement 3 showing decoding for a reduced subset of stimuli that are known to be discriminable from past behavioral work. We agree that we should have acknowledged how assessing the information available within a neural population is only part of the story, and that understanding how this information is used to guide behavior is critical. We have updated the text to reflect this fact (line 524, discussion).</p></body></sub-article></article>
