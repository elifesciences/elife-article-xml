Initiation and attenuation of the response are mediated by stress-dependent regulation of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> encodes a single HSF (Hsf1), facilitating the analysis of HSR regulation. Hsf1 is repressed by Hsp70 chaperones under non-stress conditions and becomes activated under proteotoxic stress, directly linking protein damage and its repair to the HSR. J-domain proteins (JDPs) are essential for targeting of Hsp70s to their substrates, yet the specific JDP(s) regulating Hsf1 and connecting protein damage to HSR activation remain unclear. Here, we show that the yeast nuclear JDP Apj1 primarily controls the attenuation phase of the HSR by promoting Hsf1’s displacement from heat shock elements in target DNA. In <italic>apj1Δ</italic> cells, HSR attenuation is significantly impaired. Additionally, yeast cells lacking both Apj1 and the major JDP Ydj1 exhibit increased HSR activation even in non-stress conditions, indicating their distinct regulatory roles. Apj1’s role in both nuclear protein quality control and Hsf1 regulation underscores its role in directly linking nuclear proteostasis to HSR regulation. Together, these findings establish the nucleus as key stress-sensing signaling hub.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heat shock response</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>Hsf1</kwd><kwd>J-protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BU617/21-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bukau</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/018mejw64</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MO970/9-1, project ID 541596792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mogk</surname><given-names>Axel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BR 6283/5-1, project ID 529716110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>den Brave</surname><given-names>Fabian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM138988</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gross</surname><given-names>David S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KR 3593/6-1, project ID 541620165</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>Günter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The nuclear J-domain protein Apj1 controls the shut-off phase of the yeast heat shock response by displacing DNA-bound heat shock transcription factor Hsf1.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cellular protein quality control (PQC) system employs various strategies, including protein folding, degradation, sequestration, and disaggregation, which are primarily executed by molecular chaperones and components of the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy systems. To maintain proteostasis even under proteotoxic stress, cells must enhance PQC capacity by increasing the expression of its components in a cell compartment-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pincus, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shpilka and Haynes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). For the cytosolic and nuclear PQC system, expression is principally regulated by the evolutionarily conserved heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kmiecik and Mayer, 2022</xref>). Aging can reduce Hsf1 activity, and by extension the PQC capacity, which in humans is linked to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, high HSF1 activity can promote the proliferation and spread of certain forms of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pessa et al., 2024</xref>). Understanding HSF1 activity is therefore critical for therapeutic strategies.</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Hsf1 drives the transcription of genes encoding PQC components during proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pincus, 2020</xref>), controlling the expression of 46 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>). Hsf1 becomes activated upon heat shock and binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the upstream activating regions of heat shock genes to initiate a transient response, which later is downregulated in a negative feedback loop. Hsf1 is essential for yeast growth, maintaining basal levels of Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones that support protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Solís et al., 2016</xref>). However, overactivation can impair growth of yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Halladay and Craig, 1995</xref>), which underscores the biological importance of a tunable Hsf1 activity.</p><p>Hsp70 chaperones are central to regulating Hsf1 activity across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kmiecik and Mayer, 2022</xref>). Hsf1’s activity is furthermore modulated by phosphorylation, allowing it to integrate signals from diverse pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Hsf1 phosphorylation increases during heat shock but is not essential for its basal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Hsp70 binds and represses Hsf1 activity, keeping it inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peffer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, Hsf1 is more active in yeast lacking the two major Hsp70 proteins Ssa1 and Ssa2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Halladay and Craig, 1995</xref>). Hsp70 influences both the initiation and attenuation phases of the heat shock response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garde et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>) through a titratable repressor function, allowing regulation based on misfolded protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pincus, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Hsp70 chaperones rely on J-domain proteins (JDPs) to bind specific substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rosenzweig et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruger-Herreros et al., 2024</xref>). JDPs preselect substrates and transfer them to Hsp70, facilitating ATP hydrolysis-driven trapping in its binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rosenzweig et al., 2019</xref>). In yeast, the nuclear-cytosolic JDP, Sis1, targets Hsf1 to Ssa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masser et al., 2019</xref>) and plays a dual role in PQC and Hsf1 regulation, linking protein damage accumulation and heat shock response (HSR) activation. Sis1 relocalizes to PQC foci on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nucleus during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feder et al., 2021</xref>) and binds misfolded proteins at nuclear inclusions (INQ) via interaction with the nuclear sequestrase Btn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ho et al., 2019</xref>). It also binds orphan ribosomal proteins (oRPs) in the nucleolus under stress, preventing the formation of solid aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2023</xref>). As Sis1 targets diverse PQC sites, its substrate pool changes, reducing its ability to repress Hsf1, thereby triggering Hsf1 activation and initiation of the HSR. Accordingly, impairing ribosome biogenesis activates Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tye et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, Sis1 depletion or a full gene deletion (viable upon overexpression of Tti1) induces only a partial HSR, while deletion of <italic>SSA1</italic> and <italic>SSA2</italic> fully activates Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schilke and Craig, 2022</xref>), suggesting other JDPs are involved. Additionally, Sis1 is dispensable for the HSR attenuation phase, which depends on Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garde et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>), indicating the role of an unidentified JDP co-chaperone.</p><p>Here, we aimed to identify the JDP that represses Hsf1 during the attenuation phase. We focused on the nuclear JDP Apj1, which increases during heat shock and targets proteins deposited at INQ for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">den Brave et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sahi et al., 2013</xref>). Its nuclear localization and PQC function make Apj1 an attractive candidate for linking the status of nuclear PQC to Hsf1 activity control. We show that Apj1 represses Hsf1 activity during the attenuation phase by promoting Hsf1 displacement from HSEs. Its role is further highlighted by the full heat shock response observed in cells lacking Apj1 and Ydj1, the major class A JDP of yeast, under non-stress conditions. The dual role of Apj1 in nuclear PQC and HSR regulation indicates that the nucleus is key to linking proteostasis with Hsf1 regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Apj1 represses Hsf1 activity during the attenuation phase of the heat shock response</title><p>To study the role of yeast JDPs in regulating Hsf1 activity, we focused on Apj1 due to its nuclear localization and involvement in nuclear PQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">den Brave et al., 2020</xref>). Apj1, a class A JDP, originated from the major JDP Ydj1 through gene duplication and diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sahi et al., 2013</xref>). To explore Apj1’s role in HSR regulation, we monitored the expression of the nuclear sequestrase Btn2 in wild-type (wt) and <italic>apj1Δ</italic> cells during heat shock (30–38°C), as Btn2 expression strictly depends on Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Solís et al., 2016</xref>). Btn2 only transiently accumulates during heat shock owing to its rapid turnover by proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malinovska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2015b</xref>). The decline of Btn2 levels at later timepoints of heat shock thus reports on the attenuation of the stress response. We observed a strong but transient increase in Btn2 levels in heat-shocked (from 30°C to 38°C) wt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), while Btn2 levels remained high for up to 120 min post temperature upshift in <italic>apj1Δ</italic> cells. To investigate whether the persistent accumulation of Btn2 in <italic>apj1Δ</italic> cells results from stabilization of Btn2, we added cycloheximide (CHX) 10 min post heat shock to inhibit protein synthesis. Here, Btn2 levels rapidly vanished in wt and <italic>apj1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that the high Btn2 levels in <italic>apj1Δ</italic> cells rely on ongoing transcription and translation. Similar results were obtained with a GFP reporter gene placed under control of the <italic>BTN2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The GFP reporter protein was made unstable by fusion to the N-terminal domain of Btn2. <italic>apj1Δ</italic> but not wt cells showed persistent GFP accumulation that was dependent on continuous protein synthesis as it was no longer observed after CHX addition. These findings indicate a role of Apj1 in the attenuation of the heat shock response.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Attenuation of the Hsf1-mediated heat shock response is defective in <italic>S.</italic> <italic>cerevisiae apj1Δ</italic> cells.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> wt and <italic>apj1Δ</italic> cells were grown at 30°C till logarithmic growth phase and shifted to 38°C.

In wt cells, Sis1-GFP displayed diffuse fluorescence before heat shock and formed nuclear foci afterward, indicating Sis1-GFP recruitment to deposition sites of misfolded proteins (e.g., INQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ho et al., 2019</xref>) and orphan ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This pattern is similar in <italic>apj1Δ</italic> cells, though more cells showed nuclear Sis1-GFP foci post-heat shock (53.7 vs 21% in <italic>apj1Δ and wt</italic> cells after 15 min, respectively, and 59.2 vs 30.7 after 60 min). In contrast, <italic>ydj1Δ</italic> cells showed multiple cytosolic and nuclear Sis1-GFP foci before heat shock (28.8% of cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This number further increased upon heat shock and after 60 min massive cytosolic Sis1-GFP foci were noticed in 60.5% of <italic>ydj1Δ</italic> cells. This indicates severe proteostasis defects in <italic>ydj1Δ</italic> cells that agrees with the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype. An abnormal Sis1-GFP localization pattern was no longer observed in <italic>apj1Δ ydj1Δ</italic> cells and only nuclear Sis1-GFP foci were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Notably, nuclear Sis1-GFP foci were already noticed prior to heat shock in 42.3% of <italic>apj1Δ ydj1Δ</italic> cells. This can be explained by (i) increased expression levels of the nuclear sequestrase Btn2 due to Hsf1 activation and (ii) absence of Apj1 increasing formation and stability of INQ. We also considered the possibility that formation of nuclear Sis1-GFP foci prior to heat shock in <italic>apj1Δ ydj1Δ</italic> cells liberates Hsf1, activating the HSR. However, the massive proteostasis defects of <italic>ydj1Δ</italic> cells and the resulting Sis1-GFP foci formation did not trigger Hsf1 activation. This argues against PQC defects as being the major reason triggering Hsf1 activation in <italic>apj1Δ ydj1Δ</italic> cells. It instead suggests that the growth deficiency of <italic>ydj1Δ</italic> cells arises primarily from Hsf1 repression via Apj1, limiting their PQC capacity adjustment.</p><p>We finally tested whether overproduction of plasmid-encoded Sis1 from the strong TDH3 promoter can restore Hsf1 activity control in <italic>apj1Δ ydj1-4xcga</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C/D</xref>). Strongly elevated Sis1 levels only partially reduced Btn2 levels while the high Hsp42 levels remained unaffected, indicating that Sis1 overproduction cannot efficiently repress Hsf1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We consider the possibility that a fraction of cells did not express SIS1 from the pRS315-based plasmid, which might lead to an underestimation of the effect. However, we also show that the increased Sis1 levels in <italic>apj1Δ ydj1-4xcga</italic> control cells harboring an empty vector are still insufficient to reduce Hsf1 activity, underlining that Sis1 cannot replace Apj1 and Ydj1 function in regulating Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Apj1 functions by mediating the displacement of DNA-bound Hsf1 from HSEs, a role that is specific for Apj1 and cannot be replaced by other JDPs. Our findings suggest that different JDPs have specific roles in regulating distinct phases of the HSR: one set of JDPs maintains Hsf1 in a repressed state in non-stressed cells, while Apj1 represses Hsf1 following stress activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Supporting this model, Sis1 has been implicated in repressing Hsf1 prior to stress but does not participate in HSR attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garde et al., 2023</xref>). In agreement, we observed partial derepression of Hsf1 upon Sis1 depletion, but no major effect on Hsf1 inactivation during the attenuation phase. That said, the impact of Sis1 depletion on the expression of Hsf1 targets in non-stressed cells is variable, ranging from minor (e.g. <italic>BTN2</italic>) to moderate (e.g., <italic>HSP104</italic>) derepression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Differences in the number and spacing of HSEs within the UAS regions of the respective target genes are not obvious, and Hsf1 occupancies post-heat shock are comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>). The molecular basis for the target-specific effects thus remains unclear.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Regulation of Hsf1 activity via diverse J-domain proteins (JDPs).</title><p>Hsp70 is targeted to Hsf1 in non-stressed cells by diverse J-domain proteins, including Ydj1, Sis1, and Apj1, to repress heat shock gene expression.

Unexpectedly, however, this is not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>), indicating the involvement of additional JDPs in Hsf1 control under non-stress conditions. Our finding that simultaneous loss of Ydj1 and Apj1 resulted in almost full activation of Hsf1-target gene expression positions Yd1j as a central JDP that represses Hsf1 in non-stressed cells. How can JDPs specifically control different phases of the HSR? We speculate that this is due to distinct conformational states of free and HSE-bound Hsf1. Binding to HSEs may expose sites in Hsf1 specific for Apj1 targeting, while Sis1 and Ydj1 may target free Hsf1 conformations. Notably, two Hsp70 binding sites have been identified in Hsf1. The sites are located in the N- and C-terminal transactivation domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peffer et al., 2019</xref>) and deletion of both sites leads to full Hsf1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chowdhary et al., 2022</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the diverse JDPs specifically target Hsp70 to either N- or C-terminal binding sites.</p><p>Apj1 is present at low abundance (1000 copies/cell) in non-stressed cells compared to Sis1 and Ydj1 (28.000 and 50.000 copies/cell, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho et al., 2018</xref>). In accordance, our translatome analysis shows 22- and 46-fold higher translation of mRNA encoding SIS1 and YDJ1 as compared to APJ1 at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Immediately after heat shock, the counts for all three mRNAs increase strongly, by 32-, 16-, and 4-fold for APJ1, SIS1, and YDJ1, respectively, underscoring all JDPs’ roles in stress protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The low copy number of Apj1 may prevent excessive Hsf1 inactivation, maintaining basal activity crucial for adequate levels of essential chaperones like Hsp70 and Hsp90. Additionally, lower Apj1 levels may sensitize Hsf1 regulation in response to protein damage by allowing efficient depletion of Apj1 during the early phase of heat shock. Apj1 is involved in nuclear PQC, targeting misfolded and aggregated proteins for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">den Brave et al., 2020</xref>). This function allows Apj1 to directly link the nuclear PQC status to Hsf1 activity regulation. The repair or removal of non-native proteins in the nucleus will free Apj1 to initiate the attenuation phase by targeting HSE-bound Hsf1. Consistent with this model, Apj1 binding to HSEs is delayed compared to Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D/E</xref>).</p><p>Both phases of the heat stress response, initiation and attenuation, are likely regulated by the titration of JDP cochaperones and their Hsp70 partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is remarkable that the initiation phase integrates protein misfolding information, for example, from newly synthesized proteins in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tye and Churchman, 2021</xref>) and orphan ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feder et al., 2021</xref>), while the attenuation phase incorporates information on the general nuclear PQC status. A recent study demonstrated that disrupted protein repair in the cytosol (by mutating HSF1 target genes) delays HSR attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garde et al., 2024</xref>), which aligns with our model, as impaired cytosolic damage repair in those mutants could deplete nuclear Hsp70 resources needed for Hsf1 repression during attenuation. Additionally, misfolded proteins can be targeted to the nucleus for PQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prasad et al., 2010</xref>), which may also sensitize Hsf1 activity to accumulating protein damage. Apj1 also interacts with non-imported mitochondrial precursors (mitoPREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">den Brave et al., 2020</xref>), which can be rerouted to the nucleus when mitochondrial import is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shakya et al., 2021</xref>). The accumulation of mitoPREs triggers a specific stress response involving Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boos et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that Apj1 could act as a mediator, sensing mitoPRE presence and adjusting Hsf1 activity based on the status of mitochondrial import.</p><p>In summary, our study enhances the understanding of Hsf1 activity regulation by an array of JDPs and identifies Apj1 as an attenuation phase-specific regulator of the HSR. Future investigations should focus on the features of Apj1 that underlie its regulatory function. Although a direct homolog of Apj1 is absent in humans, the human class B JDP DnaJB1 can displace Hsf1 from HSEs in concert with Hsp70 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kmiecik et al., 2020</xref>), hinting at a conserved function of JDPs in Hsf1 repression during the attenuation phase, albeit executed by different family members. Whether human class A JDPs can mimic Apj1’s function in regulating Hsf1, and how diverse human JDPs cooperate to regulate the HSR needs to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, growth conditions, and spot tests</title><p>All yeast strains used in this study are derived from BY4741 and W303 and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

The authors integrate genetic, transcriptomic (ribosome profiling), biochemical (ChIP, Western), and imaging data to dissect how Apj1, Ydj1 and Sis1 modulate Hsf1 activity under stress and non-stress conditions. The work proposes a model where Apj1 specifically promotes displacement of Hsf1 from DNA-bound heat shock elements, linking nuclear PQC to transcriptional control.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the work is highly novel-this is the first detailed functional dissection of Apj1 in Hsf1 attenuation. It fills an important gap in our understanding of how Hsf1 activity is fine-tuned after stress induction, with implications for broader eukaryotic systems. I really appreciate the use of innovative techniques including ribosome profiling and time-resolved localization of proteins (and tagged loci) to probe Hsf1 mechanism. The overall proposed mechanism is compelling and clear-the discussion proposes a phased control model for Hsf1 by distinct JDPs, with Apj1 acting post-activation, while Sis1 and Ydj1 suppress basal activity.</p><p>The manuscript is well-written and will be exciting for the proteostasis field and beyond.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The authors have addressed all my concerns,</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107157.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, the work is exceptionally well done and controlled and the results properly and appropriately interpreted. While several of the approaches, while powerful, are somewhat indirect (i.e., following gene expression via ribosomal profiling) additional experiments utilizing traditional gene expression assays added in revision combine to ultimately provide a compelling answer to the main questions being asked.</p><p>The key finding from this work is the discovery that Apj1 regulates Hsf1 attenuation in a manner that includes Hsp70. That finding is strongly supported by the experimental data. While it would be ideal to also demonstrate Apj1-controlled differential binding of Ssa1/2 to Hsf1 at either the N- or C-terminal binding sites during attenuation, the Hsp70-Hsf1 interactions are difficult to reproducibly assess in cell extracts and are likely beyond the scope of this study. However, this work paves the way in the future for potential biochemical reconstitution assays that could elucidate both Hsp70-Hsf1 interactions as well as the distinct JDP-Hsf1 interactions reported here.</p><p>This discovery raises additional new questions about JDP specificity in HSR regulation and the role of JDPs in navigating protein aggregation and sensing of proteostatic challenge in the nucleus, thus advancing the field and opening new, exciting avenues for exploration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107157.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The heat shock response (HSR) is an inducible transcriptional program that has provided paradigmatic insight into how stress cues feed information into the control of gene expression. The recent elucidation that the chaperone Hsp70 controls the DNA binding activity of the central HSR transcription factor Hsf1 by direct binding has spurred the question how such a general chaperone obtains specificity. This study has addressed the next logical question, how J-domain proteins execute this task in budding yeast, the leading cell model for studying the HSR. While an involvement and in part overlapping function of general class A and B J-domain proteins, Ydj1 and Sis1 are indicated by the genetic analysis a highly specific role for the class A Apj1 in displacing Hsf1 from the promoters is found unveiling specificity in the system.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The central strong point of the paper is the identification of class A J-domain protein Apj1 as a specific regulator of the attenuation of the HSR by removing Hsf1 from HSEs at the promoters. The genetic evidence and the ChIP data strongly support this claim. This identification of a specific role for a lowly expressed nuclear J-domain protein changes how the wiring of the HSR should be viewed. It also raises important questions regarding the model of chaperone titration, the concept that a chaperone with limiting availability is involved in a thug of war involving competing interactions with misfolded protein substrates and regulatory interactions with Hsf1. Perhaps Apj1 with its low levels and interactions with misfolded and aggregated proteins in the nucleus is the titrated Hsp70 (co)chaperone that determines the extent of the HSR? This would mean that Apj1 is at the nexus of the chaperone titration mechanism. Although Apj1 is not a highly conserved J domain protein among eukaryotes the strength of the study is that is provides a conceptual framework for what may be required for chaperone titration in other eukaryotes: One or more nuclear J-domain proteins with low nuclear levels that has an affinity for Hsf1 and that can become limiting due to interactions with misfolded Hsp70 proteins. The provides a pathway for how these may be identified using for example ChIP-seq.</p><p>Weakness</p><p>A built-in challenge when studying the mechanism of the HSR is the general role of Hsp70 chaperone system and its J domain proteins. Indeed, a weakness of the study is that it is unclear what of the phenotypic effects have to do with directly recruiting Hsp70 to Hsf1 dependent on a J domain protein and what instead is an indirect effect of protein misfolding caused by the mutation. This interpretation problem is clearly and appropriately dealt with in the manuscript text and in experiments but is of such fundamental nature that it cannot easily be fully ruled out.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107157.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her very positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her positive evaluation. We plan to add RNAseq data of yeast wild-type and JDP mutant strains as more direct readout for the role of Apj1 in controlling Hsf1 activity. We agree with the reviewer that our study includes one major finding: the central role of Apj1 in controlling the attenuation phase of the heat shock response. In accordance with the reviewer we consider this finding highly relevant and interesting for a broad readership. We agree that additional studies are now necessary to mechanistically dissect how the diverse JDPs support Hsp70 in controlling Hsf1 activity. We believe that such analysis should be part of an independent study but we will indicate this aspect as part of an outlook in the discussion section of a revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her suggestions. We agree that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish direct effects of JDP mutants on heat shock regulation from indirect ones, which can result from the accumulation of misfolded proteins that titrate Hsp70 capacity. We also agree that an in vitro reconstitution of Hsf1 displacement from DNA by Apj1/Hsp70 will be important, also to dissect Apj1 function mechanistically. We will add this point as outlook to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Can the authors submit the raw translatome data to a standard repository? Also, the data should be summarized in a supplemental Excel table.</p></disp-quote><p>We submitted the raw translatome data to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and added the analyzed data sets (shown in Figures 1 and 5) as Supplementary Tables S4/S5 (excel sheets). We additionally included RNAseq analysis of yeast WT and JDP mutants set grown at 25°C, complementing and confirming our former translatome analysis (new Figure 5, Figure Supplement 2). Respective transcriptome raw data were also deposited at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and analyzed data are available as Supplementary Table S7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) MW indicators need to be added to the Western Blot figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We added molecular weight markers to the Western Blot figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Can the authors please include the sequences of the primers used in all the RT-qPCR experiments? They mention they are in the supplemental information, but I couldn't locate them.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the sequences of the RT-qPCR primers as Supplementary Table S4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Given the clear mechanism proposed, it would be nice if the authors could provide a nice summary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the suggestion of the reviewer and illustrate our main finding as new Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) As mentioned above, a co-IP experiment between Hsf1 and Ssa1/2 in APJ1 and apj1∆ cells, utilizing Hsf1 alleles with and without the two known binding sites, would cement the assignment of Apj1 in the Hsf1 regulatory circuit.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that Hsf1-Ssa1/2 pulldown experiments, as done by Pincus and colleagues (1), will further specify the role of Apj1 in targeting Hsp70 to Hsf1 during the attenuation phase of the heat shock response. We have tried extensively such pulldown experiments to document dissociation of Ssa1/2 from Hsf1 upon heat shock in yeast wild-type cells. While we could specifically detect Ssa1/2 upon Hsf-HA1 pulldown, our results after heat shock were highly variable and inconclusive and did not allow us to probe for a role of Apj1 or the two known Ssa1/2 binding sites in the phase-specific targeting. We now discuss the potential roles of the two distinct Ssa1/2 binding sites for phase-specific regulation of Hsf1 activity in the revised manuscript (page 12, lanes 17-21).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Experiments in Figure 3 nicely localize CHIP reactions with known HSEs. A final confirmatory experiment utilizing a mutated HSE (another classic experiment in the field) would cement this finding and validate the motif and reporter-based analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this meaningful suggestions. We have done something like this by using the non-Hsf1 regulated gene BUD3, which lacks HSEs, as reference. We engineered a counterpart, termed “BUD3 HS-UAS”, which bears inserted HSEs, derived from the native UAS of HSP82, within the BUD3 UAS. We show that BUD3<sup>+</sup> lacking HSEs is not occupied by Hsf1 and Apj1 under either non-stress or heat shock conditions while BUD3-HSE is clearly occupied under both, paralleling Hsf1 and Apj1 occupancy of HSP82 (Figure 3E). We have renamed the engineered allele to “BUD3-HSE” to clarify the experimental design and output.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Page 8 - the ydj1-4xcga allele is introduced without explaining why it's needed, since ydj1∆ cells are viable. The authors should acknowledge the latter fact, then justify why the RQC depletion approach is preferred. Especially since the ydj1∆ mutant appears in Figure 5B.</p></disp-quote><p>ydj1∆ cells are viable, yet they grow extremely slowly at 25°C and hardly at 30°C, making them difficult to handle. The RQC-mediated depletion of Ydj1 in ydj1-4xcga cells allows for solid growth at 30°C, facilitating strain handling and analysis of Ydj1 function. Importantly, ydj1-4xcga cells are still temperature-sensitive and exhibit the same deregulation of the heat shock response upon combination with apj1D as observed for ydj1∆ cells. Thus ydj1 knockout and knockdown cells do not differ in the relevant phenotypes reported here and we performed most of the analysis with ydj1-4xcga cells due to their growth advantage. We added a respective explanation to the text (page 8, lanes 13-14) .</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors raise the possibility that Sis1, Apj1, and Ydj1 may all be competing for access to Ssa1/2 at different phases of the HSR, and that access may be dictated by conformational changes in Hsf1. Given that there are at least two known Hsp70 binding sites that have negative regulatory activity in Hsf1, the possibility that domain-specific association governs the different roles should be considered. It is also unclear how the JDPs are associating with Hsf1 differentially if all binding is through Ssa1/2.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and will add the possibility of specific roles of the identified Hsp70 binding sites in regulating Hsf1 activity at the different phases of the heat shock response to the discussion section. Binding of Ssa1/2 to substrates (including Hsf1) is dependent on J-domain proteins (JDPs), which differ in substrate specificity. It is tempting to speculate that the distinct JDPs recognize different sites in Hsf1 and are responsible for mediating the specific binding of Ssa1/2 to either N- or C-terminal sites in Hsf1. Thus, the specific binding of a JDP to Hsf1 might dictate the binding to Ssa1/2 to either binding site. We discuss this aspect in the revised manuscript (page 12, lanes 17-21).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 6 - temperature sensitivity of hsf1 and ydj1 mutants has been linked to defects in the cell wall integrity pathway rather than general proteostasis collapse. This is easily tested via plating on osmotically supportive media (i.e., 1M sorbitol) and should be done throughout Figure 6 to properly interpret the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data indicate proteostasis breakdown in ydj1 cells by showing strongly altered localization of Sis1-GFP, pointing to massive protein aggregation (Figure 6 – Figure Supplement 1D).</p><p>We followed the suggestion of the reviewer and performed spot tests in presence of 1 M sorbitol (see figure below). The presence of sorbitol is improving growth of ydj1-4xcga mutant cells at increased temperatures, in agreement with the remark of the reviewer. We, however, do not think that growth rescue by sorbitol is pointing to specific defects of the ydj1 mutant in cell wall integrity. Sorbitol functions as a chemical chaperone and has been shown to have protective effects on cellular proteostasis and to rescue phenotypes of diverse point mutants in yeast cells by facilitating folding of the respective mutant proteins and suppressing their aggregation (2-4). Thus sorbitol can broadly restore proteostasis, which can also explain its effects on growth of ydj1 mutants at increased temperatures. Therefore the readout of the spot test with sorbitol is not unambiguous and we therefore prefer not showing it in the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Serial dilutions of indicated yeast strains were spotted on YPD plates without and with 1 M sorbitol and incubated at indicated temperatures for 2 days.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-107157-sa4-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Line 154: Can the authors, by analysis, offer an explanation for why HSR attenuation varies between genes for the sis1-4xcga strain? Is it, for example, a consequence of that a hypomorph and not a knock is used, a mRNA turnover issue, or that Hsf1 has different affinities for the HSEs in the promoters?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the sis1-4xcga knock-down strain because Sis1 is essential for yeast viability. The point raised by the reviewer is highly valid and we extensively thought about the diverse consequences of Sis1 depletion on levels of e.g. translated BTN2 (minor impact) and HSP104 (strong impact) mRNA. We meanwhile performed transcriptome analysis and confirmed the specific impact of Sis1 depletion on HSP104 mRNA levels, while BTN2 mRNA levels remained much less affected (new Figure 5 - Figure Supplement 2A/B). We compared numbers and spacings of HSEs in the respective target genes but could not identify obvious differences. Hsf1 occupancy within the UAS region of both BTN2 and HSP104 is very comparable at three different time points of a 39°C heat shock: 0, 5 and 120 min, arguing against different Hsf1 affinities to the respective HSEs (5). The molecular basis for the target-specific derepression upon Sis1 depletion thus remains to be explored. We added a respective comment to the revised version of the manuscript (page 12, lanes 3-8) .</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 194: The analysis of ChIP-seq is not very elaborated in its presentation. How specific is this interaction? Can it be ruled out by analysis that it is simply the highly expressed genes after the HS that lead to Apj1 appearing there? More generally: Can the data in the main figure be presented to give a more unbiased genome-wide view of the results?</p></disp-quote><p>We overall observed a low number of Apj1 binding events in the UAS of genes. The interaction of Apj1 with HSEs is specific as we do not observe Apj1 binding to the UAS of well-expressed non-heat shock genes. Similarly, Apj1 does not bind to ARS504 (Figure S3 – Figure Supplement 1). We extended the description of our ChIP-seq analysis procedures leading to the identification of HSEs as Apj1 target sites to make it easier to understand the data analysis. We additionally re-analysed the two Apj1 binding peaks that did not reveal an HSE in our original analysis. Using a modified setting we can identify a slightly degenerated HSE in the promoter region of the two genes (TMA10, RIE1) and changed Figure 3C accordingly. Notably, TMA10 is a known target gene of Hsf1. The expanded analysis is further documenting the specificity of the Apj1 binding peaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 215. Figure 3. The clear anticorrelation is puzzling. Presumably, Apj1 binds Hsf1 as a substrate, and then a straight correlation is expected: When Hsf1 substrate levels decrease at the promoters, also Apj1 signal is predicted to decrease. What explanations could there be for this? Is it, for example, that Hsf1 is not always available as a substrate on every promoter, or is Apj1 tied up elsewhere in the cell/nucleus early after HS?</p></disp-quote><p>We propose that Apj1 binds HSE-bound Hsf1 only after clearance of nuclear inclusions, which form upon heat stress. Apj1 thereby couples the restoration of nuclear proteostasis to the attenuation of the heat shock response. This explains the delayed binding of Apj1 to HSEs (via Hsf1), while Hsf1 shows highest binding upon activation of the heat shock response (early timepoints). Notably, the binding efficiency of Hsf1 and Apj1 (% input) largely differ, as we determine strong binding of Hsf1 five min post heat shock (30-40% of input), whereas maximal 3-4% of the input is pulled down with Apj1 (60 min post heat shock) (Figure 3D). Even at this late timepoint 10-20% of the input is pulled down with Hsf1. The diverse kinetics and pulldown efficiencies suggest that Apj1 displaces Hsf1 from HSEs and accordingly Hsf1 stays bound to HSEs in apj1D cells (Figure 4). This activity of Apj1 explains the anti-correlation: increased targeting of Apj1 to HSE-bound Hsf1 will lower the absolute levels of HSE-bound Hsf1. What we observe in the ChIP experiment at the individual timepoints is a snapshot of this reaction. Accordingly, at the last timepoint (120 min after heat shock) analyzed, we observe low binding of both Hsf1 and Apj1 as the heat shock response has been shut down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 253: &quot;Sis-depleted&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the mistake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 332: Fig. 6C SIS1 OE from pRS315. A YIP would have been better, 20% of the cells will typically not express a protein with a CEN/ARS of the pRS-series so the Sis1 overexpression phenotype may be underestimated and this may impact on the interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that Yeast Integrated Plasmids (YIP) represent the gold standard for complementation assays. We are not aware of a study showing that 20% of cells harboring pRS-plasmids do not express the encoded protein. The results shown in Fig. 8C/D demonstrate that even strong overproduction of Sis1 cannot restore Hsf1 activity control. This interpretation also will not be affected assuming that a certain percentage of these cells do not express Sis1. Nevertheless, we added a comment to the respective section pointing to the possibility that the Sis1 effect might be underestimated due to variations in Sis1 expression (page 11, lanes 15-19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 1C. Since n=2, a more transparent way of showing the data is the individual data points. It is used elsewhere in the manuscript, and I recommend it.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that showing individual data points can enhance transparency, particularly with small sample sizes. However, the log2 fold change (log2FC) values presented in Figure 1C and other figures derived from ribosome profiling and RNAseq experiments were generated using the DESeq2 package. This DeSeq2 pipeline is widely used in analyzing differential gene expression and known for its statistical robustness. It performs differential expression analysis based on a model that incorporates normalization, dispersion estimation, and shrinkage of fold changes. The pipeline automatically accounts for biological, technical variability, and batch effects, thereby improving the reliability of results. These log2FC values are not directly calculated from log-transformed normalized counts of individual samples but are instead estimated from a fitted model comparing group means. Therefore, the individual values of replicates in DESeq2 log2FC cannot be shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 1D. Please add the number of minutes on the X-axis. Figure legend: &quot;Cycloheximide&quot; is capitalized.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the figure and figure legend as recommended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Several figure panels: Statistical tests and SD error bars for experiments performed in duplicates simply feel wrong for this reviewer. I do recognize that parts of the community are calculating, in essence, quasi-p-values using parametric methods for experiments with far too low sample numbers, but I recommend not doing so. In my opinion, better to show the two data points and interpret with caution.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the advice of the reviewer and removed statistical tests for experiments based on duplicates.</p><p>References</p><p>(1) Krakowiak, J., Zheng, X., Patel, N., Feder, Z.
