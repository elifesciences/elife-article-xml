can trigger the formation of interleukin 10 (IL-10)-producing T-regulatory type 1 (TR1) cells in vivo. We have recently shown that murine T-follicular helper (TFH) cells are precursors of TR1 cells and that the TFH-to-TR1 cell transdifferentiation process is characterized by the progressive loss and acquisition of opposing transcription factor gene expression programs that evolve through at least one transitional cell stage. Here, we use a broad range of bulk and single-cell transcriptional and epigenetic tools to investigate the epigenetic underpinnings of this process. At the single-cell level, the TFH-to-TR1 cell transition is accompanied by both, downregulation of TFH cell-specific gene expression due to loss of chromatin accessibility, and upregulation of TR1 cell-specific genes linked to chromatin regions that remain accessible throughout the transdifferentiation process, with minimal generation of new open chromatin regions. By interrogating the epigenetic status of accessible TR1 genes on purified TFH and conventional T-cells, we find that most of these genes, including <italic>Il10</italic>, are already poised for expression at the TFH cell stage. Whereas these genes are closed and hypermethylated in Tconv cells, they are accessible, hypomethylated, and enriched for H3K27ac-marked and hypomethylated active enhancers in TFH cells. These enhancers are enriched for binding sites for the TFH and TR1-associated transcription factors TOX-2, IRF4, and c-MAF. Together, these data suggest that the TR1 gene expression program is genetically imprinted at the TFH cell stage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T-regulatory type 1 cells</kwd><kwd>TR1 cells</kwd><kwd>T-follicular helper cells</kwd><kwd>TFH cells</kwd><kwd>transdifferentiation</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>immunoregulation</kwd><kwd>peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II -

Tregs include the well-characterized FOXP3+ subset as well as a FOXP3-negative CD4+ T-cell type that secretes IL-10 and low levels or no IL-4 and co-expresses CD49b, LAG-3, inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS), and/or CCR5 and PD-1 among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roncarolo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that systemic delivery of nanoparticles (NPs) coated with mono-specific peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII) molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singha et al., 2017</xref>) triggers the expansion and re-programming of cognate splenic T-follicular helper (TFH) CD4+ T-cells into expanded pools of transitional (referred to as TR1.1 or TR1-like) and terminally differentiated TR1 cells (referred to as TR1.2 or TR1) that resolve inflammation in various organ-specific autoimmune disease models in a disease-specific manner without impairing normal immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clemente-Casares et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Umeshappa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Umeshappa et al., 2019</xref>). These events result from the sustained assembly of large TCR microclusters, and rapid, robust, and prolonged TCR signaling on TFH cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solé et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Solé et al., 2023a</xref>). The antigen-specific TFH and TR1 sub-pools arising in response to pMHCII-NP therapy have nearly identical clonotypic composition but alternative functional properties and transcription factor (TF) expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solé et al., 2023b</xref>). In addition, pMHCII-NPs trigger cognate TR1 cell formation in TFH cell-transfused immunodeficient hosts, and T-cell-specific deletion of two master regulators of TFH cell genesis (<italic>Bcl6</italic> or <italic>Irf4</italic>) blunt both pMHCII-NP-induced TFH expansion and TR1 formation. In contrast, deletion of <italic>Prdm1</italic> selectively abrogates the TFH-to-TR1 conversion. Together, these data indicated that TFH cells can differentiate into TR1 cells in vivo and that Blimp-1 is a gatekeeper of this cell re-programming event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solé et al., 2023b</xref>). The work described herein was initiated to test the hypothesis that pMHCII-NP-induced conversion of TFH cells into TR1 cells involves epigenetic re-programming of the TFH precursors.</p><p>Chromatin can be modified at various levels, including alterations in chromatin accessibility to expose or shield specific genes from the gene expression machinery, through histone modifications that either promote or repress gene expression, or via changes in DNA methylation, typically hypomethylation. Although such processes have been shown to contribute to T-cell differentiation, such as during Th1/Th2 cell specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Garra and Arai, 2000</xref>), they can also occur upon T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avni et al., 2002</xref>) or in response to environmental cues, such as cytokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ostuni et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, it has been established that DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility regulate T-cell activation and effector and memory responses during immune responses to infection. Effector T-cell-specific genes are demethylated and gain chromatin accessibility and naïve T-cell-associated genes are repressed. When these cells need to become memory, the naïve genes required for survival are demethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belk et al., 2022</xref>). Another notable example of chromatin remodeling is in exhausted T-cells, where numerous effector genes, such as <italic>Ifng</italic>, become closed, and acquire open chromatin at genes that are upregulated in these cells, such as <italic>Pdcd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belk et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Several notable examples of redistribution of histone marks during T-cell differentiation have been described. For example, Th1 differentiation results in H3K4 di-methylation and H3 and H4 acetylation and in the creation of chromatin accessible regions at regulatory elements within the <italic>Ifng</italic> locus, as well as in the loss of H3K27me3 through the locus (in addition to DNA demethylation of the locus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schoenborn et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, activation of the Th2 program leads to the loss of permissive histone modifications in <italic>Ifng</italic>, addition of repressive H3K27me3 marks along the locus and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schoenborn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones and Chen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang and Aune, 2007</xref>). Th2 differentiation from naïve precursors also involves the acquisition of permissive histone modifications in <italic>Il4, Il5, Il13</italic> and the locus control region (LCR), and the loss of H3K27me3 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avni et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koyanagi et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, the promoters and eight gene regulatory elements (GREs) of <italic>Il17a</italic> and <italic>Il17f</italic> genes in naïve CD4+ T-cells acquire H3K27ac marks upon culture in Th17-polarizing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akimzhanov et al., 2007</xref>). In memory T-cells, which display faster and greater levels of gene transcription than their naïve and effector counterparts, lineage-specific cytokine genes retain the positive histone modifications on their proximal and distal GREs that were acquired during differentiation of their precursor T-cells (e.g. H3K27ac and H3K9ac marks), even when expression of the genes ceases upon memory cell conversion, allowing rapid reactivation of these loci upon antigen re-encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fann et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, naive CD8+ T cells lose repressive H3K27me3 marks during the primary immune response against infections, allowing rapid upregulation of <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Gzmb</italic> expression by their memory CD8+ T-cell counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2009</xref>). Overall, memory T-cells appear to retain the epigenetic signatures of their effector progenitors, thus allowing a quicker and more efficient response in subsequent antigen encounters.</p><p>There are also several noteworthy examples of changes in DNA methylation in T-cells. For example, the <italic>Cd4</italic> locus is hypermethylated in CD4–CD8–, CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and mature CD8+ T cells, but is demethylated in CD4+CD8–cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teghanemt et al., 2022</xref>). Likewise, in naïve T-cells, <italic>Il4, Il5, Il13,</italic> and the corresponding LCR are hypermethylated and <italic>Ifng</italic> is hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fields et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). Whereas this methylation pattern is maintained during the Th0-Th1 differentiation process, it undergoes dramatic changes during Th2 formation, such that <italic>Ifng</italic> becomes hypermethylated, and <italic>Il4, Il5, Il13,</italic> and the LCR demethylate key GREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fields et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2007</xref>), in addition to acquiring the type of permissive histone modifications discussed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avni et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koyanagi et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, TFH formation from naïve T-cell precursors involves demethylation of BCL-6 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). In Foxp3+ Tregs, the expression of <italic>Foxp3</italic> and genes coding for some Treg-function-associated molecules, such as <italic>Ctla4</italic> and <italic>Il2ra</italic>, but not genes coding for TFs controlling other cell fates or cytokine genes that are repressed in Foxp3+ Tregs, are also associated with DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohkura et al., 2012</xref>). The development of memory T-cells also involves progressive demethylation of promoter-distal GREs of key genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durek et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, the above observations indicate that, in most cases, acquisition of new functional states by peripheral T-cells, including their differentiation into different T-cell subsets, involves extensive and diverse modifications of the chromatin around specific loci, although global (i.e. genome-wide) epigenetic changes during these processes were not always explored. Here, we show, through a broad combination of transcriptomic and epigenetic studies, that the TFH-to-TR1 transdifferentiation process does not follow this pattern. Specifically, we find that conventional TFH cells are epigenetically poised to differentiate into TR1 cells, and that the TFH-to-TR1 transdifferentiation process is associated with extensive contraction of the chromatin and the upregulation of genes that are already epigenetically poised for expression, yet are silent, at the TFH cell stage, such as <italic>Il10</italic>. These genes are closed and hypermethylated in Tconv cells, but are accessible, hypomethylated, and enriched for H3K27ac-marked and hypomethylated active enhancers in TFH cells. These data suggest that genomic imprinting is a key enabler of the TFH-TR1 cell transdifferentiation process, as documented in non-immune cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holliday and Pugh, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muramoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raas et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell multiomic profiles of pMHCII-NP-induced TFH and TR1 cells</title><p>The compaction status of the chromatin has a direct impact on gene expression, by modulating the accessibility of TF binding sites and the physical interactions between GREs. We therefore sought to map changes in the genome-wide distribution and location of open chromatin regions (OCRs) along the TFH-TR1 pathway and determine whether pMHCII-NP-induced TR1-like cells inherit their chromatin exposure status from TFH cell precursors. We focused on the BDC2.5mi/I-A<sup>g7</sup> Tet+ cells arising in BDC2.5mi/I-A<sup>g7</sup>-NP-treated nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. BDC2.5mi/I-A<sup>g7</sup>-specific CD4+ T-cells comprise a population of autoreactive T-cells that contribute to the progression of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. The size of this type 1 diabetes-relevant T-cell specificity is small and barely detectable in untreated NOD mice, but treatment with cognate pMHCII-NPs leads to the expansion and formation of anti-diabetogenic TR1 cells that retain the antigenic specificity of their precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clemente-Casares et al., 2016</xref>).

Whereas scRNAseq provides information about the transcriptional identity of the various cellular sub-pools, scATACseq (assay for transposable-accessible chromatin using sequencing) reveals locations of accessible chromatin at regulatory and non-regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>) at each cell differentiation stage along the TFH-TR1 pathway. Furthermore, to ascertain whether the pMHCII-NP-induced Tet+ TFH cells and conventional (i.e. vaccine-induced) TFH cells are equivalent not only at the transcriptional level but also at the level of chromatin accessibility, we also compared the scMultiome profiles of pMHCII-NP-induced Tet+ cells with those corresponding to: (1) purified keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-induced TFH (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>high</sup>PD1<sup>high</sup>) cells from immunized NOD mice, which are transcriptionally identical to the Tet+ TFH cell pools from BDC2.5mi/I-A<sup>g7</sup>-NP-treated NOD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solé et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Solé et al., 2023a</xref>); and (2) TH0 (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>–</sup>CXCR5<sup>–</sup>PD1<sup>–</sup>) (naïve) cells obtained from KLH-immunized animals as a control, herein referred to as Tconv cells.

We acknowledge that, in the bulk ATACseq studies, the differences in the number of OCRs found in tetramer+ cells or KLH-induced TFH cells vs. naïve T-cells may be influenced by the intrinsic oligoclonality of the tetramer+ T-cell pool arising in response to repeated pMHCII-NP challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solé et al., 2023b</xref>).

Although some of these histone modifications are not involved in gene regulation but rather occur upon gene activation and RNA polymerase elongation, they are considered good epigenetic indicators of the status of the chromatin.</p><p>H3 is the histone that undergoes more epigenetic modifications. Acetylation of this histone, at K9, K14, K18, K23, or K27, is consistently associated with active transcription, by neutralizing the positive charge of lysine residues, weakening the H3-DNA interaction and enhancing accessibility of the chromatin to the transcription machinery. Generally, deposition of acetylated H3K27 (H3K27ac) is associated with gene expression and allows the identification of active/inactive or poised enhancers and active promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>). Unlike histone acetylation, histone methylation is electrically neutral and can be both activating or repressing, depending on the extent and lysine residue(s) involved. H3K4me3 deposition at transcriptional start sites (TSSs) is, like H3K27ac deposition, a marker of actively transcribed genes and is thought to imprint transcriptional ‘memory’ between generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muramoto et al., 2010</xref>). H3K27me3, generally found near CpG-rich promoters and intergenic regions, represses gene expression, even in the presence of H3K4me3, which prevents permanent silencing of the gene. The simultaneous presence of activating and repressing (bivalent) marks at the same location allows dynamic responsiveness to signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jadhav et al., 2016</xref>).

Whereas active enhancers are typically marked with H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and some H3K4me3, poised enhancers contain both H3K4me1 and the repressive H3K27me3 mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pekowska et al., 2011</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, most of the genes that remain open as the cells transition from the TFH state to its TR1 counterparts (i.e. are not closed), already harbor active enhancers in TFH cells. Specifically, most of the 396 genes that are associated with accessible chromatin in both TR1-like/TR1 and TFH cells and are marked with active enhancers (89.6%; p&lt;2.2e-16) display such enhancers in both the BDC2.5mi/I-A<sup>g7</sup>-NP-induced Tet+ and KLH-induced TFH pools.</p><p>We then investigated whether differences in the expression of these genes, as defined via scRNAseq, were associated with differences in the number and/or location of active enhancers.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the patterned hypomethylation status of distal gene regulatory elements of TR1 genes in TFH precursors define the TR1-poised nature of the TFH epigenome. First, DNA methylation is generally not permissive for transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schübeler, 2015</xref>), even at active enhancers. Second, enhancer demethylation is highly cell type-specific and accurately predicts target gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schlesinger et al., 2013</xref>). Third, differential methylation among cell types is greatest at distal gene regulatory elements than in promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schlesinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, demethylation at these sites appears to be a required final step in enhancer activation during cell fate transitions, leading to the stabilization of cell line identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnett et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To reveal the identity of differentially expressed genes proximal to ‘distal’ GREs marked by open chromatin, H3K27ac deposition and hypomethylation (excluding promoters), we interrogated our active enhancer dataset for Tet+ and TFH-specific DMRs (vs. Tconv cells).

The genes that were upregulated at the TR1 cell stage and shared an open chromatin status with TFH cells, based on the scMultiome dataset, were associated with 285 active enhancers.

Therefore, these sites are likely already occupied by these TFs at the TFH stage, especially considering their described role in TFH development and maintenance. For example, many hypomethylated active enhancers linked to <italic>Il10 in</italic> BDC2.5mi/I-A<sup>g7</sup>-NP-induced Tet+ cells and KLH-induced TFH cells have binding sites for TOX-2 (as well as IRF4 and c-MAF) in TFH and Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Having established that TFH cells can transdifferentiate into TR1-like and terminally differentiated TR1 cells in vivo in response to certain stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solé et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Solé et al., 2023a</xref>), we sought to explore the epigenetic events underpinning this process. Our comprehensive transcriptional and epigenetic studies at the bulk and/or single-cell levels indicate that conventional antigen experienced TFH cells are epigenetically poised to become TR1 cells. One of our main findings is that the TFH-to-TR1 differentiation process is associated with massive closure of OCRs, and that the vast majority of the OCRs found in TR1-like and TR1 cells are also found in KLH-DNP-induced TFH cells. Furthermore, most of the genes harbored in these shared OCRs, such as <italic>Cxcr5, Tox2, Il21, Il10,</italic> and <italic>Ctla4</italic>, to just name a few, contain nearly identical patterns of histone deposition marks, including H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K27Ac, equally similar DNA methylation patterns in gene bodies, proximal promoters, and gene-distal regulatory elements and a similar distribution of active enhancers across the genome, even when not expressed in either cell type. Altogether, these data indicate that the TR1-poised epigenome of TFH cells is a key enabler of this transdifferentiation process, and that transdifferentiation of TFH cells into TR1 cells is likely driven by changes in the expression of TFH-stabilizing and TR1-promoting TFs, possibly in response to sustained ligation of TCRs.</p><p>Our earlier scRNAseq and mass cytometry studies of cognate (antigen-specific, tetramer+) pMHCII-NP-induced CD4+ T cells demonstrated the presence of a significant Tet+ TFH-like cluster that separated away from its TR1 counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solé et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Solé et al., 2023a</xref>). When compared to each other, these two major clusters of tetramer+ cells were remarkably similar, but the TR1 sub-pool had significantly downregulated key TFH-specific genes, including <italic>S1pr2</italic>, <italic>Cxcr4</italic>, <italic>Cxcr5</italic>, <italic>Pdcd1</italic>, <italic>Il4</italic>, <italic>Ascl2</italic>, <italic>Bcl6</italic>, <italic>Cba2t3</italic>, <italic>Cebpa</italic>, <italic>Id3</italic>, <italic>Nfia</italic>, <italic>Pou2af1</italic>, <italic>Tox2</italic>, while upregulating TR1-associated genes, such as <italic>Ccr5</italic>, <italic>Havcr2</italic>, <italic>Il10</italic>, <italic>Ahr</italic>, <italic>Myc,</italic> and <italic>Prdm1</italic>. Importantly, these two clusters were developmentally related because they harbored identical clonotypes (i.e. identical TCRαβ sequences at different transcriptional states). Additional studies indicated that the TFH-to-TR1 conversion proceeds through a transitional TR1-like subset, whereby the progenitors undergo progressive downregulation of TFH-associated transcripts (i.e. <italic>Bcl6, Cxcr5</italic>, among others) and progressive upregulation of TR1-associated transcripts (i.e. <italic>il10, Ccr5,</italic> and <italic>Prdm1</italic>, among others). The suspected TFH origin of pMHCII-NP-induced TR1 cells was further supported by two additional lines of evidence. First, treatment of NOD.<italic>Scid</italic> mice engrafted with total CXCR5<sup>high</sup>PD-1<sup>high</sup> CD4+ T-cells (containing pMHCII-NP-expanded TFH-like cells but devoid of terminally differentiated Tet+ TR1 cells) with pMHCII-NPs led to the formation of cognate TR1-like and terminally differentiated TR1 cell pools in the hosts. Second, the two-dimensional scMultiome profile of Tet+ TFH-like cells arising in response to BDC2.5mi/IA<sup>g7</sup>-NP therapy was essentially identical to that corresponding to an effector TFH-like sub-pool of TFH-like cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>hi</sup>PD1<sup>hi</sup>) induced by immunization with the KLH-DNP conjugate (<italic>Bcl6<sup>hi</sup>Tox2<sup>hi</sup>Il21<sup>+</sup>Pdcd1<sup>+</sup></italic>; referred to as TFH.1).</p><p>Abrogation of <italic>Prdm1</italic> (encoding BLIMP-1) expression enabled the conversion of TFH.1 cells into TR1-like progeny, but completely blunted the TR1-like–&gt;TR1 conversion, indicating that this process requires the expression of BLIMP-1, a transcriptional repressor that antagonizes BCL-6 expression and function in both B- and T-cells, including TFH cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crotty et al., 2010</xref>). Since expression of BLIMP-1 in T-cells is restricted to activated T-cells and is induced by TCR ligation, and since pMHCII-NP therapy triggers the formation and expansion of cognate, antigen-specific TR1-like cell pools via sustained TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singha et al., 2017</xref>), we suspect that BLIMP-1 expression in TFH cells is induced by repetitive encounters of cognate TFH cells with these compounds. Progressive downregulation of <italic>Bcl6</italic> and upregulation of <italic>Prdm1</italic> at the TR1-like cell stage, immediately preceding TR1 development, might be facilitated by the loss of <italic>Lef1</italic> and significant downregulation of <italic>Tcf7</italic> (encoding TCF-1) expression (positive regulators of <italic>Bcl6</italic> expression and negative regulators of <italic>Prdm1</italic> expression) in pMHCII-NP-challenged vs. vaccine-induced TFH cells. In fact, the Tet+ TR1-like and terminally differentiated TR1 cells (BLIMP-1-independent or -dependent, respectively) differ in the expression levels of a significant number of genes whose expression has been previously associated with this TF, including <italic>Il10, Ctla4, Lag3, Icos, Havcr2, Tnfrsf4,</italic> and <italic>Tnfrsf18</italic>, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chihara et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have shown that pMHCII-NP-driven transdifferentiation of cognate TFH cells into TR1 progeny is driven by both massive closure of OCRs and major changes in the transcriptional factor make-up of the cells, rather than by TCR signaling-induced changes in the epigenetic status of the genes contained within the shared OCRs. There are some noteworthy differences between the evolution of the epigenetic landscape in effector, memory, and exhausted T-cells as compared to what we see in the TFH-TR1 pathway. In T-cells, acquisition of the epigenetic programs of effector, memory, and exhaustion states are stepwise processes. In exhausted T-cells, for example, ATACseq and H3K27AC ChIPseq analyses of different exhausted states are associated with distinct epigenetic states, including differential chromatin accessibility and active enhancer landscapes, yet shared TF profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belk et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, transdifferentiation of TFH cells into TR1 cells appears to be driven by changes in the expression of TFH-stabilizing and TR1-promoting TFs, in the face of remarkable epigenetic similarity, including a shared methylome, consistent with the idea that TFH cells are poised to rapidly become TR1 when appropriately activated. Interestingly, the TF-coding genes that are significantly downregulated during the TFH-to-TR1 conversion, unlike those that are upregulated, experience a significant reduction in chromatin accessibility. In contrast, as expected based on the epigenetic similarity of TFH vs. TR1 cells, upregulation of TF-coding genes important for TR1 cell genesis is largely dissociated from the different epigenetic marks studied here, including changes in chromatin accessibility. This suggests that changes in TF expression, particularly the loss of TFH-associated TFs, are driven, in part, via chromatin remodeling of the coding loci.</p><p>The combination of TFs that become available (i.e. <italic>Prdm1</italic>) or unavailable (i.e. <italic>Bcl6</italic>) during the TFH-TR1 conversion would be responsible for enabling/driving the formation of the active enhancer-promoter contacts required for gene expression and establishing TR1 transcriptional identity. This would explain why TR1-associated genes that are already epigenetically marked for expression in TFH cells (i.e. <italic>Il10</italic>) remain silent at the TFH stage. This is not a unique feature of the TFH-to-TR1 transdifferentiation process. For example, although the <italic>Il10</italic> locus is closed and transcriptionally silent in naive CD4+ T-cells, it is exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miraldi et al., 2019</xref>) and incorporates permissive H3K4me3 marks but not repressive H3K27me3 marks in differentiated T helper subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciofani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wei et al., 2010</xref>), promoting a transcriptional competent yet silent state. Since TFs regulating Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets, including T-bet, GATA-3, or RORγt, do no inhibit IL-10 expression, but rather enhance it, the above observations imply that different effector cell programs can co-exist with much broader gene expression-competent states. Our data indicate that this is also true for TFH cells. In fact, the expression of <italic>Il10</italic> in Th cell subsets can only occur until the TFs required for gene expression become available. For example, BATF (an AP1 family member), IRF4, NFAT, c-MAF, AHR, and BLIMP-1 are known to collectively promote <italic>Il10</italic> expression by binding to the promoter and/or cis-regulatory elements of <italic>Il10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pot et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, although Th lineage-specific cytokines present active histone marks in the corresponding lineage and repressive marks in the others, TF-coding genes are not always so strictly marked and display expression-permissive epigenetic patterns. For example, <italic>Tbx21</italic>, encoding T-bet, harbors activating H3K4me3 marks in the promoter of Th1 cells, but bivalent modifications in other Th subsets. This is also true for <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> or <italic>Bcl6</italic> in Th2 vs. non-Th2, Th17 vs. non-Th17, and TFH vs. non-TFH cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wei et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, whereas <italic>Bcl6</italic> is also marked with expression-promoting H3K4me3 marks in other Th cell subsets, loci encoding Th subset-specifying TFs (<italic>Tbx21</italic>, G<italic>ata3,</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic>) also appear to be poised for expression in TFH cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). Because BCL-6 can regulate the expression other TFs, it is likely the collective TF make-up of the cell that determines its phenotype at a given point in time. It is thus reasonable to suspect that the epigenomes of polarized T-cell subsets, including TFH cells, are programmed to enable their conversion into alternative transcriptional states when required (i.e. in response to excessive antigenic stimulation).</p><p>The TR1-poised state of TFH cells is also reflected on the global active enhancer landscapes of both cell types. For example, we have shown that most of the genes that remain open as BDC2.5mi/I-A<sup>g7</sup>-NP-induced TFH.1 cells transition into TR1-like/TR1 cells also share active enhancers in both subsets. In addition, the demethylated status of most active enhancers associated with genes specifically upregulated in TR1 cells, such as <italic>Il10</italic>, were already so (hence imprinted) at the TFH stage. Furthermore, we find that many of the active enhancers linked to genes specifically upregulated at the TR1 cell stage, which, in turn, are highly hypomethylated and accessible at the TFH cell stage, are enriched for binding sites for at least three TFH-associated TFs, including TOX2, IRF4, and c-MAF. This suggests that these sites are likely already occupied by these TFs at the TFH stage. The remarkable similarity of the DNA methylome of the TFH and TR1 subsets further suggests that both TFH and TR1 cells share a stable epigenetic program.</p><p>The factors responsible for chromatin closure during the TFH-to-TR1 conversion remain to be determined, but changes in the expression of <italic>Tox2</italic> (and the related TF <italic>Tox</italic>) may contribute to this event. TOX-2 expression in CD4+ T-cells is upregulated by BCL-6, and TOX-2 binds to loci associated with TFH generation, including <italic>Bcl6</italic>, <italic>Cxcr5</italic>, <italic>Pdcd1</italic> (also upregulated in TR1-like cells) along with BATF and IRF4 or STAT-3, increasing their chromatin accessibility and promoting their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, whereas KLH-DNP- and pMHCII-NP-induced TFH cells express high levels of <italic>Tox2</italic>, their TR1-like and TR1 counterparts express substantially lower levels; suboptimal occupation of TOX-2 binding sites by TOX-2 in pMHCII-NP-challenged TFH cells may result in the closure of these sites, cessation of the expression of the corresponding genes and progressive differentiation into TR1 cells. Downregulation of TCF-1 (encoded by <italic>Tcf7</italic>) and LEF-1 expression as TFH cells become TR1 cells may be additional contributing factors to loss of chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gounari and Khazaie, 2022</xref>). We note that loss of TCF-1 in T-cell subsets is usually paralleled by loss of LEF-1, which belongs to the same TF family and recognizes a similar motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gounari and Khazaie, 2022</xref>). In developing thymocytes, upregulation of TCF-1 expression is associated with an increase in chromatin accessibility, suggesting that it may act as a pioneer TF. Furthermore, loss of TCF-1 in DP thymocytes or CD8+ T-cells, T-exhausted stem cells or activated CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells is associated with loss of chromatin accessibility at sites that had bound TCF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gounari and Khazaie, 2022</xref>). In addition, TCF-1, along with CTCF, promotes deposition of H3K27ac onto insulated enhancers and the recruitment of cohesin-loading factor NIPBL at active enhancers in developing thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). In another recent study, TCF-1 was identified as a ‘placeholder’ TF, responsible for maintaining chromatin accessibility in naïve T-cells, and allowing activation-induced TFs to displace it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhong et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, downregulation of TCF-1 and LEF-1 may contribute to the loss of the TFH-specific gene expression program as these cells transdifferentiate into TR1, close previously open chromatin sites, and acquire new TFs orchestrating the TR1-specific gene expression program.</p><p>The current study provides a foundational understanding of how the epigenetic landscape of TFH cells evolves as they transdifferentiate into TR1 progeny in response to chronic ligation of cognate TCRs using pMHCII-NPs. Our current studies focus on functional validation of these observations, by carrying out extensive perturbation studies of the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation pathway in conditional TF gene knockout mice. In these ongoing studies, genes coding for a series of TFs expressed along the TFH-TR1 pathway are selectively knocked out in T cells, to ascertain (1) the specific roles of key TFs in the various cell conversion events and transcriptional changes that take place along the TFH-TR1 cell axis; (2) the roles that such TFs play in the chromatin re-modeling events that underpin the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation process; and (3) the effects of TF gene deletion on phenotypic and functional readouts of TFH and Treg function. Although the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation was discovered in mice treated with pMHCII-NPs, we now have evidence that this is a naturally occurring pathway that also develops in other contexts (i.e. in mice that have not been treated with pMHCII-NPs). Importantly, the discovery of this transdifferentiation process affords a unique opportunity to further understand the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms underpinning T-cell plasticity; the findings reported here can help guide/inform not only upcoming translational studies of pMHCII-NP therapy in humans, but also other research in this area.</p><p>Although the snapshot provided by our single-cell studies reported herein documents the simultaneous presence of the different subsets composing the TFH-TR1 cell pathway upon the termination of treatment, the transdifferentiation process itself is extremely fast, such that proliferated TFH cells already transdifferentiate into TR1 cells after a single pMHCII-NP dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solé et al., 2023b</xref>). This makes it extremely challenging to pursue dynamic experiments. Notwithstanding this caveat, ongoing studies of cognate T-cells post treatment withdrawal, coupled to single-cell studies of the TFH-TR1 pathway in TF gene knockout mice exhibiting perturbed transdifferentiation processes, are likely to shed light into the progression and stability of the epigenetic changes reported herein.</p><p>We have recently shown that αGalCer/CD1d-NPs can trigger the differentiation of liver-resident invariant NKT cells (LiNKT) into a TR1-like immunoregulatory, IL-10+IL-21-producing Zbtb16<sup>high</sup>Maf<sup>high</sup>Tbx21<sup>+</sup>Gata3<sup>+</sup>Rorc<sup>–</sup> subset (LiNKTR1) that can suppress local inflammatory phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Umeshappa et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, epigenetic studies of liver iNKT cells both before and after in vivo delivery of aGalCer/CD1d-coated NPs have shown that unlike the case for pMHCII-NP-induced TR1 transdifferentiation, aGalCer/CD1d-NP-induced LiNKTR1 transdifferentiation involves the acquisition of a novel epigenetic state. Specifically, whereas for most genes, gene upregulation during the LinKT-to-LiNKTR1 cell transition is largely associated with treatment-induced hypomethylation, the most upregulated genes (i.e. <italic>Il10</italic> and <italic>Il21</italic>, among others) are also those that accumulate additional epigenetic modifications favoring gene expression, such as acquisition of new OCRs and H3K27ac and H3K4me3 marks. Thus, whereas TFH cells largely require chromatin closure and changes in TF expression to become TR1 cells, LiNKT cells do not undergo massive changes in chromatin exposure and involve extensive gene demethylation to do so. Although the mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear, they indicate that the processes that regulate responses of different T-cell types to similar cues are context-dependent and dynamic.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Glucose was added to 4.5 g/L when levels dropped below 3.5 g/L. Cells were harvested on day 14 or when viability fell below 60%. The secreted proteins were purified by sequential affinity chromatography on nickel and strep-tactin columns and used for NP coating or biotinylated in vitro to produce pMHCII tetramers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>pMHCII tetramers</title><p>Phycoerythrin (PE)- or APC-conjugated tetramers were prepared using biotinylated pMHCII monomers and used to stain peripheral T-cells. Briefly, pMHCII monomers were subjected to biotinylation using biotin ligase (Avidity, Aurora, CO, USA) following the supplier’s protocols, and biotinylated monomers purified by ion exchange chromatography using an AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA).

Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit v2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, 10–50 ng of total RNA was used for poly(A)-mRNA purification using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, followed by fragmentation to ~300 bp. cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and random primers. The second strand of the cDNA incorporated dUTP in place of dTTP. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was further used for library preparation. dsDNA was subjected to A-tailing and ligation of the barcoded TruSeq adapters. All purification steps were performed using AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Library amplification was performed by PCR using the primer cocktail supplied in the kit. Final libraries were analyzed using Agilent DNA 1000 chip to estimate the quantity and size distribution. They were then quantified by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) before amplification with Illumina’s cBot. Libraries were loaded at a concentration of 2.75 pM onto the flowcell and sequenced 1×50 on Illumina’s HiSeq 2500 to obtain 30–40 M reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>10X scRNAseq</title><p>At least 5e4 fresh, alive cells were collected in DMEM media (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) at 4°C and sent to CNAG-CRG for processing and sequencing. In short, cells were separated into nanoscale gel beads emulsions with a 10X barcode. Cell numbers and viability were assessed using a TC20 Automated Cell Counter (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), with a minimum target of 5000 cells. Later, cDNA sequencing libraries were produced using the NextGEM Single-cell 3’ mRNA kit (v3.1; 10X Genomics) following the manufacturer’s instructions. These steps involved GEM-RT clean-up, cDNA Amplification for 13 cycles, and cDNA quality control and quantification using the Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were indexed by PCR using the PN-220103 Chromium i7 Sample Index Plate. Finally, sequencing was carried out on a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>ATACseq</title><p>For ATACseq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing), 5e4 cells were sorted in PBS and processed for library preparation as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>. Briefly, cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630), washed, and right after resuspended in transposase reaction mix (25 μL 2× TD buffer, 2.5 μL transposase [Illumina], and 22.5 μL nuclease-free water) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Next, library fragments were amplified using 1× NEB Next PCR master mix (New England BioLabs) and 1.25 μM of custom Nextera PCR primers forward and reverse. Libraries were rendered using the barcoded primers Ad1_noMX as forward and Ad2.1-6 as reverse and purified using a PCR cleanup kit (QIAGEN), yielding a final concentration of about 30 nM in 20 μL. Libraries were then analyzed on Bioanalyzer using an Agilent DNA High Sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to estimate the quantity and size distribution. Next, they were quantified by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit before amplification with Illumina’s cBot. Libraries were finally loaded at 3.33 pM onto the flowcell and sequenced 1×50 on Illumina’s HiSeq 2500.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>10X scMultiome (scRNAseq+scATACseq)</title><p>For 10X Multiome RNAseq+ATACseq, at least 5e5 fresh, alive cells were collected in DMEM media (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) at 4°C, and then lysed and nuclei isolated. Nuclei were transposated and adapter sequences added to DNA fragments. Nuclei were then processed for single-cell barcoding and library generation following the manufacturer’s instructions (CG000338; 10X Genomics). Briefly, isolated nuclei were partitioned into Gel Bead-In-Emulsions to produce barcoded cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA as described above, as well as barcoded DNA fragments, and processed for library amplification and sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina) as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>ChIPseq</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequencing was performed for H3K4me3, H3K27me, and H3K27Ac bound DNA via ChIPseq. We used 1e6 cells. Cells were pooled from tetramer+ T-cells from BDC2.5/IA<sup>g7</sup>-NP-treated mice (eight mice), and TFH (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CXCR5<sup>hi/</sup>PD1<sup>hi</sup>), and TH0 cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD44<sup>–</sup>/CXCR5<sup>–</sup>/PD1<sup>–</sup>) (extract from the same group of eight mice). In brief, cell dry pellets were fixed right after cell sorting with 10% PFA in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone). Next, cells were lysed, sheared, and sonicated using an S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) (13 min, 105 W, 2% Duty Factor, 200 cycles). This was followed by overnight incubation with the precipitating antibody: 0.5 µL of H3K4me3 (Sigma), 0.5 µL of H3K27me3 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), and 2 µL of H3K27Ac (Abcam, Cambridge, United Carlsbad, CA, USA) and precipitated using Protein-A-Dynabeads (Abcam). RNA was cleared using RNAse A (QIAGEN) (1 hr at 65°C), and decrosslinking was performed overnight with proteinase K at 65°C. DNA was finally purified with Phenol-Chloroform and EtOH-precipitation. After validation by Bioanalyzer analysis quality control (Agilent Technologies), samples were sequenced. Libraries were prepared using the NEB Next Ultra DNA Library Prep kit (Illumina) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were loaded at a concentration of 2.75 pM onto flowcells and were sequenced 1×50 on Illumina’s HiSeq 2500.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Methylome</title><p>For methylome analysis, genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were then sent to Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, Shenzhen, China), once frozen, for sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. DNA was processed by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. DNA was sonicated to a mean size of 250 bp using a Bioruptor (Diagenode, Belgium) and ends blunted by dA addition to the 3’-end. Finally, adapters were ligated to protect bisulfite conversions. Next, ligated DNA was bisulfite converted using an EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (ZYMO, Irvine, CA, USA). Unmethylated cytosines were converted into uracil, which after purification and amplification via PCR, were converted back to thymine. Finally, samples were sequenced at 2×150 bp using NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Bioinformatic and statistical analyses</title><p>All fastq files obtained for each omics analysis were assessed for their quality control metrics before further downstream analysis using the FastQC tool. Sources for the indicated bioinformatic packages and tools are described further below.</p><sec id="s4-16-1"><title>RNAseq</title><p>For bulk RNAseq analysis, fastq file reads were aligned using STAR to GRCm38.p6 mouse genome, and gene counts were obtained using Gencode M25 annotation release version simultaneously with the ‘GeneCounts’ STAR function. The resulting BAM files were processed into BigWig format for genomic tracks representation using SAMtools, deepTools, and trackViewer. Next, raw count values were processed and analyzed using R packages DESeq2 for normalization, scaling, and negative binomial distribution differential analysis. ggplot2 (tidyverse) was mainly used for graphics rendering purposes. Differential analysis log2 fold changes results were shrunk using ‘apglm’ to remove noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-2"><title>ATACseq and ChIPseq</title><p>For bulk ATACseq analysis, Illumina adapters and low-quality bases were first removed from fastq files reads using Trimmomatic. Next, reads were aligned to GRCm38.p6 mouse genome using Bowtie2, and duplicates were removed using Picard’s ‘MarkDuplicates’. Then peaks were called using MACS2 with a q-value cutoff of 0.05, read extension of 5’-&gt;3’ of 150, and keeping duplicates as they had been removed previously (‘-q 0.05 --nomodel --extsize 150 --keep-dup all’). The resulting BAM files were processed into BigWig format for genomic tracks representation using SAMtools, deepTools, and trackViewer.</p><p>For ATACseq analysis differential OCRs between samples were analyzed using DiffBind using BAM and peakset files. Briefly, we determined the overall background noise for each sample and then identified regions where the signal significantly exceeded noise, enabling accurate identification of peaks of enrichment controlling for false discovery rate (q-value&lt;0.05). Differential OCRs between cell types were determined using likelihood ratio to compare read counts or signal intensity within OCRs across samples.</p><p>Differential peaks between ChIPseq samples were obtained using GSA (gene set analysis) from Partek. Peaks were annotated using ‘annotatePeak’ from the ChIPseeker package, using the UCSC mm10 reference included in org.Mm.eg.db and TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene R packages. Given that peak calling alone does not account for variations in the intensity of histone mark deposition, analysis of differential histone deposition includes both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Whereas qualitative assessment involves evaluating the overall pattern and distribution of the various histone marks, quantitative assessment measures the intensity and magnitude of histone mark deposition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-3"><title>Methylome</title><p>Upstream bioinformatic analysis of whole-genome methylome data was performed by the bioinformatics team at BGI. In short, sequencing data was first filtered to remove adaptor sequences and low-quality reads from raw reads. Filtered data was then mapped to the reference genome (mm10) by BSMAP, and duplication reads were removed. Regarding alignment quality metrics, the mapping rate and bisulfite conversion rate were measured for each sample. Only uniquely mapped data was used to get methylation data. Methylation level was determined by dividing the number of reads covering each mC by the total reads covering that cytosine. DMRs were identified by comparison between sample methylomes using windows that contained at least five CpG (CHG or CHH) sites with at least a twofold change in methylation level and Fisher’s exact test p-value≤0.05. Adjacent DMRs would be considered interdependent and joined into one continuous DMR if all the regions were differentially methylated between samples. Otherwise, DMRs were identified as independent. Genomic tracks for methylome data were represented using the trackViewer R package.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-4"><title>scRNAseq</title><p>10X scRNAseq data was demultiplexed, aligned, and counts measured using Cellranger software from 10X Genomics. In short, Cellranger 10X software first filter and trim low-quality reads, then align them to a reference genome using STAR. Next, UMI (reads) and cell barcodes are filtered, grouped, and counted. Cells are called and reported their gene expression in matrices based on RNA content for each cell barcode. We then performed the secondary analysis of gene expression using the Seurat R package, where we first discarded poor quality cells based on features counts and mitochondrial and ribosomal content. Then, data was normalized, scaled, and dimensionally reduced using PCA (principal component analysis) and UMAP. Finally, cells were clustered using K-means, and visualization and differential analysis were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-5"><title>scMultiome (scRNAseq+scATACseq)</title><p>10X single-cell multiomic data of simultaneous RNAseq and ATACseq was analyzed using 10X Genomics software Cellranger-arc. In this case, gene expression matrices from gene expression data are obtained like with Cellranger software (see the previous section). On the other hand, transposase accessibility data is adapter-removed and trimmed. Next, alignment is performed using the BWA-MEM algorithm, using a fixed insert size distribution, and duplicates removed. Afterward, peaks are called across all the cells to maximize the signal and then separated by barcode, obtaining peak-barcode matrices. Subsequently, gene expression and accessibility peaks matrices were combined and downstream-analyzed using Seurat and Signac packages. Like the scRNAseq pipeline, data were first filtered for poor-quality cells using features and peaks counts, mitochondrial content, nucleosome signal, and TSS enrichment. Later, RNA and ATAC data were normalized and scaled. Also, each dataset was dimensionally reduced using PCA for RNA and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) for ATAC and UMAP. Multidimensional reduction of joint RNAseq and ATACseq data simultaneously was performed using the WNN algorithm from Seurat and clustered using K-means.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-6"><title>Active enhancer prediction</title><p>ATACseq and H3K27ac-ChIPseq were used to predict potential active enhancer regions. Using the ‘GenomicRanges’ package, all peaks called for ATACseq overlapping peaks called for H3K27Ac deposition in the same sample, which were not in a promoter region (2 kb region upstream of TSS), were considered active enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-7"><title>Chromosome views</title><p>We used the trackViewer R package to combine the information from RNAseq, ATACseq, ChIPseq, predicted active enhancers, and methylation data in linear plots representing gene tracks for specific genes.

Their evidence indicated that the downregulation of TFH-related genes during the TFH to TR1 transition depends on chromatin closure, while the upregulation of TR1-related genes does not depend on epigenetic changes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A significant advantage of their approach lies in its detailed and comprehensive assessment of epigenetics. Their analysis of epigenetics covers chromatin open regions, histone modifications, DNA methylation, and using both single-cell and bulk techniques to validate their findings. As for their results, observations from different epigenetic perspectives mutually supported each other, lending greater credibility to their conclusions. This study effectively demonstrates that 1. the TFH-to-TR1 differentiation process is associated with massive closure of OCRs, and 2. the TR1-poised epigenome of TFH cells is a key enabler of this transdifferentiation process. Considering the extensive changes in epigenetic patterns involved in other CD4+ T lineage commitment processes, the similarity between TFH and TR1 in their epigenetics is intriguing.</p><p>They performed correlation analysis to answer the association between &quot;pMHC-NP-induced epigenetic change&quot; and &quot;gene expression change in TR1&quot;. Also, they have made their raw data publicly available, providing a comprehensive epigenomic database of pMHC-NP induced TR1 cells. This will serve as a valuable reference for future research.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A major limitation is that this study heavily relies on a premise from the previous studies performed by the same group on pMHC-NP-induced T cell responses. This significantly limits the relevance of their conclusion to a broader perspective. Specifically, differential OCRs between Tet+ and naïve T cells were limited to only 821, as compared to 10,919 differential OCRs between KLH-TFH and naïve T cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that the precursors and T cell clonotypes that responded to pMHC-NP were extremely limited. I acknowledge that this limitation has been added and discussed in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97665.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Garnica</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Consorci Institut D'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Barcelona</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sole</surname><given-names>Patricia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Consorci Institut D'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Barcelona</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yamanouchi</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Calgary</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Calgary, Alberta</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Moro</surname><given-names>Joel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Consorci Institut D'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Barcelona</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mondal</surname><given-names>Debajyoti</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Calgary</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Calgary, Alberta</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fandos</surname><given-names>Cesar</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Consorci Institut D'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Barcelona</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Serra</surname><given-names>Pau</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Consorci Institut D'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Barcelona</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Santamaria</surname><given-names>Pere</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Calgary</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Calgary, Alberta</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Dr. Santamaria's group previously utilized antigen-specific nanomedicines to induce immune tolerance in treating autoimmune diseases.

We have added the following text to the Discussion to address this concern: “The current study provides a foundational understanding of how the epigenetic landscape of TFH cells evolves as they transdifferentiate into TR1 progeny in response to chronic ligation of cognate TCRs using pMHCII-NPs. Our current studies focus on functional validation of these observations, by carrying out extensive perturbation studies of the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation pathway in conditional transcription factor gene knock-out mice. In these ongoing studies, genes coding for a series of transcription factors expressed along the TFH-TR1 pathway are selectively knocked out in T cells, to ascertain (i) the specific roles of key transcription factors in the various cell conversion events and transcriptional changes that take place along the TFH-TR1 cell axis; (ii) the roles that such transcription factors play in the chromatin re-modeling events that underpin the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation process; and (iii) the effects of transcription factor gene deletion on phenotypic and functional readouts of TFH and regulatory T cell function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) This study successfully identified key transcription factors and epigenetic marks.

This event is followed by immediate transdifferentiation of the proliferated TFH cells into transitional and terminally differentiated TR1 subsets. Although the snapshot provided by our single cell studies reported herein documents the simultaneous presence of the different subsets composing the transdifferentiation pathway at any given time point, the transdifferentiation process itself is extremely fast, such that proliferated TFH cells already transdifferentiate into TR1 cells after a single pMHCII-NP dose (Sole et al., 2023a). This makes it extremely challenging to pursue dynamic experiments. Notwithstanding this caveat, ongoing studies of cognate T cells post treatment withdrawal, coupled to single cell studies of the TFHTR1 pathway in transcription factor gene knockout mice exhibiting perturbed transdifferentiation processes are likely to shed light into the progression and stability of the epigenetic changes reported herein.</p><p>To address this limitation in the manuscript, we have added the following paragraph to the Discussion: “Although the snapshot provided by our single cell studies reported herein documents the simultaneous presence of the different subsets composing the TFH-TR1 cell pathway upon the termination of treatment, the transdifferentiation process itself is extremely fast, such that proliferated TFH cells already transdifferentiate into TR1 cells after a single pMHCII-NP dose (6).

Our current studies focus on functional validation of these observations, by carrying out extensive perturbation studies of the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation pathway in conditional transcription factor gene knock-out mice. In these ongoing studies, genes coding for a series of transcription factors expressed along the TFH-TR1 pathway are selectively knocked out in T cells, to ascertain (i) the specific roles of key transcription factors in the various cell conversion events and transcriptional changes that take place along the TFH-TR1 cell axis; (ii) the roles that such transcription factors play in the chromatin re-modeling events that underpin the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation process; and (iii) the effects of transcription factor gene deletion on phenotypic and functional readouts of TFH and regulatory T cell function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors may consider adjusting figures where genes are crowded or difficult to read due to small font size.</p></disp-quote><p>Figures with crowded text have been modified to facilitate reading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study, based on their previous findings that TFH cells can be converted into TR1 cells, conducted a highly detailed and comprehensive epigenetic investigation to answer whether TR1 differentiation from TFH is driven by epigenetic changes. Their evidence indicated that the downregulation of TFH-related genes during the TFH to TR1 transition depends on chromatin closure, while the upregulation of TR1-related genes does not depend on epigenetic changes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) A significant advantage of their approach lies in its detailed and comprehensive assessment of epigenetics. Their analysis of epigenetics covers chromatin open regions, histone modifications, DNA methylation, and using both single-cell and bulk techniques to validate their findings. As for their results, observations from different epigenetic perspectives mutually supported each other, lending greater credibility to their conclusions. This study effectively demonstrates that (1) the TFH-to-TR1 differentiation process is associated with massive closure of OCRs, and (2) the TR1-poised epigenome of TFH cells is a key enabler of this transdifferentiation process. Considering the extensive changes in epigenetic patterns involved in other CD4+ T lineage commitment processes, the similarity between TFH and TR1 in their epigenetics is intriguing.</p><p>(2) They performed correlation analysis to answer the association between &quot;pMHC-NPinduced epigenetic change&quot; and &quot;gene expression change in TR1&quot;. Also, they have made their raw data publicly available, providing a comprehensive epigenomic database of pMHC-NPinduced TR1 cells. This will serve as a valuable reference for future research.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) A major limitation is that this study heavily relies on a premise from the previous studies performed by the same group on pMHC-NP-induced T-cell responses. This significantly limits the relevance of their conclusion to a broader perspective. Specifically, differential OCRs between Tet+ and naïve T cells were limited to only 821, as compared to 10,919 differential OCRs between KLH-TFH and naïve T cells (Figure 2A), indicating that the precursors and T cell clonotypes that responded to pMHC-NP were extremely limited. This limitation should be clearly discussed in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this study focuses on a very specific, previously unrecognized pathway discovered in mice treated with pMHCII-NPs. Despite this apparent narrow perspective, we now have evidence that this is a naturally occurring pathway that also develops in other contexts (i.e., in mice that have not been treated with pMHCII-NPs). Furthermore, this pathway affords a unique opportunity to further understand the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms underpinning T cell plasticity; the findings reported can help guide/inform not only upcoming translational studies of pMHCII-NP therapy in humans, but also other research in this area.</p><p>We have added the following text to the Discussion to address this limitation: “Although the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation was discovered in mice treated with pMHCII-NPs, we now have evidence that this is a naturally occurring pathway that also develops in other contexts (i.e., in mice that have not been treated with pMHCII-NPs). Importantly, the discovery of this transdifferentiation process affords a unique opportunity to further understand the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms underpinning T cell plasticity; the findings reported here can help guide/inform not only upcoming translational studies of pMHCII-NP therapy in humans, but also other research in this area”.</p><p>We acknowledge that, in the bulk ATAC-seq studies, the differences in the number of OCRs found in tetramer+ cells or KLH-induced TFH cells vs. naïve T cells may be influenced by the intrinsic oligoclonality of the tetramer+ T cell pool arising in response to repeated pMHCII-NP challenge (Sole et al., 2023a). However, we note that our scATAC-seq studies of the tetramer+ T cell pool found similar differences between the oligoclonal tetramer+ TFH subpool and its (also oligoclonal) tetramer+ TR1 counterparts (i.e., substantially higher number of OCRs in the former vs. the latter relative to naïve T cells).</p><p>This has been clarified in the revised version of the manuscript, by adding the following text to the last paragraph of the Results subsection entitled “Contraction of the chromatin in pMHCII-NP-induced Tet+ vs. TFH cells at the bulk level”: “We acknowledge that, in the bulk ATAC-seq studies, the differences in the number of OCRs found in tetramer+ cells or KLHinduced TFH cells vs. naïve T cells may be influenced by the intrinsic oligoclonality of the tetramer+ T cell pool arising in response to repeated pMHCII-NP challenge (6).

However, they did not discuss the differences in histone modification intensities measured by ChIP-seq. For example, as shown in Figure 6C, IL10 H3K27ac modification in Tet+ cells showed significantly higher intensity than KLH-TFH, while in this article, it may be categorized as &quot;possessing same histone modification region&quot;. This will strengthen their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your suggestion to discuss differences in histone modification intensities as measured by ChIP-seq. However, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s interpretation of these data.</p><p>Our study primarily focuses on the identification of epigenetic similarities and differences between pMHCII-NP-induced tetramer+ cells and KLH-induced TFH cells relative to naive T cells. The outcome of direct comparisons of histone deposition (ChIP-seq) between these cell types is summarized in the lower part of Figure 4B and detailed in Datasheet 5. Throughout this section, we mention the number of differentially enriched regions, their overlap with OCRs shared between tetramer+ TFH and tetramer+ TR1 cells based on scATAC-seq data, and the associated genes. Clearly, the epigenetic modifications that TR1 cells inherit from TFH cells were acquired by TFH cells upon differentiation from naïve T cell precursors.</p><p>Regarding the specific point raised by the reviewer on differences in the intensity of the H3K27Ac peaks linked to <italic>Il10</italic> in Figure 6C, we note that the genomic tracks shown are illustrative. Thorough statistical analyses involving signal background for each condition and p-value adjustment did not support differential enrichment for H3K27Ac deposition around the <italic>Il10</italic> gene between pMHCII-NP-induced tetramer+ T cells and KLH-induced TFH cells.</p><p>This has now been clarified by adding the following text to the end of the Results subsection entitled ”H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac marks in genes upregulated during the TFH-to-TR1 cell conversion are already in place at the TFH cell stage”: “We note that, although in the representative chromosome track views shown in Fig. 6C there appear to be differences in the intensity of the peaks, thorough statistical analyses involving signal background for each condition and p-value adjustment did not support differential enrichment for histone deposition around the Il10 gene between pMHCII-NP-induced tetramer+ T cells and KLH-induced TFH cells.”</p><p>We have also clarified this in the corresponding section of the Methods section (“ATACseq and ChIP-seq” under “Bioinformatic and Statistical Analyses”): “Given that peak calling alone does not account for variations in the intensity of histone mark deposition, analysis of differential histone deposition includes both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Whereas qualitative assessment involves evaluating the overall pattern and distribution of the various histone marks, quantitative assessment measures the intensity and magnitude of histone mark deposition.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Last, the key findings of this study are clear and convincing, but some results and figures are unnecessary and redundant. Some results are largely a mere confirmation of the relationship between histone marks and chromatin status. I propose to reduce the number of figures and text that are largely confirmatory. Overall, I feel this paper is too long for its current contents.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand your concern about the potential redundancy of some results and figures. Our aim in including these analyses was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationships between epigenetic features and transcriptomic differences. We believe that a detailed examination of these relationships is crucial for several reasons: (i) the breadth of the data allows for a thorough exploration of the relationships between histone marks, open chromatin status and transcriptional differences. This comprehensive approach helps to ensure that our conclusions are robust and well-supported; (ii) some of the results that may appear confirmatory are, in fact, important for validating and reinforcing the consistency of our findings across different contexts. These details are intended to provide a nuanced understanding of the interactions between epigenetic features and gene expression; and (iii) By presenting a detailed analysis, we aim to offer a solid foundation for future research in this area. The extensive data presented will serve as a valuable resource for others in the field who may seek to build on our findings.</p><p>That said, we have carefully reviewed the manuscript to identify and streamline elements that might be perceived as overly redundant, while retaining the depth of analysis that we believe is essential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) In Figure 1E, the text states &quot;94% (n=217/231) of the genes associated with chromatin regions that had closed during the TFH-TR1 conversion,&quot;, but n=231 do not match with n=1820 provided in Figure 1D as downregulated genes.
