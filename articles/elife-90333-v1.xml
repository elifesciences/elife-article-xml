symptoms including hyperphagia, hyperlipidemia, severe obesity, and autism phenotypes. RAI1 is a transcriptional regulator with a pan-neural expression pattern and hundreds of downstream targets. The mechanisms linking neural <italic>Rai1</italic> to body weight regulation remain unclear. Here we find that hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its downstream signalling are disrupted in SMS (<italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) mice. Selective <italic>Rai1</italic> loss from all BDNF-producing cells or from BDNF-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) induced obesity in mice. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that <italic>Rai1</italic> ablation decreased the intrinsic excitability of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons. Chronic treatment of SMS mice with LM22A-4 engages neurotrophin downstream signalling and delayed obesity onset. This treatment also partially rescued disrupted lipid profiles, insulin intolerance, and stereotypical repetitive behaviour in SMS mice. These data argue that RAI1 regulates body weight and metabolic function through hypothalamic BDNF-producing neurons and that targeting neurotrophin downstream signalling might improve associated SMS phenotypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>retinoic acid induced 1</kwd><kwd>brain-derived neurotrophic factor</kwd><kwd>paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Javed</surname><given-names>Sehrish</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rare Disease: Models &amp; Mechanisms Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Wei-Hsiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Smith-Magenis Syndrome Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Wei-Hsiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RAI1 regulates molecular signalling and intrinsic excitability of hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor neurons important for energy homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity is an increasing global concern: 20% of the world’s adult population is expected to become obese by 2025 if current trends persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collaboration NCDRF, 2017</xref>). However, the complex environmental, behavioural, and genetic contributions to obesity make this a complex condition to model and address. Monogenic obesity disorders provide a consistent system where the pathophysiology, genetic predisposition, and neurobiology underlying phenotypes can potentially provide insights that translate to polygenic obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loos and Yeo, 2022</xref>).</p><p>One such monogenic disorder is Smith–Magenis syndrome (SMS; OMIM #182290) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 1986</xref>), a neurogenetic condition frequently associated with obesity. Eighty percent of SMS cases are caused by interstitial deletions of the 17p11.2 chromosomal region containing a dosage-sensitive gene, <italic>retinoic acid-induced 1</italic> (<italic>RAI1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Slager et al., 2003</xref>). Most SMS patients are overweight (40% &gt;95th percentile weight, 80% &gt;85th percentile weight) and exhibit overeating tendencies by adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alaimo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burns et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gandhi et al., 2022</xref>). Twenty percent of SMS patients do not have 17p11.2 deletions but instead carry <italic>RAI1</italic> point mutations that are still frequently associated with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edelman et al., 2007</xref>). These clinical data indicate that RAI is critical for body weight regulation.</p><p>The human RAI1 protein shares &gt;80% sequence identity with the mouse RAI1 protein, allowing us to study RAI1 function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Javed et al., 2020</xref>). We previously found that <italic>Rai1</italic> encodes a transcriptional regulator that binds to the promoter or enhancer regions of its target genes, most of which are involved in neurodevelopment and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). SMS (<italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) mice exhibit obesity associated with hyperphagia and increased adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burns et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, RAI1 may have a sexually dimorphic function as female SMS mice exhibit more pronounced obesity than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burns et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Using a homozygous <italic>Rai1</italic> conditional knockout (<italic>Rai1</italic>-cKO) mice, we found that <italic>Rai1</italic> deletion in either subcortical excitatory neurons (vGlut2<sup>+</sup>) or single-minded homolog 1 (Sim1<sup>+</sup>) neurons induced obesity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Sim1<sup>+</sup> neurons reside in several brain regions including the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, the supraoptic nucleus, the medial amygdala, and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), a region that is critical for body weight regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balthasar et al., 2005</xref>). Sim1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the PVH are composed of several molecularly defined cell types, including those that express oxytocin, vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, somatostatin, melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4R), growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2015</xref>). Deleting <italic>Bdnf</italic> from the PVH results in obesity due to increased food intake, reduced energy expenditure, and reduced locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2015</xref>). While PVH neuronal activity is reduced during feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), activation of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons results in weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu and Xu, 2022</xref>). We recently found that RAI1 promotes <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression in the hypothalamus throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Javed et al., 2021</xref>). We hypothesized that RAI11 may be connected to BDNF-producing neurons in PVH, explaining how a neural transcription factor regulates body weight homeostasis.</p><p>BDNF regulates energy metabolism by binding to its cognate receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TRKB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2015</xref>) and may thus provide a potential therapeutic target for SMS. However, the link between <italic>RAI1, BDNF</italic>, and SMS symptoms is unclear. Patients carrying monogenic mutations in either <italic>BDNF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2006</xref>) or <italic>NTRK2</italic> (encoding TRKB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeo et al., 2004</xref>) experience severe hyperphagic obesity. Moreover, obesity and associated metabolic dysfunctions such as impaired glucose and insulin sensitivity are correlated with impaired PI3K-AKT pathway, a TRKB downstream target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Su et al., 2021</xref>). Given that (1) <italic>Bdnf</italic> overexpression during early embryonic development or (2) targeting <italic>Bdnf</italic> overexpression to the PVH of adolescent SMS (<italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) mice protected them from weight gain and metabolic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Javed et al., 2021</xref>), and that (3) a point mutation in <italic>RAI1</italic> disrupts its ability to transcriptionally enhance <italic>BDNF</italic> expression in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2018</xref>), pharmacological targeting of neurotrophin downstream signalling is an attractive and yet unexplored therapeutic avenue for SMS.</p><p>Building on our previous discoveries, here we examine the neurobiological functions of RAI1 in BDNF-producing neurons, specifically those that reside in the PVH. Importantly, we evaluated the involvement of the BDNF-TRKB pathways in SMS pathogenesis using a small molecule drug (LM22A-4) to enhance neurotrophin downstream signalling. Our work indicates that PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons depend on RAI1 to maintain normal neuronal activity and regulate body weight homeostasis, and dysfunction of BDNF downstream signalling contributes to obesity associated with SMS mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Rai1</italic> deficiency dysregulates specific downstream targets of neurotrophin in the mouse hypothalamus</title><p>Multiple lines of evidence indicated that SMS mice show decreased <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA expression in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burns et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Javed et al., 2021</xref>).

These molecules are known to play a critical role in regulating body weight homeostasis and can be activated by BDNF either directly (neurotrophin pathway) or indirectly (PI3K-AKT and mTOR pathways) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cota et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schultze et al., 2012</xref>).

These results suggest that obesity in male cKO mice is attributable to overeating despite increased energy expenditure.</p><p>To determine if <italic>Rai1</italic> loss from BDNF-producing cells impacts metabolic function, a glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed. Interestingly, cKO mice of both sexes showed normal blood glucose levels right before the test but became hyperglycaemic 20 min (female cKO) and 45 min (male cKO) after glucose administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4N</xref>).

To understand how <italic>Rai1</italic> loss affects intrinsic neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons that underlie energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2015</xref>), we fluorescently labelled them with Cre-dependent tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We found that a hyperpolarized step followed by increasing the holding voltage at resting membrane potentials (Rm) was able to initiate rebound firing or rebound repetitive firing in most PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hyperpolarization-induced <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> currents and low depolarization events were observed in some PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). cKO PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons showed reduced action potential (AP) firing frequency at a holding voltage of –60 mV compared to Ctrl PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). The resting membrane potential (Rm) of cKO (–52 mV) neurons showed a 10 mV positive shift compared to Ctrl neurons (–62 mV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We also found that fewer cKO PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons showed spontaneous firing at Rm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, Ctrl:10/13; cKO:5/12) and at a holding voltage of –70 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, Ctrl:6/12; cKO:1/12) compared to Ctrl PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons. The threshold of the first AP initiated by a ramp current injection (1 nA/s) from Rm was significantly increased in cKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Because a wider shoulder and lower AP amplitude were observed when held at more depolarized potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we compared the AP waveforms at a holding voltage of –60 mV, close to the Rm of both genotypes. The AP of the cKO group exhibited a lower peak amplitude (measuring from the threshold to peak) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), a normal threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>), and a normal half-width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In summary, we found that both passive and AP properties of cKO PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons were altered due to RAI1 loss. The Rm of cKO neurons shifted to a more positive voltage than the gating threshold of voltage-gated sodium channels (6/12 were more positive than –55 mV), which was unfavourable for their transition from the inactivation state to the closed state.

The role of BDNF-producing neurons in human obesity disorders and how the activity of these cells is regulated remained poorly studied. We found that <italic>Rai1</italic> deficiency, linked to SMS, regulates BDNF expression and maintains intrinsic excitability in PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons.</p><p>Consistent with this mechanism, we found that removing RAI1 from BDNF-producing neurons or PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons results in imbalanced energy homeostasis and obesity. A small molecule drug LM22A-4 led to increased AKT phosphorylation and partially rescued locomotor activity, insulin intolerance, and HDL levels, while delaying the onset of obesity in SMS mice. These findings highlight a potential role for hypothalamic BDNF-producing neurons, specifically PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons, in SMS pathogenesis and highlight BDNF signalling as a potentially druggable pathway to improve energy homeostasis defects and repetitive behaviours commonly observed in SMS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burns et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moss et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The involvement of different PVH subtypes in human obesity is only beginning to be elucidated. Dysfunction of oxytocin PVH neurons is linked to the Prader–Willi syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), another genetic disorder associated with obesity. Since <italic>Rai1</italic> expression is enriched in PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons but not PVH<sup>Oxytocin</sup> neurons, our data suggest that distinct pathophysiological mechanisms underlie SMS and Prader–Willi syndrome.</p><p>The conditional knockout analysis allowed us to precisely map the cell-specific origin of neuropathological phenotypes, such as SMS-like symptoms in mice. Our previous work found that deleting <italic>Rai1</italic> from cortical excitatory neurons using an <italic>Emx1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>), from the GABAergic neurons using a <italic>Gad2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>), or from astrocytes using a <italic>Gfap<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garcia et al., 2004</xref>) did not induce SMS-like obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, obesity could be induced by ablating <italic>Rai1</italic> from Sim1-lineage neurons and, to a lesser extent, SF1-lineage neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). This analysis suggests that Rai1 expression in PVH is more important than in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) for body weight regulation. Interestingly, although BDNF is required in the VMH and DMH to regulate body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Unger et al., 2007</xref>), embryonic deletion of <italic>Bdnf</italic> from the SF1-lineage populations including the VMH did not result in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kamitakahara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast, deleting <italic>Bdnf</italic> from Sim1-lineage neurons including the PVH resulted in a more severe obesity phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2015</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that BDNF expression in PVH is critical for energy homeostasis. We found that <italic>Rai1</italic> expression in BDNF-producing cells regulates energy homeostasis in a sexually dimorphic manner. Specifically, female cKO mice showed normal food intake, decreased energy expenditure, and reduced locomotor activity. In contrast, male cKO mice showed increased food intake with no changes in locomotor activity. Intriguingly, energy expenditure was increased in male cKO mice, likely due to the higher demand to maintain normal activity levels in obese mice. In both sexes, cKO mice showed an increased fat mass and adiposity with no change in lean mass, highlighting an essential role for Rai1 in regulating fat deposition. Our data also indicate that BDNF-producing cells are only partially responsible for obesity in SMS: male and female cKO mice become overweight by 15 wk, in contrast to SMS mice which become obese by 9 wk of age, suggesting that non-BDNF neurons contribute to SMS phenotypes.</p><p>Notably, mice lacking one copy of <italic>Rai1</italic> in the BDNF-producing cells do not exhibit obesity, whereas SMS patients and SMS mice show pronounced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burns et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). This indicates that although reduced <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression and BDNF-producing neurons contribute to regulating body weight, additional molecular changes and other hypothalamic populations also play important roles in regulating body weight homeostasis in SMS. Our RPPA data suggest that mTOR signalling is also misregulated in addition to the reduced activation of the neurotrophin downstream cascades. Hypothalamic mTORC1 is crucial to regulate glucose release from the liver, peripheral lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2015</xref>), while mTORC2 regulates glucose tolerance and fat mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kocalis et al., 2014</xref>). How the impaired mTOR signalling contributes to energy homeostasis defects in SMS and the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway to treat SMS-related obesity remains unclear and warrants future investigation.</p><p>What additional RAI1-dependent hypothalamic cell types residing in brain regions other than PVH regulate obesity in SMS? Other important cell types such as TRKB neurons within the PVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">An et al., 2020</xref>) and several RAI1-expressing hypothalamic nuclei including the arcuate nucleus, VMH, and lateral hypothalamus all play important roles in regulating energy homeostasis. POMC- and AGRP-expressing neurons within the arcuate nucleus are known to regulate food intake and glucose and insulin homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Quarta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vohra et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Rai1</italic> function in these neurons could contribute to obesity in SMS, a topic that awaits future investigation.</p><p>We found the metabolic phenotypes induced by deleting <italic>Rai1</italic> from BDNF-producing cells were specifically due to <italic>Rai1</italic> deletion in PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons. Therefore, our study focused on PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons. Electrophysiological experiments showed that most wild-type PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons display high-frequency spontaneous AP firing (1–10 Hz) at the resting membrane potential. Most PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons fire sharp APs held at a hyperpolarized potential and show repetitive overshoot during the current ramp test. Loss of <italic>Rai1</italic> significantly reduced the intrinsic neuronal excitability of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons. Because GABAergic <italic>Rai1</italic> loss did not induce obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>) and most BDNF-producing neurons are glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canals et al., 2001</xref>). The ionic changes in PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons that precisely explain these excitability changes await future investigations. Different groups of PVH neurons show phasic bursting or slowly inactivating delayed rectifier potassium conductance, which are properties mediated by different potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Given that our previous RNA-seq experiment found that hypothalamic Rai1 loss induces misexpression of potassium channel subunits <italic>Kcnc2</italic> and <italic>Kcnj11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), RAI1-dependent potassium channels are likely involved in altered neuronal activity. Furthermore, we found fewer low threshold depolarization events in cKO PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons during the hyperpolarized voltage step, suggesting a potential involvement of HCN channels.</p><p>Our previous work found that <italic>Rai1</italic> loss in the dentate gyrus resulted in neuronal hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2022</xref>). Here we demonstrated that <italic>Rai1</italic> loss in the hypothalamus resulted in neuronal hypoactivity, suggesting that RAI1 regulates neuronal excitability in a cell type-specific manner. Reduced PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neuronal activity upon <italic>Rai1</italic> loss could potentially explain obesity, consistent with a previous report that found chemogenetic activation of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons promotes negative energy balance by decreasing feeding and increasing energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu and Xu, 2022</xref>).</p><p>It is plausible that RAI1 regulates the expression of genes encoding inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels, which regulate neuronal activity and potentially energy homeostasis. For instance, KIR6 (a family of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, K<sub>ATP</sub>) is widely expressed in the hypothalamus. Deleting the hypothalamic KIR6.2 subunit impairs K<sub>ATP</sub> channel function and glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parton et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, reduced expression of hypothalamic GIRK4 (encoding an inwardly rectifying potassium channel) causes obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perry et al., 2008</xref>). GABAergic neurotransmission from arcuate AGRP-expressing neurons to the PVH neurons is important to increase appetite by favouring hyperphagia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atasoy et al., 2012</xref>). Disrupting the composition of these ion channels could contribute to reduced PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neuronal firing, which awaits further investigations.</p><p>Female mice with a conditional knockout of <italic>Rai1</italic> from BDNF-producing neurons do not display a noteworthy difference in food intake. Conversely, their male counterparts exhibit a significant increase in food intake. Although SMS individuals of both genders tend to overeat, male patients who are obese show significantly higher food consumption than their female counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gandhi et al., 2022</xref>). This observation raises the possibility that <italic>Rai1</italic> regulates eating behaviours through multiple cell types in the hypothalamus and that a male-specific involvement of BDNF-producing neurons in regulating food intake potentially provides a neurobiological basis for the observed pattern in SMS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gandhi et al., 2022</xref>). In future work, it would be interesting to dissect the sex-specific role of RAI1 in regulating the functional development of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons. In addition to a role for RAI1 in regulating neuronal activity, RAI1 may regulate other aspects of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neuronal function, including projections to other brain regions to regulate energy homeostasis. In this regard, it would be interesting to dissect how RAI1 controls the circuit connectivity of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons and how <italic>Rai1</italic> loss in PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons affects nearby PVH<sup>TRKB</sup> neurons that receive BDNF signalling and are linked to body weight regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">An et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>At the molecular level, our RPPA data show that <italic>Rai1</italic> depletion disrupted multiple intracellular signalling pathways and resulted in the hypoactivation of specific phospho-signalling proteins. Multiple early studies support the notion that Rai1 directly promotes <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression. First, hypothalamic <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA levels were reduced in SMS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burns et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Javed et al., 2021</xref>) or mice with <italic>Rai1</italic> conditional deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Second, the RAI1 protein directly binds to a promoter region of <italic>Bdnf</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, when <italic>Rai1</italic> expression was induced using CRISPR activation, <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA levels were significantly elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>To lend further support, here we show that SMS mice have reduced hypothalamic BDNF protein levels, as well as reduced activation of a TRKB downstream target AKT. Reduced AKT activity is frequently associated with insulin resistance and obesity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shao et al., 2000</xref>) and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Su et al., 2021</xref>). We also found that obesity, increased HDL levels, and insulin insensitivity in SMS mice could be partially alleviated using a small molecule drug (LM22A-4) that promotes AKT phosphorylation. LM22A-4 penetrates the blood–brain barrier reasonably well and has been shown to ameliorate symptoms of other neurological disorders associated with BDNF dysfunction including Rett syndrome, Huntington’s disease, Dravet syndrome, and refractory neonatal seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canals et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ogier et al., 2007</xref>). We recognize that while several in vivo studies have demonstrated the potential of LM22A-4 in targeting neurotrophin downstream signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>), an in vitro analysis failed to demonstrate the ability of LM22A-4 to activate TRKB directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boltaev et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the precise mechanism by which LM22A-4 enhances AKT cascades in the mammalian brain remains unclear and awaits further investigations. In the hypothalamus of SMS mice, LM22A-4 could indirectly engage neurotrophin downstream PI3K-AKT pathway through the G protein-coupled receptor-dependent transactivation of the TRKB receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Domeniconi and Chao, 2010</xref>) or other unknown mechanisms. Moreover, while LM22A-4 may have potential side effects, we found that wild-type mice treated with LM22A-4 did not show a further decrease in body weight, suggesting limited side effects regarding body weight regulation.</p><p>The partial rescue of SMS phenotypes that we observed contrasts with our previous findings that found (1) AAV-mediated BDNF overexpression in PVH at 3 wk of age and (2) genetically overexpressing BDNF from early development could fully prevent the development of obesity in SMS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Javed et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, further increasing TRKB signalling activation and earlier intervention might improve therapeutic outcomes. Alternatively, our RPPA data showed that in addition to disruption of neurotrophin signalling, multiple pathways including mTOR were downregulated in SMS. Increasing hypothalamic mTOR activity has been shown to decrease food intake and body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cota et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that enhancing both mTOR and TRKB signalling could achieve a more robust rescue of obesity in SMS mice. Nevertheless, these data support the concept that drugging TRKB signalling may improve stereotypical repetitive behaviour and partially alleviate metabolic functions in a mouse model of SMS. Delayed symptom onset could provide a window of opportunity for other interventions to further modify disease progression, an area requiring further investigation.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, whether the PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons depend on Rai1 to regulate adaptive thermogenesis awaits future analysis. It is known that a subset of posterior PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons project to the spinal cord and regulate thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2015</xref>). However, we found the weights of brown adipocytes were similar in control and cKO mice. Moreover, SMS mice have normal respiratory exchange rates and there are currently no reports of defective adaptive thermogenesis in SMS patients. This suggests that adaptive thermogenesis is not impacted in SMS. Another limitation is that we did not test different doses, durations, and time points for LM22A-4 treatment. The precise mechanisms by which LM22A-4 improves body weight, metabolic function, and repetitive behaviours remain unknown. Nevertheless, our work identifies RAI1 as a novel regulator of the neuronal excitability of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons. This regulation is critical for regulating food intake and energy expenditure. Our evidence suggests that BDNF-producing neurons are involved in SMS pathogenesis and that enhancing BDNF-TRKB signalling should be explored as a future therapeutic avenue for obesity and metabolic conditions associated with reduced neurotrophin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu and Xie, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal management</title><p>The animal protocol (MUHC-8127) was approved by the animal care committee of the Montreal General Hospital and was performed according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

Rai1 haploinsufficiency leads to the monogenic disorder Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), which is associated with excessive feeding, obesity and intellectual disability. Consistent with findings in human subjects, Rai1+/- mice and mice with conditional deletion of Rai1 in Sim+ neurons, which are abundant in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), exhibit hyperphagia, obesity and increased adiposity.

In previous investigations, the author's research group identified abnormal expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hypothalamus of a mouse model exhibiting Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), which is caused by heterozygous mutations of the Rai1 gene. Human SMS is associated with distinct facial characteristics, sleep disturbances, behavioral issues, and intellectual disabilities, often accompanied by obesity. Conditional knockout (cKO) of the Bdnf gene from the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) in mice led to hyperphagic obesity, while overexpression of the Bdnf gene in the PVH of Rai1 heterozygous mice restored the SMS-like obese phenotype. Based on these preceding findings, the authors of the present study discovered that homozygous Rai1 cKO restricted to Bdnf-expressing cells, or Rai1 gene knockdown solely in Bdnf-positive neurons in the PVH, induced obesity along with intricate alterations in adipose tissue composition, energy expenditure, locomotion, feeding patterns, and glucose tolerance, some of which varied between sexes. Additionally, the authors demonstrated that a brain-penetrating drug capable of activating the AKT cascades, a downstream signaling pathway of BDNF, partially alleviated the SMS-like obesity phenotype in female mice with Rai1 heterozygous mutations.

It would be advantageous to precisely identify the responsible differentially expressed genes, possibly including Bdnf itself, in the homozygous cKO model. The observed reduction in the excitability of PVH BDNF+ cells (Fig. 3) is presumably attributed to aberrant gene expression other than Bdnf itself, which may serve as a prospective target for gene expression analysis.

Rai1 haploinsufficiency leads to the monogenic disorder Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), which is associated with excessive feeding, obesity and intellectual disability. Consistent with findings in human subjects, Rai1+/- mice and mice with conditional deletion of Rai1 in Sim+ neurons, which are abundant in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), exhibit hyperphagia, obesity and increased adiposity. Furthermore, RAI1-deficient mice exhibit reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a satiety factor essential for the central control of energy balance.

For example, the authors report that more than 50% of BDNF+ neurons in PVN also express pTrkB whereas about 20% of pTrkB+ cells contain BDNF, raising the possibility that autocrine mechanisms might be at play. This is in conflict with a previous study by An et al, (2015) showing that these cell populations are largely non-overlapping in the PVN.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this assessment. Given the difficulty of using immunostaining to characterize the expression of membrane proteins in vivo, and the specificity of the pTrkB antibody in different tissues remains unknown, it is difficult to interpret the signals we observed. We have excluded the data because the histological analysis of p-TRKB and BDNF autocrine/paracrine signalling is not a focus of the present study. Future studies using a more advanced genetic method (i.e., Ntrk2CreER/+; Ai9 mouse line as used by An et al., 2015) is more suitable and should be used in the future to investigate the function of Rai1 in the TRKB+ neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue that deserves more in-depth discussion is that diminished BDNF function appears to play a minor part driving deficits in energy balance regulation. Accordingly, both global central depletion of Rai1 in BDNF+ neurons during development and deletion of Rai1 in BDNF+ neurons in the adult PVN elicited modest effects on body weight (less than 18% increase) and did not affect food intake. This contrasts with mice with selective Bdnf deletion in the adult PVN, which are hyperphagic and dramatically obese (90% heavier than controls).

The results from the proteomic analysis of hypothalamic tissue of Rai1 mutant mice and controls could be useful in generating alternative hypotheses. Depleting RAI1 in BDNF+ neurons had a robust effect compromising glycemic control. However, as the approach does not necessarily impact BDNF exclusively, there should be a larger discussion of alternative mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these insightful comments.

For instance, KIR6 (a family of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, KATP) is widely expressed in the hypothalamus. Deleting the hypothalamic KIR6.2 subunit impairs KATP channel function and glucose tolerance (Miki et al., 2001; Parton et al., 2007). Moreover, reduced expression of hypothalamic GIRK4 (encoding an inwardly rectifying potassium channel) causes obesity (Perry et al., 2008). GABAergic neurotransmission from arcuate AGRP-expressing neurons to the PVH neurons is important to increase appetite by favouring hyperphagia (Atasoy et al., 2012). Disrupting the composition of these ion channels could contribute to reduced PVHBDNF neuronal firing, which awaits further investigations.”</p><p>Moreover, to facilitate the future exploration of the potential relevance of sexual differences to human SMS cases, we have incorporated the following explanation in the discussion section.</p><p>Lines 419-426: “Female mice with a conditional knockout of Rai1 from BDNF-producing neurons do not display a noteworthy difference in food intake. Conversely, their male counterparts exhibit a significant increase in food intake. Although SMS individuals of both genders tend to overeat, male patients who are obese show significantly higher food consumption than their female counterparts (Gandhi et al., 2022). This observation raises the possibility that Rai1 regulates eating behaviours through multiple cell types in the hypothalamus and that a male-specific involvement of BDNF-producing neurons in regulating food intake, potentially provides a neurobiological basis for the observed pattern in SMS patients (Gandhi et al., 2022).”</p><p>To exclude the possibility of other brain regions adjacent to the PVH (such as VMH and arcuate nucleus) being affected by our AAV-CRISPR-mediated Rai1 knockout, we have analyzed other hypothalamic regions including VMH and arcuate nucleus from the same slides used to confirm PVH viral expression and we confirmed that the AAV was not expressed in these regions. We have incorporated a representative image (Figure 4 suppl 1F) depicting limiting AAV expression in these nuclei.</p><p>Regarding LM22A-4: It is possible that LM22A-4 functions directly through binding to TRKB or indirectly engages TRKB downstream molecules through activating other receptors such as GPCR. LM22A-4 appears to engage neurotrophin downstream PI3KAKT pathway, which was identified by our RPPA analysis to be downregulated in the hypothalamus of Rai1-deficient mice. Reduced AKT activity is associated with insulin resistance and obesity in mice. Restoration of functional activity of AKT by LM22A-4 could be the primary mode of action for this drug in the brain. However, since we observed that this drug only partially rescued the body weight defect, future research exploring more potent TrkB agonists or utilizing a combination therapy that targets both the neurotrophin and mTOR pathways might yield improved responses to the pharmacological interventions. We have included the following paragraph in the discussion:</p><p>Lines 451-461: “ We recognize that while several in vivo studies have demonstrated the potential of LM22A-4 in targeting neurotrophin downstream signalling (Kron et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017), an in vitro analysis failed to demonstrate the ability of LM22A-4 to activate TrkB directly (Boltaev et al., 2017). Therefore, the precise mechanism by which LM22A-4 enhances AKT cascades in the mammalian brain remains unclear and awaits further investigations. In the hypothalamus of SMS mice, LM22A-4 could indirectly engage neurotrophin downstream PI3KAKT pathway through the G protein-coupled receptor-dependent transactivation of the TRKB receptor (Domeniconi &amp; Chao, 2010) or other unknown mechanisms.

The manuscript would benefit from improved usage and precise descriptions of statistics. The authors often provided only general statements such as &quot;one or two-way ANOVA&quot; without specifying the exact statistical tests used. It is important to differentiate between one-way and two-way ANOVA, particularly when using the latter, by clearly indicating the within-group effects and interaction effects. The representation of p-values associated with ANOVA using asterisks requires clarification, specifying which statistics indicate ANOVA results and which ones correspond to post hoc analysis. It is advisable to assess the normality of the distribution before employing t-tests or consider non-parametric comparisons such as Wilcoxon's rank sum test if normality assumptions are not met. Additionally, it is essential to specify whether the tests are one-sided or two-sided and whether they are paired or unpaired. In some figure panels, such as Fig. 2H and K, the statistical tests used were not indicated at all.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the exact statistical tests in the figure legend for each figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.
