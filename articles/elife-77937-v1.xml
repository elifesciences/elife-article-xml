reorganization and drastic reshaping of the proteome landscape. Failure of ordered erythropoiesis is associated with anaemias and haematological malignancies. Although the ubiquitin system is a known crucial post-translational regulator in erythropoiesis, how the erythrocyte is reshaped by the ubiquitin system is poorly understood. By measuring the proteomic landscape of in vitro human erythropoiesis models, we found dynamic differential expression of subunits of the CTLH E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that formed maturation stage-dependent assemblies of topologically homologous RANBP9- and RANBP10-CTLH complexes. Moreover, protein abundance of CTLH’s cognate E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBE2H increased during terminal differentiation, and UBE2H expression depended on catalytically active CTLH E3 complexes. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated inactivation of CTLH E3 assemblies or UBE2H in erythroid progenitors revealed defects, including spontaneous and accelerated erythroid maturation as well as inefficient enucleation. Thus, we propose that dynamic maturation stage-specific changes of UBE2H-CTLH E2-E3 modules control the orderly progression of human erythropoiesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Ubiquitylation</kwd><kwd>erythropoiesis</kwd><kwd>E3 ubiquitin ligase</kwd><kwd>CTLH E3 complex</kwd><kwd>UBE2H</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHU3196/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schulman</surname><given-names>Brenda A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schulman</surname><given-names>Brenda A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Erythroid maturation-dependent remodelling of CTLH E3 complex, along with its cognate E2, controls the orderly progression of human erythropoiesis, thus establishing a paradigm for other E2-E3 ubiquitylation modules involved in developmental processes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular differentiation in multicellular organisms is often accompanied by programmed proteome reshaping and cellular reorganization to accomplish cell-type-specific functions. For instance, during myogenesis proliferative myoblasts undergo a differentiation programme with induction of specialized cytoskeletal proteins to form myofibrils in terminally differentiated myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chal and Pourquie, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Le Bihan et al., 2015</xref>), whereas adipose stem cells induce differentiation cues controlling expression of proteins involved in lipid storage and lipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsuji et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, global temporal proteomic analysis during neurogenesis of human embryonic stem cells revealed large-scale proteome and organelle remodelling via selective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ordureau et al., 2021</xref>). A striking example of proteome remodelling is mammalian erythropoiesis, which is required for the generation of disc-shaped enucleated erythrocytes, whose unique topology dictates function of efficient red blood cell movement through the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After several specialized cell divisions, erythroid progenitors progress through morphologically distinct differentiation stages known as pro-erythroblasts (ProE), early and late basophilic erythroblasts (EBaso and LBaso, respectively), polychromatic erythroblasts (Poly), and orthochromatic erythroblasts (Ortho), a process associated with erythroid-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cantor and Orkin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cross and Enver, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perkins et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pevny et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shivdasani et al., 1995</xref>), reduction of cell volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolznig et al., 1995</xref>), chromatin condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>), and haemoglobinization.

Ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2), components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase machinery, and deubiquitylases have been implicated in regulating protein stability and turnover in erythroid cell proliferation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maetens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mancias et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Minella et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Randle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). The E2 enzyme UBE2O is greatly upregulated in reticulocytes and required for clearing ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, a functional role of the multiprotein <italic>C-t</italic>erminal to <italic>L</italic>is<italic>H</italic> (CTLH) E3 ubiquitin ligase was implicated in mammalian erythropoiesis. The CTLH subunits MAEA and WDR26 are expressed in a differentiation stage-dependent manner and implicated in maintaining erythroblastic islands in the bone marrow and regulating nuclear condensation in developing erythroblasts, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wei et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhen et al., 2020</xref>). The tight correlation between protein abundance and functionality in differentiation suggested that large-scale proteome profiling is a potential way to identify proteins that are important for the functional specialization of erythroid cells. Here, we profiled protein abundance of E2-E3 modules in erythroid differentiation uncovering a dynamic regulation of CTLH E3 ligase subunits and its cognate E2 conjugating enzyme UBE2H. Interestingly, UBE2H amounts are dependent on active CTLH E3, suggesting a coupled E2/E3 regulation. We further show that CTLH complex composition is remodelled and complex assemblies are formed in a maturation stage-dependent manner. Our study indicates that unique UBE2H-CTLH assemblies are organized and co-regulated in functional E2-E3 modules and are required for the orderly progression of terminal erythroid maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stage-dependent expression of UBE2H and CTLH complex subunits during erythropoiesis</title><p>Reshaping of the erythropoietic proteome is thought to be regulated in part by the transient presence of stage-specific E2-E3 ubiquitin targeting machineries.

In this study, HUDEP2 cells were shifted to differentiation conditions and semi-synchronous bulk cell populations were obtained at different time points (days 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12) corresponding to maturation stages spanning from proerythroblast to orthochromatic stages. Each population was processed in three biological replicates, and their proteomes were acquired by measuring single 100 min gradient runs for each sample/replicate in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aebersold and Mann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gillet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karayel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ludwig et al., 2018</xref>).

When we clustered the 2771 differentially expressed proteins (ANOVA, false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.01 and S0 = 0.1), we observed dynamic changes of the proteome between early (day 0) and late (day 12) time points across erythroid differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Interestingly, the homologues RANBP9 and RANBP10 showed an inverse expression pattern: RANBP9 levels were high at progenitor stages and dropped at later stages, whereas RANBP10 levels exhibited the opposite pattern. Taken together, analyses of differentiation-resolved proteomes revealed stage-dependent expression of CTLH subunits and UBE2H suggesting a dynamic assembly of distinct CTLH complexes linked to erythrocyte development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Erythroid maturation stage-dependent modulation of RANBP9- and RANBP10-assembled CTLH complexes</title><p>Recent cryo-EM maps of human CTLH sub- and supramolecular complexes revealed that RANBP9 is part of a core scaffold module of the CTLH complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sherpa et al., 2021</xref>). Beyond an N-terminal extension unique to RANBP9, both homologues RANBP9 and RANBP10 have a common domain architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, we reasoned that RANBP10 may replace RANBP9 and also form topologically similar complexes and, depending on abundance and availability of RANBP9 and RANBP10, distinct RANBP9-, ‘mixed’ RANBP9/RANBP10-, and/or RANBP10-CTLH complexes may assemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we monitored CTLH complexes by fractionating whole-cell lysates from non-differentiated (day 0) or differentiated (day 6) HUDEP2 cells on 5–40% sucrose density gradients and detecting CTLH subunits by immunoblot analysis. All CTLH subunits sedimented at ≥670 kDa, corresponding to the shift observed for the supramolecular CTLH assemblies we previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sherpa et al., 2021</xref>). However, RANBP9 amounts in the CTLH fraction were higher at day 0 compared to day 6, while RANBP10 amounts had the opposite pattern, suggesting stage-specific modulation of CTLH complex composition and/or stoichiometry during differentiation. To further test stage-specific modulation of CTLH, we established a sequential immunoprecipitation (IP) protocol allowing us to determine relative proportions of RANBP9-, RANBP9/RANBP10-, and RANBP10-CTLH complexes in cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In step 1, RANBP9-assembled complexes were immunoprecipitated from lysates of differentiation days 0, 4, and 8 using RANBP9-specific antibody. Subsequently, RANBP9-depleted supernatants were subjected to step 2 for immunoprecipitation with an ARMC8-specific nanobody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) to precipitate remaining RANBP10-CTLH complexes. Immunoblot analysis of pellet 1 samples revealed a progressive decrease of precipitated RANBP9-CTLH in differentiating HUDEP2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Notably, RANBP10 was co-precipitated and relative RANBP10 amounts increased towards differentiation day 8, indicating a shift from RANBP9- to RANBP9/RANBP10-assembled CTLH complexes. Moreover, the amount of precipitated RANBP10-CTLH complexes in pellet 2 samples increased, indicating the predominant assembly of RANBP10-CTLH complexes at late stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>).

To test this, we expressed and purified a recombinant version of the core CTLH subcomplex, containing a scaffold module (RANBP10, TWA1, α-ARMC8), the catalytic module (MAEA and RMND5A), and the substrate receptor GID4 (named hereafter RANBP10-CTLH<sup>SR4</sup>). In parallel, we generated the previously described homologous complex where RANBP9 replaced RANBP10 (RANBP9-CTLH<sup>SR4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mohamed et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sherpa et al., 2021</xref>).

First, we assessed the physical association between UBE2H and CTLH complex subunits in HUDEP2 or erythroleukemia K562 cells using anti-UBE2H IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 1979</xref>). Endogenous UBE2H specifically co-precipitated the Cat-module subunit MAEA in whole-cell lysates from both cell lines, indicating that UBE2H can form a reasonably stable E2-E3 enzyme module. Next, we tested ubiquitin transfer activity by in vitro ubiquitylation assays with a fluorescently labelled model peptide substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sherpa et al., 2021</xref>). This model substrate consisted of an N-terminal PGLW sequence that binds human GID4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2018</xref>) and a 30 residue linker sequence with the target lysine (K) towards the C-terminus at position 23 (PGLW[X]<sub>30</sub>K23) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). In a reaction with UBE2H, both RANBP9-CTLH and RANBP10-CTLH promoted polyubiquitylation of the model substrate peptide in a GID4-dependent manner, although RANBP10-CTLH was less active under these conditions than the homologous RANBP9-CTLH complex. Cumulatively, biochemical and structural data revealed that RANBP9 and RANBP10 can assemble in distinct homologous CTLH complexes capable of activating UBE2H-dependent ubiquitin transfer activity.

We reasoned that association with MAEA, and presumably with RMND5A, is itself not sufficient to maintain UBE2H protein levels, but rather the catalytic activity of MAEA is required. A potential mechanism might be UBE2H autoubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, which would be triggered in case ubiquitin-transfer-efficient UBE2H-CTLH modules are not formed. Proteome analysis by different studies identified four endogenous ubiquitylation sites on UBE2H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akimov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In vitro ubiquitylation reaction with recombinant E1 and ubiquitin showed ubiquitylation of UBE2H but not of catalytic dead UBE2H-C87A mutant, indicating an autoubiquitylation mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>). Overall, we conclude that UBE2H protein amounts are coupled to the presence of active MAEA and are controlled by differentiation-induced transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptionally by proteasomal degradation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrate here that in-depth analysis of dynamic proteome profiles obtained from in vitro reconstituted erythropoiesis systems is an effective method to uncover differentiation stage-dependent expression of protein and protein complexes with functional roles in erythropoiesis. We observed that UBE2H and CTLH E3 complex assemblies form co-regulated E2-E3 modules required for erythropoiesis. Importantly, distinct protein profiles of the CTLH subunit homologues RANBP9 and RANBP10, suggest a remodelling of CTLH complex and the presence of erythroid maturation stage-dependent CTLH assemblies.</p><p>The activity and substrate specificity of multi-subunit E3 ligases are generally regulated by the control of complex subunit assembly. One of the best-studied E3 ligase complexes are members of the CRL family which engage interchangeable substrate receptor/adapter complexes for substrate-specific ubiquitylation. Substrate receptor assembly is kept in a highly dynamic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reitsma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Straube et al., 2017</xref>), whereby specific expression of substrate receptors in response to external and internal cellular cues, as well as in a cell-type and tissue-specific way, allows the formation of CRLs for selective and efficient client substrate ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGourty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ravenscroft et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, the activity of the multiprotein yeast GID (orthologue of human CTLH complex) was shown to be predominantly regulated by engaging interchangeable substrate receptors, which conceivably target distinct substrates for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chrustowicz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langlois et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu and Pfirrmann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melnykov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qiao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shin et al., 2021</xref>). However, the regulation of human CTLH activity via substrate receptor assembly is not well understood. Here we show that protein levels of GID4 did not significantly change in the HUDEP2 differentiation system, suggesting that GID4 may not be the critical substrate receptor of CTLH complex during erythropoiesis. However, the observed upregulation of the CTLH subunit WDR26, in conjunction with the recent evidence that WDR26 can function as a substrate receptor module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mohamed et al., 2021</xref>), promotes the idea of a potential regulatory role of WDR26. Moreover, other, not yet identified substrate receptors might also exist and assemble with CTLH complex in an erythroid maturation-dependent manner. Besides WDR26, other CTLH subunits were significantly up- or downregulated with correlating protein intensity profiles indicating remodelling of CTLH assemblies during erythropoiesis. In particular, the homologous scaffold module subunits RANBP9 and RANBP10 displayed inverse protein expression profiles which agree with recently described mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhen et al., 2020</xref>). As a consequence, HUDEP2 cells undergo a dynamic remodelling of mixed RANBP9/RANBP10-CTLH complexes, from predominantly RANBP9-containing CTLH complexes at progenitor/early erythroblast stages to predominantly RANBP10-CTLH complexes at later maturation stages. Importantly, RANBP9- and RANBP10-CTLH can assemble independently in cells, and additional structural/biochemical characterization of recombinant complexes revealed overall similar topologies of catalytic and scaffold modules of RANBP9-CTLH or RANBP10-CTLH, exerting E3 ligase activity in vitro with UBE2H.</p><p>Despite the compelling evidence of distinct CTLH assemblies in differentiating erythroid cells, we can only speculate about the mechanism of assembly and remodelling of complex subunits. RANBP9 and RANBP10 are unlikely to exchange freely within the CTLH complexes given that both subunits form extended surface interactions with ARMC8 and TWA1 forming the core of the scaffold module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sherpa et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, RANBP9 and/or RANBP10 are likely to assemble CTLH complexes de novo, dependent on their availability and expression profiles. Importantly, our data showing evidence for RANBP9-CTLH, RANBP9/RANBP10-CTLH, and RANBP10-CTLH complexes substantiate the notion that CTLH complexes exist in multiple compositions and architectures, thereby expanding the complexity of the CTLH E3 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sherpa et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To determine the biological role of all possible CTLH complexes in erythropoiesis, we focused on <italic>MAEA</italic> knockout cells. MAEA deficiency in K562 and HUDEP2 cells caused significantly lower protein amounts of RMND5A and UBE2H, suggesting the ubiquitin transfer activity of most – if not all – cognate UBE2H-CTLH modules was eliminated. Analysis of <italic>MAEA-</italic> and <italic>UBE2H</italic>-deficient HUDEP2 cells, which were cultured under expansion growing (non-differentiating) or differentiation-induced conditions, showed increased haemoglobinization and enrichment of erythroid marker proteins, resembling a spontaneously and accelerated differentiated cell population. Interestingly, accelerated differentiation was also observed in <italic>RANBP9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells. Hence, these knockout cells might be more susceptible to signals that promote erythropoiesis. Therefore, we reasoned that MAEA – in particular when assembled in RANBP9-CTLH complex – and UBE2H are either required to maintain HUDEP2 cells in a dormant/quiescent progenitor stage and/or to maintain accurate timing of early erythroid maturation. The in vitro reconstitution of erythropoiesis by the HUDEP2 system does not fully recapitulate in vivo erythropoiesis. However, our findings are supported by <italic>MAEA</italic> knockout studies in mice. Conditional <italic>MAEA</italic> deletion in murine haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) impaired HSC quiescence, leading to a lethal myeloproliferative syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). The authors proposed a mechanism whereby the absence of MAEA leads to a stabilization of several haematopoietic cytokine receptors causing prolonged intracellular signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). A similar concept might apply to the observed phenotypes of HUDEP2 <italic>MAEA<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells. Whereas proteins involved in quiescence and dormancy are not overall changed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>), several erythroid plasma membrane proteins are overrepresented, including increased TFRC (transferrin receptor 1) levels. Hence, these cells are potentially more responsive to extracellular ferritin, enabling increased heme and haemoglobin production. Furthermore, mouse studies, which either conditionally deleted <italic>MAEA</italic> in central macrophages of erythroblastic islands or in erythroid progenitors, have revealed abnormal erythroblast maturation in the bone marrow showing altered profiles with distinct accumulation of maturation stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wei et al., 2019</xref>). This phenotype is, in part, recapitulated in <italic>MAEA-, RANBP9-,</italic> and <italic>UBE2H-</italic>deficient HUDEP2 cells by an apparent accumulation of early maturation stages. In addition, we observed inefficient enucleation of differentiating CD34<sup>+</sup> cells that are depleted of either <italic>MAEA</italic> or <italic>UBE2H,</italic> suggesting a role of UBE2H-CTLH at orthochromatic/reticulocytes stage. To date, no UBE2H knockout mouse models and erythropoiesis studies are available; however, our data are in agreement with studies of <italic>MAEA</italic> null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Soni et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>MAEA<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos, which lack <italic>MAEA</italic> in central macrophages and erythroid progenitors, accumulate nucleated erythrocytes in peripheral blood. Cumulatively, our in vitro studies support the notion that the activity of UBE2H-CTLH modules is required at different erythroid maturation stages.</p><p>The functions of E2-E3 ubiquitylation modules are typically considered to be regulated via the E3 enzyme. However, E3 ubiquitylation involves different E2s, which themselves can be regulated by multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stewart et al., 2016</xref>), such as modulation by transcriptional/translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mejía-García et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Whitcomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ying et al., 2013</xref>). Apart from transcriptional upregulation of UBE2H in mammalian erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lausen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wefes et al., 1995</xref>), its <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue Marie Kondo (Kdo) was shown to be translationally upregulated upon oocyte-to-embryo transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zavortink et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that UBE2H levels are regulatory nodes in developmental processes of higher eukaryotes. In agreement with transcriptional upregulation of UBE2H mRNA in terminal erythroid maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lausen et al., 2010</xref>), we observe a substantial increase in UBE2H protein at orthochromatic stages of differentiating HUDEP2 cells. Surprisingly, absence of MAEA caused reduced protein but not the mRNA encoding UBE2H, suggesting an MAEA-dependent post-transcriptional mode of regulation. A MAEA mutant that still can bind UBE2H, but is defective in E3 ligase activity, does not efficiently rescue UBE2H levels in <italic>MAEA<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells. Therefore, in the absence of a ubiquitin-transfer-proficient MAEA (aka active UBE2H-CTLH complex), UBE2H can undergo autoubiquitylation at multiple lysine residues, which might by potentially triggering proteasomal degradation regulate UBE2H levels. Alternatively, a mechanism might be in place sensing inactive UBE2H-CTLH complexes that mediate ubiquitin targeting of UBE2H by other interacting E3 ligases, such as TRIM28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doyle et al., 2010</xref>). Future studies are needed to further dissect the precise mechanism. To our knowledge, UBE2H-CTLH is the first E2-E3 module described whereby E2 amounts are coupled to the activity of the cognate E3.</p><p>Cumulatively, our work features a mechanism of developmentally regulated E2-E3 ubiquitylation modules, which couples remodelling of multiprotein E3 complexes with its cognate E2 availability. This mechanism assures assembly of distinct erythroid maturation stage-dependent UBE2H-CTLH modules, required for the orderly progression of human erythropoiesis, thus establishing a paradigm for other E2-E3 modules involved in developmental processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>HUDEP2, CD34<sup>+</sup>, and K562 cell culture and manipulation</title><p>HUDEP2 cells were cultured as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurita et al., 2013</xref>).

For processing the micrographs, frames were first motion-corrected using Relion’s own implementation of MotionCor-like algorithm followed by contrast transfer function estimation using CTFFind 4.1. Particles were auto-picked using Gautomatch (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/">http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/</ext-link>) using a template of RANBP9-CTLH<sup>SR4</sup> (EMDB: EMD-12537). The extracted particles were subjected to several rounds of 2D classification and 3D classification followed by autorefinement without and with a mask. To improve the quality of maps obtained for RANBP10-CTLH complex, a focused 3D classification without particle alignment was performed with a mask over CTLH<sup>SRS</sup>. The best class with most features were chosen, and autorefinement with mask over the CTLH<sup>SRS</sup> was performed followed by post-processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>MS-based proteomics analysis of HUDEP2 samples</title><p>Cell pellets were lysed in SDC buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate in 100 mM Tris pH 8.5) and then heated for 5 min at 95°C. Lysates were cooled on ice and sonicated for 15 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined by Tryptophan assay as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>, and equal amount of proteins were reduced and alkylated by 10 mM TCEP and 40 mM 2-chloroacetamide, respectively, for 5 min at 45°C. Proteins were subsequently digested by the addition of 1:100 LysC and Trypsin overnight at 37°C with agitation (1500 rpm). Next day, around 10 µg of protein material was processed using an in-StageTip (iST) protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, samples were at least fourfold diluted with 1% trifluoro-acetic acid (TFA) in isopropanol to a final volume of 200 μl and loaded onto SDB-RPS StageTips (Empore). Tips were then washed with 200 μl of 1% TFA in isopropanol and 200 μl 0.2% TFA/2% acetonitrile (ACN). Peptides were eluted with 80 μl of 1.25% ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH)/80% ACN and dried using a SpeedVac centrifuge (Concentrator Plus; Eppendorf). MS loading buffer (0.2% TFA/2% ACN [v/v]) was added to the dried samples prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. Peptide concentrations were measured optically at 280 nm (Nanodrop 2000; Thermo Scientific) and subsequently equalized using MS loading buffer. Approximately 300–500 ng peptide from each sample was analysed using a 100 min gradient single-shot DIA method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>LC-MS/MS analysis and data processing</title><p>Nanoflow LC-MS/MS measurements were carried out on an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to the Orbitrap instrument, namely, Q Exactive HF-X and a nano-electrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We used a 50 cm HPLC column (75 µm inner diameter, in-house packed into the tip with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ1.9 µm resin [Dr. Maisch GmbH]). Column temperature was kept at 60°C with an in-house-developed oven.</p><p>Peptides were loaded in buffer A (0.1% formic acid [FA] [v/v]) and eluted with a linear 80 min gradient of 5–30% of buffer B (80% ACN and 0.1% FA [v/v]), followed by a 4 min increase to 60% of buffer B and a 4 min increase to 95% of buffer B, and a 4 min wash of 95% buffer B at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Buffer B concentration was decreased to 4% in 4 min and stayed at 4% for 4 min. MS data were acquired using the MaxQuant Live software and a DIA mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wichmann et al., 2019</xref>). Full MS scans were acquired in the range of m/z 300–1650 at a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 200 and the automatic gain control (AGC) set to 3e6. Full MS events were followed by 33 MS/MS windows per cycle at a resolution of 30,000 at m/z 200 and ions were accumulated to reach an AGC target value of 3e6 or an Xcalibur-automated maximum injection time. The spectra were recorded in profile mode.</p><p>The single-shot DIA runs of HUDEP2 samples were searched with dDIA mode in Spectronaut version 14 (Biognosys AG) for final protein identification and quantification. All searches were performed against the human SwissProt reference proteome of canonical and isoform sequences with 42,431 entries downloaded in July 2019. Carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification and acetylation of the protein N-terminus and oxidation of methionine as variable modifications. Trypsin/P proteolytic cleavage rule was used with a maximum of two miscleavages permitted and a peptide length of 7–52 amino acids. A protein and precursor FDR of 1% were used for filtering and subsequent reporting in samples (q-value mode).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Bioinformatics data analysis</title><p>We mainly performed data analysis with Perseus (versions 1.6.0.9 and 1.6.1.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>). Protein intensities were log2-transformed for further analysis. Data sets were filtered to make sure that identified proteins showed expression in all biological triplicates of at least one experimental group and the missing values were subsequently replaced by random numbers that were drawn from a normal distribution (width = 0.3 and down shift = 1.8). PCA of experimental groups and biological replicates was performed using Perseus. Multisample test (ANOVA) for determining whether any of the means of experimental group was significantly different from each other was applied to protein data set. For truncation, we used permutation-based FDR which was set to 0.01 or 0.05 in conjunction with an S0 parameter of 0.1. For hierarchical clustering of significant proteins, median protein abundances of biological replicates were z-scored and clustered using Euclidean as a distance measure for row and/or column clustering. GO enrichments in the clusters were calculated by Fisher’s exact test using Benjamini–Hochberg FDR for truncation. Mean log2 ratios of biological triplicates and the corresponding p-values were visualized with volcano plots and significance was based on an FDR &lt; 0.05 or 0.01. Network representation of significantly regulated proteins was performed with the STRING app (1.5.1) in Cytoscape (3.7.2).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>B.A.S. is adjunct faculty at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, honorary professor at Technical University of Munich, a member of the scientific advisory bards of Interline Therapeutics and BioTheryX, and a convector of intellectual property related to DCN1 inhibitors licensed to Cinsano</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-77937-transrepform1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD031992.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. While the title of this study states that &quot;differential UBE2H-CTLH E2-E3 ubiquitylation modules regulate erythroid maturation&quot;, the authors do not present data that support this conclusion. They show that RanBP9 and RanBP10 are differentially regulated in a manner that correlates with erythroid maturation, but they fall short of demonstrating that this change in expression actually results in differential complexes and regulates erythroid maturation. The authors therefore need to quantify the relative cellular amounts of RANBP9 and RANBP10 that are integrated into CTHL E3 at each differentiation state and correlate these to the relative changes in protein levels as determined by mass spec. In fact, they need to show that RANBP9 and RANBP10 form independent complexes in cells (this could be done by sequential IPs). Most importantly, they need to assess whether deletion of either RanBP9 or RanBP10 has functional consequences onto both the erythrocyte proteome as well as erythrocyte differentiation, which would indicate that the observations made here are significant in the context of this differentiation program.</p><p>2. In addition, the described phenotypes of UBE2H and MAEA deletion on erythrocyte differentiation need to be analyzed in more detail, in particular addressing whether the apparently accelerated differentiation is yielding functional progeny. While their data (in particular Figure 5 H) supports an accelerated differentiation phenotype, the authors should clarify whether MAEA- and UBE2H-deficient HUDEP2 cells yield functional progenitors. Could the authors perform assays to compare viability and functionality of control and CTLH E3 ligase-deficient orthochromatic erythroblasts (day 12 of differentiation)? Results from such analysis would help understanding how erythrocyte lineage-specific Maea knock out results in reduced circulating RBC counts (PMID: 30674470) (i.e. relative contributions of early versus late defects in erythropoiesis). Furthermore, is there any data from the UBE2H and/or MAEA KO proteomes compared to WT that shows decreased levels of proteins involved in maintaining a dormant/quiescent progenitor stage? The authors should analyze their datasets and address the possibility that they introduced in the discussion.</p><p>3. Finally, it is not clear how MAEA stabilizes UBE2H and thereby contributes to erythrocyte differentiation, and this part of the paper is therefore fairly observational without much insight into regulation or function. The authors show that re-expression of MAEA bearing a mutation in a residue they previously showed prevents ubiquitylation in vitro is not able to restore UBE2H expression, implying that the CTLH complex activity is required to maintain UBE2H expression. However, this claim is supported by one single transfection experiment, not quantified, which shows a slight reduction in UBE2H expression compared to wild-type MAEA. This is substandard. This experiment needs to be repeated and quantified. In addition, as it is known from both yeast and mammalian cell studies that MAEA and RMND5A expression are interdependent and that RMND5A expression is decreased upon MAEA knockout, it would be necessary to ensure that RMND5A expression is restored when re-expressing MAEA under the conditions used. To provide mechanistic insight, the authors might also want to test whether UBE2H levels are regulated through ubiquitin modification itself, as the activity of other E2s has been shown to be regulated by ubiquitylation (e.g. UBE2T (PMID: 16916645) or UBE2E (PMID: 25960396)). Finally, the effect of MG132 onto UBE2H levels could either be due to stabilization or effects on differentiation – other differentiation markers would have to be investigated. If these other markers also increase, the authors would need to formulate the text more carefully.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Suggestions for further improvement of the manuscript:</p><p>1. Figure 2: the most direct way to show that Ranbp9 and Ranbp10 assemble into independent complexes would be a sequential IP using either Ranbp9 or Ranbp10 and another CTLH complex subunit. If the authors are correct, then Ranbp9 complexes should not contain Ranbp10 and vice versa.</p><p>2. Lower resolution of Ranbp10 CTLH complexes and lower in vitro activity might indicate that some components or modifications are missing; these might provide additional regulation. It would have been nice if endogenous Ranbp9 and Ranbp10 IPs would have been analyzed by mass spectrometry.</p><p>3. Figure 6: effect of MG132 onto UBE2H levels could either be due to stabilization or effects on differentiation – other differentiation markers would have to be investigated. If these other markers also increase, I would formulate the text more carefully.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors overstate some of their conclusions. The title states that &quot;differential UBE2H-CTLH E2-E3 ubiquitylation modules regulate erythroid maturation&quot;. The authors do not present data that support this conclusion. They show that MAEA and UBE2H knockouts impair erythroid maturation, consistent with CTLH complex involvement in this process. And they show that RanBP9 and RanBP10 are differentially regulated in a manner that correlates with erythroid maturation, but they fall short of demonstrating that this change in expression, which would result in differential complexes actually results in or regulates erythroid maturation.</p><p>2. Another conclusion that is overstated, is that RanBP9 and RanBP10 assemble in &quot;distinct CTLH E3 supramolecular complexes&quot; which would be of importance to support the conclusion of &quot;structurally distinct complexes&quot; regulating erythroid maturation. However, they did not provide evidence that RanBP9 and RanBP10 form different complexes in vivo. The authors show that RanBP9 and RanBP10 can assemble with ArmC8 and Twa1 to form CTLH complex core module in vitro, but the data from the sucrose gradients is in support of a model where RanBP9 and RanBP10 co-exist in the complex. Therefore, as stated by the authors in the discussion (line 492) &quot;…we can only speculate about the mechanism of assembly of complex subunits&quot;, which makes it difficult to support their claim that &quot;differential ubiquitylation modules regulate erythroid maturation&quot;.</p><p>3. Another main conclusion stated by the authors is that re-expression of MAEA bearing a mutation in a non-priming residue (Y394A, that they previously showed prevented ubiquitination in vitro) is not able to restore UBE2H expression, implying that the CTLH complex activity is required to maintain UBE2H expression. However, this claim is supported by one single transfection experiment, not quantified, which shows a slight reduction in UBE2H expression compared to wild-type MAEA. This is substandard. This experiment needs to be repeated and quantified. In addition, as it is known from both yeast and mammalian cell studies that MAEA and RMND5A expression are interdependent and that RMND5A expression is decreased upon MAEA knockout, it would be necessary to ensure that RMND5A expression is restored when re-expressing MAEA under the conditions used.</p><p>4. Adding to the above comment. This report convincingly implicates MAEA in erythropoiesis signaling, however, the connection with the CTLH complex reported by the authors is puzzling. The discussion introduces two other publications that connect MAEA and hematopoietic signaling, but the manuscript overall fails to make any other connections with the CTLH complex. What is particularly surprising is that deletion of WDR26 – a complex member that was previously shown to regulate supramolecular formation in the same cell line used in this study – is reported to have no effect on UBE2H levels compared to parental cells. The same goes for GID4, the receptor subunit of the complex, which appears to be dispensable for UBE2H regulation. Could MAEA be functioning independently of the CTLH complex to induce this phenotype? Do RMND5A knockout cells exhibit the same phenotype, since it is predicted that only the MAEA-RMND5A RING heterodimer is functional?</p><p>Other Comments</p><p>1. Line 197: Authors suggest that RanBP9 and RanBP10 protein levels change from day 0 to day 6 of differentiated HUDEP2 cells based off the sucrose gradient, but since there is no loading control in this type of experiment, they cannot use sucrose gradients to make this conclusion. Curiously, the authors do not see a difference in any other complex member protein levels by sucrose gradient, even though the authors conclude that there are protein level differences based on Figure 1F and G. A Western blot showing levels of complex members on day 0 and day 6, with appropriate loading controls, would allow for these conclusions while also validating the proteomic data shown in Figure 1. Also, why choose day 0 and day 6 for Figure 2 instead of day 0 and day 12? Day 12 showed the largest effects according to data in Figure 1.</p><p>2. Line 201: ARMC8 was immunoprecipitated using a nanobody, but in the methods section (line 651), authors indicate that ARMC8 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. This ambiguity needs to be addressed. Authors should also indicate whether the nanobody is specific for ARMC8 α or β; since this nanobody has not been used in previous publication, ARMC8 KO cell lines should be the appropriate negative control instead of &quot;mock&quot;.</p><p>3. Line 209: a couple of complex members besides RanBP9 and RanBP10 should be immunoblotted on the sucrose gradients, especially since the purpose of the figure was to demonstrate &quot;whether RanBP9 and RanBP10 could can independently form CTLH complexes&quot;.</p><p>4. Line 214: authors mention that RanBP9 and RanBP10 assemble in &quot;distinct CTLH E3 supramolecular complexes&quot; based on Figure 2, but as seen in Figure 2A, both RanBP9 and RanBP10 exhibit a similar sedimentation pattern in parental HUDEP2 cells, suggesting that both proteins may be present in the same complex rather than RanBP9- and RanBP10-dependent complexes. Since this is a fundamental conclusion from this paper, authors need to further analyze how RanBP9 and RanBP10 interact with the complex when both are present. The authors mention (Line 495) a previous study that showed that other CTLH complex members' expression is compromised upon RanBP9 depletion, and they mention that RanBP9 is &quot;slightly increased&quot; in RanBP10 KO cells, although no quantifications are shown. Did the authors observe a similar decrease in CTLH complex subunits upon RanBP9 knockout as previously reported, or is there a compensatory effect in HUDEP2 cells? This would help better understand the nature of the complexes.</p><p>5. Figure 3: it has previously been shown that GID4 is larger than TWA1 (Lampert et al., 2019; Qiao et al., 2020; Mohamed et al., 2021), yet Figure 3A indicates the opposite.</p><p>6. Line 223: Sherpa et al., 2021 showed that when WDR26 is deleted, much of the CTLH complex population migrates to a lower molecular weight when performing sucrose gradients in vivo using K562 cells, yet the authors omitted WDR26 when reconstituting the complex in vitro. Given how supramolecular assembly, which corresponds to data shown in Figure 2A, is governed by WDR26 in human cells, there needs to be a discussion about why this protein was omitted in this experiment.</p><p>7. Line 478: authors mention that they have shown no differences in GID4 levels during erythropoiesis in HUDEP2 cells, but Figure 1F does not include GID4. Even though it may be in the supplemental dataset, it would be logical to include GID4 in Figure 1F as well.</p><p>8. Line 506: the authors state: &quot;MAEA deficiency in K562 and HUDEP2 cells caused significantly lower protein amounts of RMND5a and UBE2H…”. There is no data, or citation to be found in the manuscript that shows RMND5a depletion in HUDEP2 cells.</p><p>9. A recent paper (Zhen et al., 2020) showed that CTLH complex member mRNA levels decrease as human erythroblasts become terminally differentiated, yet Figure 1G shows the opposite effect on CTLH protein level in the same system with the notable exceptions being RanBP9 and RanBP10. Could any of your results explain why this may be?</p><p>10. Line 512: is there any data from the UBE2H and/or MAEA KO proteomes compared to WT that shows decreased levels of proteins involved in maintaining a dormant/quiescent progenitor stage? The authors should analyze their datasets and address the possibility that they introduced in the discussion.</p><p>11. The model proposed in Figure 6J was not addressed in the manuscript. Is there altered hematopoiesis if RanBP9 or RanBP10 are knocked out? If the CTLH complex is going to be associated with this pathway, there needs to be evidence showing that deletion of another complex member leads to a similar phenotype.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To address the weaknesses I outlined above, I have the following comments and suggestions for experiments:</p><p>1) Differentiation stage-specific formation of RANBP9-CTHL and RANBP10-CTHL complexes:</p><p>– While there is good evidence that there is differential formation of these of RANBP9-CTHL and RANBP10-CTHL during maintenance and 6 days of erythrocyte progenitor differentiation (Figure 2A,B) , it would greatly strengthen if the authors could quantify the effects. E.g. would it be possible to quantify the relative cellular amounts of RANBP9 and RANBP10 integrated into CTHL E3 at each differentiation state (input versus fraction 9,10,11 from sucrose gradients) and correlate these to the relative changes in protein levels as determined by mass spec? Alternatively the endogenous ARMC8 IPs could be quantified in the same manner. In case there is a clear correlation between the relative protein level increase and the relative integration of RANBP9 and RANBP10, such data would provide evidence that changes in CTHL composition are driven by abundance of RANBP9/10 withing cells (as suggested by the authors in the discussion). Alternatively, if there is no strict correlation, this could point to cellular mechanisms that regulate their assembly into the CTHL complex.</p><p>– To provide evidence that these differentiation-specific RANBP9-CTHL and RANBP10-CTLH are functionally distinct and important for erythropoiesis, could the authors use their available RANBP9/10 knock out cells and determine effects on progenitor maintenance and differentiation?</p><p>2) Coupling of UBE2H stability to CTLH E3 ligase activity:</p><p>– The authors convincingly show that UBE2H stability depends on the catalytic activity of the CTLH E3 ligase and in its absence is targeted for proteasomal degradation. This is an conceptually interesting finding and it would greatly strengthen the manuscript if the authors could provide evidence for when and how such regulation is important during erythrocyte progenitor maintenance or differentiation. E.g. would overexpression of UBE2H dysregulate erythrocyte progenitor maintenance, in which overall CTHL E3 ligase function is presumably lower?</p><p>– Can the authors speculate on how catalytic activity of MAEA prevents proteasomal degradation of UBE2H? Could it be through ubiquitin modification itself? The activity of other E2s have been shown to be regulated by ubiquitylation (e.g. UBE2T (PMID: 16916645) or UBE2E (PMID: 25960396)), so it might be worthwhile to test whether UBE2H undergoes MAEA-dependent, regulatory ubiquitylation, which, if lost, leads to proteasomal degradation.</p><p>3) CTLH E3 ligase loss and accelerated erythrocyte differentiation: while the data presented (in particular Figure 5 H) supports an accelerated differentiation phenotype, I think the authors should clarify whether they think that MAEA- and UBE2H-deficient HUDEP2 cells yield functional progenitors. At least from the proteomic data analysis in Figure 4H and J one would expect that the resulting cell populations are quite different. Could the authors perform assays to compare viability and functionality of control and CTLH E3 ligase-deficient orthochromatic erythroblasts (day 12 of differentiation)? Results from such analysis would also help understanding how erythrocyte lineage-specific Maea knock out results in reduced circulating RBC counts (PMID: 30674470) (i.e. relative contributions of early versus late defects in erythropoiesis).</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>Line 507: the authors state that MAEA deficiency results in lower RMND5a amounts.

While the title of this study states that &quot;differential UBE2H-CTLH E2-E3 ubiquitylation modules regulate erythroid maturation&quot;, the authors do not present data that support this conclusion. They show that RanBP9 and RanBP10 are differentially regulated in a manner that correlates with erythroid maturation, but they fall short of demonstrating that this change in expression actually results in differential complexes and regulates erythroid maturation. The authors therefore need to quantify the relative cellular amounts of RANBP9 and RANBP10 that are integrated into CTHL E3 at each differentiation state and correlate these to the relative changes in protein levels as determined by mass spec. In fact, they need to show that RANBP9 and RANBP10 form independent complexes in cells (this could be done by sequential IPs). Most importantly, they need to assess whether deletion of either RanBP9 or RanBP10 has functional consequences onto both the erythrocyte proteome as well as erythrocyte differentiation, which would indicate that the observations made here are significant in the context of this differentiation program.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide in our revised manuscript a comprehensive set of new data to support and strengthen our conclusion that modular UBE2H-CTLH complexes regulate erythroid maturation.</p><p>A sequential IP approach (as suggested by the reviewers’) was established, allowing us to discriminate and monitor endogenous RANBP9- versus RANBP10-assembled CTLH complexes during erythroid differentiation (outlined Figure 2D). In the first step a RANBP9 antibody was used to precipitate all RANBP9-assembled CTLH complexes. In the second step, the RANBP9-depleted supernatant was subjected to an IP with our developed ARMC8 nanobody to capture remaining RANBP10-CTLH complexes (Despite testing several commercial RANBP10 antibodies, none of these were specific and efficient in IPs). We applied this approach to cell lysate samples derived from different erythroid differentiation stages (at day 0, 4, 8) and monitored relative levels of RANBP9- and RANBP10-assembled CTLH complexes by immunoblotting. In accordance with changes of RANBP9 and RANBP10 levels (as shown in the proteomics data), we observed a dynamic modulation of mixed RANBP9 and RANBP10-CTLH complexes, from predominantly RANBP9-CTLH complexes at progenitor/early erythroblast stage to predominantly RANBP10-CTLH complexes at later differentiation stages (Figure 2E). Furthermore, the sequential IPs performed provide evidence for the assembly of independent RANBP9-CTLH and RANBP10-CTLH complexes. These data – including the sedimentation experiments (Figure 2C and 2G) – suggest the presence of distinct stage-specific assemblies of RANBP9- and RANBP10-CTLH complexes in terminal erythropoiesis.</p><p>To assess whether these RANBP9- and RANBP10-CTLH complexes have a role in the differentiation programme we generated a set of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated <italic>RANBP9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>RANBP10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> deletion cell lines.

We believe these new data support our conclusion that RANBP9- and RANBP10-CTLH complexes are required at different stages of differentiation, and that RANBP9-CTLH has a potential role in maintaining HUDEP2 cells in dormant/quiescent progenitor cells and/or controlling transition to terminal differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In addition, the described phenotypes of UBE2H and MAEA deletion on erythrocyte differentiation need to be analyzed in more detail, in particular addressing whether the apparently accelerated differentiation is yielding functional progeny. While their data (in particular Figure 5 H) supports an accelerated differentiation phenotype, the authors should clarify whether MAEA- and UBE2H-deficient HUDEP2 cells yield functional progenitors. Could the authors perform assays to compare viability and functionality of control and CTLH E3 ligase-deficient orthochromatic erythroblasts (day 12 of differentiation)?

Importantly mouse studies, that either conditionally deleted <italic>MAEA</italic> in central macrophages of erythroblastic islands or in erythroid progenitors (Wei et al., 2019; PMID: 30674470), have revealed abnormal erythroblast maturation in the bone marrow showing altered profiles with distinct accumulation of maturation stages. This phenotype is, at least in part, recapitulated in our study of <italic>MAEA-</italic> and <italic>UBE2H-</italic>deficient HUDEP2 cells by an apparent accumulation of early maturation stages.</p><p>We followed up on these data and addressed reviewer’s comment regarding the functionality of <italic>MAEA-</italic> and <italic>UBE2H</italic>- deficient orthochromatic erythroblasts that might account for reduced circulating RBC counts in erythrocyte lineage-specific <italic>MAEA</italic> knockout (Wei et al., 2019; PMID: 30674470), or anaemia in <italic>MAEA</italic> null mice embryos, which also accumulate nucleated erythrocytes in peripheral blood (Soni S. et al. 2006, PMID: 16707498). The maturation of orthochromatic erythroblasts into reticulocytes is characterized by the elimination of the condensed nucleus – enucleation. Hence, we focused our functional analysis of <italic>MAEA-</italic> and <italic>UBE2H</italic>- deficient orthochromatic erythroblasts by monitoring enucleation efficiency as a critical step in generating functional reticulocytes. HUDEP2 cells show intrinsically weak enucleation efficiency, we therefore switched to the CD34<sup>+</sup> erythroid maturation system. We observed inefficient enucleation of maturating CD34<sup>+</sup> cells that were depleted of either <italic>MAEA</italic> or <italic>UBE2H,</italic> suggesting a role of UBE2H-CTLH at ortho/reticulocytes stage (Figure 4I-4L). To date, no UBE2H knock out mouse models and erythropoiesis studies are available, however, our data agree with data from <italic>MAEA</italic> null mice that accumulate nucleated erythrocytes in peripheral blood (Soni S. et al. 2006, PMID: 16707498).

The point is mentioned in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Finally, it is not clear how MAEA stabilizes UBE2H and thereby contributes to erythrocyte differentiation, and this part of the paper is therefore fairly observational without much insight into regulation or function. The authors show that re-expression of MAEA bearing a mutation in a residue they previously showed prevents ubiquitylation in vitro is not able to restore UBE2H expression, implying that the CTLH complex activity is required to maintain UBE2H expression. However, this claim is supported by one single transfection experiment, not quantified, which shows a slight reduction in UBE2H expression compared to wild-type MAEA. This is substandard. This experiment needs to be repeated and quantified. In addition, as it is known from both yeast and mammalian cell studies that MAEA and RMND5A expression are interdependent and that RMND5A expression is decreased upon MAEA knockout, it would be necessary to ensure that RMND5A expression is restored when re-expressing MAEA under the conditions used. To provide mechanistic insight, the authors might also want to test whether UBE2H levels are regulated through ubiquitin modification itself, as the activity of other E2s has been shown to be regulated by ubiquitylation (e.g. UBE2T (PMID: 16916645) or UBE2E (PMID: 25960396)). Finally, the effect of MG132 onto UBE2H levels could either be due to stabilization or effects on differentiation – other differentiation markers would have to be investigated. If these other markers also increase, the authors would need to formulate the text more carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>We observed in <italic>MAEA</italic> knock-out cell lines (HUDEP2 and K562) reduced levels of UBE2H (proteomics data, immunoblot analysis), which can be rescued by expressing wildtype MAEA, but not a catalytic defective MAEA-Y394A mutant. To strengthen our conclusion that MAEA activity is required for UBE2H levels, we generated clonal MAEA<sup>-/-</sup> cell lines stably expressing either wildtype or MAEA-Y394A mutant (note, clones were selected for comparable expression levels of wildtype or MAEA-Y394A). Immunoblot analysis in revised Figure 6I confirms that MAEA-Y394A is not efficient in stabilizing UBE2H, whereas wild type completely rescued UBE2H levels. Immunoblot signals of UBE2H levels (n&gt;10), normalized to actin have been quantified indicating statistical significance (Figure 6J). Importantly, RMND5A levels are stabilized by wildtype MAEA expression, as well as MAEA-Y394A.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point that the effect of MG132 onto UBE2H levels could be either due to stabilization or via effects on differentiation. To investigate both effects, the original experiment was designed and carried out in the absence/presence of the erythroid differentiation inducer NaB and MG132. Whereas NaB treatment only had a modest effect on the stabilization of UBE2H in MAEA<sup>-/-</sup> cells (Figure 6G, compare lane 5 with 7), prolonged MG132 treatment resulted to UBE2H levels as observed in parental cells (Figure 6G compare lane 5 with 6). In fact, MG132 treatment reduced rather increased levels of the erythroid maker GYPA. Hence, rescue of UBE2H levels is unlikely due to differentiation upon MG132 treatment.</p><p>To follow up on reviewers’ comments and suggestions regarding a potential mechanism regulating UBE2H levels in the absence of functional MAEA, we investigated whether “orphan” UBE2H might undergo autoubiquitylation. Proteomics studies identified several UBE2H ubiquitylation sites (RMIDs:29967540, 2106985, 21890473), which we highlighted in an Alphafold 2-derived model structure of UBE2H-Ub (Figure 6—figure supplement 1K). The surface-exposed sites that are in close proximity to the catalytic C87 could be potentially autoubiquitylated. We reconstituted autoubiquitylation in an in vitro assay and detected ubiquitylation of UBE2H which was dependent on the catalytic C86 residue (Figure 6L). Moreover, using lysine-less ubiquitin with all Lys-to-Arg mutation, indicated predominant UBE2H monoubiquitylation. Taken together, we propose a plausible mechanism of MAEA-dependent UBE2H levels: it is likely that in the absence of ubiquitin-transfer proficient MAEA (aka functional CTLH E3 ligase complex), UBE2H undergoes autoubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Alternatively, other UBE2H-interacting E3 ligases, such as TRIM28 (Doyle et al. 2010, PMID: 20864041), could potentially target UBE2H for proteasomal degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Suggestions for further improvement of the manuscript:</p><p>1.

In addition, as it is known from both yeast and mammalian cell studies that MAEA and RMND5A expression are interdependent and that RMND5A expression is decreased upon MAEA knockout, it would be necessary to ensure that RMND5A expression is restored when re-expressing MAEA under the conditions used.</p></disp-quote><p>To strengthen our conclusion that MAEA activity is required for UBE2H levels, we generated clonal MAEA<sup>-/-</sup> cell lines stably expressing either wildtype or MAEA-Y394A mutant (note, clones were selected for comparable expression levels of wildtype or MAEA-Y394A). Immunoblot analysis in revised Figure 6I confirms that MAEA-Y394A is not efficient in stabilizing UBE2H, whereas wild type completely rescued UBE2H levels. Immunoblot signals of UBE2H levels, normalized to actin, have been quantified (Figure 6J). Importantly, RMND5A levels are stabilized by wildtype MAEA expression, as well as MAEA-Y394A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Adding to the above comment. This report convincingly implicates MAEA in erythropoiesis signaling, however, the connection with the CTLH complex reported by the authors is puzzling. The discussion introduces two other publications that connect MAEA and hematopoietic signaling, but the manuscript overall fails to make any other connections with the CTLH complex. What is particularly surprising is that deletion of WDR26 – a complex member that was previously shown to regulate supramolecular formation in the same cell line used in this study – is reported to have no effect on UBE2H levels compared to parental cells. The same goes for GID4, the receptor subunit of the complex, which appears to be dispensable for UBE2H regulation. Could MAEA be functioning independently of the CTLH complex to induce this phenotype? Do RMND5A knockout cells exhibit the same phenotype, since it is predicted that only the MAEA-RMND5A RING heterodimer is functional?</p></disp-quote><p>Structural evidences from GID/CTLH complexes show that different forms of GID/CTLH complexes can exist and active complexes without Gid4 and WDR26 also exist (Sherpa et al., 2021; Qiao et al., 2020; Mohamed et al., 2021). This might suggest why deletion of substrate receptor Gid4 or WDR26 alone does not affect UBE2H levels. However, MAEA which is the catalytic RING subunit of CTLH is indispensable for all forms of active CTLH E3 ligases. MAEA and RMND5A are structurally and functionally interconnected. As shown recently protein abundance of MAEA and RMND5A is interdependent (Maitland et al., 2019) and in agreement, we also observe in our <italic>MAEA</italic> deletion cells reduced amounts of RMND5A (Figure 6I)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other Comments</p><p>1. Line 197: Authors suggest that RanBP9 and RanBP10 protein levels change from day 0 to day 6 of differentiated HUDEP2 cells based off the sucrose gradient, but since there is no loading control in this type of experiment, they cannot use sucrose gradients to make this conclusion. Curiously, the authors do not see a difference in any other complex member protein levels by sucrose gradient, even though the authors conclude that there are protein level differences based on Figure 1F and G. A Western blot showing levels of complex members on day 0 and day 6, with appropriate loading controls, would allow for these conclusions while also validating the proteomic data shown in Figure 1. Also, why choose day 0 and day 6 for Figure 2 instead of day 0 and day 12? Day 12 showed the largest effects according to data in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Since we are looking at different maturation stages and the associated massive global protein changes, loading controls would also likely change, and therefore not be suitable. Therefore, for the sedimentation experiments equal total protein amount was loaded onto the sucrose gradient. Immunoblots (of input and fractions samples) and scans were done in parallel, hence, a relative comparison is justified.</p><p>For technical reason we did not use cell lysates from differentiation day 12. Cells at day 12 are very small and to extract amounts of protein lysates equal to cells at earlier differentiation stages (day 0 to day 8) would have resulted in an unmanageable upscaling of the differentiation protocol. Choosing time points day 0/6 for sedimentation experiments and day 0/4/8 for sequential IPs was a reasonable compromise for collecting sufficient cell lysate amounts as well as covering a time window where major CTLH remodelling occurs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line 201: ARMC8 was immunoprecipitated using a nanobody, but in the methods section (line 651), authors indicate that ARMC8 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. This ambiguity needs to be addressed. Authors should also indicate whether the nanobody is specific for ARMC8 α or β; since this nanobody has not been used in previous publication, ARMC8 KO cell lines should be the appropriate negative control instead of &quot;mock&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We generated an ARMC8-specific nanobody that was used for IPs. For the verification that the nanobody is specific for ARMC8, we resolved a cryo-EM structure of the ARMC8 nanobody bound CTLH complex (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) and the structure also indicates that the nanobody recognizes and binds a region specific to the α-variant of ARMC8. Therefore, we did not use ARMC8 KO cell lines and rather used IP in the absence of the nanobody (mock) as a control. Text and methods have been edited accordingly. Also, depletion of the core scaffolding subunit ARMC8 will disrupt the CTLH complex assembly, and thereby would be unsuitable in comparison with specific IP experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 209: a couple of complex members besides RanBP9 and RanBP10 should be immunoblotted on the sucrose gradients, especially since the purpose of the figure was to demonstrate &quot;whether RanBP9 and RanBP10 could can independently form CTLH complexes&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded the immunoblot analysis and monitored WDR26 and MAEA. Both CTLH subunits co-sediment with RANBP9 or RANBP10 in respective cell lines corresponding to supramolecular assembly fractions.

Line 214: authors mention that RanBP9 and RanBP10 assemble in &quot;distinct CTLH E3 supramolecular complexes&quot; based on Figure 2, but as seen in Figure 2A, both RanBP9 and RanBP10 exhibit a similar sedimentation pattern in parental HUDEP2 cells, suggesting that both proteins may be present in the same complex rather than RanBP9- and RanBP10-dependent complexes. Since this is a fundamental conclusion from this paper, authors need to further analyze how RanBP9 and RanBP10 interact with the complex when both are present. The authors mention (Line 495) a previous study that showed that other CTLH complex members' expression is compromised upon RanBP9 depletion, and they mention that RanBP9 is &quot;slightly increased&quot; in RanBP10 KO cells, although no quantifications are shown. Did the authors observe a similar decrease in CTLH complex subunits upon RanBP9 knockout as previously reported, or is there a compensatory effect in HUDEP2 cells? This would help better understand the nature of the complexes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the possibility of mixed RANBP9-RANBP10-CTLH complex assemblies. Indeed, the new data from the sequential IP (Figure 2D and 2E) mentioned also in response to reviewer 1, point 1, clearly show co-precipitation of RANBP10 with RANBP9 IP, indicating also presence of “mixed” RANBP9/RANBP10-CTLH complexes.</p><p>Increased RANBP10 amounts in RANBP9<sup>-/-</sup> (and RANBP9 amounts in RANBP10<sup>-/-</sup>), have consistently been observed (Figure 2F and Figure 5A). Immunoblots do not indicate an obvious decrease of CTLH subunits like WDR26 or MAEA compared to the parental (Figure 2G). Hence, we can only speculate that the cellular stoichiometry of CTLH subunits might allow a “compensatory” assembly of RANBP9- or RANBP10-CTLH assemblies, as mentioned in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Line 223: Sherpa et al., 2021 showed that when WDR26 is deleted, much of the CTLH complex population migrates to a lower molecular weight when performing sucrose gradients in vivo using K562 cells, yet the authors omitted WDR26 when reconstituting the complex in vitro.

To make it clear, we indicated the use of truncated GID4 (∆GID4) in the figure, legend, and text.</p><p>As shown in previous studies of GID/CTLH E3 ligases (Sherpa et al., 2021; Qiao et al., 2020; Mohamed et al., 2021) multiples forms of GID/CTLH assemblies with and without Gid7/WDR26 can exist. To assess the structural architecture of RANBP10 CTLH complexes and to compare it with published RANBP9-CTLH complex, we focused on the minimal catalytically active CTLH complex composed of either RANBP9 or RANBP10, ARMC8, TWA1, ∆GID4, MAEA, and RMND5A.

A recent paper (Zhen et al., 2020) showed that CTLH complex member mRNA levels decrease as human erythroblasts become terminally differentiated, yet Figure 1G shows the opposite effect on CTLH protein level in the same system with the notable exceptions being RanBP9 and RanBP10. Could any of your results explain why this may be?</p></disp-quote><p>mRNA levels are not necessarily reflecting protein amounts. Indeed, it was recently shown that dynamics of mRNA expression during terminal erythroid maturation did not accurately predict protein expression (Gautier et al. 2016). Regarding some differences of mRNA and protein levels of CTLH subunits we can only speculate that different factors like mRNA stability, mRNA maturation could account for altered translational efficiency and subsequently protein amounts. Importantly, Zhen et al., 2020 did describe inverse transcriptional profiles for <italic>RANBP9</italic> (down regulated) and <italic>RANBP10</italic> (up regulated) during terminal maturation, which agree with our proteome data.

E.g. would it be possible to quantify the relative cellular amounts of RANBP9 and RANBP10 integrated into CTHL E3 at each differentiation state (input versus fraction 9,10,11 from sucrose gradients) and correlate these to the relative changes in protein levels as determined by mass spec? Alternatively the endogenous ARMC8 IPs could be quantified in the same manner. In case there is a clear correlation between the relative protein level increase and the relative integration of RANBP9 and RANBP10, such data would provide evidence that changes in CTHL composition are driven by abundance of RANBP9/10 withing cells (as suggested by the authors in the discussion). Alternatively, if there is no strict correlation, this could point to cellular mechanisms that regulate their assembly into the CTHL complex.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this suggestion, we set up a different approach using sequential IPs. Please see response to reviewer 1, section 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To provide evidence that these differentiation-specific RANBP9-CTHL and RANBP10-CTLH are functionally distinct and important for erythropoiesis, could the authors use their available RANBP9/10 knock out cells and determine effects on progenitor maintenance and differentiation?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to reviewer 2, section 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Coupling of UBE2H stability to CTLH E3 ligase activity:</p><p>– The authors convincingly show that UBE2H stability depends on the catalytic activity of the CTLH E3 ligase and in its absence is targeted for proteasomal degradation. This is an conceptually interesting finding and it would greatly strengthen the manuscript if the authors could provide evidence for when and how such regulation is important during erythrocyte progenitor maintenance or differentiation. E.g. would overexpression of UBE2H dysregulate erythrocyte progenitor maintenance, in which overall CTHL E3 ligase function is presumably lower?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We are also interested in dissecting the detailed regulation of UBE2H abundance and its cellular importance, however this will require further extensive investigations beyond the scope of this manuscript and this will be our follow-up goal in future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Can the authors speculate on how catalytic activity of MAEA prevents proteasomal degradation of UBE2H? Could it be through ubiquitin modification itself? The activity of other E2s have been shown to be regulated by ubiquitylation (e.g. UBE2T (PMID: 16916645) or UBE2E (PMID: 25960396)), so it might be worthwhile to test whether UBE2H undergoes MAEA-dependent, regulatory ubiquitylation, which, if lost, leads to proteasomal degradation.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding a potential mechanism regulating UBE2H levels in the absence of functional MAEA, we investigated whether “orphan” UBE2H might undergo autoubiquitylation. Proteomics studies identified several UBE2H ubiquitylation sites (RMIDs:29967540, 2106985, 21890473), which we highlighted in an Alphafold 2-derived model structure of UBE2H-Ub (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D). The surface-exposed sites that are in close proximity to the catalytic C87 could be potentially autoubiquitylated. We reconstituted autoubiquitylation in an in vitro assay and detected ubiquitylation of UBE2H which was dependent on the catalytic C87 residue (Figure 6K). Moreover, using lysine-less ubiquitin with all Lys-to-Arg mutation, indicated predominant UBE2H monoubiquitylation. Taken together, it is likely that in the absence of ubiquitin-transfer proficient MAEA (aka functional CTLH complex), UBE2H undergoes autoubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Alternatively, other UBE2H-interacting E3 ligases, such as TRIM28 (Doyle at al. 2010, PMID: 20864041), could potentially target UBE2H for proteasomal degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) CTLH E3 ligase loss and accelerated erythrocyte differentiation: while the data presented (in particular Figure 5 H) supports an accelerated differentiation phenotype, I think the authors should clarify whether they think that MAEA- and UBE2H-deficient HUDEP2 cells yield functional progenitors. At least from the proteomic data analysis in Figure 4H and J one would expect that the resulting cell populations are quite different. Could the authors perform assays to compare viability and functionality of control and CTLH E3 ligase-deficient orthochromatic erythroblasts (day 12 of differentiation)? Results from such analysis would also help understanding how erythrocyte lineage-specific Maea knock out results in reduced circulating RBC counts (PMID: 30674470) (i.e. relative contributions of early versus late defects in erythropoiesis).</p></disp-quote><p>Our initial in vitro erythropoiesis studies with HUDEP2 cells show spontaneous and accelerated erythroid maturation in MAEA and UBE2H deficient cells. Importantly, mouse studies, that either conditionally deleted <italic>MAEA</italic> in central macrophages of erythroblastic islands or in erythroid progenitors (Wei et al., 2019; PMID: 30674470), have revealed abnormal erythroblast maturation in the bone marrow showing altered profiles with distinct accumulation of maturation stages. This phenotype is, at least in part, recapitulated in our study of <italic>MAEA-</italic> and <italic>UBE2H-</italic>deficient HUDEP2 cells by an apparent accumulation of early maturation stages.</p><p>We followed up on these data and addressed reviewer’s comment regarding the functionality of <italic>MAEA-</italic> and <italic>UBE2H</italic>- deficient orthochromatic erythroblasts that might account for reduced circulating RBC counts in erythrocyte lineage-specific <italic>MAEA</italic> knockout (Wei et al., 2019; PMID: 30674470), or anaemia in <italic>MAEA</italic> null mice embryos, which also accumulate nucleated erythrocytes in peripheral blood (Soni S. et al. 2006, PMID: 16707498). The maturation of orthochromatic erythroblasts into reticulocytes is characterized by the elimination of the condensed nucleus – enucleation. Hence, we focused our functional analysis of <italic>MAEA-</italic> and <italic>UBE2H</italic>- deficient orthochromatic erythroblasts by monitoring enucleation efficiency as a critical step in generating functional reticulocytes. HUDEP2 cells show intrinsically weak enucleation efficiency, we therefore switched to the CD34<sup>+</sup> erythroid maturation system.

To date, no UBE2H knock out mouse models and erythropoiesis studies are available, however, our data agree with data from <italic>MAEA</italic> null mice that accumulate nucleated erythrocytes in peripheral blood (Soni S. et al. 2006, PMID: 16707498).
