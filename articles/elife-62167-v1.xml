The mechanisms that modulate microglial trogocytosis of axons and its function in neural circuit development remain poorly understood. Here, we directly observe axon trogocytosis by microglia in vivo in the developing <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> retinotectal circuit. We show that microglia regulate pruning of retinal ganglion cell axons and are important for proper behavioral response to dark and bright looming stimuli. Using bioinformatics, we identify amphibian regulator of complement activation 3, a homolog of human CD46, as a neuronally expressed synapse-associated complement inhibitory molecule that inhibits trogocytosis and axonal pruning. Using a membrane-bound complement C3 fusion protein, we demonstrate that enhancing complement activity enhances axonal pruning. Our results support the model that microglia remodel axons via trogocytosis and that neurons can control this process through expression of complement inhibitory proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinotectal</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>morphometry</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>pruning</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-143238</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruthazer</surname><given-names>Edward S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruthazer</surname><given-names>Edward S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Tony KY</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008644</institution-id><institution>Faculty of Medicine, McGill</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Tony KY</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vivo time lapse imaging reveals that microglial trogocytosis of presynaptic elements is regulated by the complement system which controls axon morphogenesis in the developing brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microglia, the immune cells of the CNS, are vital for the maintenance and development of a healthy brain. Constantly surveilling the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wake et al., 2009</xref>), these highly phagocytic cells are thought to contribute to developmental synaptic remodeling by phagocytosing inappropriate or supernumerary synapses, a hypothesis that has derived considerable support from histological and immunohistochemical evidence identifying synaptic components within endocytic compartments in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tremblay et al., 2010</xref>). This hypothesis is further supported by numerous studies demonstrating that microglia depletion leads to exuberant axonal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pont-Lezica et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Squarzoni et al., 2014</xref>), impaired pruning of excess synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ji et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milinkeviciute et al., 2019</xref>), and increased spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wallace et al., 2020</xref>) during development.</p><p>Studies depleting microglia or disrupting microglial function provide indirect evidence to support the hypothesis that microglia remodel synapses through phagocytic mechanisms. An inherent weakness of indirect approaches is that the source of the synaptic material within microglia is unknown. For example, it is possible that synaptic components may be found within microglia due to clearance of apoptotic neurons rather than synaptic pruning. More direct approaches are required to verify whether microglia collect synaptic material from living neurons. Currently, direct evidence of complete elimination of synapses by microglial engulfment remains elusive. However, instead of removing entire synapses, microglia have been documented engaging in trogocytosis, or partial elimination, of axons and presynaptic boutons in ex vivo organotypic cultures and in fixed brain tissue using electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Weinhard et al., 2018</xref>), although it remains to be seen whether microglial trogocytosis of axons is a phenomenon that occurs in vivo.</p><p>Even if we accept the hypothesis that microglia trogocytose the axonal compartment, many questions remain. What impact does partial elimination of presynaptic structures have on circuit remodeling? It is unclear if this phenomenon is required for proper wiring of neuronal circuits. Does microglial trogocytosis of axons affect axon morphology? While disrupting microglial function enhances axon tract outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pont-Lezica et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Squarzoni et al., 2014</xref>), it is unknown if this result is because of a disruption in microglial trogocytosis, or whether non-phagocytic mechanisms are in play. Is axonal trogocytosis by microglia mechanistically similar to complement-mediated synaptic pruning? There is extensive evidence demonstrating that the complement system regulates synaptic pruning by microglia via the complement protein C3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stevens et al., 2007</xref>). However, knockout (KO) mice lacking complement receptor type 3 (CR3), the receptor for activated C3, do not exhibit a deficit in microglial trogocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Weinhard et al., 2018</xref>), raising the possibility that microglial trogocytosis of axons is mechanistically distinct from complement-mediated synaptic pruning.</p><p>In this study, we addressed these questions and directly observed in vivo trogocytosis of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons by individual microglial cells in real-time using the developing <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> retinotectal circuit. We then developed an assay to monitor microglial trogocytosis of axons among the population of microglia in the optic tectum. To investigate the functional role of microglial trogocytosis, we depleted microglial cells and found that this enhanced axon arborization and reversed the behavioral responses to dark and bright looming stimuli. We identified amphibian regulator of complement activation 3 (aRCA3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oshiumi et al., 2009</xref>), a homolog of mammalian CD46, as an endogenously expressed, synapse-associated, complement inhibitory molecule in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> RGC neurons. Overexpression of aRCA3 inhibited trogocytosis and axonal pruning. Conversely, expression of a membrane-bound complement C3 fusion protein in RGCs enhanced axonal pruning. Our findings provide direct in vivo evidence supporting the hypothesis that microglia trogocytose presynaptic axonal elements and supports a model in which microglial trogocytosis regulates axonal pruning to promote proper neural wiring during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Weinhard et al., 2018</xref>). In this model, neurons exert local control of microglial trogocytosis and axonal pruning by expressing complement regulatory proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microglia in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles resemble neonatal mammalian microglia</title><p>Microglia in albino <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles were labeled with IB4-isolectin conjugated fluorophores for in vivo imaging.

As endosomal organelles are typically acidified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casey et al., 2010</xref>), pH-stability of dyes and fluorescent proteins is an important consideration when performing live imaging of trogocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shinoda et al., 2018</xref>). To reduce quenching of fluorescence, we used pHtdGFP (pKa = 4.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>) which is more pH-stable than EGFP (pKa = 6.15). We expressed pHtdGFP in RGC axons by electroporation in the eye and labeled microglia with Alexa 594-conjugated IB4-isolectin.

To quantify microglial trogocytosis, we instead took the approach of measuring microglial green fluorescence across the population of microglia within the optic tectum. A greater number of pHtdGFP-labeled axons in the optic tectum is expected to lead to more frequent opportunities for trogocytotic interactions between microglia and pHtdGFP-labeled axons, resulting in greater amounts of green fluorescent material found within the microglial population. Based on this principle, we developed an assay to measure microglial trogocytosis of RGC axons in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles. At developmental stage 39/40, RGC axons were labeled by retinal electroporation with plasmid encoding pHtdGFP, and microglia were labeled by intraventricular injection of Alexa 594-conjugated IB4-isolectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). By 2 days post-labeling, axons begin expressing pHtdGFP and innervate the optic tectum. This also corresponds to the period when microglia begin to extensively colonize the optic tectum. At day 4 and day 5 post-labeling, the optic tectum was imaged by two-photon microscopy. The number of pHtdGFP-labeled axons present in the optic tectum was counted and the green fluorescence within the population of microglia in the imaging field was quantified using 3D masking with the IB4-isolectin channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To control for the possibility of RGC apoptosis, data were excluded if axonal blebbing was observed, or if the number of axons decreased from day 4 to day 5. Even when electroporation yields no labeled axons, some basal green fluorescence in microglial cells is still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Additionally, labeling of axons with pHtdGFP or SYP-pHtdGFP resulted in an increase in fluorescent label within microglia between days 4 and 5 post-labeling.

We speculate that expression of VAMP2-C3 in RGC neurons reduces viability, as previous studies have shown that the complement cascade mediates phagocytosis of RGC neurons during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, our study indirectly examined the effects of VAMP2-C3 and aRCA3 on microglial trogocytosis. Future experiments could directly examine the effects of VAMP2-C3 expression and aRCA3 overexpression on trogocytosis rates by real-time imaging.</p><p>It is hypothesized that neurons endogenously express membrane-bound complement inhibitory molecules to protect synapses from phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Stephan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stevens et al., 2007</xref>), and our data support this hypothesis. Recently, sushi repeat protein X-linked 2 (SRPX2) has been identified as a endogenous neuronal complement inhibitor in the mammalian system which protects synapses from complement C1 tagging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cong et al., 2020</xref>). SRPX2 is a secreted protein, and while secreted complement inhibitory molecules can act via cell-autonomous mechanisms to protect the neuron that produced it, such molecules also have non-autonomous actions due to the ability to diffuse through the extracellular environment. Conversely, a membrane-bound complement inhibitory molecule acts solely through cell-autonomous mechanisms and allows for greater spatiotemporal control of local complement protection. While the identity of a membrane-bound complement inhibitory molecule endogenous to mammalian neurons remains elusive, in this study we characterized <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> aRCA3, an endogenously expressed, synaptic vesicle-associated, complement inhibitory molecule. aRCA3 is the most similar amphibian homolog of human CD46. CD46 is a membrane-bound complement inhibitory molecule that cleaves activated complement C3 and C4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barilla-LaBarca et al., 2002</xref>). Using the Allen Brain Institute human multiple cortical areas RNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen Institute for Brain Science, 2015</xref>), we report that CD46 transcripts are enriched in human neurons. Interestingly, CD46 associates directly with β1-integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lozahic et al., 2000</xref>), an adhesion molecule present on neuronal surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neugebauer and Reichardt, 1991</xref>) and enriched in synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that it too may be localized to axon surfaces and synapses. In our study, we show that aRCA3 expression inhibits both axon trogocytosis by microglia and axonal pruning—we speculate that CD46 may perform similar functions in mammals. Excessive synaptic pruning is thought to be one of the underlying causes of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sellgren et al., 2019</xref>), and three large-scale genetic susceptibility studies have identified the CD46 gene as a significant Schizophrenia-risk locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Håvik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ripke et al., 2014</xref>).

As depleting microglia increases the number of neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cunningham et al., 2013</xref>) and the number of RGC neurons in the embryonic retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>), it was unclear whether the increased axon tract innervation that occurs following microglial depletion resulted from a deficit of microglial-mediated axonal pruning, or whether it was because of an increase in the overall number of axons. To address this, we examined the effect of microglial depletion on the morphology of single axons, showing that microglia depletion significantly increased axon branch number. Thus, our study supports the model that the increase in axon tract innervation resulting from microglial depletion is because of increased arborization of individual axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>The observations that microglial depletion and overexpression of the complement inhibitor aRCA3 in RGC neurons enhanced axonal arborization suggests that both phenomena may act through a common mechanism. These results support the hypothesis that microglial trogocytosis suppresses both axon branching and axon growth through the removal of extra branches and axonal material. While this explanation is at odds with the observation that microglia-depletion did not increase axon arbor length, it is important to note that with aRCA3 overexpression, a single axon gains a relative growth advantage over other axons—this is distinct from the case of microglial depletion, where all axons profit from the same increased growth. If all axons are growing larger at the same pace, competitive mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gosse et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ruthazer et al., 2003</xref>) might be expected to constrain axon arbor sizes. Another interesting possibility is that microglia preferentially engage in trogocytosis at short, dynamic branches over longer, established, mature branches. In this case, microglial depletion results in a greater number of short branches, which over the short time course in this study, do not significantly impact axon branch length.</p><p>It is worth considering that there may be unintended side-effects of microglial depletion with PLX5622 and that many microglial functions beyond trogocytosis of axons may be altered. In our study, we found that CSF1R inhibition reduced process branching of remaining microglial cells, an observation that has also been seen in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elmore et al., 2014</xref>).

Instead, the effects of microglia depletion on looming-evoked escape behavior must occur further upstream in the retina, the optic tectum, or in the projections from the tectal neurons to the hindbrain. As microglia depletion induces exuberant RGC axonal arborization, one explanation for why microglia depletion disrupts defensive behavior to dark looming stimuli is that the dark looming-sensitive RGC axons cannot effectively wire with their tectal neuron counterparts, resulting in a misclassification of threatening visual stimuli when axonal pruning is disrupted. When microglia are depleted, axons form more errant connections, and dark looming-sensitive RGC axons may instead wire together with tectal neurons which are not associated with threat classification, reducing the probability that dark looming stimuli elicit escape responses. We predict that the reverse is true for bright looming-sensitive RGC axons, whereby microglia depletion results in increased likelihood of errant wiring between bright looming RGC axons and tectal neurons that classify threatening visual stimuli, leading to enhancement of escape behavior to bright looming stimuli. Conversely, it is possible that dark and bright looming-sensitive RGC axons are differentially affected by microglial depletion or the circuitry of the retina upstream of RGCs is remodeled following microglial depletion, both of which could produce the abnormal behavioral outcomes we observed. Indeed, the mechanism linking microglial depletion to improper response to looming stimuli is unclear and warrants future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Synaptic pruning and trogocytosis are two sides of the same coin: axonal pruning</title><p>Classically, synaptic pruning has been described as the engulfment and elimination of synapses, a phenomenon dependent on the complement pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Perry and O'Connor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stevens et al., 2007</xref>).

However, our study suggests that complement-mediated synaptic pruning and trogocytosis are mechanistically related. We find that the complement system influences both axonal trogocytosis and axonal arborization, and it is possible that in CR3 KO mice, compensation through one of the other receptors for activated C3 occurs.

Female frogs were primed by injection of 50 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene Ltd., Ness-Ziona, Isreal). After 3 days, male and primed female frogs were injected with 150 IU and 400 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, CA) into the dorsal lymph sac, respectively. The injected male and female frogs were placed in isolated tanks for mating. Embryos were collected the following day and maintained in Modified Barth’s Saline with HEPES (MBSH) in an incubator at 20°C with LED illumination set to a 12 hr/12 hr day-night cycle and staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (NF) developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1994</xref>). All experiments were conducted according to protocol application number 2015–7728 approved by The Animal Care Committee of the Montreal Neurological Institute and in accordance with Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> sex cannot be determined visually pre-metamorphosis, and thus the sex of experimental animals was unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Labeling of microglia, axons, and brain structures</title><p>Stage 39/40 tadpoles were anesthetized with 0.02% MS-222 in 0.1X MBSH. For labeling of microglia, tadpoles received an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection to the third ventricle of 1 mg/ml Alexa 594 conjugated IB4-isolectin. A minimum of 48 hr was allowed to pass before live imaging studies were commenced to allow for binding and update of IB4-isolectin by microglial cells. For concurrent labeling of brain structures, 1 mM CellTracker Green BODIPY in 10% DMSO was injected icv after isolectin injection. For labeling of RGC axons, electroporation of plasmid DNA into RGC cells was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ruthazer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ruthazer et al., 2013a</xref>). In brief, stage 39/40 tadpoles were anesthetized with 0.02% MS-222 in 0.1X MBSH. A glass micropipette was back filled with endotoxin free maxi-prep plasmid solution (2–3 μg/µl) and fast green to visualize the injection. The micropipette was advanced into the eye, and DNA solution pressure injected. The micropipette was then withdrawn, and parallel platinum electrodes were placed to bracket the eye. For bulk labeling of RGCs, a Grass Instruments SD9 electrical stimulator was used to apply 4–6 pulses of 2.4 ms duration at 36 V with a 3 µF capacitor was placed in parallel to obtain exponential decay current pulses. For single-cell labeling of RGCs, 4–6 pulses of 1.6 ms duration at 36 V was applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Microglial depletion</title><p>PLX5622 was dissolved in DMSO at 20 mM, aliquoted, and stored at −20°C. Thawed aliquots of PLX5622 were sonicated briefly for 1 min before dilution in polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400. PEG 400 solution was then further diluted in a solution of 0.1X MBSH containing non-ionic surfactants poloxamer 407 and D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) to form a mixed micelle drug delivery vehicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2013</xref>). Final vehicle rearing solution consisted of 2.5% PEG 400, 0.04% poloxamer 407, 0.01% TPGS, and 0.05% DMSO in 0.1X MBSH. Initially, animals were reared in 0.1X MBSH. At stage 35–40, animals were transferred to vehicle rearing solution with or without 10 μM PLX5622 for rearing. Rearing solutions were refreshed daily with newly prepared drug and vehicle solutions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Two-photon live imaging</title><p>Two-photon live imaging of axons and microglia cells was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ruthazer et al., 2013b</xref>). Tadpoles were placed in a Sylgard 184 silicone imaging chamber with their dorsal side facing up and were covered with a #1 thickness glass coverslip. One μm interval z-stacks of the optic tectum were collected on a custom-built two-photon microscope (Olympus BX61WI with Olympus FV300 confocal scan head) outfitted with an Olympus 1.0 NA 60x water-immersion objective, or a Thorlabs multiphoton resonant scanner imaging system outfitted with an Olympus 1.0 NA 20x water-immersion objective. Excitation was produced using a Spectra-Physics InSight3X femtosecond pulsed laser. Images were collected at 512 × 512 pixels with Fluoview 5.0 or ThorImage LS.</p><p>For real-time imaging studies, stage 46–48 tadpoles were immobilized by brief (2–8 min) immersion in freshly thawed 2 mM pancuronium bromide in 0.1X MBSH. Animals were then maintained in 0.1X MBSH for imaging. Z-stacks were collected at 6 min intervals. For daily imaging studies, stage 43–47 tadpoles were anesthetized by immersion in 0.02% MS-222. Z-stacks were collected, and animals were returned to 0.1X MBSH rearing solution.</p><p>When imaging microglia (Alexa 594 conjugated IB4-isolectin) and RGC axons (eGFP or pHtdGFP) concurrently, excitation wavelength was set at 830 nm and a 565 nm emission dichroic was used in conjunction with green (500–550 nm) and red (584–676 nm) filters for fluorescence emission detection on separate photomultiplier tubes. When imaging microglia (Alexa 594 conjugated IB4-isolectin) and brain structures (CellTracker Green BODIPY), imaging was done sequentially. Alexa 594 was first imaged with excitation wavelength set to 810 nm and fluorescence emission detection through the red filter. Imaging of CellTracker Green BODIPY was then performed at excitation wavelength 710 nm and the fluorescence emission detected through the green filter. When imaging RGC axons alone (pHtdGFP), excitation wavelength was set to 910 nm and fluorescence emission detected through the green filter.

On day 4 and day 5 post-labeling, 150-µM-thick z-stacks were collected from the optic tectum. Laser power and photomultiplier tube voltage was kept constant on both days. The number of labeled axons was counted manually. In studies when axons were labeled with pHtdGFP, data were excluded if axonal blebbing was detected, or if the number of labeled axons fell from day 4 to day 5. This data exclusion step was not performed when axons were labeled with SYP-pHtdGFP. Using the red microglia channel, microglia 3D ROIs were automatically generated using the 3D object counter plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>). Microglia segmentation threshold was set to the mean pixel intensity of the red channel plus two standard deviations.

The 3D ROI manager plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ollion et al., 2013</xref>) was then used to measure the mean gray value of the green channel within microglial cell ROIs. To reduce background signal in the green channel, the mode of the green pixel intensity was calculated from the z-stack and subtracted. Non-microglial ROIs such as melanophores as well as microglia which had overlapping pixels with the axon were excluded manually and the average microglial green fluorescence intensity for the population of microglia in the z-stack was determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-6"><title>Colocalization analysis</title><p>Two-photon z-stacks were captured on day three post-electroporation. aRCA3-mCherry-Myc and SYP-pHtdGFP channels were denoised using the 3D hybrid median filter ImageJ plugin.

The petri dish was placed on the bottom of a large shallow (20 cm diameter, 8 cm deep) glass culture dish filled completely with 0.1X MBSH. The large shallow glass culture dish was placed on a purple 3D printed stage to allow for automated segmentation of albino tadpoles. A webcam was placed above the tadpole to record tadpole behavior, while a 2000 lumens projector customized by 3D printing to shorten the focal distance, was used to project visual stimuli onto a piece of 96 white 20 lb bond copy paper taped to the side of the large glass culture dish.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Stimulus presentation and recording</title><p>Dark or bright looming stimuli were presented using custom code written in Python 3. An expanding circle was projected onto the culture dish (800 × 600 pixels or 10.6 × 8 cm) using the PsychoPy library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Peirce et al., 2019</xref>). For dark looming stimuli, a black (29 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) expanding circle was shown over a white (208 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) background. For bright looming stimuli, a white expanding circle was shown over a black background. During looming, the diameter of the circle expanded exponentially at 10% per frame at 60 frames per second, from a diameter of 54 pixels (7 mm) until it encompassed the entire screen 0.5 s later. After another 0.8 s, the screen was reset and a 10 s refractory period commenced. In parallel to stimulus presentation, 480 p video was recorded by webcam using the OpenCV library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradski, 2000</xref>).

Feature detection on the petri dish was used to automatically determine the scale of video data. Background was subtracted and segmentation of the tadpole was carried out by thresholding. The resulting mask was fit to an ellipse to extract location and speed, as well as directional data and escape angle. Location data from 0 to 2 s following the onset of the looming stimulus was summarized and displayed as a contrail. Instantaneous velocity for the 3 s before and after the looming stimulus was also extracted and compared by area under curve analysis to obtain distance traveled.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>Discrimination of positive and negative responses to looming stimuli</title><p>An automated python script was used to randomize tadpole videos and a user blinded to treatment categorized tadpole responses to looming stimuli as defensive escape behavior (positive response), absence of defensive escape behavior (negative response), or undeterminable (excluded from response rate calculation). Tadpole responses were categorized as undeterminable if the tadpole was moving quickly when the looming stimulus was presented. The response rate was calculated as the number of positive responses divided by the combined number of positive and negative responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-5"><title>Assessment of motor responses</title><p>Positive escape responses were further analyzed to compare motor data. Escape distance and maximum velocity over 2 s from the onset of the loom was calculated. Escape angle was also measured from heading data. In dark looming stimuli trials, the escape angle was defined as the absolute value of the change in heading from 0 to 0.6 s. For bright looming stimuli trials, the escape angle was defined as the absolute value of the change in heading from 0 to 1.2 s. This difference is because dark looming stimuli evoked escape movement beginning approximately 0.5 s after looming onset, whereas bright looming stimuli evoked escape movement beginning approximately 1.0 s after looming onset.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Identification of complement inhibitory proteins</title><p>To identify candidate complement inhibitory proteins, the STRING database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Szklarczyk et al., 2019</xref>) was used to look for functional interactions between complement C3 and other proteins.

Using the developing retinotectal projection of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles as a model system, you have used molecular manipulations, live imaging and behavior, to provide compelling in vivo evidence that microglia prune axons via trogocytosis – a partial engulfment and breakdown of axon terminals, identifying this process as an important regulator of axonal pruning to promote correct neural wiring during development.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Microglial trogocytosis and the complement system regulate axonal pruning in vivo&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Carlos Aizenman (Reviewer #1); Cornelius T Gross (Reviewer #2); Amanda Sierra (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your study linking microglial trogocytosis, or partial engulfment of axon endings, to the maturation of axonal terminal arborizations in the developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> retinotectal system was in general praised by three reviewers. The longitudinal in vivo fluorescent imaging to simultaneously monitor microglia motility and retinal ganglion cell axon terminal branch dynamics in the optic tectum are superb and informative. Examining the functional consequences of this process, as well as relating the process of trogocytosis to the complement system, are solid additions to your study.</p><p>The reviewers had some issues, nevertheless, on controls for autofluorescence and for the complement experiments, literature citation and discussion, and in some cases, overinterpretation of your data. Most of their comments can be readily amended with your existing data. Below, is a summary of their comments and suggested revisions, taken from the appended reviews and from the reviewer discussion, which was more interactive and thorough than usual with the reviewers ultimately agreeing with each other, all to your benefit.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) Measuring changes in branching versus axon length: Reviewer 2 questioned whether microglia depletion results only in a change of branching, but not overall length of axons. During the reviewer discussion, reviewer 1 pointed out that the changes observed occur over a short time course, of small lengths of an otherwise large arbor and so changes in axon length would not be a useful measure. I agree. This point should be taken up in the Discussion.</p><p>2) Controls for autofluorescence, to demonstrate true trogocytosis signal vs autofluorescence:</p><p>a) As suggested by reviewer 3, is it possible to quantify with appropriate negative controls (for instance, experiments with unlabeled axons, or with off-target labeling in other brain structures) to demonstrate the specificity of the quantification?</p><p>b) Reviewer 2 suggests that traces for all individual cells in the validation experiments (Figure 2F) should be shown to understand the variability in the persistent change in GFP signal that remains after contacts are completed. In addition, a spectral analysis should be done to help rule out autofluorescence.</p><p>c) Correlative EM, also suggested, would be a labor-intensive addition, and is not deemed necessary if one of the former suggestions are taken.</p><p>3) Complement experiments</p><p>a) Reviewer 2 thought that the proper control for the VAMP2-C3 overexpression is VAMP2 itself, is not ideal, citing that VAMP2-C3 fusion might have dominant negative effects that could have little to do with C3; also, that a better control would be VAMP2-C3* where C3* is non-cleavable or even a VAMP2-GFP fusion. He also wondered why you did not use a GPI anchor if the idea was to present C3 on the membrane, and whether you had evidence that C3 in this fusion form is functional. In the Consultation session, reviewer 1 did not think that the VAMP-GFP fusion or uncleaveable C3 would be better, and surmised that you used VAMP rather than GPI anchors to limit expression to presynaptic terminals. Reviewer 2 accepts this point but please discuss the inherent weaknesses in using the VAMP2-C3 control, either in the Materials and methods and/or Results.</p><p>b) Reviewer 3 thought that for the aRCA3 overexpression and VAMP2-C3 expression experiments (Figures 7 and 8), you should show direct evidence that trogocytosis is altered by quantifying the axonal fluorescent signal in microglia (as in Figure 3C), as proof that engulfment is potentiated or decreased (instead of showing only the downstream effect in axons). Reviewer 1 rebutted this comment by indicating that he did see a difference in axon phenotypes for depletion and CD46 homolog or C3 overexpression. He also acknowledges that you do discuss and invoke compensations due to the cell autonomous nature of the CD46 homolog and C3 over-expression. However, he did find it disappointing that you did not follow up on a single axon level with longitudinal in vivo live imaging what the impact of microglia contacts is in these circumstances. Please address the shortcomings of these experiments in the Discussion.</p><p>c) Reviewer 2, # 6 comment on why depletion of microglia does not alter the number of axons, only their branching, but manipulations of complement seem to alter total numbers of axons. Please cite the possibility that C3 has an impact on microglia-mediated neuron elimination via apoptosis (see on RGC apoptosis and C3r, Anderson et al., 2019). Reviewer 1 thought that both microglia depletion and complement manipulation altered number of axonal branches, not number of axons. Please address this point in the Discussion.</p><p>4) RGC subtype specificity; pruning in areas outside the tectum:</p><p>a) As per reviewer 1's comments, that because there is a bigger effect on dark looming detectors than light looming detectors, different types of axons (from different RGCs having different response selectivity) could be differently selective to microglial pruning.</p><p>b) Inhibition of microglial activation by PLX5622 might also affect remodeling in visual circuits, and could account for the behavioral difference.</p><p>Please discuss.</p><p>5) Unease with the behavioral results: Reviewer 2, comment #4 and Figure 9: the &quot;behavioral part of the manuscript is only weakly linked to the main story&quot;. Reviewer 1 somewhat concurs, especially since this behavior is something that is known to require intact tectal circuitry. To this end, reviewer 3 proposes that to ensure that microglia outside the optic tectum, including the retina, regions involved in locomotion, as well as peripheral macrophages are not affected, evidence should be provided that the depleted animals do not have impairments in their vision, locomotor activity, and overall health. Reviewer 2 subsequently agreed to include the behavior, provided that you explicitly state that the mechanism that links depletion to behavior is far from understood, and remove Figure 9 summary, as it now stands, &quot;to offset the abundance of correlative findings and hype in this field and reinforcement of (such) data&quot;. Reviewer 3 adds that you could modify Figure 9 to summarize what is known and what is not, and put question marks whenever appropriate. The latter would be a compromise position.</p><p>6) Literature citation: All three reviewers ask for a more critical appraisal of the literature regarding microglial synaptic pruning, to highlight what you have done so well and how it is novel (see Reviewer 2, point #9; Reviewer 3: Point #1): Although previous and widely cited studies argue for microglial pruning, based on KO and depletion models, there is little direct evidence that microglia actively select the synapses to be removed (in contrast to neural shdding of synapses, later to be engulfed by microglia). Other live imaging studies have failed to show that microglia grasp and digest synapses from living neurons; this includes the Weinhard and Gross study using organotypic cultures. They instead report axonal trogocytosis, for the first time, in vivo. Yours is the first study very nicely demonstrating trogocytosis by live imaging.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a beautiful study, and probably one of the best work I've seen from this group, already known for excellent, high-quality papers in developmental neuroscience.</p><p>The authors use an in vivo system to examine the hypothesis, based on prior in vitro data, that microglia prune axons via troglocytosis – a partial engulfment of an axon, basically by engulfing and breaking down axon terminals. The advantages of this in vivo system is that they can also push this hypothesis much further by examining the functional implications of microglial troglocytosis, and directly link the role of the complement system in synaptic pruning to microglial engulfment of axon terminals.</p><p>Using the developing retinotectal projection of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles as a model system, the authors present a compelling set of experiments, that include molecular manipulations, live imaging and behavior, to provide compelling in vivo evidence that microglia troglocytose presynaptic axon terminals, and that this is an important regulator of axonal pruning to promote correct neural wiring during development.</p><p>Their experiments are as follows: <italic>Xenopus</italic> microglia are identified by labelling with IB4-isolectin, and using in vivo imaging are found to me highly motile and responsive to injury, consistent with known MG functions. Remarkably MG enter the neuropil and are shown to associate with a green FP labelled retinal axon and depart with little bits of green fluorescence in their bellies. Moreover, using labelled synaptophysin (a synaptic vesicle protein) they show that MG are actually engulfing synaptic terminals. This increase in green fluorescent in the MG was shown to be highly significant as shown as an increase over a day. These experiments convincingly show troglocytosis by MG of synaptic terminals in vivo and in real time. The provided videos are incredible.</p><p>Next they look at the developmental consequences of MG pruning. In the first experiment they deplete MG using an inhibitor of a kinase necessary for MG survival. Depletion of MG results in increased branching of RGC axon terminals, suggesting that MG are negatively regulating axon branching over development. To test the consequences of this, they use a behavioral response to either dimming or brightening visual stimuli. Remarkably, MG depletion induced remodeling suppresses responses to dimming stimuli and enhances responses to brightening stimuli. While this is a puzzling finding, it does show that disrupted remodeling does cause abnormal behavior.</p><p>To find whether the complement system is important for regulating MG pruning, they first look for complement regulating proteins known to be associated in the brain, and identify human CD46 as a top candidate. The closes protein to this was the frog aRCA3 protein, a transmembrane protein with several complement control protein domains (CCCPs). Using RNAscope in situ hybridization, they find that aRCA3 is expressed in the RGC layer in the retina, and that it co-localizes with RGC axon terminals. By overexpressing aRCA2 (and thus inhibiting complement) they see decreased MG troglocytosis and enhanced axonal branching, whereas increasing complement expression in axons (by anchoring it to the presynaptic terminal) they saw increased pruning.</p><p>Together these data show compelling evidence that the complement system regulates activation of microglia, and thus axonal pruning, which results in normal sculpting of axonal projections in the developing brain.</p><p>I really struggled to find something I didn't like about this study. The data is high-quality, the logic is clear, the findings are incredibly cool and compelling. This paper will be of interest to a wide range of scientists, including developmental neuroscientists, systems neuroscientists, those interested in the role of the immune system in the brain, etc. What I especially like is how it brings together a bunch of disparate ideas and creates a sense of clarity that makes it one of those papers that read as an instant classic.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Lim et al. takes important steps to link microglia to the maturation of axonal terminal arborization in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> vertebrate model. They take advantage of the unique power of this system to perform longitudinal in vivo fluorescent imaging to simultaneously monitor microglia motility and retinal ganglion cell axon terminal extensions in the optic tectum. Their major novel observation is that microglia appear to persistently retain cytoplasmic GFP signal expressed in axons following their contacts with axons. They invoke microglia-neuron trogocytosis as a possible mechanism to explain this phenomenon. They then go on to show that pharmacological depletion of microglia results in an increase in axonal branching and conjecture that trogocytosis is involved in reducing axonal branching by a trogocytosis-dependent pruning phenomenon. In a digression they also show that the same pharmacological treatment results in changes in behavioral responses to dark and light looming stimuli. In the second half of the work they overexpress a <italic>Xenopus</italic> CD46 homolog and show that it reduces GFP retention and increases axonal outgrowth/branching and overexpress C3 and show that it decreases GFP retention and decreases axonal outgrowth/branching. The authors conclude that microglia restrict axon terminal outgrowth by trogocytosing axon material via a complement-dependent mechanism.</p><p>The work makes several important observations and has the potential to link microglia function to the pruning of axon terminals. In particular, several observations are important for the field in my opinion and could be elaborated more, including the finding that microglia depletion results in a change of branching, but not overall length of axons, and the report of frequent switching back and forth between ramified and amoeboid morphologies and entry and exit from the neuropil layer. However, several data are overinterpreted in my view and the authors need to hone closer to the findings so as to emphasize their most important contributions.</p><p>Issues that should to be addressed:</p><p>1) The GFP retention assay needs controls in order to rule out confounds due to the background autofluorescence mentioned by the authors. Traces for all individual cells in the validation experiments (Figure 2F) should be shown for the reader to understand the variability in the persistent change in GFP signal that remains after contacts are completed. In addition, a spectral analysis should be done to help rule out autofluorescence.</p><p>2) To causally link GFP retention to axonal remodeling it would be helpful to follow the axonal arborization of neurons that have been contact by microglia. Do they change in a manner consistent with the microglia depletion experiments (changes in branching but not axon length)? Without this kind of data it is hard to understand the impact of microglia contacts on axons.</p><p>3) Figure 3EF: it seems odd that Syp-GFP is taken up by microglia as it should be primarily localized to vesicles. Does this suggest that microglia engulf axons with their vesicles inside?</p><p>4) The behavioral part of the manuscript is only weakly linked to the main story. Microglia depletion will clearly have multiple effects on development beyond the remodeling of axons in the optic tectum and without a more restricted depletion or manipulation of microglia and documented interpretable changes in the responsible circuitry, the link to changed behavior is tenuous. Given this weak mechanistic link, Figure 9 is premature and misleading and should be eliminated.</p><p>5) It is not clear that the proper control for the VAMP2-C3 overexpression is VAMP2 itself. I'd be concerned that a VAMP2-C3 fusion might have dominant negative effects that could have nothing to do with C3 and could explain the difference with VAMP2. The better control would be VAMP2-C3* where C3* is non-cleavable or even a VAMP2-GFP fusion. Also, if the idea was to present C3 on the membrane then why didn't the authors use a GPI anchor? Moreover, it would be good to have evidence that the C3 in this fusion form is in fact functional.</p><p>6) If depletion of microglia does not alter the number of axons, but just their branching, why do manipulations of complement seem to alter total numbers of axons? The argument made in the Discussion that in this case there are compensations is possible, but other mechanisms should be considered, in particular the possibility that C3 has an impact on microglia-mediated neuron elimination via apoptosis (see paper about RGC apoptosis and C3r, Anderson et al., 2019).</p><p>7) The authors should present the criteria that define trogocytosis in the manner used in this manuscript, especially as there is no EM data to support its morphological assessment.</p><p>8) The images in Figure 7 do not appear to be representative of the data in the accompanying graph for branch numbers.</p><p>9) Several citations are referred to incorrectly: Weinhard et al., 2018 presented evidence for trogocytosis in fixed brain tissue using electron microscopy; Paolicelli et al., 2011 did not investigate complement factors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;Microglial trogocytosis and the complement system regulate axonal prunning in vivo&quot; by Lim and Ruthazer is a very elegantly designed and written paper showing for the first time in vivo evidence of microglial trogocytosis, using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpole retinotectal circuit as a model.</p><p>The paper is very solid and I only have a few comments.</p><p>1) The authors seem to consider that microglial synaptic pruning is well-established whereas axonal trogocytosis is not but this is not exactly the case. The evidences for microglial pruning synapses come from indirect studies using KO and depletion models – these studies demonstrate a role for microglia but do not provide direct evidence that microglia actively selects the synapses to be removed (in opposition to neurons shedding off the synapses, later engulfed by microglia), although this is widely stated in the literature.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Carlos Aizenman (Reviewer #1); Amanda Sierra (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your study on microglial pruning of axon endings through partial engulfment is excellent and well documented. Using the developing retinotectal projection of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles as a model system, you have presented a varied set of experiments that include molecular manipulations, live imaging and behavior, to provide compelling in vivo evidence that microglia prune axons via trogocytosis – a partial engulfment of an axon and breakdown of axon terminals, identifying this process as an important regulator of axonal pruning to promote correct neural wiring during development.</p><p>Especially pointed is the experiment to overexpress aRCA2 (equivalent to human CD46) and thus inhibiting complement, when you see decreased microglial trogocytosis and enhanced axonal branching, whereas increasing complement expression in axons (by anchoring it to the presynaptic terminal) you see increased pruning. Together with the functional experiments, these data show compelling evidence that the complement system regulates activation of microglia, and thus axonal pruning, which results in normal sculpting of axonal projections in the developing brain.</p><p>Your revisions are apt and thorough, and address the concerns of the reviewers. Reviewer 1 in fact said, &quot;(this is) probably one of the best work I've seen from this group, already known for excellent, high-quality papers in developmental neuroscience.&quot;</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>Reviewer 3 had two caveats and you can address these by textual revision:</p><p>1) Refrain from using the term &quot;activated microglia&quot; or &quot;microglial activation&quot; since there is no unique state of activation. Rather, microglia show different responses to different stimuli. As you show, in physiological conditions, they are far from &quot;resting&quot; and play critical roles by responding to neuronal cues.</p><p>2) This reviewer had initial concern about the specificity of your novel imaging method, which you largely addressed with new figures. However, you have not provided additional evidence of engulfment with an independent method, such as correlational EM analysis, as this reviewer recommended. You lightly touched on this issue by mentioning the EM study performed by Weinhard et al. , but a more explicit acknowledgement of the need of independent corroboration of their findings is still needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62167.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) Measuring changes in branching versus axon length: Reviewer 2 questioned whether microglia depletion results only in a change of branching, but not overall length of axons. During the reviewer discussion, reviewer 1 pointed out that the changes observed occur over a short time course, of small lengths of an otherwise large arbor and so changes in axon length would not be a useful measure. I agree. This point should be taken up in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The following text has been added to the Discussion:</p><p>“Another interesting possibility is that microglia preferentially engage in trogocytosis at short, dynamic, branches over longer, established, mature branches. In this case, microglial depletion results in a greater number of short branches, which over the short time course in this study, do not significantly impact axon branch length.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Controls for autofluorescence, to demonstrate true trogocytosis signal vs autofluorescence:</p><p>a) As suggested by reviewer 3, is it possible to quantify with appropriate negative controls (for instance, experiments with unlabeled axons, or with off-target labeling in other brain structures) to demonstrate the specificity of the quantification?</p><p>b) Reviewer 2 suggests that traces for all individual cells in the validation experiments (Figure 2F) should be shown to understand the variability in the persistent change in GFP signal that remains after contacts are completed. In addition, a spectral analysis should be done to help rule out autofluorescence.</p><p>c) Correlative EM, also suggested, would be a labor-intensive addition, and is not deemed necessary if one of the former suggestions are taken.</p></disp-quote><p>The important negative control experiment to address the question of autofluorescence, in which the experiment is performed with unlabeled axons, was actually integrated into our original experimental design in Figure 3C and D (i.e., “no axons” condition). No significant increase in green fluorescence was detected in this condition.</p><p>We have also added a supplemental figure (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1) which follows over time the changes in intensity of green fluorescence associated with each microglial cell that contacts (or fails to contact) a GFP-expressing axon. The stable levels of green fluorescence in non-interacting microglia lends further support to our finding that green fluorescence in microglia increases specifically as a result of axon-microglia contact.</p><p>In addition, we have added a new quantitative analysis (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1) which examines green fluorescence across all individual cells in the trogocytosis assay validation experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Complement experiments</p><p>a) Reviewer 2 thought that the proper control for the VAMP2-C3 overexpression is VAMP2 itself, is not ideal, citing that VAMP2-C3 fusion might have dominant negative effects that could have little to do with C3; also, that a better control would be VAMP2-C3* where C3* is non-cleavable or even a VAMP2-GFP fusion. He also wondered why you did not use a GPI anchor if the idea was to present C3 on the membrane, and whether you had evidence that C3 in this fusion form is functional. In the Consultation session, reviewer 1 did not think that the VAMP-GFP fusion or uncleaveable C3 would be better, and surmised that you used VAMP rather than GPI anchors to limit expression to presynaptic terminals. Reviewer 2 accepts this point but please discuss the inherent weaknesses in using the VAMP2-C3 control, either in the Materials and methods and/or Results.</p></disp-quote><p>We added to the Results to explain why we didn’t use a GPI anchor design:</p><p>&quot;This design was chosen in favor of a GPI anchor design that modifies the C-terminus C345C domain of complement C3 as this domain undergoes major rearrangement during activation and proteolysis (32° rotation, 10 Å translation) (Janssen et al., 2005). In contrast, the N-terminus of complement C3 is exposed on the surface of the protein and located on the MG1 domain, a domain that does not undergo marked confirmational changes upon complement C3 activation and proteolysis (3° rotation, 1 Å translation).”</p><p>Also added to the Discussion to discuss the shortcomings of the VAMP2 control:</p><p>“While VAMP2-C3 clearly produced effects on axon morphology, we did not rule out the possibility that the expression of VAMP2-C3 in RGC neurons may be producing effects on axons that are not mediated by the complement system.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Reviewer 3 thought that for the aRCA3 overexpression and VAMP2-C3 expression experiments (Figures 7 and 8), you should show direct evidence that trogocytosis is altered by quantifying the axonal fluorescent signal in microglia (as in Figure 3C), as proof that engulfment is potentiated or decreased (instead of showing only the downstream effect in axons). Reviewer 1 rebutted this comment by indicating that he did see a difference in axon phenotypes for depletion and CD46 homolog or C3 overexpression. He also acknowledges that you do discuss and invoke compensations due to the cell autonomous nature of the CD46 homolog and C3 over-expression. However, he did find it disappointing that you did not follow up on a single axon level with longitudinal in vivo live imaging what the impact of microglia contacts is in these circumstances. Please address the shortcomings of these experiments in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Added to the Discussion:</p><p>&quot;Additionally, we were unable to determine whether VAMP2-C3 expression enhanced microglial trogocytosis as electroporation of RGC neurons with VAMP2-C3 rarely yielded labeled axons. We speculate that expression of VAMP2-C3 in RGC neurons reduces viability, as previous studies have shown that the complement cascade mediates phagocytosis of RGC neurons during development (Anderson et al., 2019). Furthermore, our study indirectly examined the effects of VAMP2-C3 and aRCA3 on microglial trogocytosis. Future experiments could directly examine the effects of VAMP2-C3 expression and aRCA3 overexpression on trogocytosis rates by real-time imaging.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Reviewer 2, # 6 comment on why depletion of microglia does not alter the number of axons, only their branching, but manipulations of complement seem to alter total numbers of axons. Please cite the possibility that C3 has an impact on microglia-mediated neuron elimination via apoptosis (see on RGC apoptosis and C3r, Anderson et al., 2019). Reviewer 1 thought that both microglia depletion and complement manipulation altered number of axonal branches, not number of axons. Please address this point in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the Discussion to be clearer that the number of axons was not examined in this study. Our experiments select for labeling of isolated pHtdGFP-expressing single axons that can be reconstructed for morphometric analysis. This experimental design therefore does not provide direct or indirect information about the total number of retinal axons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) RGC subtype specificity; pruning in areas outside the tectum:</p><p>a) As per reviewer 1's comments, that because there is a bigger effect on dark looming detectors than light looming detectors, different types of axons (from different RGCs having different response selectivity) could be differently selective to microglial pruning.</p><p>b) Inhibition of microglial activation by PLX5622 might also affect remodeling in visual circuits, and could account for the behavioral difference.</p><p>Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Added to the Discussion:</p><p>“Conversely, it is possible that dark and bright looming-sensitive RGC axons are differentially affected by microglial depletion or the circuitry of the retina upstream of RGCs is remodeled following microglial depletion, both of which could produce the abnormal behavioral outcomes we observed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Unease with the behavioral results: Reviewer 2, comment #4 and Figure 9: the &quot;behavioral part of the manuscript is only weakly linked to the main story&quot;. Reviewer 1 somewhat concurs, especially since this behavior is something that is known to require intact tectal circuitry. To this end, reviewer 3 proposes that to ensure that microglia outside the optic tectum, including the retina, regions involved in locomotion, as well as peripheral macrophages are not affected, evidence should be provided that the depleted animals do not have impairments in their vision, locomotor activity, and overall health. Reviewer 2 subsequently agreed to include the behavior, provided that you explicitly state that the mechanism that links depletion to behavior is far from understood, and remove Figure 9 summary, as it now stands, &quot;to offset the abundance of correlative findings and hype in this field and reinforcement of (such) data&quot;. Reviewer 3 adds that you could modify Figure 9 to summarize what is known and what is not, and put question marks whenever appropriate. The latter would be a compromise position.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur and have removed Figure 9C which relied too heavily on correlative findings and added to the Discussion:</p><p>&quot;Indeed, the mechanism linking microglial depletion to improper response to looming stimuli is unclear and warrants future investigation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Literature citation: All three reviewers ask for a more critical appraisal of the literature regarding microglial synaptic pruning, to highlight what you have done so well and how it is novel (see Reviewer 2, point #9; Reviewer 3: Point #1): Although previous and widely cited studies argue for microglial pruning, based on KO and depletion models, there is little direct evidence that microglia actively select the synapses to be removed (in contrast to neural shdding of synapses, later to be engulfed by microglia). Other live imaging studies have failed to show that microglia grasp and digest synapses from living neurons; this includes the Weinhard and Gross study using organotypic cultures. They instead report axonal trogocytosis, for the first time, in vivo. Yours is the first study very nicely demonstrating trogocytosis by live imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>We added to the Introduction:</p><p>“Studies depleting microglia or disrupting microglial function provide indirect evidence to support the hypothesis that microglia remodel synapses through phagocytic mechanisms. An inherent weakness of indirect approaches is that the source of the synaptic material within microglia is unknown. For example, it is possible that synaptic components may be found within microglia due to clearance of apoptotic neurons rather than synaptic pruning. More direct approaches are required to verify whether microglia collect synaptic material from living neurons.”</p><p>Modified the main text to be more assertive about trogocytosis results.</p><p>Modified the Introduction to include the mention of electron micrographic data in the Weinhard et al., 2018 study.</p><p>Removed incorrect references attributing complement studies to Paolicelli et al.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>Reviewer 3 had two caveats and you can address these by textual revision:</p><p>1) Refrain from using the term &quot;activated microglia&quot; or &quot;microglial activation&quot; since there is no unique state of activation. Rather, microglia show different responses to different stimuli. As you show, in physiological conditions, they are far from &quot;resting&quot; and play critical roles by responding to neuronal cues.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed both of these references to microglial activation from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) This reviewer had initial concern about the specificity of your novel imaging method, which you largely addressed with new figures.

You lightly touched on this issue by mentioning the EM study performed by Weinhard et al., but a more explicit acknowledgement of the need of independent corroboration of their findings is still needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The first paragraph of the Discussion section, summarizing our results now explicitly acknowledges that our finding was not confirmed using correlative EM:</p><p>“As SYP-pHtdGFP is primarily localized to synaptic vesicles, this suggests that the axonal material that microglia engulf contains presynaptic vesicles and is consistent with correlative electron microscopy studies that have demonstrated putative presynaptic vesicles within microglia (Weinhard et al., 2018), although we did not use correlative electron microscopy to confirm this in our study.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
