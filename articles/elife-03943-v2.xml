congenital muscular dystrophy with hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan (secondary dystroglycanopathies). Since defects in the O-mannosylation protein glycosylation pathway are primarily responsible for dystroglycanopathies and with no established O-mannose initiated structures containing a β3 linked GlcNAc known, we biochemically interrogated this human enzyme. Here we report this enzyme is not a β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase with catalytic activity towards β-galactose but rather a β-1,4-glucuronyltransferase, designated B4GAT1, towards both α- and β-anomers of xylose. The dual-activity LARGE enzyme is capable of extending products of B4GAT1 and we provide experimental evidence that B4GAT1 is the priming enzyme for LARGE. Our results further define the functional O-mannosylated glycan structure and indicate that B4GAT1 is involved in the initiation of the LARGE-dependent repeating disaccharide that is necessary for extracellular matrix protein binding to O-mannosylated α-dystroglycan that is lacking in secondary dystroglycanopathies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03943.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03943.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03943.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Dystroglycan is a protein that is essential for muscles to function correctly, and helps to connect the interior framework of muscle cells with the external matrix of molecules that hold the cells together in the tissue. As is the case for many proteins, dystroglycan must have particular carbohydrate molecules joined to it in order to work correctly. Enzymes called glycosyltransferases assist with the reactions that build the carbohydrates on a protein.</p><p>Mutations in multiple glycosyltransferases that add carbohydrates to dystroglycan can cause a group of diseases that are characterized by a progressive loss of muscle function, known as congenital muscular dystrophies. Praissman et al. use biochemical experimentation to investigate the role of one of these enzymes, known as B3GNT1. The enzyme's name is based on a code that describes which carbohydrate it helps to bind to proteins. However, Praissman et al. (and independently, Willer et al.) discovered that this enzyme actually works with a different donor and acceptor than previously thought, and so should be called B4GAT1 instead.</p><p>Praissman et al. propose that the B4GAT1 enzyme starts the process of forming the carbohydrate structures that help muscle cells bind to the muscle tissue matrix. B4GAT1 forms short carbohydrates on the surface of the part of dystroglycan that sits on the surface of cells. These carbohydrates are then extended into longer chains by another glycosyltransferase called LARGE. The results of Praissman et al. suggest that another enzyme is also involved in this process, which will require further studies to identify. Understanding the role of B4GAT1 and other glycosyltransferases that build functionally glycosylated dystroglycan could help to develop treatments for diseases such as muscular dystrophies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03943.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03943.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>congenital muscular dystrophy</kwd><kwd>O-mannosylation</kwd><kwd>glycosylation</kwd><kwd>alpha-dystroglycan</kwd><kwd>B4GAT1</kwd><kwd>B3GNT1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111939</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Live</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Lance</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01GM107012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boons</surname><given-names>Geert-Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Lance</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moremen</surname><given-names>Kelley W</given-names></name><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Lance</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Live</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name><name><surname>Boons</surname><given-names>Geert-Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Moremen</surname><given-names>Kelley W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The correct enzymatic activity of a previously misnamed enzyme is defined, placing the enzyme upstream of LARGE in building functional O-mannose structures on α-dystroglycan that are disrupted in multiple forms of congenital muscular dystrophy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glycosylation is the most abundant and diverse post-translational modification of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Varki, 2011</xref>).

Poly-N-acetyllactosamine is a prevalent glycan substructure found in N-glycans and O-glycans on proteins whose abnormal levels have been associated with human diseases including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ujita et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). The Fukuda group used an expression cloning strategy enriching for plasmids containing cDNA inserts that substantially increased poly-N-acetyllactosamine, as judged by antibody binding, on the surfaces of Namalwa KJM-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sasaki et al., 1997</xref>). Shortly thereafter, work carried out by Hennet's and Sasaki's groups led to the cloning of three other β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, B3GNT2, 3, and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shiraishi et al., 2001</xref>). However, papers as recently as 2008 continued to use conflicting nomenclature for B3GNT2 by calling it B3GNT1 causing some confusion within the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biellmann et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, B3GNT2, B3GNT3 and B3GNT4 were found to share motifs with β3-galactosyl-transferases as well as β3-GalNAc-transferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shiraishi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Togayachi et al., 2006</xref>).

B3GNT1 lacks these motifs and is in a different CaZY family, interestingly one shared with LARGE and LARGE2 that contain both xylosyl- and glucoronsyl–transferase activity and which functionally modify O-mannosylated glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inamori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goddeeris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inamori et al., 2013</xref>).

Here we report that B3GNT1 is in fact B4GAT1 (β-1,4-glucuronyltransferase 1) that generates the substrate for the LARGE-dependent repeating disaccharide that is required for interaction of O-mannosylated α-dystroglycan with extracellular matrix proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>B3GNT1 (B4GAT1), unlike B3GNT2, is not a N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase</title><p>A secreted (lacking the trans-membrane domain) epitope-tagged form of human B3GNT1 was recombinantly expressed in HEK293F cells, purified, and the epitope tag removed before enzymatic characterization.

We have gone on to show that LARGE can extend the resulting products of B4GAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Prior reports indicated that B4GAT1 (B3GNT1) activity is necessary for expression of LARGE-dependent functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan and that B4GAT1 (B3GNT1) and LARGE form a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buysse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czeschik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>). We were unable to confirm this latter point using our soluble forms of the enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since we have shown that the specific activity and catalytic efficiency of B4GAT1 towards the tested monosaccharide xylosides is greater by more than an order of magnitude compared to LARGE catalysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), this suggests that B4GAT1 is an initiating enzyme for LARGE-dependent glycan synthesis. This conclusion is further strengthened by data showing a significant lag in the initial rate for synthesis of or a complete failure to produce polymer in the absence of B4GAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It also appears that B4GAT1 serves exclusively as a priming enzyme since we could not detect B4GAT1 modification of LARGE extended trisaccharides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We also demonstrate that neither LARGE nor B4GAT1 is capable of adding GlcA to a disaccharide that has been capped with GlcA suggesting that branching is not occurring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This leads to the conclusion that there is only one type of repeating disaccharide (Xyl-α3-GlcA-β3) attached to α-dystroglycan that is synthesized by LARGE. This data also serves to highlight the differences in structural isomers by showing both anomeric configuration (α and β, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig6">Figures 2C and 6</xref>) as well as linkage position (−3 and −4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) of isomeric substrates influences their subsequent ability to be elongated by enzymes (LARGE and B4GAT1). In sum, our data provide a basis for further attempts to fully elucidate the functional LARGE-dependent O-mannose-initiated structure(s) and suggests that at least one of the remaining incompletely characterized genes implicated in functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (FKTN, FKRP, ISPD, and TMEM5, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wells, 2013</xref>]) likely encodes a xylosyltransferase to provide a substrate for B4GAT1. Given that B4GAT1 is essential for proper glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buysse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czeschik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>) and that LARGE is incapable of transferring GlcA to a β-xylopyranoside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inamori et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2013</xref>]) or generating a polymer from pNP-β-Xyl without B4GAT1 present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), our findings strongly suggest that the underlying xylose is in a β-linkage on α-dystroglycan. This work also clarifies why deficiencies in this enzyme would be associated with loss of functional glycosylation and laminin binding of α-dystroglycan and be causal for congenital muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buysse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czeschik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>). Further, our results likely clarify how loss of expression of B4GAT1 (B3GNT1), similar to loss of expression of LARGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Bernabe et al., 2009</xref>), can lead to loss of laminin-binding α-dystroglycan and promote metastasis in certain cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, potential complex interactions between poly-N-acetyllactosamine, as often measured by the i-antigen antibody, and the LARGE-dependent repeating disaccharide, often measured on α-dystroglycan by the IIH6 antibody, need to be reexamined in the context of the newly defined enzymatic activity of B4GAT1 (B3GNT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ujita et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wright et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoneyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buysse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czeschik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>). For example, B4GAT1 has previously been observed to be in complex with B4GALT1, an enzyme required for poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). This finding suggested that interaction between these two enzymes, which were thought to generate the repeating disaccharide, potentially influenced poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis. In lieu of our findings, this extrapolated conclusion from the interaction data is no longer valid. Instead, the relationship between poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis and the functional O-mannose glycan pathway needs to be evaluated, especially given that both have been implicated in cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ujita et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wright et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoneyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buysse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czeschik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03943.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed role of B4GAT1 in the O-mannosylation pathway.</title><p>The molecular link between the phospho-O-mannose trisaccharide synthesized on α-dystroglycan and the LARGE synthesized repeating disaccharide crucial for laminin binding reactivity is still not fully characterized (represented as [X]).

This designation is following in the tradition of the three other known non-proteoglycan glycoprotein glucuronyltransferases that all add GlcA in a β3-linkage (B3GAT1-3, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morita et al., 2008</xref>]). Interestingly, the only established glycoprotein glycoslytransferases capable of transferring GlcA in a β4-linkage are the dual-activity exostoses enzymes involved in heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan polymerization that build the repeating disaccharide (-GlcNAc-α4-GlcA-β4-) backbone of the glycosaminoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zak et al., 2002</xref>). Similarities exist between HS (and other proteoglycan) biosynthesis pathways and the LARGE-dependent functional O-mannose glycan assembly pathway built on α-dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Included in these similarities are that they both contain non-reducing end repeating disaccharides (GlcA and GlcNAc for HS and GlcA and Xyl for the functional O-Man structure), they both contain an acidic glycan (GlcA), there is a copolymerase that has dual–enzymatic activity (exostoses enzymes for HS and LARGE for the functional O-Man glycan structure), both require a specific underlying core structure, and each contains specific priming glycosyltransferases (EXTLs for HS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kitagawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2001</xref>], B4GAT1 for the functional O-Man glycan structure) that adds one of the sugars found in the repeat to the underlying core structure to initiate elongation. Here we have established that B4GAT1, previously referred to as B3GNT1, is a xylopyranoside β1,4-glucuronyltransferase that appears to be the priming enzyme for the LARGE copolymerase for building the functional O-Man structure on α-dystroglycan that when defective causes CMD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Tagged monosaccharide glycosides were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) at ≥97% purity as were UDP-GlcA trisodium salt, UDP-GlcNAc disodium salt and UDP-Gal disodium salt.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Suzanne Pfeffer, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, while Pamela Stanley has also agreed to reveal her identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes an exciting new development in our understanding of the synthesis of a functional glycan required for α-dystroglycan to interact with laminin and the ECM. The data strongly support the authors' conclusions that the enzyme formerly called B3GNT1 should be renamed B4GAT1. However, the following points and questions should be addressed by the authors:</p><p>1) LARGE has a very low specific activity in these assays. The data in this manuscript should be compared directly for consistency with previous data published by the Campbell and Bakker groups (3 papers) in terms of incubation times, UDP-sugar concentrations, pH, metal ions etc. In addition, the precise conditions for each set of assay conditions should be given in all figure and table legends. It is not sufficient to have general conditions in the Methods.</p><p>2) It is intriguing that B4GAT1 has similar specificity for Xyl-α-MU and Xyl-β-MU. Could B4GAT1 be a branching enzyme as well as a priming enzyme? The fact that branching is not observed with tri-saccharide substrates under certain conditions <italic>in vitro</italic> does not rule out this possibility.</p><p>3) Does LARGE produce at least a small polymer from di- or trisaccharide substrate when both UDP-xylose and UDP-GlcA are present in the reaction? It would support priming if polymer is only obtained when B4GAT1 is in the mix.</p><p>4) The literature indicates that LARGE and B4GAT1 should form a complex. Is this the case for the purified enzymes? And, if so, does the complex increase the specific activity of LARGE/B4GAT1 for Xyl-α-MU? These data would provide important support for the priming activity of B4GAT1.</p><p>5) The study uses artificial substrates and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. The model presented predicts that the alpha-dystroglycan from B4GAT1 deficient cells (KD, KO or patient derived) should display a single branched Xylose (or a terminal Xylose) in addition to the phospho-O-Mannose tri-saccharide. In recognition of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient quantities for structural evidence, indirect evidence that the absence of B4GAT1 results in the production of O-Mannose glycans on alpha-dystroglycan terminating in beta-xylose (or at least xylose) would be helpful.</p><p>6) To explore why B4GAT1 is indispensable and prove it is a priming enzyme, it would be ideal to test whether the first Xylose on the alpha-dystroglycan is indeed branched in Beta as proposed by the authors. Please speculate on how this could be tested.</p><p>7) Lee at al 2009 presents data for intracellular association of B4GAT1/B3GNT1 with B4GALT1. Perhaps the new findings suggest that a variety of Golgi glycosyltransferases are present in larger, oligomeric assemblies in cells? Please speculate. Also, could the authors speculate why the previous work came to the wrong conclusion?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03943.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) LARGE has a very low specific activity in these assays.

The buffering conditions between our assays and those used by others (Inamori K, et al., 2012, Science, 335:93, Goddeeris, MM et al., 2013, Nature, 503:136, and Ashikov, A, et al., 2013, Glycobiology, 23:303, Inamori K, et al., 2013, Glycobiology, 23:295) are essentially the same. However, specific activity was only reported in the Inamori 2013 manuscript as the other experiments used undefined amounts of enzyme and rarely look at initial rates. The Inamori, et al. 2013 manuscript used a disaccharide for establishing rates due to the low activity observed for monosaccharide as a substrate consistent with our findings. As can be clearly observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref> of our manuscript, it is the initial transfer of GlcA to a monomer that appears to be slow and then extension appears to be robustly consistent with the observations of Inamori et al. 2013. Thus, we believe our results are fully consistent with what others have observed though direct comparison is not possible due to undefined reactions and/or different substrates being utilized for establishing kinetic parameters.</p><p><italic>2) It is intriguing that B4GAT1 has similar specificity for Xyl-α-MU and Xyl-β-MU. Could B4GAT1 be a branching enzyme as well as a priming enzyme? The fact that branching is not observed with tri-saccharide substrates under certain conditions in vitro does not rule out this possibility</italic>.</p><p>Given the fact that the B4GAT1 and the LARGE glycosytransferase add GlcA in different linkages to α-xylose, this is an intriguing possibility. To better address this issue, we produced and purified the disaccharides GlcA-β3-Xyl-α-pNP (product of LARGE) and GlcA-β4-Xyl-α-pNP (product of B4GAT1). We performed a radioactive GlcA transferase activity with each of these substrates using both enzymes, as well as positive controls for activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). In our hands, we were unable to see transfer of radioactivity that would have been indicative for the formation of GlcA-β3-(GlcA-β4)-Xyl-α-pNP. While we are unable to completely rule out this possibility, since it is possible we are not using the correct substrates, our results argue against a branching activity for B4GAT1 or LARGE GlcA activity.</p><p><italic>3) Does LARGE produce at least a small polymer from di- or trisaccharide substrate when both UDP-xylose and UDP-GlcA are present in the reaction? It would support priming if polymer is only obtained when B4GAT1 is in the mix</italic>.</p><p>The production of polymer with LARGE alone has been previously described by others using disaccharide substrates (Inamori K, et al., 2012, Science, 335:93, Goddeeris, MM et al., 2013, Nature, 503:136, and Ashikov, A, et al., 2013, Glycobiology, 23:303). To further address the issue of priming and polymer formation, we have included additional experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). This new data clearly demonstrates that LARGE alone is not able to form polymer using the Xyl-β-pNP as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, LARGE in the presence of both sugar nucleotides can produce polymer on Xyl-α- pNP though the initial rate, for the addition of the first GlcA, is quite slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Further, the addition of B4GAT1 eliminates this initial lag observed with Xyl- α-pNP as the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Using the Xyl-β-pNP, polymer is only observed when both enzymes are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed the presence of polymer formed when both enzymes are used by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). This data strongly supports the model of B4GAT1 being the priming enzyme for LARGE-dependent polymer formation. Further, when coupled with the similar phenotype observed in patients and animal models with mutations/knock-down of B4GAT1 or LARGE, this data suggests that the underlying xylose on the alpha-dystroglycan structure is most likely in a beta-linkage.</p><p><italic>4) The literature indicates that LARGE and B4GAT1 should form a complex. Is this the case for the purified enzymes? And, if so, does the complex increase the specific activity of LARGE/B4GAT1 for Xyl-α-MU? These data would provide important support for the priming activity of B4GAT1</italic>.</p><p>Tests carried out with our purified soluble enzymes did not reveal <italic>in vitro</italic> complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). This could potentially be attributed to the lack of transmembrane and stalk regions in our proteins. However, in a similar finding to ours, while Bao et al had previously demonstrated that B4GAT1 and LARGE when overexpressed as tagged proteins in cells together could co-immunopurify, they demonstrated that mixing of two cell extracts each overexpressing one of the proteins did not result in complex formation (Bao, X et al, 2009, PNAS, 106:12109). This suggests an unknown need for co-expression for complex formation or it reflects the inherent difficulty in determining specific protein-protein interactions via co-immunoprecipiation for membrane proteins.</p><p>While we were unable to see a complex, we were able to see an enhancement in initial rates for polymer formation when B4GAT1 was added with LARGE to Xyl- α-pNP and a complete inability to form polymer except when B4GAT1 was added with LARGE using Xyl-β-pNP as the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This strongly supports the proposed priming activity of B4GAT1.</p><p><italic>5) The study uses artificial substrates and in vitro assays. The model presented predicts that the alpha-dystroglycan from B4GAT1 deficient cells (KD, KO or patient derived) should display a single branched Xylose (or a terminal Xylose) in addition to the phospho-O-Mannose tri-saccharide.

Our new data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> that LARGE cannot generate polymer in the absence of B4GAT1 on Xyl-β-pNP is consistent with this argument as well.</p><p><italic>6) To explore why B4GAT1 is indispensable and prove it is a priming enzyme, it would be ideal to test whether the first Xylose on the alpha-dystroglycan is indeed branched in Beta as proposed by the authors.

Briefly, we have now demonstrated that LARGE cannot produce polymer in the absence of B4GAT1 on Xyl-β-pNP but can, albeit with a slow initial rate, on Xyl-α-pNP.</p><p><italic>7) Lee at al 2009 presents data for intracellular association of B4GAT1/B3GNT1 with B4GALT1. Perhaps the new findings suggest that a variety of Golgi glycosyltransferases are present in larger, oligomeric assemblies in cells? Please speculate</italic>. <italic>Also, could the authors speculate why the previous work came to the wrong conclusion?</italic></p><p>Given the often-times high Km’s of glycoslytransferases, the presence of oligomeric assemblies of enzymes in the secretory pathway would be a reasonable proposed mechanism for directed complex glycosylation. Of course, the oligosaccharyl transferase is a known multi-protein complex in the ER responsible for en bloc transfer of glycans from lipid linked oligosaccharides to Asn residues on proteins serving as a proof-of-concept for this model. Furthermore, a recent publication (Babu et al, 2012, Nature, 489:585) clearly established that there are multiple membrane protein-protein interactions occurring in eukaryotic cells. Lee et al 2009 established that B4GAT1 (now known to be involved in the LARGEdependent O-Mannosylation pathway [demonstrated here and in the companion article from the Campbell laboratory]) interacted with B4GALT1 (an enzyme involved in the generation of multiple types of glycans including, importantly in this context, the synthesis of polyLacNAc), and that they could influence each others location in the secretory pathway. We think it is overly strong to state that these authors arrived at a wrong conclusion as this manuscript’s major conclusion, in our view, was that these two enzymes interact. This appears to be a valid conclusion based on their studies that showed co-immunoprecipitation, co-localization, and the ability of one enzyme to regulate the localization of the other enzyme in the secretory pathway. At the time of these studies, one could postulate that these 2 enzymes associated together to more efficiently produce poly-LacNAc as the 2 activities needed are B3GNT and B4GALT activity. This of course needs to be re-evaluated in light of our findings. Being highly speculative, this complex could be involved in generating the phenomena seen in some cancer types where production of poly-LacNAc goes up and production of the LARGE-dependent glycosylation goes down. However, this remains to be evaluated.</p></body></sub-article></article>
