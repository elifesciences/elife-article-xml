An initial structure was solved using data collected at the Canadian Light Source. During the revision of the manuscript, we were able to obtain a higher resolution structure from beamline 24-ID-E (NE-CAT) at the Argonne National Library.</p><p>Below is the original text from the Materials and methods subsection “Crystallization of CARM1 in complex with 1 and 5a”:</p><p>“Graphics program COOTS4 was used for model building and visualization. Crystal diffraction data and refinement statistics for the structure are displayed in Table 2. To further confirm the electronic densities of the ligand, the total omission electron density map was calculated using SFCHECK from CCP4suite and contoured at 1.0 s (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004; Murshudov et al., 1997).</p><p>For the CARM1-<bold>5a</bold> complex, CARM1 was crystallized with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20°C by mixing 1 μL of protein solution with 1 μL of the reservoir solution containing 25% PEGG3350, 0.1M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M Hepes (pH = 7.5). The compound <bold>5a</bold> (0.2 μL of 10 μM in DMSO) was added to the drops with apo crystals and incubated overnight. X-ray diffraction data for the CARM1-5a complex were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku FR-E superbright X-ray generator. Data were processed using the HKL-3000 suite (Minor et al., 2006). The structure was isomorphous to PDB entry 4IKP, which was used as a starting model. REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 2011) was used for structure refinement. Geometric restraints for compound refinement were prepared with GRADE v.1.102 developed at Global Phasing Ltd. (Cambridge, UK). The COOT graphics program (Emsley et al., 2010) was used for model building and visualization, and MOLPROBITY (Williams et al., 2018) was used for structure validation. To further confirm the electronic densities of the ligand, the total omission electron density map was calculated using SFCHECK from the CCP4suite and contoured at 1.0 s (Figure 3b) (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004; Murshudov et al., 1997).”</p><p>And the corrected version with changed text underlined:</p><p>“Graphics program COOT was used for model building and visualization.
