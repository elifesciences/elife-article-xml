excision DNA repair. The TFIIH core complex is sufficient for its repair functions and harbors the XPB and XPD DNA-dependent ATPase/helicase subunits, which are affected by human disease mutations. Transcription initiation additionally requires the CdK activating kinase subcomplex. Previous structural work has provided only partial insight into the architecture of TFIIH and its interactions within transcription pre-initiation complexes. Here, we present the complete structure of the human TFIIH core complex, determined by phase-plate cryo-electron microscopy at 3.7 Å resolution. The structure uncovers the molecular basis of TFIIH assembly, revealing how the recruitment of XPB by p52 depends on a pseudo-symmetric dimer of homologous domains in these two proteins. The structure also suggests a function for p62 in the regulation of XPD, and allows the mapping of previously unresolved human disease mutations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44771.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA inside a cell carries the instructions it needs to survive. Living cells use many different proteins to read and maintain this store of information. For example, a group of ten proteins collectively called TFIIH is often involved in both reading and repairing the DNA. Proteins in the TFIIH complex include p52, p62, XPB and XPD.</p><p>Understanding the structure of the proteins in TFIIH could reveal much about how it works and how changes to its structure contribute to various medical conditions. Yet TFIIH is a dynamic assembly of molecules and includes many proteins, which makes examining its structure challenging. An ideal protein structure should provide an accurate map of the positions of all the atoms in a protein. Previously, it has not been possible to get this level of detail for TFIIH.</p><p>Greber et al. used an approach called cryo-electron microscopy (also called cryo-EM) to reveal the structure of TFIIH collected from human cells. The structure revealed several new details, including how p52 helps XPB attach to the rest of TFIIH, and that p62 helps to control the activity of XPD. With such a detailed structure, Greber et al. could link changes in TFIIH that are seen in different human diseases to specific parts of the complex.</p><p>Examining the atomic details of proteins can reveal a lot about how they work and the changes that occur during different diseases. These structures can also help to reveal aspects of how DNA is read and repaired, and may help to design new approaches to treat diseases in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Transcription</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>Macromolecular complex</kwd><kwd>Helicase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM63072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced PostDoc Mobility Fellowship P300PA_160983</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greber</surname><given-names>Basil J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM127018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01-GM063210</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced PostDoc Mobility Fellowship P300PA_174355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greber</surname><given-names>Basil J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of human transcription factor IIH, a critical DNA repair and transcription initiation factor, has been determined by cryo-electron microscopy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is a 10-subunit protein complex with a total molecular weight of 0.5 MDa that serves a dual role as a general transcription factor for transcription initiation by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and as a DNA helicase complex in nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Compe and Egly, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sainsbury et al., 2015</xref>). Mutations in TFIIH subunits that cause the inherited autosomal recessive disorders xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD), and Cockayne syndrome (CS) are characterized by high incidence of cancer or premature ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cleaver et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rapin, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, TFIIH is a possible target for anti-cancer compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berico and Coin, 2018</xref>) and therefore of great importance for human health and disease.</p><p>The TFIIH core complex is composed of the seven subunits XPB, XPD, p62, p52, p44, p34, and p8, and is the form of TFIIH active in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Svejstrup et al., 1995</xref>), where TFIIH serves as a DNA damage verification factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mathieu et al., 2013</xref>) and is responsible for opening a repair bubble around damaged nucleotides. This activity depends on both the SF2-family DNA-dependent ATPase XPB, and the DNA helicase activity of XPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Evans et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kuper et al., 2014</xref>). TFIIH function in transcription initiation requires the double-stranded DNA translocase activity of XPB to regulate opening of the transcription bubble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alekseev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fishburn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Grünberg et al., 2012</xref>), and additionally the CdK activating kinase (CAK) complex, which harbors the kinase activity of CDK7 as well as the Cyclin H and MAT1 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Devault et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fisher et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fisher and Morgan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Shiekhattar et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Svejstrup et al., 1995</xref>). Targets of human CDK7 include the C-terminal heptapeptide repeat domain of the largest subunit of Pol II, as well as cell-cycle regulating CDKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fisher and Morgan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Shiekhattar et al., 1995</xref>). MAT1 serves as a bridging subunit that promotes CAK subcomplex formation by interacting with Cyclin H and CDK7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Devault et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fisher et al., 1995</xref>), recruits the CAK to the core complex by interactions with XPD and XPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulrahman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busso et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Greber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rossignol et al., 1997</xref>), and also aids in Pol II-PIC formation by establishing interactions with the core PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schilbach et al., 2017</xref>). The presence of MAT1 inhibits the helicase activity of XPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulrahman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sandrock and Egly, 2001</xref>), but the mechanism of this inhibition is not fully understood. While the enzymatic activity of XPD is not required for transcription initiation, it is critical for the DNA repair function of TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dubaele et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Evans et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kuper et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, NER requires the release of the CAK subcomplex from the core complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coin et al., 2008</xref>). The activities of both XPB and XPD are regulated by interactions with additional TFIIH components, including that of p44 with XPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dubaele et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), and those of the p52-p8 module with XPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jawhari et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kainov et al., 2008</xref>). These interactions are likely to be crucial for TFIIH function, as some are affected by disease mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cleaver et al., 1999</xref>), but they have been only partially characterized mechanistically.</p><p>Our previous structure of the TFIIH core-MAT1 complex at 4.4 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Greber et al., 2017</xref>) allowed modeling of TFIIH in the best-resolved parts of the density map, but several functionally important regions remained unassigned or only partially interpreted because reliable de novo tracing of entire domains in the absence of existing structural models was not possible. Here, we present the complete structure of the human TFIIH core complex in association with the CAK subunit MAT1, determined by phase plate cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at 3.7 Å resolution. Our structure reveals the complete architecture of the TFIIH core complex and provides detailed insight into the interactions that govern its assembly. Additionally, our cryo-EM maps define the molecular contacts that control the regulation of the XPB and XPD subunits of TFIIH, including the critical p52-XBP interaction, and an extensive regulatory network around XPD, formed by XPB, p62, p44, and MAT1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure determination of TFIIH</title><p>To determine the complete structure of the human TFIIH core complex, we collected several large cryo-EM datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) of TFIIH immuno-purified from HeLa cells using an electron microscope equipped with a Volta phase plate (VPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Danev and Baumeister, 2017</xref>) and a direct electron detector camera mounted behind an energy filter. From a homogeneous subset of approximately 140,000 TFIIH particle images identified by 3D classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Scheres, 2010</xref>), we reconstructed a 3D cryo-EM density map at 3.7 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2A–C</xref>). This VPP-based cryo-EM map was substantially improved compared to our previous maps obtained without phase plate, both in resolution and interpretability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–G</xref>), and enabled building, refinement, and full validation of an atomic model of the TFIIH core complex and the MAT1 subunit of the CAK subcomplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>), while the remainder of the CAK subcomplex is invisible in our map because it is flexibly tethered to the TFIIH core complex. Tracing and sequence register assignment of protein components modeled de novo was facilitated by density maps obtained from focused classification and multibody refinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nakane et al., 2018</xref>), which resulted in density maps of improved interpretability for all three sub-volumes and a slightly improved resolution of 3.6 Å for the XPD-MAT1 region.

First, an α-helix formed by p62 residues 295–318 binds directly to XPD RecA2 and thereby recruits residues 160–258 of p62, comprising the BSD2 domain and adjacent sequence elements, to this surface of XPD RecA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Second, p62 residues 266–287 are inserted into the DNA-binding cavity of XPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>), in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schilbach et al., 2017</xref>). This inserted p62 segment directly blocks a DNA-binding site on XPD RecA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and localizes near the access path to a pore-like structure between the XPD FeS and ARCH domains. While p62 does not directly contact the DNA-binding surface on XPD RecA2, it may still sterically interfere with DNA binding or access to the helicase elements of XPD in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, this segment of p62 may need to move away when XPD binds and unwinds DNA. Third, p62 residues 350–358 form a short α-helix that binds in a cleft between the two RecA-like domains of XPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), so that it not only closes the entrance to the nucleotide binding pocket in XPD RecA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), but also partially overlaps with the predicted location of the nucleotide itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), strongly suggesting a role for this p62 sequence element in XPD regulation. The density for these structural elements of p62 (residues 260–300 and 346–365) in our cryo-EM map is weaker than for the remainder of the complex, suggesting a dynamic interaction with XPD that enables them to modulate the access to the nucleotide-binding pocket, the DNA-binding cavity, and the DNA-translocating pore of XPD, depending on the functional state of TFIIH. 3D reconstructions of TFIIH classified for these regions of p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) show globally intact TFIIH, both in the presence and absence of the p62 segments at these XPD sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–J</xref>), supporting our hypothesis of dynamic regulation, rather than the alternative hypothesis of p62 binding to XPD as a requirement for TFIIH stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Luo et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Molecular basis of XPB recruitment by p52</title><p>Our structure of TFIIH resolves the structure and interactions of all four folded domains of human XPB – two RecA-like domains that form the SF2-family type helicase cassette, a DNA damage recognition domain (DRD)-like domain, and an N-terminal domain (NTD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) – and reveals the molecular basis of XPB recruitment by p52.

Because our structure does not shown any elements of p52 approaching the XPB nucleotide-binding pocket, we propose that this effect is likely induced by the interactions of p52 with the XPB NTD and RecA2, which may, together with p8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coin et al., 2006</xref>), properly arrange the XPB helicase cassette to bind and hydrolyze ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Grünberg et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The XPB NTD is the site of the two human disease mutations F99S and T119P, which cause XP and TTD, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cleaver et al., 1999</xref>). Or structure shows that neither of these residues is in direct contact with p52 or the RecA-like domains of XPB, suggesting that the F99S and T119P mutations exert their detrimental effects through structural perturbation of the XPB NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2F–I</xref>). Specifically, T119 is located near a turn at the end of a β-strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G</xref>), where its side chain points towards the solvent. Nevertheless, this residue is highly conserved in eukaryotic XPB from ciliates to humans, in some archaeal and bacterial XPB homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and in the structurally homologous clutch domain in p52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F–H</xref>). This conservation suggests that a threonine at this position is important for the efficient folding of this domain in general, and that the T119P mutation may cause its destabilization, resulting in lower levels of active enzyme in TTD patients. Lower overall levels of properly assembled TFIIH have been shown to be a hallmark of TTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Botta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dubaele et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Giglia-Mari et al., 2004</xref>) and could explain the disease-causing effect of T119P in vivo even though recombinant TFIIH carrying this mutation retains some activity in both transcription initiation and NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coin et al., 2007</xref>).

Our 3.7 Å-resolution map of TFIIH reveals that in eukaryotic XPB, one β-strand of the DRD of archaeal XPB is replaced by an insertion of approximately 70 residues that exhibits relatively low sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and shifts the domain boundaries of the human XPB DRD-like domain with respect to previous sequence alignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oksenych et al., 2009</xref>). The part of this insertion resolved in our map consists of a negatively charged linker and an α-helical element that contacts XPD directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).

We described above two interactions that could potentially regulate XPD activity: the newly defined interaction of an insertion element in the XPB DRD with a DNA-binding site in XPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>); and XPD-p62 interactions involving the XPD nucleotide binding pocked and DNA binding cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>) that implicate p62, as well as XPB, in XPD regulation. Additionally, it is known that the helicase activity of XPD is inhibited by the CAK subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Araújo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sandrock and Egly, 2001</xref>). The contacts we see between MAT1 and XPD localize to the ARCH domain of XPD and the N-terminal RING domain and helical bundle of MAT1 (residues 1–130) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), in agreement with previous structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Greber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schilbach et al., 2017</xref>) and biochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulrahman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Luo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Warfield et al., 2016</xref>). The interaction between the XPD ARCH domain and the MAT1 helical bundle is characterized by charge complementarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J–M</xref>). This interface is highly dynamic, enabling the release of MAT1 and the entire CAK subcomplex from TFIIH during NER, as well as its subsequent re-association to regenerate a transcription-competent TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Insertion of substrate DNA into the pore between the XPD ARCH and FeS domains requires the flexibility of the XPD ARCH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Constantinescu-Aruxandei et al., 2016</xref>), and large domain motions have been observed in the structure of the DNA-bound homologous helicase DinG upon nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng and Wigley, 2018</xref>). This suggests a role for the mobility of the ARCH domain in both DNA loading and DNA translocation by the XPD helicase. Our structure suggests that binding of the MAT1 helical bundle and RING domain to the ARCH domain may prevent such motion and therefore the subsequent substrate loading and XPD helicase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), in agreement with biochemical data that show XPD inhibition upon MAT1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sandrock and Egly, 2001</xref>), as well as reduced single-stranded DNA affinity of TFIIH in the presence of the CAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, release of MAT1 from XPD might allow the ARCH domain to move more freely, thereby de-repressing XPD. Furthermore, displacement of the MAT1 α-helix that connects XPD to XPB may allow XPB to move away from XPD, thereby unmasking the substrate-binding site on XPD RecA2 that is otherwise occluded by the DRD insertion element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This latter conformational change would be similar, overall, to that seen for TFIIH upon incorporation into the Pol II-PIC, where XPD and XPB move apart and density for the MAT1 helix is missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schilbach et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that the combined unmasking of the XPD substrate binding site and the enhanced flexibility of the XPD ARCH domain may both contribute to de-repression of the XPD helicase upon release of MAT1. This mechanism of XPD inhibition by MAT1 does not exclude the possibility of additional repression of NER activity by the CAK subcomplex through phosphorylation of NER pathway components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Araújo et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Our structure also resolves in detail the XPD-p44 interaction, a known regulatory interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dubaele et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kuper et al., 2014</xref>) affected by numerous disease mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cleaver et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Greber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kuper et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The relatively small interaction surface between p44 and XPD, of just 940 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), contrasts with the much larger buried surface of 3300 Å<sup>2</sup> between XPD and p62, or 1580 Å<sup>2</sup> for the p52-XPB interaction. This smaller interaction surface may result in higher sensitivity to mutations that localize at the XPD-p44 interface. Our structure, thus, rationalizes the deleterious effect of a number of natural and synthetic mutations in this interface (see Appendix 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>), including mutations L174W and T175R in the β4-α5 loop of p44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Seroz et al., 2000</xref>), which may lead to steric clashes in the densely packed interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and the XPD R722W mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kuper et al., 2014</xref>), which disrupts the salt bridge with D75 in p44 and may additionally cause steric clashes with neighboring p44 residues due to the bulky tryptophan side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Our structure also shows that, in contrast to a previously proposed model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Luo et al., 2015</xref>), the XPD R616P, D673G, and G675R disease mutations act either via disruption of the XPD structure or the XPD-p44 interface, but not via disruption of the interaction with p62 (see Appendix 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Notably, the p44-dependet stimulation of XPD activity does not depend on the presence of p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dubaele et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kuper et al., 2014</xref>).

Depending on whether XPB binds to the damaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) or undamaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) strand, the combined action of XPD and XPB could lead to the extrusion of a DNA bubble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) or to the tracking of the entire complex towards the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), which is initially located 3’ of the TFIIH binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sugasawa et al., 2009</xref>). The latter hypothesis is attractive in the context of biochemical data that show that XPD tracks along the damaged strand in the 5’ to 3’ direction until it encounters the DNA lesion in order to verify the presence of a bona fide NER substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buechner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mathieu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Naegeli et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sugasawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wirth et al., 2016</xref>).

This proposal is compatible with a model in which TFIIH sitting on the open repair bubble might track towards the lesion, where it would stop due to inhibition of XPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mathieu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Naegeli et al., 1993</xref>), at which point double incision could be initiated. However, this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) would require strong DNA bending before both XPB and XPD could be loaded. Additionally, it has not been fully resolved whether XPB participates in DNA translocation or unwinding during TFIIH activity in NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2015</xref>), which would be required in the tracking model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2015</xref>), or whether it exclusively acts to anchor the complex in the vicinity of the DNA lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oksenych et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Independently of the orientation of the repair bubble, our structural data are compatible with literature data introduced above and a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) that localizes XPG near XPD and p62 (site of 3’-incision), XPF-ERCC1 near XPB (site of 5’-incision), and with RPA binding the non-damaged strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fagbemi et al., 2011</xref>).

Therefore, we conclude that our final reconstruction is representative of the overall particle population in the dataset.</p><p>To facilitate the interpretation of less ordered or only partially occupied parts of the structure, including the p62 BSD2 domain, the MAT1 RING domain, the MAT1 three-helix bundle at the XPD arch domain, and the N-terminus of XPD, we used signal subtracted classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>) (p62 BSD2 domain, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), focused classification (MAT1 RING domain, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), and multibody refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nakane et al., 2018</xref>) (MAT1 three-helix bundle and XPD N-terminus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). For these classification procedures, we used only the VPP data because 3D classification separated VPP and conventional cryo-EM data into distinct classes, rendering combined classification ineffective. Multibody refinement led to only a slight improvement in resolution for the XPD-MAT1 body (to 3.6 Å) relative to the overall refined best map, and only during the first two iterations, likely due to the relatively small size of the individual bodies and the resulting limited signal for alignment. However, the above-mentioned structural elements showed improved density features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>) and could be more reliably interpreted in the multibody-refined XPD-MAT1 map (green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>; also used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>). Overall, the use of VPP data in this work resulted in substantial improvements both in nominal resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>) and map quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>) compared to our previous 4.4 Å-resolution structure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p>The previous structure of the human TFIIH core complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Greber et al., 2017</xref>) and of yeast TFIIH in the Pol II-PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schilbach et al., 2017</xref>) were docked into the cryo-EM map and used as the basis for atomic modeling in O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jones et al., 1991</xref>) and COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>).

Placement of the regions near XPD, where density is weak overall, was guided by matching the succession of secondary structure elements along the p62 sequence with helical densities in the cryo-EM map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and corroborated by CX-MS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Luo et al., 2015</xref>), which showed excellent agreement of p62-XPD crosslinking data with the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6G</xref>). Crosslinks between p62 and p44 showed a relatively large proportion of outliers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), which may be due to the fact that the sequence register of the p62 segments to which these crosslinks map is not well constrained. These segments were modeled as poly-alanines and deposited without sequence assignment (UNK; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Maps low-pass filtered to 6 Å and sharpened by a B-factor of only −100 Å<sup>2</sup> were used to guide docking of domains and assess the continuity of the density in poorly ordered regions of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p><p>The resulting coordinate model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) was refined against the final overall reconstruction at 3.7 Å resolution using the real space refinement program in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>) and validated using the MTRIAGE program in PHENIX and the MOLPROBITY web server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Ramachandran, C<sub>β</sub>, rotamer, and secondary structure restraints were used throughout the refinement to ensure good model geometry at the given resolution. Data used in the refinement excluded spatial frequencies beyond the nominal 3.7 Å resolution of the cryo-EM map to prevent over-fitting. Additionally, by specifically monitoring the bond length and bond angle r.m.s.d. values, the real space refinement program in PHENIX automatically estimates the relative weighing of the restraint and map data to maintain good model geometry and to prevent over-refinement of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>). Because the automatically determined weight fluctuated between approximately 3 and 6 during a typical refinement run, we used the average value of 4.5 for the final refinement (five macro cycles of global optimization and B-factor refinement). The N-terminal RING domain of MAT1 and the BSD1 domain of p62, for which only poorly resolved density is present in the final cryo-EM map, were additionally restrained by reference restraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Headd et al., 2012</xref>) using the NMR structures of the corresponding domains (PDB ID 1G25 and 2DII, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gervais et al., 2001</xref>). The side chains of these two domains (with the exception of residues involved in zinc finger formation and of prolines) were truncated at the Cβ position to reflect the lower resolution of the corresponding densities. The FSC curve between the refined coordinate model and the cryo-EM map extends to 3.9 Å and the distribution of B-factors in the refined coordinate model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) mirror the local resolution of the cryo-EM map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), as expected.

After completion of multi-body refinement, we used RELION three to run a principal component analysis to identify the principal modes of motion of the bodies relative to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nakane et al., 2018</xref>). The volume series for the first 12 principal components were reconstructed and difference densities (green and purple in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) were computed between the most extreme states in each series and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. Subsequently, roughly 20,000 particles corresponding to both ends of the distribution were used for selected principal components and subjected to 3D refinement, resulting in maps of approx. 10 Å resolution. It is important to note that the particles used for these refinements, and the subsequent analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, were un-subtracted original particle images containing the entire TFIIH. These refinements are therefore not directly affected by any limitations on alignment accuracy that would arise from alignment of smaller sub-volumes of TFIIH. We also repeated this analysis for two different data subsets (the final 138,659 particle-subset that gave rise to the 3.7 Å-resolution reconstruction and the complete set of 786,755 VPP particles resulting from the initial 3D classification) using only three bodies for multibody refinement (providing more signal for alignment per body) and obtained consistent results overall, with the exception that the ranking of the principal components changed in some instances.</p><p>The refined atomic model of the TFIIH core complex, subdivided into suitable rigid bodies, was then rigid-body refined into these volumes using PHENIX real space refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>) and coordinate displacement between the two resulting models for each principal component was plotted to obtain an initial assessment of the modes of motion present in the TFIIH dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

TFIIH function in NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kuper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Winkler et al., 2000</xref>), and it serves as an architectural element in

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>). The XPD-p44 interaction is critical both for the enzymatic and architectural roles of XPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dubaele et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kuper et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, disruption of the XPD-p44 interface can simultaneously cause NER defects and impair transcription initiation, which leads to a TTD phenotype in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dubaele et al., 2003</xref>). Our structure provides a detailed view of this interaction interface, which encompasses the p44 loops β1-α1, β4-α5, β5-α6, and β6-α7 connecting β-strands and α-helices in the p44 VWA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Mutations L174W, T175R, and D178A in the p44 β4-α5 loop have been shown to abrogate the p44-XPD interaction and to reduce the helicase activity of XPD, implicating this region in XPD activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Seroz et al., 2000</xref>). Our structure suggests that the insertion of large residues (L174W, T175R) into the tightly packed p44-XPD interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>) is likely to lead to steric clashes, while the D178A mutation would break a likely salt bridge with XPD R592 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Strikingly, the R592P mutation in XPD, the side chain of which packs against the p44 β4-α5 loop in wild type XPD, causes TTD in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cleaver et al., 1999</xref>), underscoring the importance of this interaction.</p><p>In XPD, RecA2 loop residues 531–533, 563–565, 589–592, 612–616, and the helical segment 718–725 form the p44 interaction interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Using recombinant human and <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic> proteins, it has been shown that the XPD R722W mutation impairs the interaction between p44 and XPD, thereby interfering with both the p44-dependent stimulation of the XPD ATPase and helicase activities in NER, and architectural role of p44 in transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kuper et al., 2014</xref>). Our structure shows that the R722W mutation disrupts a salt bridge to p44 D75, and the bulky tryptophan side chain may additionally cause steric clashes with neighboring p44 residues, explaining the deleterious effect of the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). It has been proposed that the R616P, D673G, and G675R disease mutations, which impair the p44-XPD interaction and the XPD helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dubaele et al., 2003</xref>), exert their deleterious effect by impairing the interaction between XPD and p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Luo et al., 2015</xref>). However, our structure shows that G675 is buried in the core of XPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>), where accommodation of the large arginine side chain in G675R will disrupt the structure of the protein. XPD D673 is located in a β-strand in the vicinity of the XPD-p62 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>); however, no direct interactions of this residue with p62 are observed. XPD R616 is located at the p44-XPD interface, where its side chain is packed against neighboring residues (e.g. Y674, located between the D673 and G675, the sites of the D673G and G675R mutations). R616 or Y674 may engage in interactions with p44 E204 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These interactions would be disrupted in the R616P mutant. Altogether, these observations suggest that these mutations act either via disruption of the XPD structure or the XPD-p44 interface, not via p62. Nevertheless, a contribution of p62 to the stabilization of the p44-XPD interface cannot be excluded because several p62 elements are observed near the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). As discussed in the main text, some of these interactions are dynamic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G–J</xref>) and unlikely to be strictly required for the stability of the p44-XPD interface.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><boxed-text><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44771.034</object-id><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Mapping of XPD mutations</title><p>In addition to our analysis of the XPD-p44 interface and the mutations located in its vicinity, we were also able to map numerous other human disease mutations onto our structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our results are in good agreement with the hypotheses derived from comparative modeling based on homologous bacterial DNA repair enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bienstock et al., 2003</xref>), archaeal XPD homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wolski et al., 2008</xref>), and our previous lower-resolution TFIIH structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Greber et al., 2017</xref>). Several XP mutations map in the regions that interact with bound DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as confirmed by superposing homologous DNA-bound helicase structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng and Wigley, 2018</xref>), or in the conserved motifs near the ATPase active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These mutations impair XPD helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dubaele et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), causing the NER defects that manifest in the XP disease symptoms. As explained above, TTD mutations tend to map to the periphery of XPD, including the XPD-p44 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), the ARCH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), or the FeS domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The C259Y mutation in the ARCH domain likely impairs the proper folding of this domain due to steric hindrance introduced by the large tyrosine side chain, which in turn impairs association of the CAK subcomplex through disruption of MAT1 association, as discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Greber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wolski et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with its observed location in our structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), the R112H mutation in the FeS domain leads to destabilization of the 4FeS cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rudolf et al., 2006</xref>), which in turn leads to the disruption of folding of this entire domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fan et al., 2008</xref>) and lower TFIIH levels overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Botta et al., 2002</xref>). Another TTD mutation that does not localize to the periphery of XPD is the particularly interesting temperature-sensitive mutation R658C, for which patients show exacerbated symptoms, including complete hair loss, when they develop a fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Vermeulen et al., 2001</xref>). This residue is located at the interface between the XPD RecA1 and RecA2 domains, where it forms a salt bridge across the domain interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This interface would be partially destabilized by the mutation at normal temperature and more severely disrupted at elevated temperature, leading to stronger disease symptoms.</p><p>We also mapped onto our structure the location of the so-called <italic>rem</italic> mutations in Rad3, the yeast homolog of XPD. These mutations increase the affinity of Rad3 for DNA, which leads to retention of Rad3/XPD on DNA lesions, incomplete NER reactions, and subsequent DNA breakage upon arrival of a DNA replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Herrera-Moyano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Moriel-Carretero and Aguilera, 2010</xref>). We mapped the <italic>rem</italic> mutations Rad3-E236G (XPD E235), Rad3-A237T (XPD A236), and Rad3-H661Y (XPD H659), as well as the human XP-CS mutation XPD-G675R, which also exhibits elevated DNA affinity but reduced helicase activity in an archaeal model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fan et al., 2008</xref>) and DNA breakage in patient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Theron et al., 2005</xref>), onto our structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). XPD E235 and A236 are part of the conserved helicase motif II (signature sequence DEAH, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>), and as such critical for nucleotide hydrolysis. Notably, the neighboring XPD D234, also part of motif II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,F</xref>), is a human XP mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cleaver et al., 1999</xref>). XPD H659 is located nearby, and contacts R601, which locates to the immediate vicinity of the DNA based on superposition with structures of DNA-bound helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Büttner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng and Wigley, 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and is affected by an XP mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cleaver et al., 1999</xref>). In agreement with previous proposals, the <italic>rem</italic> mutations are therefore localized near regions responsible for ATP hydrolysis and DNA binding, consistent with the idea that they lead to stalling of NER complexes at DNA lesions, which may ultimately lead to incomplete NER, DNA breaks, failure to re-start transcription, and the XP-CS phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Moriel-Carretero et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our structure pinpoints the locations of XPD mutations that provide insight into human disease mechanisms, and in most cases resolves the density for the side chains of the affected residues, thereby providing a structural framework for the detailed analysis of the interactions of the affected residues and the effects of these mutations.</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44771.051</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Grigorieff</surname><given-names>Nikolaus</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Grigorieff</surname><given-names>Nikolaus</given-names> </name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Darst</surname><given-names>Seth A</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>The Rockefeller University</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

We will address the detailed comments in point-by-point answers below. Other than the changes required for addressing these questions and comments, we have made the following changes and improvements to the manuscript:</p><p>i) We previously deposited the main cryo-EM map and coordinate model at the EMDB and PDB. We have now deposited six additional cryo-EM maps to the EMDB: The maps classified for the p62 BSD2 domain (EMD-0588, EMD-0589), the density classified for the <italic>MAT1</italic> RING domain (EMD-0587), and the multibody-refined best-quality maps (EMD-0602, EMD-0603, EMD-0604). The accession codes are provided in the appropriate location in the manuscript (section “Data availability” at the end of the manuscript).</p><p>ii) Supplementary files 2 and 3 were updated with the accession codes of the map and model deposited at the EMDB and PDB as well as with the final refinement statistics of the model (Supplementary file 3) and the list of residues deposited as UNK (Supplementary file 2). The statistics are slightly improved overall, e.g. the Ramachandran outliers are down to 0.2% from 0.3% and the bond angle RMSD is down to 1.08° from 1.19°.</p><p>iii) Figure 1—figure supplement 2: Panel B was updated with a model vs. map FSC curve computed against a cryo-EM map filtered at 3.5 Å resolution. The lack of a hard cut-off at 3.7 Å resolution results in a more natural decay of the model vs. map curve at high resolutions (because the coordinates correlate with the map beyond the nominal map resolution in the core of the structure), while the resolution estimates are unchanged (both of these observations are as expected). Panel C was updated with the B-factors of the final coordinate model deposited at the PDB.</p><p>iv) Figure 1—figure supplement 5: While the manuscript was under review, it was brought to our attention that post-processing unfiltered half maps from intermediate steps of multibody refinement runs can lead to artifacts in the FSC curves at very high resolution (close to Nyquist frequency) and is discouraged. Even though to the best of our knowledge, these issues did not affect our reconstructions in any way, we opted to completely avoid any risk of artifacts. We therefore replaced the initially used multibody-refined maps with maps resulting from a regular final refinement cycle in RELION 3 (using data out to Nyquist frequency), which led to the same improvements in map interpretability observed before, but slightly different resolution estimates (3.6-3.8 Å depending on the sub-volume; see also the point-to-point answer on that topic below). These have been updated in the figure (along with the FSC curves).</p><p>v) Figure 4C and D now use more accurate representations of the “open” conformation of TFIIH, based on fitting of component domains of our human TFIIH structure into the cryo-EM maps of the human and yeast Pol II-PIC. The legend has been adjusted accordingly; the information content of the figures is otherwise unchanged and no changes to the text were needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) What is meant by &quot;extreme&quot; motion?</p></disp-quote><p>We reworded this:</p><p>“… because it is flexibly tethered to the TFIIH core complex”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Structure determination of TFIIH”: Please provide the full range of resolutions, not just the best value.</p></disp-quote><p>While the manuscript was under review, we modified the way the multi-body refinement was conducted (see general comments above). The XPD-<italic>MAT1</italic> body is now resolved at 3.6 Å resolution, while the remaining two bodies did not see an improvement in resolution (even though the map quality increased in certain regions in all bodies). This has been clarified in the manuscript:</p><p>“…, which resulted in density maps of improved interpretability for all three sub-volumes and a slightly improved resolution of 3.6 Å for the XPD-MAT1 region.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What is meant by &quot;initial 3D classification&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to the initial 3D classification to remove broken particles and false-positive particle picks, as introduced in the preceding sentence. We have clarified this by specifying the angular sampling used, and mentioning that this classification was a coarse angular sampling, low-resolution classification:</p><p>“To remove false positive particle picks and broken particles, an initial 3D classification at low resolution (7.5° angular sampling) was performed on each dataset individually (datasets 3, 4, 5) […]). In summary, a total of &gt; 2,000,000 initial particle picks were subjected to this initial low-resolution 3D classification, identifying approx. 820,000 intact particles that were subjected to further processing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Data collection: Please include a figure showing a typical micrograph and a set of 2D class averages.</p></disp-quote><p>These panels have been added to Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Data analysis: The authors mention a problem of preferred orientation. Please show a figure plotting orientations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a representation of the orientation distribution to Figure 1—figure supplement 1D. The orientations populate mostly a zone that corresponds to particles adhering to the carbon support with the long axis of the complex parallel to the support layer, and a range of orientations arising from rotation of the particles around that long axis. Dataset 6 showed stronger orientation bias compared to the other datasets. Therefore, we pooled these particles with a different dataset for initial 3D classification to avoid bias in classification at this step. Subsequently, the resulting particles from dataset 6 were joined with the remaining datasets.</p><p>The legend to the new figure panel reads:</p><p>“(D) Depiction of the orientation distribution of the particle images in the final reconstruction.

Please indicate what the lines mean between subunits; presumably crosslinks?</p></disp-quote><p>The lines do not indicate crosslinks, but actual protein-protein interactions derived from the structure, mapped at the domain level. Elucidating which domains of which TFIIH subunits interact with each other has been the goal of a number of previous publications in the field, and this figure panel provides the answer to this question. We have emphasized this point in the figure legend:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Domain-level protein-protein interaction network between the components of the TFIIH core complex and MAT1 derived from the interactions observed in our structure.&quot;</p><p>9) Close-ups: In a number of figures, close-ups are shown next to overviews of a subunit or the complex (for example, Figure 5A and B, Figure 6A and B, but also elsewhere).

The authors should discuss this and, if appropriate, reevaluate these results.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers bring up an important point. However, we believe that our approach should eliminate the risk of generating this type of artifact. It is important to note that after multi-body refinement (alignment of sub-volumes) and principal component analysis, we selected the complete, non-subtracted particle images (showing entire TFIIH complexes) corresponding to the tails of the distribution (i.e. largest conformational difference) and re-refined these small datasets. Coordinates were then rigid body refined into these volumes, and the positional differences of these fitted coordinates is what is plotted in Figure 4A. Therefore, importantly, the analysis and conclusions shown in Figure 4 do not directly rely on the alignment of the sub-volumes. The alignment of sub-volumes only gave the principal components according to which the particle images for re-refinement were selected. If this selection had been based merely on alignment errors of the sub-volumes without any actual conformational differences occurring in the actual particle images, we would not expect to find these same conformational differences in the volumes obtained from refinement of complete particle images. We clarified and elaborated on this point in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>&quot;It is important to note that the particles used for these refinements, and the subsequent analysis shown in Figure 4A, were un-subtracted original particle images containing the entire TFIIH. […] We also repeated this analysis for two different data subsets (the final 138,659 particle-subset that gave rise to the 3.7 Å-resolution reconstruction and the complete set of 786,755 VPP particles resulting from the initial 3D classification) using only 3 bodies for multibody refinement (providing more signal for alignment per body) and obtained consistent results overall, with the exception that the ranking of the principal components changed in some instances.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Atomic model refinement: Which map was the model refined against? Was it one of the half maps or the full map? The authors should discuss how they limited over-refinement.</p></disp-quote><p>The model was refined against the full map to utilize the full signal available in the cryo-EM dataset. We estimate that we would lose approximately 0.3-0.5 Å resolution if we were to use only a half-map for refinement.</p><p>The real space refinement algorithm in PHENIX automatically estimates the relative weighing of geometry restraints and density (Adams et al., 2010; Afonine et al., 2018; as cited in the manuscript) based on the bond length and bond angle RMSD values to prevent overfitting. Because these automated target weights fluctuated between refinement cycles, sometimes giving rise to arbitrarily higher or lower weights in the last iteration (which determines the final fit to map and geometry quality), we used a weight of 4.5 for the final 5 macro-cycles of refinement, corresponding to the average of weights estimated by PHENIX during a trial run on the same data. These settings resulted in bond length and bond angle RMSD values in the expected range (1.08° for bond angles, 0.01 Å for bond lengths). We have added this information in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript:</p><p>&quot;Additionally, by specifically monitoring the bond length and bond angle r.m.s.d values, the real space refinement program in PHENIX automatically estimates the relative weighing of the restraint and map data to maintain good model geometry and to prevent over-refinement of the structure (Adams et al., 2010; Afonine et al., 2018). Because the automatically determined weight fluctuated between approximately 3 and 6 during a typical refinement run, we used the average value of 4.5 for the final refinement (5 macro cycles of global optimization and B-factor refinement).&quot;</p><p>As detailed in the manuscript, we additionally used reference restraints, where available, to avoid overfitting of coordinates in poorly resolved regions of the cryo-EM map.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) About 50% of the videos were discarded. This number seems high. The authors indicate that some images did not show CTF fringes to high resolution, and that their data selection was quite stringent. However, a 3.6-Å reconstruction does not impose much of a limit on the data quality. What was the reason for so many bad images, and what were the quantitative criteria for inclusion/rejection?</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed in Supplementary file 1, the high rejection rate affected mostly the non-VPP data, which was affected by higher variability than the VPP data. Most of the non-VPP data was collected on a low-base FEI Titan (non-KRIOS) microscope with a side-entry holder, where stage drift is a concern, and consequently, more images were rejected due to poor resolution of the CTF fitting (worse than 4.5 Å). Unexpectedly, the data from the Janelia Research Campus Titan KRIOS was affected by similar problems, with large numbers of micrographs exhibiting CTF fit resolutions of only 5 Å. Inclusion of these lower-quality micrographs and combining them with the VPP data degraded the resolution of the reconstructions at an early stage, so stringent selection criteria were applied to the non-VPP data and inclusion of the resulting data improved the reconstruction until the VPP data alone exceeded 3.9 Å resolution, at which point even the best non-VPP data no longer improved the resolution and was consequently removed from the calculations (as described in the manuscript).</p><p>We have added a short note to the legend of Supplementary file 1:</p><p>&quot;The high rejection rate for the data collected without VPP was due to poorer CTF resolution estimates compared to the VPP data, likely because of the use of a low-base Titan with a less stable side entry holder for most of these data.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Of the 2 million particles picked initially, only 7% ended up in the final reconstruction. How do the authors know that these are the &quot;correct&quot; 7%? Could they have missed a major conformation that would have told a very different story?</p></disp-quote><p>We are confident that we did not miss a major conformation of TFIIH that would have led to a vastly different interpretation. The 2 million initial particle picks included false positives (e.g. non-particles showing only carbon, or ice contamination) as well as presumably damaged complexes that never resulted in a reconstruction with discernable features. Notably, almost 40% of the initial particles (approx. 800,000 particle images) were retained after the first round of 3D classification and their refinement resulted in a reconstruction that is highly similar to the final reconstruction, albeit at lower resolution (approx. 4.3 Å) and considerably worse map quality because of TFIIH flexibility (mostly motion of XPB that results in opening and closing of the TFIIH “horseshoe”). We have clarified this in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“We note that even though the final reconstruction comprises only a relatively small fraction of the total particle picks, the first 3D refinement from 786,755 VPP particle images (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) resulted in a 4.3 Å-resolution map that is in excellent agreement with the final map, except for lower resolution and worse map quality caused by residual heterogeneity that was addressed in the subsequent 3D classification step to yield the final set of 138,659 particle images. Therefore, we conclude that our final reconstruction is representative of the overall particle population in the dataset.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
