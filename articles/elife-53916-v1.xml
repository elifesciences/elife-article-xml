Over developmental time spans, regulatory networks of transcription factors drive the acquisition of unique cell fates by integrating patterning information and determining the set of genes regulated in response to developmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Levine and Davidson, 2005</xref>). The critical nodes of these regulatory networks are cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) where transcription factors bind in order to activate or repress target gene activity. However, additional epigenetic determinants such as the organization of chromatin structure likely influence how genomic information is accessed by regulatory networks. For instance, because nucleosome positioning can hinder transcription factor-DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kornberg and Lorch, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Polach and Widom, 1995</xref>) chromatin effectively serves as a filter either to highlight or obscure regulatory information encoded in DNA. But embryonic chromatin states themselves are dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Weintraub et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">McKay and Lieb, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Xy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cusanovich et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cusanovich et al., 2018b</xref>). The mechanisms that drive developmental progression can also trigger remodeling of chromatin accessibility patterns on both large and small scales, thereby changing over time what genetic information is available to gene regulatory systems. While in several cases we have near comprehensive understanding of both the genetic components of certain developmental networks and the critical CRMs whereby these components interact, much less is known about how chromatin accessibility states constrain network function and how mechanisms for controlling chromatin accessibility are woven into the developmental program.</p><p>In the case of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, decades of investigation into the mechanisms of development have exhaustively identified the critical patterning cues and transcription factors that drive early cell fate specification and differentiation of select developmental lineages. Patterning is initiated by four distinct maternal pathways that alone are sufficient to initiate zygotic regulatory networks that specify all the primary cell identities that arise along the major embryonic axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schüpbach and Wieschaus, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casanova and Struhl, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jiménez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lehmann and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Petkova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hülskamp et al., 1989</xref>). At the outset of patterning, nuclei have what can be considered a ‘ground state’ of chromatin structure that contains the initial set of accessible CRMs and promoters that will define the first regulatory network interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>). The ground state effectively provides a baseline for determining the influence of epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation on developmental processes. The early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo therefore represents an ideal starting point to observe both how regulatory networks are constrained by chromatin states, and how these states change as a function of progression through the developmental program.</p><p>Before embryos can respond zygotically to maternal patterning cues, they must first undergo a series of 13 rapid, synchronous mitotic divisions that serve to amplify the single nucleus formed after fertilization into a set of ~6000 largely uncommitted, pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Farrell and O'Farrell, 2014</xref>). These mitotic divisions occur in a state of general transcriptional quiescence that effectively prevents nuclei from responding prematurely to regulatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Lengyel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zalokar, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Edgar et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edgar and Schubiger, 1986</xref>). The shift from the initial proliferative phase to later periods of differentiation comes at a major developmental milestone termed the midblastula transition (MBT) during which the zygotic genome gradually activates, and cells become competent to respond to maternal patterning information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Harrison and Eisen, 2015</xref>). A major component of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is the establishment of the chromatin ground state by a subset of transcription factors known as pioneer factors that gain access to closed or nucleosome-associated DNA and direct the establishment of short tracts of open and accessible chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McDaniel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>). Because maternal pioneer factors such as Zelda are expressed uniformly in all cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Liang et al., 2008</xref>), it is inferred that the initial ground state is common to all cells of the embryo at ZGA. However, maternal patterning systems can also directly influence chromatin accessibility states at ZGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>), and because their activities are by definition spatially restricted, this gives rise to heterogeneous embryonic chromatin states. Indeed, ATAC-seq measurements of chromatin accessibility in subdivided post-ZGA embryos, sampled either as posterior and anterior halves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haines and Eisen, 2018</xref>), sorted cells purified from restricted positions along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bozek et al., 2019</xref>), or as single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cusanovich et al., 2018a</xref>) identify spatial heterogeneities in accessibility patterns that begin to emerge shortly after embryos undergo ZGA and initiate patterning. These observations raise the question of what mechanisms drive the reshaping of the chromatin landscape following ZGA.</p><p>In this study, we have investigated how chromatin accessibility states change following ZGA and to what extent these changes are dependent on the mechanisms of embryonic patterning. We find that the ZGA chromatin state must continue to change in order to support the establishment of accessible CRMs within the regulatory network that confers embryonic segmental identities. By measuring changes in chromatin accessibility over the 1-hr period between ZGA and gastrulation comparing wild-type and mutant embryos in which all graded maternal inputs to patterning are either eliminated or flattened, we define sites that display dynamic regulation of accessibility downstream of either localized pattern-dependent or global patterning-independent cues. We find that although maternal patterning systems are limited in their ability to influence directly chromatin accessibility states, distinct downstream components of zygotic gene regulatory networks make major contributions to patterning-dependent alterations of the chromatin accessibility landscape. We focus on the characterization of one such factor, Odd-paired (Opa), which we demonstrate is both necessary and sufficient to pioneer open chromatin states for a set of CRMs critical for the function of the embryonic segmentation network. These results highlight that individual components of gene regulatory networks may operate not simply to activate or repress target gene expression, but to dictate how and when network components interact by controlling dynamic CRM accessibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The ZGA chromatin state is insufficient to support embryonic segmentation</title><p>To estimate the sufficiency of the ZGA chromatin state to support early embryonic development, we scored all known enhancers in the anterior-posterior (AP) segmentation network for chromatin accessibility. During ZGA, the first zygotic components of the segmentation network are transcribed in response to maternal patterning cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pritchard and Schubiger, 1996</xref>). Over the course of nuclear cycle 14 (NC14) complex patterned gene expression from the gap, pair-rule, and segment polarity networks sequentially drive the conversion of graded maternal information into the unique segmental identities of cells across the AP axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Petkova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hülskamp and Tautz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Schroeder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jaeger, 2011</xref>). By entry into gastrulation, approximately 65 min into NC14 at 23°C, the initial activation of all three networks is complete. Because many of the CRMs required to generate the complex expression patterns of genes within the segmentation network are known, we used this system as a model to ask whether the ZGA chromatin state contains all the accessible cis-regulatory information required to complete this well-characterized developmental patterning task.</p><p>To evaluate chromatin accessibility states between ZGA and gastrulation, we collected single embryos aged either 12 or 72 min into NC14 and performed ATAC-seq. Mapped reads were assigned to peaks, which were subsequently cross-referenced against the Redfly database of previously characterized CRMs within the segmentation network (n = 111 CRMs, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1; </xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rivera et al., 2019</xref>). These were then scored for accessibility either shortly after ZGA (NC14+12’) or 1 hr later at the onset of gastrulation (NC14+72’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chromatin accessibility at segmentation network enhancers is dynamic over the 1-hr period between ZGA and gastrulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap showing the scaled chromatin accessibility between ZGA (top row, NC14 + 12’) and gastrulation (bottom row, NC14 + 72’) over the complete set of known enhancers within the gap, pair-rule, and segment polarity gene regulatory networks.

All the known early gap gene CRMs are open at ZGA and either maintain or lose accessibility by the onset of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In contrast, pair-rule CRMs separate into two distinct temporal classes of chromatin accessibility. All the early, stripe-specific CRMs within the pair-rule network are open at ZGA, whereas later, seven-stripe (or 14-stripe) specific CRMs generally lack open chromatin at ZGA, and gain accessibility by the onset of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). A large subset of the known segment polarity CRMs lack accessible chromatin at ZGA and undergo significant gains in accessibility by gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>). Overall, within this network, 30% (33/111) of known CRMs undergo statistically significant changes in chromatin accessibility over time. Taken together, these results demonstrate that during the 1-hr period between ZGA and gastrulation patterns of chromatin accessibility within segmentation network CRMs are dynamic, correlating with the early or late activity of gene expression patterns within the network. We conclude from this that the ZGA chromatin state contains insufficient accessible cis-regulatory information to sustain the function of the segmentation gene network. Chromatin accessibility patterns continue to change over the 1-hr period between ZGA and gastrulation to support the later-acting components of the network, particularly the segment polarity and late pair-rule systems. This raises the possibility that the hierarchical networks that drive embryonic segmentation derive timing information from regulated chromatin accessibility. Notably, binding of pioneers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rieder et al., 2017</xref>) implicated in the establishment of the initial ZGA chromatin state is low or absent at sites that gain accessibility late (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that additional, unrecognized regulatory mechanisms drive further changes in chromatin accessibility after ZGA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of patterning-dependent and -independent changes in chromatin accessibility</title><p>The post-ZGA changes in chromatin accessibility could arise either uniformly within all cells of the embryo or could stem from the localized effects of developmental patterning systems. Previous investigations of chromatin accessibility states in post-ZGA embryos have demonstrated that shortly after ZGA, chromatin accessibility is largely homogeneous across most cells of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haines and Eisen, 2018</xref>), but as development proceeds, spatially restricted, lineage-specific patterns of accessibility emerge as cell fates are specified and spatially restricted gene expression programs mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cusanovich et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bozek et al., 2019</xref>). One major exception to ZGA chromatin state homogeneity is a small cohort of enhancers with anteriorly restricted accessibility whose open state depends on the activity of the maternal patterning factor Bicoid (Bcd) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cusanovich et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haines and Eisen, 2018</xref>). Besides Bcd, it is unclear whether any other maternal patterning systems or downstream zygotic targets directly impact the chromatin accessibility state of the early embryo. We therefore measured the effect of eliminating all graded maternal inputs to embryonic development on the changes in chromatin accessibility we observe between ZGA and gastrulation.</p><p>By eliminating or flattening all graded maternal inputs to development, we force all cells of the embryo to develop along a single restricted trajectory. In situ hybridization of wild-type NC14 embryos for representative markers of anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) specification reveals distinct, spatially restricted gene expression patterns along both axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left column). Four maternal systems provide the information sufficient to distinguish these positional identities along the AP and DV axes. The terminal extrema of the embryo are distinguished by localized Torso receptor tyrosine kinase antagonism of the medial determinant Capicua (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casanova and Struhl, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jiménez et al., 2000</xref>). Anterior fates are specified by the Bcd transcription factor gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Struhl et al., 1989</xref>). Posterior identity is conferred by clearance of maternal Hunchback transcriptional repressor by graded expression of the Nanos translational repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lehmann and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hülskamp et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ephrussi et al., 1991</xref>). DV positions are specified by a gradient of the transcription factor Dorsal that functions downstream of a ventral-to-dorsal gradient of activated Toll receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Roth et al., 1989</xref>). We generated embryos from mothers with null mutations in all terminal and AP systems (<italic>bcd</italic>, <italic>osk</italic>, <italic>cic</italic>, <italic>tsl</italic>) as well as a ‘lateralizing’ allele of <italic>Toll</italic> (<italic>Tl<sup>RM9</sup></italic>) that yields uniform, mid-level Dorsal activity across the entire DV axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Roth et al., 1989</xref>) (see Discussion).

Over this early period, we expect that embryos from these two genotypes develop with similar rates and therefore remain comparable until at least the time when wild-type embryos gastrulate. As expected, comparison of differentially accessible regions between stage and genotype identifies regulatory elements with spatially restricted expression patterns. For example, at the <italic>wingless</italic> (<italic>wg</italic>) locus, two closely apposed regions (<italic>wg −2.5</italic> and <italic>−1</italic>) show differential behavior between genotypes. The <italic>wg −2.5</italic> region undergoes a modest increase in accessibility in wild-type embryos but not in mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, green shading). In contrast, the neighboring <italic>wg −1</italic> region shows greatly increased accessibility in mutant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, cyan shading). These two regions together constitute a single previously identified CRM (<italic>wg WLZ4L</italic>) controlling early <italic>wg</italic> expression in both a segment-polarity multi-stripe pattern as well as a single posterior endodermal stripe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lessing and Nusse, 1998</xref>). On the basis of our ATAC data, we individually cloned the <italic>wg −2.5</italic> and <italic>−1</italic> regions into reporter constructs and compared expression between wild-type and mutant embryos. <italic>wg −2.5</italic> becomes active just prior to gastrulation in wild-type but not in equivalently staged mutant embryos, and exclusively drives multi-stripe expression within the segmental primordium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and data not shown). In constrast, <italic>wg-1</italic> is active earlier in NC14 and exclusively drives expression of the endodermal stripe pattern. As expected, whereas <italic>wg −1</italic> expression is restricted to a single posterior endodermal domain in wild-type embryos, all cells in a mutant embryo have strong <italic>wg −1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

In general, a greater fraction of the sites with dynamic chromatin accessibility undergo patterning-independent changes. This was quantified in two ways, and source code for the following analysis has also been provided (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>). First, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) on the complete set of differentially accessible regions (i.e. all regions with both a ± 2 fold change and an adjusted p-value&gt;0.01 either between timepoints or between genotypes as determined by DESeq2). The greatest source of variance is patterning-independent, with the first principal component separating samples according to developmental time (PC1: 66% variance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The second principal component separates samples according to genotype and therefore resolves patterning-dependent variance (PC2: 21% variance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). There is less of a patterning-dependent difference between NC14+12’ samples compared with the +72’ timepoint, supporting the conclusion that cells initiate the zygotic phase of development with a large degree of chromatin state homogeneity and that additional changes emerge over the period leading up to gastrulation from patterning-dependent and -independent sources.</p><p>To relate the observed changes to discrete developmental processes, we returned to the set of known segmentation network CRMs and plotted scaled chromatin accessibility over time between wild-type and mutant samples. Within all three tiers of the segmentation network, we find evidence for extensive patterning-dependent chromatin accessibility at both early and late timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As previously shown, the gap gene network receives extensive patterning-dependent chromatin accessibility cues from a pioneer activity of Bcd (7/18 CRMs, 39%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>). Early pair-rule CRMs receive both patterning dependent and independent inputs; however, the majority of late pair-rule CRMs gain accessibility in a patterning-dependent manner (25/30 pair-rule CRMs with late accessibility, 83%). Segment polarity CRMs (e.g., <italic>wg −2.5</italic> and <italic>wg −1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) likewise have extensive patterning-dependent accessibility states (16/33, 49%). Overall, 43% (48/111) of these segmentation network CRMs receive accessibility cues either directly or indirectly from maternal patterning systems. Therefore, these results indicate that although overall changes in accessibility tend to occur independently of embryonic patterning, the networks dedicated specifically to embryonic patterning display a disproportionate reliance on patterning systems for determination of their chromatin accessibility states.</p><p>Next, we quantified the types of changes in chromatin accessibility that we observed in our analysis. Overall, there are 26,328 peaks in the ATAC dataset. Similar to the PCA analysis, we find fewer patterning-dependent differences at ZGA than at gastrulation (408 versus 1871, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). In contrast, a greater number of time-dependent differences are observed for both genotypes (5190 for wild-type, 8655 for mutant, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>). We note that these numbers represent above-threshold statistical significance for tests on only one of two critical parameters in this experiment, either time or genotype.</p><p>To comprehensively classify the types of changes that any single region undergoes over time and relative to patterning inputs, we took a clustering-based approach to identify groups of similarly-behaved regions and then used the output from paired DESeq2 tests to assign regions to each identified category (see Materials and methods). By this approach, we identify a total of 2917 dynamic regions (11% of the total peaks list, n = 26328) that classify into one of ten distinct dynamic categories with respect to time and patterning-dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">10</xref>, please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for a complete ATAC peaks list). Overall, roughly similar numbers of sites gain and lose accessibility over time with 46% of sites that are open early losing accessibility over time (1351/2917, ‘late repression’ classes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, groups 1 through 5) and 50% sites gaining accessibility by the onset of gastrulation (1446/2917, ‘late accessibility’ classes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, groups 8 through 10). In total we identify 56% (1635/2917) strictly pattern-independent regions that either gain (25% (725/2917)) or lose (31% (910/2917)) accessibility uniformly between ZGA and gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, groups 1 and 8, see <italic>slam</italic> detail, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">8</xref>). The remaining 44% of regions (1282/2917) receive inputs from patterning systems. 11% (307/2917) additional regions gain accessibility uniformly by ZGA but undergo patterning-dependent losses in accessibility by gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, groups 2 and 3, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). In this case, we cannot distinguish whether the patterning-dependent behavior is repressive or instead represents spatially restricted maintenance of accessibility against a uniform repressor. The remaining classes all reflect pattern-dependent behaviors. 9% of regions (254/2917) show pattern-dependent early accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, groups 4 through 7). This class is split either into regions that lose accessibility by gastrulation (n = 134, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> group 4, see <italic>gt-10</italic> detail, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>) or show constitutive patterning-dependent accessibility through gastrulation (n = 120, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> groups 6 and 7, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplements 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">7</xref>). Finally, 25% regions (721/2917) demonstrate late patterning-dependent gains in accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> groups 9 and 10, see <italic>slp1 ‘5’</italic> detail, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplements 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">10</xref>). Patterning-dependent regulation of chromatin accessibility therefore increases by a factor of 4-fold over the course of NC14. While patterning-dependent accessibility at ZGA is limited to 254 regions, over the course of NC14, patterning systems have a significant impact on the embryonic chromatin landscape driving late gains in accessibility at 721 sites and late reductions in accessibility (or maintenance, see above) at an additional 307 sites for a total of 1028 late patterning-dependent regions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ten classes of peaks with dynamic chromatin accessibility between ZGA and gastrulation.</title><p>Ten peak classes are symbolized by cartoons in the left column.

Compared with the 42 min of development that precede large-scale ZGA (NC11 through NC13) where thousands of promoters display dynamic acquisition of chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>), the period between ZGA and gastrulation shows largely invariant promoter chromatin accessibility. Dynamic chromatin regulation during this time is focused on putative intergenic and intronic regulatory elements. However, in addition, nearly every group that displays early chromatin accessibility and gastrula-stage reductions in accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, groups 1–4) show an enrichment for exonic regions. While this raises the possibility that groups 1 through 4 additionally capture exonic regions with differential expression over this period, intersecting this set of exons with a published RNA-seq timecourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lott et al., 2011</xref>) reveals that few of these exons are associated with contemporaneous zygotic transcriptional activity. Across all groups, an average of 8 ± 5% of associated exons are zygotically expressed during NC14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s11">Figure 4—figure supplement 11</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the functional implications of enriched intergenic and intronic regions, we cross-referenced the collection of functionally-validated enhancer elements from the Vienna Tiles collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kvon et al., 2014</xref>) to address whether these groupings enriched for CRMs with related expression patterns. The expression patterns of individual Vienna Tiles have been extensively annotated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://enhancers.starklab.org">http://enhancers.starklab.org</ext-link>) and we tested for enrichment of controlled-vocabulary (CV) terms describing the expression domains of enhancers overlapping the different ATAC peak class groupings. Overall, enhancers associated with regions that undergo patterning-independent regulation of chromatin accessibility (groups 1 and 8) nevertheless demonstrate spatially restricted patterns of expression. Early, patterning-independent regions (group 1) are enriched for expression domains that span the AP and DV axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Late patterning-independent regions (group 8) likewise demonstrate restricted patterns of expression with enrichment for anterior ectodermal and endodermal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8D</xref>). These observations are consistent with an interpretation that patterning-independent changes in chromatin accessibility underlie not the spatial extent but rather the timing of expression for associated enhancers. One caveat to this conclusion is that the Vienna Tiles collection is itself enriched for regions likely to have spatially restricted, as opposed to ubiquitous, expression patterns and may under-represent the potential enrichment of more broadly active CRMs.</p><p>Enhancers associated with patterning-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility demonstrate a greater degree of spatial restriction in their expression patterns. As observed for the <italic>wg −1</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), increased or persistent accessibility in mutant embryos correlates with expression domains largely limited to posterior and endodermal expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">10D &amp; E</xref>). Group 3, in which accessibility is lost in mutant but not wild-type embryos, demonstrates a corresponding lack of enhancer activity within the posterior endodermal compartment (e.g. VT39546 and VT7922, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Conversely, increased or persistent accessibility in wild-type embryos corresponds to expression domains that largely exclude the posterior endodermal compartment. Groups 4 and 6, which are enriched for Bcd binding motifs, are likewise enriched for enhancers with anteriorly restricted expression domains, and any posterior expression domains exclude posterior endodermal precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6D</xref>). Finally, the late, wild-type patterning-dependent group (group 9) demonstrates enrichment for enhancers with AP or pair-rule stripes (e.g. VT15159 and VT26324). A subset of enhancers in group nine also demonstrate AP stripes with graded or discontinuous modulation along the DV axis (e.g. VT7841 and VT40612, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9D</xref>), thus raising the possibility that these enhancers receive regulatory inputs from both the AP and DV patterning systems. Our groupings therefore primarily distinguish between enhancer subclasses that have activities associated with, or distinct from, posterior endodermal precursors and may help to define a regulatory network for early endodermal development.</p><p>Regions with patterning-dependent accessibility regulation are enriched for DNA sequence motifs associated with patterning factors. To gain insight about what regulatory factors could be driving the observed dynamic chromatin accessibility behaviors, we performed sequence motif enrichment analysis within each dynamic class using the MEME suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>). Regions with strictly uniform regulation of accessibility are enriched for motifs associated with ubiquitously expressed maternally supplied regulators, including binding sites for Zld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Liang et al., 2008</xref>) and GAGA/CLAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rieder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tsukiyama et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farkas et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, groups 1 and 8). In contrast, patterning-dependent sites are enriched for regulators with patterned, spatially restricted expression such as Bcd, Odd-paired (Opa), and Forkhead (Fkh, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, groups 4, 6, 9, and 10). In addition to these, we frequently observe across all categories enrichment of motifs for three maternally supplied factors with expected repressive activity, Tramtrack (Ttk), Adult Enhancer Factor 1 (Aef1), and Combgap (Cg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, groups 1, 5, 7, and 9). While Ttk has long been hypothesized to play a broad repressive role over the maternal-to-zygotic transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pritchard and Schubiger, 1996</xref>) as well as in regulation of embryonic patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harrison and Travers, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown and Wu, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Read et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wheeler et al., 2002</xref>), much less is known about potential early embryonic roles of Aef1 and Cg (see Discussion). We also note that although motifs for Cg are not included in the available DNA binding motif databases used to compile these results, we include Cg here on the basis of previous identification of Cg binding to a (CA)<sub>n</sub> motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ray et al., 2016</xref>), maternal expression of Cg, and frequent recovery of an orphan motif (CA)<sub>n</sub> in our analysis.</p><p>The recovery of Bcd and Fkh motifs in our dataset suggests that enrichment analysis could identify potential patterning-dependent pioneer activities responsible for driving differential accessibility states. We note here that recovery of motifs in our analysis is similar to those recovered in another recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nevil et al., 2019</xref>), which measured changes in accessibility between early and late NC14 samples but did not distinguish between patterning-dependent and independent events. Bcd has been demonstrated to pioneer accessibility at a subset of its targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>), and Bcd-motif enrichment in this analysis correlates with the set of previously identified bcd-dependent regions (e.g. <italic>gt −10</italic>). Fkh is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of a well-characterized pioneer factor FoxA1/2 that operates in early mammalian endodermal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cirillo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ang et al., 1993</xref>). Fkh is expressed zygotically late in NC14 within the posterior endodermal precursors we enrich with mutant embryos, and Fkh motif enrichment is observed specifically within the set of regions that have enhanced late accessibility in mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, group 10). Therefore, it is possible that like its mammalian counterpart, Fkh may pioneer accessibility of distinct endodermal CRMs in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> development.</p><p>Within the set of regions with patterning-dependent late accessibility, we also enrich for a zygotic pair-rule transcription factor, Opa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, group 9, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>). Opa is a C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor that is the<italic>Drosophila</italic>homolog of Zn-Finger of the Cerebellum (Zic) proteins, which have been implicated in a broad range of developmental functions ranging from maintenance of stem cell pluripotency, neural crest specification, and neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Houtmeyers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Luo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Groves and LaBonne, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Vásquez-Doorman and Petersen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hursh and Stultz, 2018</xref>). Broad roles for Opa in <italic>Drosophila</italic> development are also likely. In addition to an early requirement of Opa for segmental patterning, Opa is necessary for midgut morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cimbora and Sakonju, 1995</xref>), imaginal disc and adult head development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lee et al., 2007</xref>), and has recently been shown to play a critical role in regulating the temporal identity of neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdusselamoglu et al., 2019</xref>). Although neither Opa nor its homologs have been shown previously to pioneer chromatin accessibility, mouse Zic2 has been demonstrated to bind both active and poised enhancers in embryonic stem cells prior to Oct4 and to play a critical role in maintenance of stem cell pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Luo et al., 2015</xref>), and in certain species of moth flies Opa has been adopted as the maternal anterior determinant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yoon et al., 2019</xref>), which in <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires pioneer activity from Bcd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>). This, coupled with the observed enrichment of Opa motifs in our analysis, raised the possibility that Opa could contribute to patterning-dependent chromatin regulation after ZGA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Opa pioneers chromatin accessibility of late patterning-dependent regions</title><p>Originally identified in a genetic screen for regulators of embryonic segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jürgens et al., 1984</xref>), <italic>opa</italic> functions as a pair-rule gene to pattern alternating segmental identities. However, <italic>opa</italic> differs from the other seven pair-rule genes in several ways. First, <italic>opa</italic> is not expressed in a characteristic early seven-stripe pattern typical of pair-rule genes but is instead expressed uniformly over the entire embryonic segmental primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benedyk et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Second, compared with other pair-rule genes, <italic>opa</italic> initiates expression significantly later in development and has been proposed to function as a temporal switch within the pair-rule network, facilitating the transition from early to late phases of network operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark and Akam, 2016</xref>).

Because we observed enrichment of Opa binding motifs in the set of regions that gain patterning-dependent accessibility late in NC14, and because many pair-rule and segment polarity CRMs also display late patterning-dependent accessibility, we tested the hypothesis that Opa functions as a pioneer factor to confer changes in chromatin structure downstream of maternal patterning cues.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Opa is necessary and sufficient to pioneer accessible chromatin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunostaining for myc-tagged Opa expression relative to expression of pair-rule genes Runt and Eve in a late NC14 embryo.

We performed ChIP-seq on three independent biological replicates of 200 homozygous <italic>opa-myc</italic> cellular blastoderm embryos using as a negative control wild-type (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>) embryos. Mapped reads were subjected to peak calling with MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), yielding 3553 total, low-stringency peak regions. From these, we we defined a set of 879 reproducible, high-confidence Opa ChIP peaks by Irreproducible Discovery Rate analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Landt et al., 2012</xref>) (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for the IDR filtered peaks list). 85% (744/879) of the Opa ChIP peaks overlap with at least one ATAC-seq peak. Opa ChIP peaks contain between 0 and 9 Opa motifs (80% match to the Opa position weight matrix reported by MEME), with an average of 1.08 motifs per peak. To test whether Opa pioneers accessibility at its direct targets, we performed ATAC-seq on single NC14 + 72’ embryos collected from a cross between parents heterozygous for a null allele (<italic>w; opa<sup>IIP32</sup>/His2Av-GFP</italic>). Following mapping of reads, zygotic genotypes were called based on recovered SNPs (see Materials and methods). DESeq2 analysis of differentially accessible regions between genotypes determines that 263 (30%) of the high-confidence Opa-binding sites show significantly reduced chromatin accessibility in homozygous <italic>opa</italic>-mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>We have chosen in the following to focus on changes in chromatin accessibility specifically over the set of direct Opa-binding sites as determined by ChIP-seq to help distinguish between direct and indirect effects of Opa on the system. Evaluating changes in accessibility instead over the entire ATAC-seq peaks list, we find that 319 peaks lose, and 26 peaks gain accessibility in <italic>opa</italic> mutant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). None of the 26 peaks that gain accessibility in <italic>opa</italic> mutant samples overlap with either high- or low-stringency Opa ChIP peaks and these sequences are enriched neither for an Opa nor any other motif (data not shown). This suggests that these <italic>opa-</italic>dependent gains in accessibility are indirect effects. Of the set of 319 peaks with reduced accessibility, 139 (44%) overlap with high-stringency, IDR-selected Opa ChIP peaks. Testing for overlap with the low-stringency, pre-IDR Opa ChIP peaks list, an additional 63 (20%) Opa peaks overlap. The remaining 167 peaks that demonstrate reduced accessibility in an <italic>opa</italic> mutant are not enriched for an Opa motif, suggesting that at least 37% of the overall effect of Opa on accessibility gains is indirect. Motif enrichment on this set of 167 indirect Opa-sensitive peaks yields a long, adenine-rich motif with no high-confidence match in the sequence motif database and a weak resemblance to a binding motif for <italic>jim,</italic> another C2H2 Zn-finger transcription factor (data not shown). Since <italic>jim</italic> is not expressed until significantly later in fly development (&gt;12 hr post-fertilization, primarily in larval and pupal stages), we conclude that the factor associated with this motif is unknown.</p><p>These results demonstrate that Opa is necessary for conferring accessible chromatin states at a subset of its direct binding sites. Similar to the overall Opa peaks list, opa-dependent ChIP peaks contain between 0 and 9 Opa motifs, but have moderately higher average motif number (1.32). In contrast, ChIP peaks that do not depend on Opa for accessibility have fewer Opa motifs (range: 0 to 5, mean = 0.95). This moderate difference in average motif content between these two classes is statistically significant at p=2×10<sup>−7</sup> by one-tailed permutation test on 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> proportional randomly selected groups. Similar to the overall distribution of dynamic chromatin regions from ZGA to gastrulation, opa-dependent regions are strongly enriched for intergenic regions and are under-represented for promoter regions. Only three Vienna Tiles, all with late NC14 AP-stripe expression patterns, uniquely overlap with the set of opa-dependent sites: VT14361 (contains <italic>eve-late</italic>), VT1965 (contains <italic>slp1 ‘5’</italic>), and VT39542 (intronic <italic>homothorax</italic> enhancer). Relative to the set of patterning-dependent and independent dynamic genomic regions defined above, direct opa-dependent pioneer activity alone is sufficient to account for 36% of group 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>): the set of chromatin regions that depend on inputs from maternal patterning systems to gain accessibility by the onset of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, in addition to pioneering open chromatin in late NC14 embryos, Opa’s zygotic pioneer activity accounts for a significant proportion of overall changes in chromatin accessibility downstream of maternal patterning systems.</p><p>In addition, Opa is sufficient to pioneer open chromatin at the majority of these direct, opa-dependent targets. Because <italic>opa</italic> is expressed late in NC14, at earlier timepoints opa-dependent regions represent effectively naive chromatin states that can be used to test for sufficiency. We reasoned that at NC13 (one cell cycle before NC14) chromatin accessibility status at Opa targets would largely resemble late <italic>opa-</italic>mutant states. To test for sufficiency, we performed ATAC-seq comparing single wild-type embryos collected 12 min into NC13 with embryos misexpressing <italic>opa</italic> maternally under direct control of the maternal <italic>alpha-tubulin 67</italic> c promoter (<italic>tub &gt;opa</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This misexpression strategy yields maternal <italic>opa</italic> expression levels comparable to maximal zygotic <italic>opa</italic> expression at late NC14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Embryos produced from mothers heterozygous for <italic>tub &gt;opa</italic> hatch and can mature to adulthood, albeit with varying degrees of segmental mis-patterning as described below. Whereas wild-type NC13 + 12’ accessibility at direct Opa targets is nearly indistinguishable from NC14 + 72’ <italic>opa</italic>-mutant samples, maternal expression of Opa increases the open chromatin signature at these targets at 80% (197/263) of opa-dependent sites and at 59% (519/879) of direct Opa targets overall. We conclude that, with the exception of 25% (66/263) opa-dependent but maternal-opa-insensitive sites that Opa is sufficient to pioneer open chromatin at its target sites.</p><p>A second criterion for classifying a transcription factor as a pioneer is that it binds to its DNA motifs even in the nucleosome-associated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2016</xref>). To test this, we measured the distribution of Opa-binding motifs relative to nucleosome positions modeled from the distribution of large (&gt;100 bp) ATAC-seq fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schep et al., 2015</xref>). Either before expression of <italic>opa</italic> (wild-type NC14+12’) or in <italic>opa</italic> mutants at late NC14 (<italic>opa</italic> NC14 + 72’), 51% (250/486) of Opa motifs in opa-dependent regions are located within 73 bp of a modeled nucleosome dyad (i.e., within the wrap of DNA around a nucleosome, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and data not shown). The fraction of Opa motifs within opa-dependent regions overlapping with predicted nucleosome positions is significantly greater than is observed from the set of Opa motifs located in non-bound, but accessible regions (27%, 427/1572, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Following binding of Opa (wild-type NC14+72’), the fraction of motifs in bound regions overlapping the nucleosome footprint reduces to 15% (73/486) and the average position of Opa motifs relative to predicted nucleosome dyads increases by an average of 79 bp in bound regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In constrast, the distance between motifs and nucleosomes distance changes by only 6 bp in non-bound regions. These results suggest that a substantial fraction of Opa motifs within future Opa-occupied sites are associated with nucleosomes in the ZGA chromatin state. Following activation of Opa late in NC14, binding of Opa to targets results in a reorganization of nucleosomes surrounding Opa motifs and exposure of previously nucleosome-occluded DNA. Although additional studies of Opa binding to nucleosome-free and -bound DNA will need to be performed, these results are consistent with a model where Opa can interact with nucleosome-associated binding motifs and can trigger reorganization of local chromatin structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Additional mechanisms regulate developmental competence of late segment-polarity CRMs to gain accessibility</title><p>We have demonstrated that following ZGA, both local and global changes in chromatin accessibility patterns continue to take place. The identification of pioneers like Opa raises the possibility that distinct zygotic factors function to establish accessibility states conditional on prior, maternal patterning information.

To characterize this further, we performed motif enrichment analysis over the entire set of opa-dependent, opa-insensitive sites and find enrichment of the Opa motif, as well as enrichment of two maternal repressors, Ttk and Cg. In contrast, the set of both opa-dependent and opa-sensitive regions shows enrichment for the Opa motif alone. These results indicate that within the segmentation network there exists differential sensitivity to acquisition of chromatin accessibility states, and that although Opa is necessary for conferring open chromatin at a set of pair-rule and segment polarity loci, it is possible that competence to respond to Opa, and perhaps any pioneer in general, is further regulated by additional repressive mechanisms.</p><p>Maternal expression of <italic>opa</italic> triggers premature activity of opa-dependent targets and mispatterning of the pair-rule network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). The opa-sensitive target <italic>odd-late</italic> initiates expression in wild-type embryos in a domain of seven odd-numbered parasegments that correspond to the secondary pattern of <italic>odd</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark and Akam, 2016</xref>). Expression within even-numbered parasegments corresponding to the primary <italic>odd</italic> expression pattern follows later, ultimately yielding a 14-stripe pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and data not shown). In addition to the parasegmental expression pattern, there is a transient head stripe anterior to the first stripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Activity of this CRM is entirely dependent on <italic>opa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Maternal expression of <italic>opa</italic> affects both spatial and temporal aspects of the <italic>odd-late</italic> expression pattern, driving premature activity of <italic>odd-late</italic> in stripes with incorrect spatial distributions. The most significant spatial effect of maternal <italic>opa</italic> expression on <italic>odd-late</italic> pattern is an increased interstripe distance between the first and second odd parasegmental expression domain, resulting in apparent compression between the second and third stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In addition, compared with wild-type, the regular spacing of odd- and even-parasegmental stripes at positions 4–6 is disrupted with maternal <italic>opa</italic> expression. Despite the fact that <italic>tub &gt;opa</italic> is expressed uniformly across the entire embryo, premature <italic>odd-late</italic> expression appears not uniformly, but within the spatial domains to which its later expression will be restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Similar effects have been observed with premature expression of <italic>opa</italic> using the <italic>gal4</italic>-UAS system, where increasing levels of <italic>opa</italic> expression lead to defects in <italic>slp1</italic> expression only within the segmental primordium (i.e. in a domain where additional co-regulators are expressed). Only in combination with uniformly misexpressed <italic>runt</italic> are ectopic domains of <italic>slp1</italic> observed outside the segmental primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Swantek and Gergen, 2004</xref>). These observations are consistent with a role for <italic>opa</italic> largely restricted to regulating accessibility and not strictly activating or repressing expression from direct targets such as <italic>odd-late</italic> and that interfering with timing of CRM accessibility results in inappropriate responses to developmental cues and disruption of the precision of embryonic patterning.</p><p>To quantify the effect of maternal <italic>opa</italic> expression on additional components of the pair-rule network, we immunostained embryos for Runt and Eve and quantified stripe positioning in precisely staged embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dubuis et al., 2013</xref>). Although between genotypes the segmental primordium is unchanged in both overall area and overall positioning, the intensity and positions of stripes 2–6 are affected by maternal <italic>opa</italic> expression. Similar to <italic>odd-late</italic> we also observe increased inter-stripe distances between Runt stripes 1 and 2, and reduced distance between stripes 2 and 3, as well as minor mis-positioning of stripes 4–6. We note that the long-term severity of the <italic>tub</italic> &gt;<italic>opa</italic> phenotype may be attenuated by limited effects of maternal <italic>opa</italic> expression on the segment polarity network. Because the degree of <italic>opa</italic> mis-expression approximates wild-type <italic>opa</italic> expression levels at mid to late NC14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), it also remains possible that driving higher levels of <italic>opa</italic> expression would result in stronger mis-expression phenotypes. The positioning of stripes in the pair-rule network is highly precise and results from optimal decoding of maternal and gap-gene patterning inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Petkova et al., 2019</xref>). Our results are consistent with a model where premature <italic>opa</italic> expression alters how maternal information is read at the level of this network. While we cannot at present distinguish effects on the system that stem from Opa-dependent pioneering from possible Opa-dependent effects on transcription, these results provide support for the hypothesis that the sequential transitions in chromatin accessibility patterns are themselves necessary for proper patterning of the embryo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To the extent that the developmental program can be described by gene regulatory networks, mechanisms for the regulation of chromatin accessibility must play a major role in determining how this program unfolds. Focusing on the AP segmentation network, we show that at the outset of embryonic patterning, not all CRMs in this network are fully accessible. Over time, accessibility states change as the network activates the gap, pair-rule, and segment polarity components of the system. A portion of these changes over time are sensitive to loss of maternal patterning cues, which either directly (via maternal factors such as Bcd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>) or indirectly (via activation of zygotic targets such as Opa) influence accessibility states. Therefore, accessibility states within a network can be dynamic, and the drivers of these changes can be integral components of the networks themselves, as we see in the case of the segmentation GRN. As gene expression states progress through a stereotypical progression in order to impart embryonic pattern, so do accessibility states of the CRMs that drive these patterns. Importantly, we demonstrate that the temporal sequence of CRM accessibility states is itself important for proper patterning of the embryo: driving premature accessibility at a subset of late pair-rule CRMs results in inappropriate responses to patterning cues, and disruption to the otherwise highly precise expression of pair-rule genes.</p><p>Although we have focused primarily on the AP segmentation network and the contribution of Opa to accessibility of late-acting enhancers in this network, we have also more generally estimated the relative contribution of patterning-dependent and patterning-independent mechanisms for driving changes in chromatin accessibility in the 1-hr period between ZGA and gastrulation. The ATAC-seq peaks in this study have been provided as an extended data file with complete annotations for further exploration of these results. We caution that we have not exhaustively determined here the extent of patterning-dependent accessibility states on the DV network (see below). In addition to CRMs within the segmentation network, our results also highlight at least two other major classes of dynamic chromatin sites.</p><p>First, regions that demonstrate enriched chromatin accessibility in mutant <italic>bcd osk cic tsl Tl<sup>RM9</sup></italic> embryos compared with wild-type are enriched for CRMs that demonstrate expression patterns restricted to cells fated to become posterior endoderm. This is a lineage that has received comparatively less attention in studies of early <italic>Drosophila</italic> development in part because defects in endodermal specification were not explicitly screened for in the classic zygotic screens for patterning mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wieschaus and Nüsslein-Volhard, 2016</xref>). Similarly, a recent ATAC-seq study on spatially restricted populations of blastoderm nuclei did not exclusively purify cells within this lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bozek et al., 2019</xref>). Our results indicate that this small population develops extensive cell-type specific accessibility patterns by the onset of gastrulation, and we speculate that our data may enrich the set of known CRMs operating within this lineage. By motif enrichment analysis within regions that gain accessibility late in mutant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, group 10), we find over-representation of both Fkh and Byn motifs. In addition to the well-known role for mammalian Fkh homologs in pioneering endodermal chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cirillo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ang et al., 1993</xref>), a recent study has also indicated that the mammalian Byn homolog, Brachyury, contributes to pioneering of mesendodermal enhancers during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tosic et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, in addition to potentially identifying additional components of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> posterior endodermal GRN, our results also suggest that mechanisms for establishing endodermal cell-type specific chromatin states are conserved. Further work will be needed to confirm the expected pioneer activities of Fkh and Byn in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system.</p><p>Second, our observation of continued uniform, patterning-independent changes to chromatin accessibility after ZGA suggests that additional global timers of developmental progression continue to operate following the maternal-to-zygotic transition. One of the most intensely studied developmental transitions in chromatin structure is large-scale ZGA that accompanies the maternal-to-zygotic transition. The initial ground state of chromatin structure is built by maternally supplied pioneers, particularly Zelda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>), and likely a combination of factors that bind (GA)<sub>n</sub> repeats, GAGA-factor and CLAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rieder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kaye et al., 2018</xref>). Prior studies on the temporal dynamics of the establishment of the initial ground state have suggested that these pioneers act in distinct temporal waves, with the earliest accessible regions associated with Zelda binding, and the latest accessible regions enriched for the (GA)<sub>n</sub> motif and GAGA-factor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>). Our results add to these prior observations by suggesting that these global ‘waves’ of accessibility regulation continue well past the ZGA, and likely, based on motif enrichment, receive inputs from additional maternally supplied factors with expected repressive activity: Ttk, Aef1, and Cg. Next to nothing is known about the role of these factors specifically in the context of global chromatin accessibility regulation at the ZGA. Aef1 was identified as a Zn-finger transcriptional repressor that regulates gene expression in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Falb and Maniatis, 1992</xref>). Cg has been implicated in both positive and negative regulation of target genes, has been shown to interact with GAGA factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lomaev et al., 2017</xref>), and plays a role in recruitment of polycomb group proteins to polycomb response elements through direct binding of (CA)<sub>n</sub> repreats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ray et al., 2016</xref>). Both Aef1 and Cg are expressed maternally, and transcripts are cleared by the onset of gastrulation (Berkeley <italic>Drosophila </italic>Genome Project) although protein expression kinetics have not been determined for early embryos. The transcriptional repressor Ttk plays a role in the spatio-temporal regulation of segmentation gene expression, directly influencing timing and pattern of pair-rule and segment polarity gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pritchard and Schubiger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harrison and Travers, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown and Wu, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Read et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wheeler et al., 2002</xref>). Perhaps indicating a more general role beyond segmentation network regulation, Ttk has been demonstrated to interact directly with GAGA factor and antagonize GAGA-dependent transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lomaev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pagans et al., 2004</xref>). Because Ttk mRNA and protein are expressed at high levels maternally and are cleared from the embryo by gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harrison and Travers, 1990</xref>), Ttk (as well as Aef1 and Cg) may play a more global role in ZGA timing by limiting pioneer factor activity at target sites until they are cleared from the embryo. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the subset of opa-dependent targets that are insensitive to maternal <italic>opa</italic> expression demonstrate an enrichment for Ttk and Cg motifs. One possible explanation for this apparent developmental competency to respond to Opa pioneering activity is that binding of maternal repressors can antagonize pioneer factor activity. Future work will include testing the role of these maternal factors in the context of ZGA timing and regulation of coordinated, global chromatin remodeling events.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Odd-paired as a pioneer within the segmentation network</title><p>In contrast with these mechanisms for uniform regulation of accessibility, while there is relatively little influence of maternal patterning systems directly on chromatin accessibility status, we observe that certain zygotic targets of maternal pathways, such as Opa, can have a major impact on chromatin accessibility states. Similar to Zelda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>), Opa is necessary for driving accessibility at ~30% of its direct binding targets. We note that overall Opa displays more limited binding across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome and occupies a smaller number of available motifs encoded in the genome sequence than Zelda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>). The reason for this is not clear. Additionally, we demonstrate evidence consistent with a model where Opa can bind to motifs in the nucleosome bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), although this result will need to be confirmed through future biochemical studies of Opa binding. On the basis of these two observations, that Opa is necessary and sufficient for driving open chromatin states, and that Opa likely interacts with inaccessible motifs to drive these states, we conclude that Opa functions as a pioneer factor in this system.</p><p>Opa’s primary role in the pair rule network is to facilitate the transition, termed a ‘frequency doubling’, from early to late expression patterns. In the absence of Opa, pair-rule loci (primarily <italic>odd</italic>, <italic>slp, run,</italic> and <italic>prd</italic>) fail to undergo the transition from early seven-stripe to late 14-stripe patterns. Additionally, late 7-stripe expression of <italic>eve</italic> is also strongly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark and Akam, 2016</xref>). Because of uniform expression across the segmental primordium, Opa does not provide positional information that defines the precise location of its target expression domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benedyk et al., 1994</xref>), and has been proposed to cooperate with additional pair-rule factors such as Runt to activate or repress target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark and Akam, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Swantek and Gergen, 2004</xref>). Here, we demonstrate the mechanism for Opa’s role in the network: that Opa facilitates the frequency doubling of the pair-rule network by pioneering accessibility of the CRMs that drive these late expression patterns. We predict that Opa pioneer activity will therefore result in conditional cis-regulatory interactions of the remaining pair-rule factors with late CRMs. This mechanism can help explain the previously observed ‘conditional regulation’ between network components (e.g. Odd repression of <italic>prd</italic> to yield anterior and posterior stripes)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark and Akam, 2016</xref>), which we propose is largely mediated through opa-dependent CRM accessibility states. The set of opa-dependent CRMs within the pair-rule network that we identify strongly support this conclusion. Incorporating such ‘time-gated’ pioneering events into a regulatory network may therefore allow for a system to generate multiple patterning outputs from a limited set of input transcription factors. Further investigation of the opa-dependence for conditional cis-regulatory interactions amongst pair-rule factors, as well as identification of additional zygotic pioneer factors will address these predictions.</p><p>A critical distinction that arises between transcription factors within a network, then, is what effect they have on chromatin accessibility states. It is likely that not all transcription factors have pioneer activity, or that the ability of a factor to pioneer is context specific. For instance, loss of <italic>grainyhead</italic> (<italic>grh</italic>) has minimal effects on the pre-gastrula chromatin accessibility state, despite the fact that <italic>grh</italic> has been demonstrated to function as a pioneer in other biological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nevil et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, while repressors have been demonstrated to negatively impact chromatin accessibility states, certain repressors, such as the pair-rule factor <italic>hairy</italic>, can operate not through compaction of chromatin but by inhibiting recruitment of the basal transcriptional machinery, at least in certain contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Li and Arnosti, 2011</xref>). Whether repressors within the pair-rule network fall into distinct chromatin-dependent and -independent categories at a genome-wide scale remains to be determined. A comprehensive appraisal of how transcription factors within a network not only interact with cis-regulatory elements over time but also how they impact chromatin accessibility states will be necessary to fully understand the regulatory logic of embryonic patterning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Is accessibility regulated maternally along the DV axis?</title><p>We note that we have not yet exhaustively examined all possible maternal patterning contributions to chromatin accessibility. The <italic>bcd osk cic tsl Tl<sup>RM9</sup></italic> mutant embryos used in this study, while amorphic for maternal determinants of AP and terminal cell fates, have uniform, moderate <italic>Tl</italic> pathway activation and therefore moderate <italic>dorsal</italic> (<italic>dl</italic>) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Roth et al., 1989</xref>). So, it remains possible that any possible <italic>dl</italic>-dependent chromatin accessibility states remain unidentified by our study. However, we predict that <italic>dl</italic> does not pioneer chromatin at least to the same extent as <italic>bcd</italic>. The observation of <italic>bcd</italic>-dependent chromatin accessibility states has now been observed in four independent studies in addition to this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cusanovich et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haines and Eisen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bozek et al., 2019</xref>). Besides studies where accessibility was measured in <italic>bcd</italic> mutants directly (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>), two additional studies of spatially restricted chromatin accessibility independently confirmed the predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>) anterior enrichment of <italic>bcd</italic>-dependent regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haines and Eisen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bozek et al., 2019</xref>). However, none of these studies were specifically designed to distinguish differential DV accessibility states. In contrast, a recent single-cell ATAC-seq study could have identified these states if they existed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cusanovich et al., 2018a</xref>). This study consistently identified several clusters of early embryonic cells that distinguished AP states, and single-cell ‘anterior’ clusters were found to be enriched for previously identified <italic>bcd</italic>-dependent regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cusanovich et al., 2018a</xref>). If <italic>dl</italic> were to pioneer chromatin to a similar extent as <italic>bcd</italic>, we would therefore expect that single-cell ATAC-seq would have also identified early ‘dorsal’ and ‘ventral’ clusters, but in this study, all DV-specific clusters (e.g. mesoderm) were only found associated with cells presumed to be staged later based on ‘pseudotime’ analysis. So, although maternal systems may not drive differential accessibility along the DV axis, it nevertheless likely that, similar to <italic>opa</italic>, specific zygotic targets within the DV networks operate immediately downstream of maternal pathways to distinguish DV-specific chromatin accessibility states. This also highlights how in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system both single-cell (or enriched cell) methods and genetic manipulation represent powerful complementary approaches for distinguishing the degrees of complexity in the chromatin landscape and linking these features to developmental regulatory systems. Replacing <italic>Tl<sup>RM9</sup></italic> with complete gain- or loss- of function alleles affecting <italic>Tl</italic> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Stathopoulos et al., 2002</xref>) in our maternal mutants will definitively test the hypothesis suggested by single-cell approaches of limited early DV heterogeneity in chromatin accessibility states.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Transcriptional activation or pioneering?</title><p>A prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bozek et al., 2019</xref>) observed that chromatin accessibility levels at enhancers as measured by ATAC-seq correlated strongly with the transcriptional activity of the associated gene. This raises important questions about how to interpret ATAC-seq peak intensities, including whether losses of ATAC signal in certain mutant backgrounds can be interpreted as stemming from pioneer activities or simply reflect reduced expression of associated genes. While this observation points to likely several compounding layers of regulation that influence chromatin accessibility and ATAC-seq measurements, it is unlikely that transcriptional activity is the sole determinant of enhancer accessibility states. For one, sites can be found that gain accessibility uniformly, but which are not transcribed. One such locus, <italic>ush</italic>, undergoes significant patterning-independent gains in promoter accessibility between ZGA and gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), but fails to be expressed in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This demonstrates that gains in accessibility can occur independently of transcriptional activation, and similarly highlights an example where transcriptional repression need not result in reduced accessibility. In contrast, the high degree of ATAC signal we observe at sites that preferentially gain accessibility in uniform-lineage mutant embryos (e.g. <italic>wg −1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) and <italic>18w 1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10</xref>)) may be significantly compounded by the large fold-increase between wild-type and mutant embryos of cells in which the associated CRM drives active transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). So, we cannot rule out completely an additional contribution from transcriptional status on the magnitude of ATAC signals.</p><p>In our study, we demonstrate distinct patterning-dependent gains in chromatin accessibility over time, and a significant fraction of these we link to <italic>opa</italic> activity. However, within the segmentation network specific CRMs, Opa is not the sole pair-rule factor predicted to bind to these sites. At the <italic>odd-late</italic> enhancer, for instance, in addition to our demonstration of direct Opa binding, prior ChIP-chip profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">MacArthur et al., 2009</xref>) of a subset of pair rule genes in broadly staged embryos predicts that one activator (Ftz) as well as several repressors (Slp1, Prd, Run, and to a lesser extent Hairy) bind to this region. Ftz, Run, and Hairy are expressed during early NC14, well before Opa, yet neither is <italic>odd-late</italic> functional at this time, nor is it accessible. Our results are consistent with a model where this and other <italic>opa</italic>-dependent enhancers require Opa to pioneer accessible chromatin first in order for other regulatory factors such as Ftz and Run to interact with the underlying DNA sequence and thereby regulate patterned expression of the associated gene. It is possible that robust transcriptional activity following initial pioneering results in additional increases in overall ATAC signal. Future work will include directly testing whether Opa expression facilitates de novo interaction of pair-rule genes at previously inaccessible chromatin regions, and direct testing of the regulatory consequences of dynamic chromatin accessibility states on network function.</p><p>We concede that it is difficult to disentangle using ATAC-seq alone what are likely numerous additional determinants of developmental chromatin accessibility dynamics. For instance, ATAC does not provide good information about the chromatin state of enhancers prior to acquiring an accessible state, nor does it directly shed light on the mechanisms for regulating competence for a site to be pioneered. In the case of Opa, we identify shifts in the positions of nucleosomes relative to binding sites consistent with a model where Opa binding triggers reorganization of chromatin structure at targeted loci. In many, but not all cases, Opa is sufficient to open chromatin at these sites earlier in development. Additional contextual features of the system must regulate competency for a site to be pioneered. As observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haines and Eisen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bozek et al., 2019</xref>), in many cases regions that undergo spatially restricted, pattern-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility demonstrate intermediate degrees of accessibility in the ‘closed’ state greater than that observed at completely inactive genomic loci. The idea of distinct degrees of ‘repressed’ or ‘closed’ chromatin adds further layers of potential regulation to these systems and raises the possibility that additional factors confer competence for chromatin to be pioneered. Much remains to be understood about what grants competence to a genomic locus to undergo chromatin remodeling in response to binding of a pioneer factor.</p><p>Finally, we note that a contemporaneous and independent investigation on the effect of Opa on early embryonic chromatin states has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Koromila et al., 2019</xref>). </p></sec></sec><sec

The quintuple ‘patternless’ maternal mutant was a gift from Eric Wieschaus at Princeton University. The base stock genotype is <italic>bcd<sup>E2</sup> osk<sup>166</sup> cic<sup>1</sup> tsl<sup>1</sup> Tl<sup>RM9</sup></italic> and was constructed through multiple rounds of meiotic recombination. A commonly available <italic>bcd osk</italic> double mutant stock was recombined with <italic>cic tsl</italic> double mutants and resultant quadruple mutants were subsequently recombined with <italic>Tl<sup>RM9</sup></italic>. Retention of mutant alleles was confirmed at each step by extensive complementation tests against single mutant alleles and examination of cuticle phenotypes. For ATAC-seq experiments, patternless mutant mothers were trans-heterozygotes between two independent quintuple mutant recombinants, and one of the two mutant chromosomes also carried <italic>His2Av-EGFP</italic> to facilitate staging of embryos. The <italic>opa</italic> mutant allele (<italic>opa<sup>IIP32</sup></italic>) was obtained from the Schupbach-Wieschaus Stock Collection at Princeton University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jürgens et al., 1984</xref>). For ATAC-seq experiments, <italic>opa</italic>/TM3, Sb were first crossed to <italic>w; His2Av-EGFP</italic> and embryos were collected from a cross between resultant <italic>opa</italic>/<italic>His2Av-EGFP</italic> adults. In the course of this study, we determined the nature of the <italic>opa<sup>IIP32</sup></italic> lesion as a single G &gt; A point mutation (chr3R:4853998–4853998, dm6 assembly) that generates a missense allele converting a critical cysteine residue within the first predicted Opa C2H2 Zn-finger to tyrosine (C298Y). To determine the zygotic genotypes of the individual embryos produced from the cross between <italic>opa</italic>/<italic>His2Av-EGFP</italic> adults, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) over the <italic>opa</italic> coding sequence were called using Samtools/BCFtools. Sequencing depth for these samples over variant bases within the <italic>opa</italic> locus were sufficiently deep (ranging from 47 to 104 independent reads per base) to allow for high-confidence <italic>post hoc</italic> genotyping. Whereas the wild-type chromosome was found to harbor SNPs that generate samesense mutations at a threonine and a proline residue (chr3R: 4868551 (G &gt; T) and chr3R: 4868557 (T &gt; C), respectively), a unique SNP (chr3R:4853998 (G &gt; A)) yielding a missense mutation at cysteine 298 was found present in either 0,~50%, or 100% of base calls at that position for a given sample. Sample genotypes were therefore assigned according to the frequency of recovery of the presumed causative mutation on the <italic>opa<sup>IIP32</sup></italic> chromosome. Since this lesion is predicted to severely impact Opa DNA binding and mutant <italic>opa<sup>IIP32</sup></italic> cuticle phenotypes are indistinguishable from those produced from homozygous <italic>opa<sup>Df</sup></italic> (data not shown), we conclude the <italic>IIP32</italic> allele is effectively amorphic.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>CRISPR modification of the <italic>opa</italic> locus</title><p>CRISPR was performed by microinjection of <italic>y sc v; nos &gt;Cas9</italic>/<italic>CyO</italic> embryos with ~60 pl of a mixture of plasmids encoding pU6-driven sgRNAs targeting <italic>opa</italic> and <italic>ebony</italic> (100 ng/ul each) and a plasmid for homology directed repair to insert either a 3x-myc tag or an EGFP-enhancer llama-tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bothma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kirchhofer et al., 2010</xref>) at a concentration of 500 ng/ul. All injections were performed in-house using a modified in-chorion approach originally developed by Nicolas Gompel and Sean Carroll (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carroll.molbio.wisc.edu/methods/Miscellaneous/injection.pdf">http://carroll.molbio.wisc.edu/methods/Miscellaneous/injection.pdf</ext-link>) which greatly facilitated high-throughput injection and enhanced survival of hundreds of embryos per day. The cited protocol was enhanced by beveling unclipped, freshly pulled injection needles at a 40° angle on a Narishige Needle Grinder (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan), resulting in reproducible needle preparations that easily pierced the chorion and minimized damage to injected embryos from irregularly surfaced tips. Targeting efficiency of <italic>ebony</italic> was used to select for likely ‘jackpots’ of CRISPR modified founders, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kane et al. (2017)</xref>. The <italic>opa</italic> sgRNA target sequence was selected from the UCSC Genome Browser/CRISPOR pre-calculated sgRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Concordet and Haeussler, 2018</xref>) and targets chr3R:4869148–4869167 (+ strand, dm6), yielding an expected Cas9-dependent double-strand break 4 bp downstream of the desired insertion site (immediately upstream and in-frame with the <italic>opa</italic> stop codon). The guide sequence oligonucleotides were synthesized with a leading G residue and terminal sequences compatible with insertion into BbsI-digested pU6-2xBbsI as described at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flycrispr.org/protocols/grna/">http://flycrispr.org/protocols/grna/</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gratz et al., 2015</xref>). Homology-directed repair (HDR) constructs were constructed using two 500 bp homology arms either terminating at the insertion site on the left or beginning at the expected Cas9 double-strand break on the right. Because the selected <italic>opa</italic> sgRNA target sequence spanned the site of insertion and would therefore be disrupted either in the HDR vector or in successfully targeted and repaired <italic>opa</italic> loci, we did not introduce sgRNA or PAM site mutations to prevent CRISPR targeting of the HDR plasmid or re-targeting of repaired loci. We constructed HDR sequences in a modified pBluescript KS vector where we introduced a <italic>3xP3 &gt; dsRed</italic> eye marker into the vector backbone (pBS 3xP3) to facilitate negative selection of unwanted founders that incorporate the full HDR plasmid by homologous recombination. All DNA constructs for injection were prepared using a modified Qiagen EndoFree Midiprep protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), which enhanced survival of injected embryos compared with standard Qiagen Midiprep grade DNA preparations. Following injection, surviving embryos were raised to adulthood and single founders were crossed to five or six <italic>w; Dr e/TM6c, Sb</italic> flies. F1 progeny were scored for the proportion of <italic>ebony</italic> and vials with &gt;50% <italic>ebony</italic> progeny were scored as ‘jackpots’ in which we induced greater-than-monoallelic targeting of the <italic>ebony</italic> locus. Up to six individual jackpot males from up to six jackpot founders were subsequently crossed to <italic>w; Dr e</italic>/<italic>TM6c, Sb</italic> females and stocks were established from F2 progeny. We favored jackpots that produced 85–100% <italic>ebony</italic> progeny. We observed a 32% survival rate of injected embryos (effectively 64% survival taking into account homozygous lethality of either the second-chromosomal <italic>nos &gt;Cas9</italic> transgene or <italic>CyO</italic>), of these 40–60% of founders produced at least one <italic>ebony</italic> progeny, and 15–25% of surviving founders, overall, produced jackpot lines. Following selection against whole-pasmid integrants (<italic>dsRed+</italic> individuals), approximately 75% of selected F2 jackpot individuals were positive for the desired insertion. No difference in insertion efficiency was observed between <italic>3xMyc</italic> and the <italic>EGFP-llama</italic> cassettes. Positive insertions were identified by PCR and reared to homozygosity before PCR amplification of the modified locus (using primers targeting sites outside the original left and right homology arms) and sequence confirmation by Sanger sequencing.

Embryos were dechorionated for 1 min in 4% Clorox (50% dilution of a commercially available ‘concentrated’ Clorox Bleach solution), washed extensively in dH<sub>2</sub>O, and mounted in halocarbon oil sandwiched between a glass coverslip and a gas-permeable membrane mounted on an acrylic slide. Syncytial blastoderm embryos were identified on the basis of morphology and nuclear density, and time-lapse images were collected on a Leica SP8 WLL confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with a 40 × 1.3 NA oil-immersion objective, using excitation wavelengths of 489 nm for EGFP and 585 nm for RFP. Images were captured at 512 × 240 pixels with 692 nm x-y pixel size (0.83x Zoom) and a 1 µm z-step spanning a z-depth of 12 µm, 115 µm pinhole size, and 110 Hz scan rate with bidirectional scanning. Series were collected at 30 s per xyz stack. We required that a movie begin within NC12 and for data collection to continue until at least NC14 + 72 min. This ensured not only that we quantified <italic>opa</italic> expression from the beginning of NC14, but also controlled for variation in developmental rates by allowing us to measure the duration of NC13. We required that NC13 would last no longer than 22 min and no shorter than 17 min for imaging to proceed. Fluorescence intensity was quantified by segmenting nuclei in the RFP channel and quantifying average, per nucleus intensity in the GFP channel. Nuclei outside of the <italic>opa</italic> expression domain were manually identified to estimate fluorescence background and plotted expression levels were calculated by subtracting the background estimate from the average intensity of nuclei within the observed <italic>opa</italic> expression domain.

Briefly, embryos were staged at NC14 to the minute by observation of anaphase of the prior cell cycle (t = 0’) and aging embryos to the desired stage. Embryos were maintained at constant room temperature to reduce variability in staging. Three minutes before the desired stage, a single embryo was dechorionated and macerated in Lysis Buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>). Nuclei were pelleted by gentle centrifugation at 4°C at 500 RCF and the supernatant was discarded prior to freezing on dry ice. We have determined that one critical parameter in this process is the use of low-retention 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes (e.g. Eppendorf DNA LoBind tubes, manufacturer part number 022431021) (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Samples were briefly thawed on ice before tagmentation in a 10 µl solution as described previously. A second critical parameter was to ensure sufficient resuspension of the nuclear pellet during the addition of the tagmentation solution, which we achieve by extensive up-and-down pipetting upon addition of the solution. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 800 RPM agitation in an Eppendorf Thermomixer HotShakey device. Following tagmentation, samples were cleaned up with the Qiagen MinElute Reaction Clean Up kit, eluting in 10 µl.</p><p>ATAC libraries were amplified using a set of modified Buenrostro primers that introduced Unique Dual Indexes (UDI). Buenrostro primers differ slightly from Illumina Nextera primers with the addition of 7 bp (Nextera Index Read 2 Primer/Universal or i5) or 6 bp (Nextera Index Read 1 Primer/i7) additional base pairs to the 3’ ends of standard Nextera primer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>) (Illumina Inc, San Diego, California).

The ATAC UDI Index Read one primer corresponds to the indexed Buenrostro primer designs, although we did not retain the same i7 barcodes. Because not all index combinations are compatible with one another, we used index pair combinations reported for the New England Biolabs NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (96 Unique Dual Index Pairs) set (catalog number E6440, New England Biolabs, Beverly, Massachusetts), replacing the (n)<sub>8</sub> sequences above with the appropriate i5 and i7 barcode.

No major differences were observed with library amplification or sequencing efficiencies between the UDI primer sets and the original Buenrostro designs.</p><p>Amplified libraries were checked on an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Biotechnologies, Santa Clara, California) to confirm the presence of distinct open and nucleosome-associated fragment sizes. Twelve embryos total were processed for the comparison between wild-type and ‘patternless’ mutant embryos: three embryo biological replicates per timepoint (NC14+12’ or +72’) and per genotype. For ATAC on <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos, 22 embryos were collected from a cross between <italic>opa/+</italic> heterozygous adults and sequenced in two separate library pools. This yielded five wild-type embryos, three <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos, and 14 heterozygous embryos. For ATAC-seq on NC13+12’ wild-type and <italic>tub &gt;opa</italic>/+ embryos, six embryos were collected per genotype. Sample sizes were chosen by the following rationale: in prior studies, we have observed that three independent biological samples provide sufficient information to estimate the reproducibility of an observed result. In the case of the <italic>opa</italic> mutant ATAC experiment, we sequenced samples until at least three of each expected zygotic genotype was recovered. In the <italic>tub &gt;opa</italic> experiment, we sequenced more than three samples simply because we had the choice of whether to sequence three replicates each at twice the depth, or sequence twice as many samples in order to fill the capacity of a sequencing lane. On the basis of Picard MarkDuplicates output (data not shown) increasing sequencing depth would not have provided additional information and would have only increased the duplication rate of the samples, so we chose to sequence more samples. Throughout the study, the term ‘replicate’ refers strictly to a biological replicate as samples were generated from individual embryos, that is, distinct biological samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>ChIP-seq</title><p>Per replicate, 200 cellular blastoderm stage <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> or <italic>opa-3xmyc</italic> embryos were collected, crosslinked and ChIPped as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blythe and Wieschaus (2015)</xref> for a total of three independent biological replicates. The ChIP antibody was an anti-myc tag polyclonal antibody from Sigma-Aldrich (C3956, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri). ChIP-seq libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II library prep kit with the NEB Unique Dual Index primer set kit (New England Biolabs). Samples were sequenced at the Northwestern University NuSeq Core Facility on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 on single-end 50 bp mode. Demultiplexed reads were run through TrimGalore! (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore">https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore</ext-link>) and mapped to the dm6 assembly of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>genome using Bowtie2 with options <monospace>-fivePrimeTrim 5 N 0 –local</monospace> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). Suspected optical and PCR duplicates were marked by Picard MarkDuplicates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). To determine a set of high-confidence peaks, we called peaks using relaxed stringency with MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) followed by determination of reproducible peak regions per replicate using the Irreproducible Discovery Rate algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Landt et al., 2012</xref>). First, we used Bedtools bamtobed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</ext-link>) to convert. bam formatted mapped, filtered primary sequencing reads to. bed format, which facilitated generation of pseudoreplicate datasets. Pseudoreplicates were generated by randomly splitting each replicate sample into two bed files. Overall pseudoreplicates were generated by pooling all replicates for either <italic>w</italic> or <italic>opa-3xmyc</italic> and randomly splitting reads into two separate bed files. Several peaks files were generated using MACS2 in preparation for IDR analysis. First, peaks for each individual <italic>opa-3xmyc</italic> sample (n = 3) were called against the pooled <italic>w</italic> sample data as a control. Having previously determined the MACS2 parameter <italic>-d</italic>, we bypassed model building (<monospace>--nomodel</monospace>) and manually specified the expected fragment size (<monospace>--extsize 149</monospace>). Relaxed conditions were specified by designating the option <monospace>-p 1e-3</monospace> as recommended by IDR. Samples were scaled to the larger dataset (<monospace>--scale-to large</monospace>). A second peaks list (n = 1) was generated for the pooled <italic>opa-3xmyc</italic> samples against the pooled <italic>w</italic> samples using the same MACS2 options. A third set of peaks (n = 6) were called for each pseudoreplicate for each biological replicate of <italic>opa-3xmyc</italic> against the pooled <italic>w</italic> samples, using the same MACS2 options. Finally, a fourth set of peaks (n = 2) were called for the two pseudoreplicates of the pooled <italic>opa-3xmyc</italic> data against the pooled <italic>w</italic> data, using the same MACS2 parameters. We then performed IDR analysis on this set of peaks with threshold values of 0.02 for individual replicates and 0.01 for the pooled data sets. IDR was performed for pairwise comparisons between replicates (e.g. rep 1 vs rep 2, rep 2 vs rep 3, and rep 3 vs rep 1) using as a reference the peak list from pooled <italic>opa-3xmyc</italic> samples. IDR options were <monospace>--input-file-type narrowPeak --rank p.value --soft-idr-threshold 0.02</monospace> and <monospace>--use-best-multisummit-idr</monospace>. IDR was then subsequently performed on each pair of pseudoreplicates for each individual biological replicate (e.g. rep1 pseudo 1 vs rep 1 pseudo 2...) using the same IDR options. Finally, IDR was performed on the pooled sample pseudoreplicates using the same IDR options except <monospace>--soft-idr-threshold</monospace> was 0.01 instead of 0.02, per the recommendation of the IDR instructions. The largest number of reproducible peaks between replicates was 881, and so we took the top 881 peak regions (ranked by p-value) from the list of pooled peaks and filtered out two regions that mapped to non-canonical chromosomes, leaving 879 high confidence peaks. Consequently, this is a conservative estimate of true Opa binding sites but is determined by more rigorous criteria (reproducibility between biological replicates) than either arbitrary p-value thresholding or simply taking the top N peaks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ATAC-seq analysis</title><p>Demultiplexed reads were trimmed of adapters using TrimGalore! and mapped to the dm6 assembly of the<italic>Drosophila</italic>genome using Bowtie2 with option -X 2000.

For the comparison between wild-type and ‘patternless’ mutant embryos over NC14+12 and +72, the design parameter passed to DESeq2 was ~genotype + time + genotype:time. For other comparisons (<italic>opa</italic> gain or loss of function at single timepoints) the design was ~genotype only. Regions with an adjusted p-value of less than 0.01 and absolute log<sub>2</sub>fold-changes &gt; 1 were considered to be statistically significant in the relevant test.</p><p>To determine the different dynamic peak classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we first undertook a clustering based approach to explore how many different classes we could identify within the dataset. To do this, we first averaged the number of reads per peak region for each sample and then scaled the data for each peak region by dividing the mean reads for a peak region by the sum of all mean reads for a peak region (i.e. so that the sum of the scaled reads for a peak region, sum<sub>region</sub>(wt 12, wt, 72, mut 12, mut 72), would equal 1). Next, we performed k-means clustering with a variable number of cluster centers, and plotted the average per-cluster profile to visualize average behavior of clustered regions. We found that 10 was the minimum number of cluster centers that would capture all the unique patterns present in the data, that fewer clusters would combine similar but qualitatively different classes, and more clusters would subdivide clusters into relatively similar subsets. We note that over the two-year course of this study, attempts were made to replicate this analysis on three different Apple (Apple Computer Inc, Cupertino, CA) computers running different base operating systems, versions of R, and versions of dependent libraries. For reasons that are not clear, clustering based approaches were not strictly reproducible across differently configured computers despite identical input datasets and identical scripting of the analysis code. To be clear, similar cluster types and minimum cluster number were called across different systems; however, the numeric order of the clusters, as well as the number of peaks assigned to each cluster would vary between systems. Because of this, we could not rely on clustering alone to reproducibly describe our results. Therefore, we took an alternative approach to categorizing peak classes that depended on the statistical output of DESeq2, whose output was identical across different computer systems. We paired statistical tests from DESeq2 to define classes. For instance, to define regions that were uniformly open early and uniformly lost accessibility by gastrulation, we required both wild-type and mutant samples to have a statistically significant difference across timepoints, with a log2 fold change of −1 or less. On the basis of these paired DESeq2 criteria, we reproduced each of the 10 peak class types predicted by clustering. We note that the final number of categorized peaks (2917) is substantially lower than the number of peaks that score above the significance + log2 fold change thresholds of 0.01 + |1| (6775). This is due to the fact that we require pairs of DESeq2 tests to score above significance thresholds for assignment to a class. The remaining 3858 regions only score as significantly different in one of the four tests.

In general, coverage at peak regions was plotted on the UCSC genome browser and views were zoomed out to identify flanking regions of low accessibility. We hypothesized that functional genomic elements would be defined by extended regions of accessible chromatin flanked by inactive, low-accessibility regions. Primer pairs were designed to amplify peak regions plus a small amount of flanking ‘low-accessibility’ DNA and were cloned into a Gateway entry vector pENTR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham Massachusetts). The exception to this overall strategy was in the case of the <italic>wg-2.5</italic> and <italic>−1</italic> regions which are adjacent to one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). in which case we delineated the two regions by the midpoint between the two major peaks of chromatin accessibility. Once we had generated one pENTR-enhancer clone by TA-cloning of a PCR product, it was no longer necessary, efficient, or desirable to perform TA cloning. Subsequent pENTR clones were made by excising the original insert and replacing with new candidate enhancer fragments via Gibson Assembly (NEB HiFi Assembly Kit, New England Biolabs). The candidate enhancer fragments were shuttled to the transgenic vector pBPGUw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>) upstream of a minimal synthetic promoter sequence driving Gal4 using standard Gateway cloning techniques (LR Clonase, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Reverse primers included a leading T7 promoter sequence to facilitate probe synthesis by in vitro transcription using an Ambion MegaScript T7 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche, Sigma-Aldrich) following standard procedures. In situ hybridizations were performed according to standard procedures using a hybridization temperature of 65°C, which was found to significantly reduce background compared with 56°C. For reducing bias in the evaluation of gene expression in ‘patternless’ mutant embryos, color development reactions were performed side-by-side with a wild-type control. Color development was evaluated by observing only the wild-type sample and stopping both reactions once it was determined that wild-type samples had just reached optimal signal. Staining levels in mutant embryos were then evaluated following termination of the color development reaction.

activity of Odd-paired/Zic is necessary for establishing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Segmentation Network&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Oliver Hobert as the Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Erik Clark (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers are in agreement that this is a very nice, interesting study that is of general importance. No additional experiments are required but we all agree that there are a number of editorial changes, clarifications and writing changes that need to be implemented before the manuscript becomes acceptable. Those are detailed in the reviews appended below. In addition, reviewer #1 suggested in points #1 and #2 an additional analysis of the ChIP peaks, which require no further experimentation, but may provide some additional insights; please try to perform this analysis (the experimental analysis suggested in point #3 by reviewer #1 was deemed to not be essential and does not need to be done).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Soluri et al. identified widespread changes in accessibility of cis-regulatory elements of patterning genes as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo undergoes gastrulation. Using a powerful quadruple mutant embryo and ATAC-seq, the authors demonstrate that the majority of these changes in accessibility are driven by developmental time and not dependent on patterning itself. They identify Odd-paired (Opa) motifs underlying regions that gain accessibility during gastrulation and using a combination of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq demonstrate that Opa has some defining features of pioneer factors. In general, this is a well-executed paper addressing an important and interesting developmental question.</p><p>1) It would be useful to compare the number of peaks identified without using the IDR analysis for comparison with other data sets that do not use a tagged allele and therefore cannot use an IP from wild type as control. If additional peaks are identified in this less stringent analysis are these peaks enriched for a centered Opa motif? This might suggest that the stringent methods used are only identifying the most robust Opa-binding sites. Given that the ATAC-seq analysis on the opa mutant is only focused on these regions some additional information could be gained from looking at potential additional sites.</p><p>2) Expanding the ChIP analysis is especially important given that the ATAC-seq analysis is centered only on those stringently identified Opa ChIP peaks. It would be important to more globally discuss the changes in accessibility identified in the opa mutant. These data appears to be all included in the comprehensive ATAC-seq peak list, but should be discussed. How many loci overall gain and lose accessibility? How many of these overlap the stringently called Opa peaks? The focus on stringently called Opa peaks is understandable, but to more broadly assess the impact of the loss of Opa on accessibility, it is important to report all identified changes and not just those that overlap direct targets. Are there motifs selectively enriched in the Opa-dependent vs. Opa-independent regions bound by Opa that might suggest factors that maintain accessibility in the absence of Opa? Is there an enrichment for any genomic regions (enhancers, promoters)?</p><p>3) While it is nicely demonstrated that Opa influences chromatin accessibility at sites where it is bound, the downstream effects of this accessibility remain largely unanalyzed. It could be useful to have some orthogonal analysis of the role of Opa on gene expression. Mutating the Opa-binding sites in the odd-late reporter and seeing if that is not expressed would be a useful demonstration of the direct role of Opa at this CRM. Alternatively, the global effect of Opa-mediated accessibility on gene expression could be analyzed by RNA-sequencing of either the opa mutant or the tub-opa overexpression.</p><p>4) The impact of this manuscript would be strengthened if the Introduction and Discussion were streamlined for clarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Soluri et al. address the important question of the dynamic acquisition of genome accessibility during key developmental transitions. Specifically they focus on the 1h period of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis, from ZGA to gastrulation, during which regulatory networks establish segmental identities across the A/P axis.</p><p>By performing single embryo ATAC-seq on carefully staged <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos prior to and at gastrulation, they identify a novel set of cis-regulatory elements that gain accessibility at later stages. Through an elegant genetic approach, where all A/P maternal cues are depleted to generate embryos with a uniform unique lineage, the authors were able to distinguish cis-regulatory elements that gain accessibility dynamically, specifically at late stages but in a patterning-dependent fashion.</p><p>The analysis of the sequences enriched in this category of ATAC-seq peaks revealed the over-representation of opa motif. While its role as a patterning gene during segmentation was already known, opa's requirement for genome accessibility is novel and nicely demonstrated by both loss and gain of function approaches in this manuscript. Overall I find the experiments presented in this work well-designed and the data of high quality. The manuscript is well written, and I particularly appreciated the tone of the last part of the Discussion where the limits of the study are well-stated.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>The WT and quintuple mutant embryos are compared at exact similar timing. Can the author comment on the developmental timing status of the quintuple mutant in terms of developmental delays?</p><p>Since a novel exciting finding of this study is the fact that opa acts as pioneer factor, it would be exciting to discuss a) the defining properties of a pioneer factor, and b) which of these properties opa seems to fulfil and which ones are still unclear. In such a discussion, a comparison with Zelda, which is the other pioneer factor shown to act as a quantitative temporal timer of gene expression, would be interesting. Additionally, the evidence that opa is able to engage its targets even in the context of nucleosomal DNA is currently absent. I agree that the bioinformatic analysis performed by the authors is consistent with this hypothesis; however, to avoid future confusion, it would be ideal to state it clearly in the Discussion.</p><p>Could the authors provide statistics: how many enhancers are analysed in Figure 3C, D and in Figure 1A? In Figure 3E, the number of peaks is indicated, but as an enhancer can exhibit multiple peaks, it's difficult to infer the number of CRMs considered.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– The manuscript starts by focusing on a small set of known CRM within the segmentation network. Could the authors give a number for the number of segmentation network enhancers for which they observe a dynamic change in chromatin accessibility? Would it be possible to extend this analysis to another type of enhancers, such as the DV patterning network?</p><p>– Since the ATAC-seq data have been performed in carefully staged single embryos, it would be interesting to extract more information than the small set of segmentation enhancers.</p><p>– Since the authors performed opa ChIP-seq, can they examine if there is a correlation between the number of opa binding sites and the timing of accessibility?</p><p>– Could the authors discuss similarities and differences with the pioneer factor Zelda, as several studies (Foo et al., 2014, Dufourt et al., 2018, Yamada et al., 2019) demonstrate its function as a quantitative timer?</p><p>– In Figure 6, the authors employ a gene expression analysis on a subset of opa-dependent CRM to support the conclusion that 'the primary function of opa is to modulate the temporally restricted accessibility of a subset of critical CRM'. Although not essential for this manuscript, it would be very exciting to build MS2 reporter transgenes for these critical CRM (for example odd-late) and examine the effect of adding extra opa sites to see if this is sufficient to elicit a premature expression (again like Zelda does, as shown in Yamada et al. and Dufourt et al.).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53916.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) It would be useful to compare the number of peaks identified without using the IDR analysis for comparison with other data sets that do not use a tagged allele and therefore cannot use an IP from wild type as control.

We chose to perform IDR analysis in order to report the most high-confidence peaks from the biological triplicate samples used in our ChIP-seq analysis. This is done primarily to employ a rigorous, systematic, data-driven thresholding approach to declaring a set of peaks. We view this as a feature, not a drawback of our analysis. We cannot stress this enough: if someone wants to reproduce these studies, the approach we have taken here is the best method we are aware of to ensure that what we report here is not only true in our hands but will likely also be observed in independent hands. However, we also understand the reviewer’s point of view: are we throwing away any information by being rigorous? Yes: in the “non-IDR” peaks there are additional regions that bind Opa and that contain a centered Opa motif (numbers below). They however tend to be of lower overall intensity and show larger variance in intensities between replicates than we feel confident in including with the set of peaks we have concentrated on. In practical terms: these are not the parts of the genome where one would want to really focus on studying Opa function. We have provided the raw data, as well as summaries of coverage (.wig formatted files) to GEO for any investigators interested in reproducing these analyses and focusing on this broader spectrum of Opa binding sites.</p><p>The IDR approach is to call peaks with MACS2 using an extremely high (i.e., lax) p-value cutoff (0.05) and then to use the reproducibility between replicates of peak score ranks within this list to determine which peaks are robust, reproducible Opa targets. MACS is very good at reporting any miniscule significant fold difference between control and experimental ChIP samples, and invariably the least robust of these called peaks are either noise that fell on the wrong side of the p-value cutoff, or really weak, noisy interactions that may not warrant a ton of attention. For the sake of transparency in this analysis, we have now indicated in the description of the results based on Opa ChIP the number of peaks we started with (see below) and what was left after IDR filtering. We have also added a pair of columns to the ATAC peaks list that annotates whether an ATAC peak overlaps with the lax or the IDR filtered peaks list.</p><p>The lax MACS2 peaks list on all replicates pooled together that was used as input for IDR analysis contains 3553 peaks, of which 879 passed the IDR filter (24.7%). We counted up the total number of Opa motifs in the entire genome (n = 69373, 80% match to the Opa PWM as reported by MEME). Of these, 2462 (3.5%) overlap with the entire peak list. Within this set of Opa motifs in all peaks, 949 (38.5%) motifs are present in the IDR peak list, and the remaining 1513 (61.5%) are in the non-IDR peaks. Therefore, IDR selects 24.7% of peaks but these have 38.5% of the available motifs, suggesting that IDR enriches for peaks with some subset of available motifs. The number of Opa motifs per peak ranges from 0 to 9 in the IDR peaks, and similarly from 0 to 8 in the non-IDR peaks. However, the number of peaks with zero Opa motifs is substantially different between these two peak classes. While only 28.9% of IDR peaks have zero Opa motifs, 55.3% of non-IDR peaks have zero Opa motifs. Therefore, IDR selects for peaks that are more likely to contain at least one Opa motif. For all peaks that contain at least one Opa motif, there is a similar average distance between the peak summit and the nearest Opa motif of 17.24 ± 3.90 bp (IDR) and 21.21 ± 3.31 bp (non IDR).</p><p>We feel that we have a strong rationale for the choice to use IDR for deciding on a set of ChIP-seq peaks to focus on and have therefore not re-analyzed our data by expanding our peaks list. To address the reviewer’s more general point, we have (in the response to point 2 below) included analysis of Opa loss- and gain-of-function effects over the entire ATAC-seq peaks list. This directly addresses the point of broadening the analysis of our analysis of the effects of Opa on the system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Expanding the ChIP analysis is especially important given that the ATAC-seq analysis is centered only on those stringently identified Opa ChIP peaks. It would be important to more globally discuss the changes in accessibility identified in the opa mutant. These data appears to be all included in the comprehensive ATAC-seq peak list, but should be discussed. How many loci overall gain and lose accessibility? How many of these overlap the stringently called Opa peaks? The focus on stringently called Opa peaks is understandable, but to more broadly assess the impact of the loss of Opa on accessibility, it is important to report all identified changes and not just those that overlap direct targets. Are there motifs selectively enriched in the Opa-dependent vs. Opa-independent regions bound by Opa that might suggest factors that maintain accessibility in the absence of Opa? Is there an enrichment for any genomic regions (enhancers, promoters)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is true: most of these data were included in the comprehensive ATAC peaks list but we have now added a paragraph to the text describing Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 2 that describes the overall effect of Opa vis a vis the complete set of peaks defined in the ATAC analysis. We have also added to the ATAC peak list columns containing logical vectors that allow for filtering on the basis of membership in the following categories: 1) intergenic; 2) promoter; 3) exon; 4) intron; 5) In ‘lax’ Opa ChIP-seq peaks list’ 6) In ‘IDR’ Opa ChIP-seq peaks list. The first four of these are for the purposes of asking about association of a peak with a particular genomic feature. The last two facilitate comparison between the ATAC peaks and the ChIP peaks and allow for the ‘broader’ analysis requested in point 1 above.</p><p>To summarize, we demonstrate that examination of the effect of Opa on accessibility in the broad ATAC peak list allows us to estimate the degree of indirect effects of opa on chromatin accessibility. We observe indirect opa-dependent gains and losses in accessibility by this analysis. None of the regions that gain accessibility overlap with any form of the Opa ChIP Peaks list, these are all indirect effects and there are no associated enriched motifs. ~44% of the regions that go down overlap with the stringent Opa ChIP peaks, and an additional ~20% of these regions are included in the lax Opa ChIP peaks. The remaining 36% of these regions are not represented in any form of the Opa ChIP peaks and have moderate enrichment for a long adenine-rich motif with no good match to the TF motif databases. (There is a poor match to a Zn-finger TF named <italic>jim</italic>, but <italic>jim</italic> is not expressed in early embryos, so this is not a good candidate factor). We feel this further supports the need to focus on direct targets of Opa in the analysis.</p><p>We now note that the regions that are directly regulated by Opa are enriched for intergenic regions and very strongly depleted for promoter regions, similar to the overall set of dynamic regions from the ATAC data (for symmetry, we have now also added this information to the text describing the overall ATAC dataset (Figure 4)). We have also incorporated Kvon/Stark’s Vienna Tile dataset of validated enhancers in both the ATAC and the Opa analysis to substantiate the functionality of ‘intergenic’ regions we have identified. Opa enriches for Vienna Tiles with the functional characterization of “PairRule”, which fits nicely with expectations. We note here, however, that the Vienna Tile dataset is incomplete in that it only represents about 14% of the noncoding genome. It is therefore good for finding enriched enhancer classes but is likely rife with false negatives. We have carefully worded our interpretation of the enrichment analysis of Vienna Tiles to ensure we aren’t making conclusions based on the lack of enrichment for a particular class.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While it is nicely demonstrated that Opa influences chromatin accessibility at sites where it is bound, the downstream effects of this accessibility remain largely unanalyzed. It could be useful to have some orthogonal analysis of the role of Opa on gene expression. Mutating the Opa-binding sites in the odd-late reporter and seeing if that is not expressed would be a useful demonstration of the direct role of Opa at this CRM. Alternatively, the global effect of Opa-mediated accessibility on gene expression could be analyzed by RNA-sequencing of either the opa mutant or the tub-opa overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We are currently performing orthogonal analysis of the role of Opa on gene expression as part of several follow-up studies to this work which will be reported separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The impact of this manuscript would be strengthened if the Introduction and Discussion were streamlined for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the Introduction and Discussion (primarily the Discussion) to streamline for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] General comments:</p><p>The WT and quintuple mutant embryos are compared at exact similar timing. Can the author comment on the developmental timing status of the quintuple mutant in terms of developmental delays?</p></disp-quote><p>We comment here in depth and include a summary note in the manuscript.</p><p>Depending on how you want to think about it, this is a complicated question, namely, “What controls the timing of development, especially when you eliminate (or flatten) embryonic patterning cues.” And rather than just hand-wave here, we wanted to try to get some numbers. Without going too far off the philosophical deep end, we reasoned that the early timepoint should be synchronous given that wild-type and “patternless” mutants both complete the maternally-controlled phase of development with the same number of cell divisions, which themselves proceed with normal cell cycle periods, at least NC11-13 which we can easily observe. Thereafter, however, many of the zygotic ‘mileposts’ whereby the passage of time could be measured are themselves affected by the mutant phenotype. One patterning-independent marker of time is the process of cellularization, and this process completes at a morphological level in “patternless” mutants with indistinguishable kinetics from wild-type. We note that the major zygotic cellularization genes are all included in the set of regions that lose accessibility uniformly in the late timepoint (i.e., this process is equivalent between genotypes).</p><p>After cellularization, a wild-type embryo gastrulates, undergoing tremendous morphological changes over a 15-20 minute period. In contrast, the “patternless” mutants remain as an epithelial monolayer for approximately 9-10 hours before initiating some kind of morphological transformation that we have not yet examined carefully. Wild-type and mutant embryos therefore diverge morphologically at the moment of gastrulation. However, during gastrulation in a wild-type embryo, zygotic mitoses resume in distinct mitotic domains that are themselves clock-like in that they always occur in the same order and in the same place, and that the timing of these domains is linked to spatially restricted patterning events (Foe V.E., Development 1989; Edgar B.A. and O’Farrell, P.H., Cell 1989; Momen-Roknabadi, A., et al., Cell Reports2016). We noticed in the course of these experiments that although “patternless” mutants remain as an epithelial monolayer, they continue to perform metasynchronous mitotic divisions albeit over much longer periods than the syncytial divisions. We do not understand the mechanistic basis for these additional divisions in the mutant, but they may represent continual adherence to the biological timing mechanisms that dictate the precise timing of zygotic mitotic domains. Based on V. Foe’s mitotic domain maps, and our limited expression profiling of mutants (e.g., Figure 2), we predicted that the mutant embryos would be fated to contribute to mitotic domain 13, which should initiate mitosis by 86 minutes after the start of NC14 (albeit at 25°C). We live-imaged 5 “patternless” mutant embryos expressing Histone RFP under the confocal at an approximate temperature of 21°C. Of these, three initiated mitosis before NC14+120’ (range 92’-119’). We lost patience around 120’ with the other two embryos, which did not divide by this time. This suggests that by 120 minutes post NC14, some temporal heterogeneity has arisen in the mutant embryos, with some embryos sticking somewhat closely to the expected zygotic mitotic clock, albeit with a broader variance (&gt;&gt;20’) than would be expected in a wild-type sample.</p><p>To generate an additional estimator of synchrony between wild-type and “patternless” mutant embryos, we imaged the onset of posterior <italic>wingless</italic> expression using a <italic>wg-MS2</italic> CRISPR allele (kindly provided by Hernan Garcia, Cal Berkeley). We measure the onset of posterior <italic>wg</italic> expression at 36.0 ± 1.73 minutes in wild-type, and at 36.7 ± 1.89 minutes in “patternless” mutants (n = 3 per genotype, <italic>p</italic> = 0.67, t-test). If we instead score the timepoint at which the posterior <italic>wg</italic> expression domain is fully ‘on’, this occurs at 42.3 ± 2.25 minutes in wild-type, and 46.17 ± 6.33 minutes in mutants (n = 3 per genotype, <italic>p =</italic> 0.57, t-test). These measurements suggest that at earlier timepoints corresponding to the period in which we performed our ATAC experiments, timing between the two genotypes is more synchronous.</p><p>Finally, we point out that our NC14+72’ timepoint replicates have similarly clustered distributions within the PCA analysis suggesting that we have measured a reproducible, similarly variant event in each genotype. We also do identify a substantial number of genomic regions that undergo changes in accessibility (gains or losses) in both genotypes, and that motif enrichment supports the idea that these regions are controlled by uniformly-expressed factors. We feel that although the broader question is interesting of whether the passage of time in a multiply mutant embryo is the same as in wild type, this one-hour period in which we have chosen to perform our measurements remains synchronous enough between the two genotypes that we are confident in our delineation of patterning-dependent and -independent events.</p><p>A study of this broader question of timing in the absence of patterning inputs will be performed elsewhere. However, we have added a brief note to the manuscript when the mutants are first introduced that we are confident wild-type and mutant embryos develop at similar rates and remain comparable until at least early gastrula stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since a novel exciting finding of this study is the fact that opa acts as pioneer factor, it would be exciting to discuss a) the defining properties of a pioneer factor, and b) which of these properties opa seems to fulfil and which ones are still unclear.

Overall, in terms of the fraction of directly-bound sites, Opa and Zld have a similar effect on chromatin accessibility. Schulz et al., 2015 determines that loss of zelda results in ~28% of sites losing accessibility. This is comparable to the ~30% we observe for loss of Opa. We have also framed this within the discussion of what makes a pioneer a pioneer: although we haven’t directly demonstrated binding of Opa to a nucleosome-occluded motif, our measurements are consistent with this possibility, and we point out that additional work needs to be done on this for a definitive answer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors provide statistics: how many enhancers are analysed in Figure 3C, D and in Figure 1A?

See the response to the first specific comment just below for numbers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– The manuscript starts by focusing on a small set of known CRM within the segmentation network. Could the authors give a number for the number of segmentation network enhancers for which they observe a dynamic change in chromatin accessibility? Would it be possible to extend this analysis to another type of enhancers, such as the D/V patterning network?</p></disp-quote><p>Our list of segmentation network enhancers derived from the Redfly database is 111 sites long. These numbers were in the original submission when we discuss patterning-dependence within this network: 18 gap gene enhancers, 60 pair-rule enhancers, and 33 segment polarity enhancers. For clarity, we have now added to the text accompanying Figure 1 the following additional tabulations: 5/18 (27.8%) gap gene enhancers, 17/60 (28.3%) pair-rule enhancers, and 11/33 (33.3%) segmentation polarity enhancers change accessibility over time. Overall 29.8% of enhancers in this network undergo a statistically-significant change in accessibility over time.</p><p>We have not extended this analysis to the D/V network because here we chose to use the lateralizing allele of Toll (<italic>RM9</italic>), which retains some amount of Dorsal expression (cited in the text). If Dorsal influences accessibility patterns, this activity may remain intact in these <italic>Tl</italic> mutants, and we would therefore underestimate the contribution of Dorsal to accessibility. In a future study, we will be modulating D/V fates to address this question directly. To this end, however, we included in the original submission a section in the Discussion dedicated to the question of whether accessibility needs to be modulated along the D/V axis by maternal factors. We predict that it does not, at least early on. Patterning along the A/P axis is determined by single genes with multiple stripes at all levels of network organization, and we observed (Hannon, 2017) that one function of Bicoid is to pioneer anterior-domain specific enhancers of <italic>knirps</italic> and <italic>giant</italic>, as well as <italic>eve1</italic> and a slew of the “head gap genes” amongst others. Early D/V genes, on the other hand activate in single domains along the D/V axis and may therefore not require conditional accessibility states to generate sufficient spatial expression pattern complexity. The definitive test will be to compare accessibility in an allelic series of <italic>Tl</italic> mutants. It remains possible, however, that changes in accessibility accompany cell lineage commitment and distinguish, for instance, mesoderm, neurectoderm, and ectodermal trajectories. In support of these observations, the single-cell ATAC study of record (Cusanovich) identified several distinct early clusters of cells distinguished along the A/P axis, but the only D/V-distinct clusters arose in more advanced stages and delineated mesodermal and neurectodermal signatures.</p><p>To extend our observations, we have now compared our list of differentially-accessible regions with the Kvon/Stark set of experimentally validated enhancer elements (Vienna Tiles). These results estimate which additional systems may show high overrepresentation within our different groupings of dynamic regions. As discussed in the response below, we have tried to carefully balance the information overload of a genomics study with extracting meaningful information about embryonic development. Hence, we have maintained the central focus on the segmentation network, but have expanded the scope of the analysis to lend support to the idea that this phenomenon isn’t necessarily just limited to this network.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Since the ATAC-seq data have been performed in carefully staged single embryos, it would be interesting to extract more information than the small set of segmentation enhancers.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to focus on the segmentation enhancers because they, for the most part, represent a comprehensive GRN that would be definitively disrupted with our genetic approach. By focusing on a comprehensive network, we feel that this focuses the genomic analysis back on to the embryo and away from more abstract heat maps, gene sets, and p-values. We have provided the raw and processed data, as well as comprehensively annotated peaks lists (with outputs of differential enrichment tests) for other investigators to query, and certainly we have not exhausted the analytic possibilities for this dataset.</p><p>One less-well characterized presumptive GRN would be the one that drives early posterior endodermal development in the fly. In our experiments, we have identified likely a set of putative CRMs that operate within this lineage in the group of peaks that have enhanced accessibility in the mutant compared with wild-type. We now highlight these regions in the Results section associated with Figure 4, and we explicitly discuss this group in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Since the authors performed opa ChIP-seq, can they examine if there is a correlation between the number of opa binding sites and the timing of accessibility?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this in the following way: we counted the number of Opa motifs (at 80% match to the PWM reported by the MEME analysis associated with the Opa ChIP peaks) over the set of ChIP peaks. Overall, an Opa ChIP peak contains between 0 and 9 Opa motifs (mean = 1.08). The set of direct Opa targets that require Opa for accessibility have between 0 and 9 motifs (mean = 1.32). In contrast, the set of direct Opa targets that do not require Opa for chromatin accessibility have between 0 and 5 motifs (mean = 0.95). This indicates that Opa-dependent regions have on average a</p><p>higher number of Opa motifs than Opa-independent regions, although the magnitude of this difference strikes us as small. The difference between these values is statistically significant by both a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (<italic>p =</italic> 4.026e-6), as well as a one-tailed permutation test on the difference between the mean Opa motif number in proportional randomly selected groups (1e+7 trials, <italic>p =</italic> 2e-7). We have reported this distribution of motifs across the Opa-dependent and -independent groups, the average number of motifs between groups, and the p-value of the permutation test. We have also appended a column to both the Opa ChIP peaks, as well as the ATAC peaks reporting the number of Opa motifs within each peak region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Could the authors discuss similarities and differences with the pioneer factor Zelda, as several studies (Foo et al., 2014, Dufourt et al., 2018, Yamada et al., 2019) demonstrate its function as a quantitative timer?</p></disp-quote><p>We have done this in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 6, the authors employ a gene expression analysis on a subset of opa-dependent CRM to support the conclusion that 'the primary function of opa is to modulate the temporally restricted accessibility of a subset of critical CRM'. Although not essential for this manuscript, it would be very exciting to build MS2 reporter transgenes for these critical CRM (for example odd-late) and examine the effect of adding extra opa sites to see if this is sufficient to elicit a premature expression (again like Zelda does, as shown in Yamada et al. and Dufourt et al.).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be an interesting analysis and thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have gotten as far as co-imaging Opa protein expression and MS2 reporters of late pair-rule loci such as <italic>eve-late</italic> and <italic>odd-late</italic>. We have not yet begun the intensive testing of several mechanistic hypotheses related to enhancer architecture and Opa function such as the one suggested above. This overall represents a significant body of work that will be addressed in a future study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
