severe disabilities and early mortality for which there are no available treatments. The goal of this study is to identify new therapeutic targets for RYR1-RMs. To accomplish this, we developed a discovery pipeline using nematode, zebrafish, and mammalian cell models. We first performed large-scale drug screens in <italic>C. elegans</italic> which uncovered 74 hits. Targeted testing in zebrafish yielded positive results for two p38 inhibitors. Using mouse myotubes, we found that either pharmacological inhibition or siRNA silencing of p38 impaired caffeine-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from wild type cells while promoting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in <italic>Ryr1</italic> knockout cells. Lastly, we demonstrated that p38 inhibition blunts the aberrant temperature-dependent increase in resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> in myotubes from an RYR1-RM mouse model. This unique platform for RYR1-RM therapy development is potentially applicable to a broad range of neuromuscular disorders.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscle cells have storage compartments stuffed full of calcium, which they release to trigger a contraction. This process depends on a channel-shaped protein called the ryanodine receptor, or RYR1 for short. When RYR1 is activated, it releases calcium from storage, which floods the muscle cell. Mutations in the gene that codes for RYR1 in humans cause a group of rare diseases called RYR1-related myopathies. The mutations change calcium release in muscle cells, which can make movement difficult, and make it hard for people to breathe. At the moment, RYR1 myopathies have no treatment.</p><p>It is possible that repurposing existing drugs could benefit people with RYR1-related myopathies, but trialing treatments takes time. The fastest and cheapest way to test whether compounds might be effective is to try them on very simple animals, like nematode worms. But even though worms and humans share certain genes, treatments that work for worms do not always work for humans. Luckily, it is sometimes possible to test whether compounds might be effective by trying them out on complex mammals, like mice. Unfortunately, these experiments are slow and expensive. A compromise involves testing on animals such as zebrafish. So far, none of these methods has been successful in discovering treatments for RYR1-related myopathies.</p><p>To maximize the strengths of each animal model, Volpatti et al. combined them, developing a fast and powerful way to test new drugs. The first step is an automated screening process that trials thousands of chemicals on nematode worms. This takes just two weeks. The second step is to group the best treatments according to their chemical similarities and test them again in zebrafish. This takes a month. The third and final stage is to test promising chemicals from the zebrafish in mouse muscle cells. Of the thousands of compounds tested here, one group of chemicals stood out – treatments that block the activity of a protein called p38. Volpatti et al. found that blocking the p38 protein, either with drugs or by inactivating the gene that codes for it, changed muscle calcium release. This suggests p38 blockers may have potential as a treatment for RYR1-related myopathies in mammals.</p><p>Using three types of animal to test new drugs maximizes the benefits of each model. This type of pipeline could identify new treatments, not just for RYR1-related myopathies, but for other diseases that involve genes or proteins that are similar across species. For RYR1-related myopathies specifically, the next step is to test p38 blocking treatments in mice. This could reveal whether the treatments have the potential to improve symptoms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RYR1</kwd><kwd>myopathy</kwd><kwd>drug screen</kwd><kwd>excitation contraction coupling</kwd><kwd>animal models</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005202</institution-id><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dirksen</surname><given-names>Robert T</given-names></name><name><surname>Dowling</surname><given-names>James J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010474</institution-id><institution>RYR-1 Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dirksen</surname><given-names>Robert T</given-names></name><name><surname>Dowling</surname><given-names>James J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>363863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dirksen</surname><given-names>Robert T</given-names></name><name><surname>Dowling</surname><given-names>James J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A multi-species chemical screening platform reveals a conserved role for p38 inhibition in modulating ryanodine receptor-related phenotypes and is adaptable to a range of neuromuscular disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ryanodine receptor type I (RyR1) is a calcium release channel located in the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in skeletal muscle. During excitation-contraction coupling (ECC), RyR1 is activated by the voltage sensing L-type calcium channel dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), located in the transverse tubule (T-tubule) membrane. Together, the T-tubule and two adjacent SR terminal cisternae form a junctional membrane unit referred to as the triad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jungbluth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dowling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jungbluth et al., 2018</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>RYR1</italic> gene are the most common cause of non-dystrophic muscle disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colombo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonorazky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jungbluth et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations are associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes, collectively referred to as RYR1-related myopathies (RYR1-RM), that can include wheelchair and ventilator dependence, and dynamic symptoms such as exercise induced myalgias, heat stroke, and malignant hyperthermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amburgey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Snoeck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jungbluth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matthews et al., 2018</xref>). Despite their relatively high prevalence and associated morbidities, there are currently no approved pharmacological therapies for patients with RYR1-RM.</p><p>Much of what is known about the function of RyR1 and the impact of its mutations on skeletal muscle comes from animal models. Well described recessive models of RYR1-RM include the <italic>C. elegans unc-68</italic> mutant (null mutant with impaired motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maryon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maryon et al., 1998</xref>]), the <italic>relatively relaxed</italic> zebrafish (loss of function <italic>ryr1b</italic> mutant with impaired motility and early death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirata et al., 2007</xref>), and the ‘dyspedic’ <italic>Ryr1</italic> null mouse (perinatal lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buck et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avila and Dirksen, 2000</xref>]). In addition, two compound heterozygous mouse models of recessive RYR1-RM were with recently generated and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elbaz et al., 2019</xref>). These models are complimented by ‘knock-in’ mutants in mice that mirror specific dominant human mutations, including the I4895T mutant (associated with central core disease and referred to as the IT model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zvaritch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zvaritch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), the R163C mutant (associated with malignant hyperthermia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2006</xref>), and the Y522S mutant (associated with malignant hyperthermia and referred to as the YS mouse) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chelu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lanner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yarotskyy et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous work using these models identified potential therapeutic targets for RYR1-RM (for a comprehensive review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lawal et al., 2018</xref>) including anti-oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dowling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Michelucci et al., 2017</xref>), ER stress modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), and chemicals that influence the binding of RyR1 to modifying partners (e.g. S107, which promotes RyR1/calstabin1 interaction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lehnart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2011</xref>). However, as of yet none of these targets has successfully translated to patients, though <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine was tested in a recently completed clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT02362425), where it failed to achieve its primary endpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Todd et al., 2020</xref>). There is thus a critical need to identify and develop new treatment strategies.</p><p>With the goal of identifying new therapies for RYR1-RM, we set out to establish a novel multi-species translational pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This pipeline is based on the functional conservation of RyR1 across many species, and takes advantage of specific attributes of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (ability to rapidly screen thousands of compounds), zebrafish (large-scale testing in a vertebrate model), and mammalian cell lines (translatability to humans). We screened several thousand compounds, and discovered that p38 inhibition modifies RyR1 phenotypes in all three systems. Our study identifies a new potential therapeutic strategy for RYR1-RM, outlines the utility of multi-species drug discovery, and lays the groundwork for future similar screens for other neuromuscular disorders.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of our multi-species translational pipeline aimed at identifying potential therapeutic targets for RYR1-RM.</title><p>The pipeline involved screening <italic>C. elegans</italic> and zebrafish with thousands of compounds for suppressors of RYR1 mutant phenotypes, followed by further characterization in zebrafish and evaluation in mammalian cell lines.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52946-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Large-scale chemical screen in <italic>C. elegans </italic>identifies 74 unc-68 suppressors</title><p>We performed a drug screen using the <italic>unc-68</italic>(<italic>r1162</italic>) <italic>C. elegans</italic> model of RYR1-RM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This model has a deletion in the worm ryanodine receptor, lacks RyR protein expression by western blot, and manifests an <italic>unc-68</italic> null phenotype characterized by an ‘uncoordinated’ (<italic>unc</italic>) movement phenotype, defective pharyngeal pumping, impaired calcium regulation, and reduced fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maryon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maryon et al., 1998</xref>). We first considered using a liquid-based movement assay (i.e., the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ‘thrashing assay’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maryon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maryon et al., 1998</xref>) as the basis for our drug screen because <italic>unc-68</italic> mutants thrash at lower rates than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but found that automatable methods for this assay were sufficiently variable to prevent use in a screen of thousands of compounds. Instead, we developed a sensitized screen based on our observation that nemadipine-A, an inhibitor of the dihydropyridine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwok et al., 2006</xref>), induces developmental growth arrest in <italic>unc-68</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Specifically, <italic>unc-68</italic> worms exposed to 25 μM nemadipine-A arrest at the L1-L3 larval stage, while the majority of wild type N2 strain treated with nemadipine-A have either normal development or, in a small percentage, arrest at the L4 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on this, we screened for chemicals that could overcome this growth arrest by counting the number of L4 and adult stage worms after six days of exposure to both nemadipine-A and chemical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Chemical screen finds that p38 MAPK inhibition suppresses the nemadipine-A growth arrest of <italic>unc-68</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of our screen methodology showing the expected growth arrest phenotype of <italic>unc-68</italic> worms exposed to 25 μM nemadipine after 6 days of exposure and the expected phenotype of a chemical that suppresses this growth arrest.

We also screened 880 kinase inhibitors (GlaxoSmithKline Published Kinase Inhibitor Set) at 60 μM. Lastly, we screened 1280 drugs from the US Drug Collection of clinical trial stage compounds at 60 μM (MicroSource Discovery Systems). The concentration used for the latter two libraries was based on previous <italic>C. elegans</italic> screens performed in the 25–60 μM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwok et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burns et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otten et al., 2018</xref>). This concentration range is used to overcome the poor bioaccumulation of exogenous compounds in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burns et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The primary screen found 278 chemical conditions out of 3700 (~7.5%) that contained at least one L4 or adult worm in duplicate wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, 62 single DMSO vehicle control wells out of 760 (~8.2%) and 360 single experimental wells out of 7400 (~4.9%) also contained at least one <italic>unc-68</italic> mutant that reached the L4 or adult stage, which we collectively refer to as ‘random escapees’. Based on this, we concluded that many of the 278 chemicals may potentially be false positives. We prioritized 145 of the 278 chemicals for re-testing because they demonstrated in duplicate wells the most complete (i.e. highest number of L4 and adult) suppression the phenotype.</p><p>Of note, we only counted the number of ‘rescued’ worms (L4 and adult) per well, and did not count the exact number of L1-L3 worms in each well. Precise counts would have allowed us to calculate the true proportion of worms which escaped growth suppression and thus more accurately determine which chemicals promoted statistically meaningful growth arrest rescue values as compared to random escapee wells. We instead addressed this by performing a post-hoc analysis using an assumption of a standard number of worms plated in each well (<italic>n</italic> = 20, where realistically this number ranged from 15 to 25). We estimated the % arrest based on this assumption, using a formula where the number of L1-L3 larvae = 20 –(true count of L4-adult) and found that 142 of the original 278 chemical wells were statistically different from random escapee wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). Given that 88% of those identified as statistically significant were in our prioritization group of 145, this provided us with confidence that they merited additional examination.</p><p>We re-tested the 145 chemicals in duplicate and found that 74 reproducibly suppressed the nemadipine-A-induced growth suppression of <italic>unc-68</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Among these 74 ‘hits’, we identified five wactives and seven non-wactives, 44 kinase inhibitors, and 18 compounds from the MicroSource library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For several of the strongest suppressors, we performed dose-response analyses to confirm the effect of suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>).</p><p>Many of the chemicals in our libraries have overlapping targets and/or functions (e.g. there are several EGFR inhibitors in the kinase library and several steroid hormones in the US Drug Collection). Therefore, we reasoned that hits that are overrepresented among groups of structurally and/or functionally related chemicals should be prioritized for further testing in zebrafish. To determine enrichment based on structural similarity, we compared the chemical fingerprints of the hits with those of the chemicals in each library by hierarchical clustering of their Tanimoto scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burns et al., 2015</xref>). This method shows how structurally similar chemicals cluster with one another.</p><p>Using this methodology, we found that p38 inhibitors were significantly overrepresented (**p=0.0022, Fisher’s exact test) when considering the total number of p38 inhibitors in the kinase inhibitor library. Interestingly, structurally dissimilar p38 inhibitors suppressed the phenotype (clusters 5, 6, 16, and 19 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that inhibition of their common target was responsible for the activity. We then applied the same post-hoc analysis to the re-tested molecules as we did with the primary screen to visualize changes in developmental stage distribution after chemical treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B–G</xref>). As shown, p38 inhibitors were among the strongest suppressors identified from the inhibitor set. Finally, we validated p38 as a target by knocking down the p38 MAPK orthologs <italic>pmk-1</italic>, <italic>pmk-2</italic>, <italic>pmk-3</italic> alone and in combination, and we observed a modest increase in the proportion of <italic>unc-6</italic>8 mutants that escaped nemadipine-A induced growth arrest with each of the four conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, from the 44 hits in the kinase library we found that EGFR, PERK, and PLK1 inhibitors were overrepresented (**p=0.0060, *p=0.0109, *p=0.0326, respectively). Multiple GSK3 (n = 9) and PI3K (n = 3) inhibitors also strongly suppressed the phenotype, but these were not statistically overrepresented (p=0.4093 and p=0.1027, respectively). Among the 18 positive hits from the MicroSource library, several chemical classes were overrepresented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>): riboflavins (***p=0.0002), surfactants (***p=0.0002), benzophenones (**p=0.0018), anthracenes (*p=0.0279), salicylates (*p=0.0416), and tricyclic antihistamines (*p=0.0416). Interestingly, two DHPR inhibitors out of nine present in the library (**p=0.0063) were identified as suppressors of the growth arrest induced by nemadipine-A, itself a DHPR inhibitor. This may reflect competition for receptor binding which diminishes the effect of nemadipine-A, or perhaps a higher effective concentration which becomes agonistic to the receptor. Of note, riboflavin and riboflavin 5-phosphate sodium both strongly suppressed growth arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A,E</xref>) and they appear to be structurally distinct from every other chemical in the US Drug Collection (cluster 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Similarly, thiostrepton suppressed growth arrest strongly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E</xref>), is a structurally unique molecule and overrepresented among the 18 hits (*p=0.0141). Altogether, the overrepresented groups of chemicals and the structurally unique molecules were prioritized for follow-up testing in <italic>ryr1b</italic> mutant zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Large-scale chemical screen in <italic>ryr1</italic> zebrafish</title><p>In parallel, we performed a screen in a zebrafish model of RYR1-RM.

Using commercially available siRNA we achieved roughly 50–80% knockdown of p38 MAPK targets as compared to non-targeting negative control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In <italic>Ryr1</italic> KO C2C12 cells, siRNA knockdown of <italic>Mapk11</italic> (p38β) promoted increased caffeine-induced calcium release in KO cells versus negative control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Mapk14</italic> (p38α) and <italic>Mapk12</italic> (p38γ) also increased calcium release in <italic>Ryr1</italic> KO myotubes but to a lesser degree. These data thus suggest that in KO C2C12 cells, p38 inhibition (either via chemical or genetic inhibition) is able to promote intracellular calcium release independent of RyR1. This is consistent with the ability of p38 inhibitors and RNAi to suppress the <italic>unc-68</italic> (i.e. RyR1 null) phenotype in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Unlike with SB203580 or SB202190 treatment, siRNA knockdown of p38 isoforms did not impair Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), perhaps suggesting that inhibition may be partially caused by off-target effects of the chemicals. Alternatively, this may instead be a reflection of the incomplete p38 knockdown we achieved with siRNA, or could reflect siRNA toxicity, as caffeine-induced calcium release from WT cells was lower with control siRNA treatment when compared to DMSO-treated conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SB203580 abrogates the temperature-dependent increase in resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> in YS myotubes</title><p>The fact that p38 chemical inhibitors negatively modulate swim behavior in WT zebrafish and caffeine-induced calcium release in C2C12 cells opens the possibility that they may serve as modifiers of phenotypes related to RyR1 hyperexcitability. To test this, we examined calcium dynamics in myotubes from the YS mouse model of RYR1-RM. The YS model contains a point mutation analogous to the Y522S mutation found in patients with malignant hyperthermia and central core pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Quane et al., 1994</xref>). The YS mutation enhances both the sensitivity of RyR1 to activators (e.g. DHPR, caffeine, 4-chloro-<italic>m</italic>-cresol) and the temperature-dependence of RyR1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak, alterations that underlie the MH susceptibility and exertional heat stroke phenotypes of these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chelu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lanner et al., 2012</xref>). We examined if the temperature dependent increase in resting myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in YS myotubes was abrogated by the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Overnight incubation of YS myotubes with 10 μM SB203580 significantly reduced the temperature-dependent increase in resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> observed in YS myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we developed a multi-system pipeline for drug discovery and development for RYR1-RM. Using this platform, we were able to screen several thousand compounds and test their efficacy across multiple species. We identified p38 inhibitors as a new class of potential modifiers of RyR1 signaling. This platform can be applied to new compounds that may improve RYR1-RM phenotypes, as well as for additional diseases with suitable animal models.</p><p>The strengths of our pipeline include the rapidity with which we are able to screen drugs and the potential for increased translatability in drugs that positively modify a diverse group of in vivo models. In terms of speed, the initial screen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> was completed within two weeks, while the large-scale screen in zebrafish was accomplished in one month. While this does not approach the speed and scale of cell culture screens, it is fast and efficient and importantly is done in vivo using outcome measures that are relatable to human disease phenotypes. It would additionally be possible to add a cell culture based screen into the pipeline as a pre-screen or in parallel with the animal model testing. For example, studies for RyR1 functional interactors are underway using novel calcium indicators such as SERCaMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henderson et al., 2014</xref>); these indicators may prove ideal for screens in disease relevant cell models. Recently, a high-throughput screen was performed with HEK293 cells that successfully identified novel inhibitors of RyR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>), supporting the potential utility of a cell-based screen in identifying modifiers of mutant RyR1 activity.</p><p>In terms of translatability, it is difficult to say whether a multi-organism strategy is superior to other approaches and/or more likely to yield targets that will work in humans. This is because, at present, no drugs have successfully been translated to patients with RYR1-RM. However, there is reason to speculate that a compound that can modify phenotype(s) associated with dysfunction of a gene in these diverse evolutionary settings may promote improvement in a more universal way.</p><p>Most relevant to future clinical intervention of RYR1-RM, our study identifies p38 inhibition as a modifier of RYR1-related phenotypes in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and murine myotubes. The potential translational value of this observation awaits additional study, including in vivo testing in newly developed mouse models of RYR1-RM (see below). Interestingly, it was shown recently that combined treatment of <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine (NAC) and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 leads to robust expansion of myogenic satellite cell populations in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">L'honoré et al., 2018</xref>). This is noteworthy because NAC has been shown to reduce aberrant oxidative stress and improve phenotypes of preclinical RYR1-RM models (zebrafish and patient cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dowling et al., 2012</xref>). Based on these data, NAC was recently tested via clinical trial in RYR1-RM patients, where a non-significant trend toward improvement was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Todd et al., 2020</xref>). These observations open the prospective of polytherapy as a potential treatment strategy. Future work will be needed to establish the interplay between p38 inhibition and anti-oxidant therapy, both in the setting of normal myogenesis and with mutation in <italic>RYR1</italic>, and likely in the whole animal setting.</p><p>As p38 inhibition emerged as the most promising hit from our study, we considered potential mechanisms of action. Our observation of increased caffeine-induced intracellular calcium release in <italic>Ryr1</italic> KO C2C12 cells suggesting that p38 inhibition modulates non-RyR1 calcium channels. In the developing myotube, these could include RyR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tarroni et al., 1997</xref>), the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R), which has been shown to mediate calcium release in a caffeine-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2010</xref>), or the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) system mediated by STIM1/ORAI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soboloff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endo et al., 2015</xref>). If we hypothesize a similar mechanism of action in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and C2C12 cells, this would exclude RyR3 activation, as there is only a single RyR in <italic>C. elegans</italic> encoded by <italic>unc-68</italic>. Alternatively, both IP<sub>3</sub>R and the SOCE machinery are present in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and enhanced calcium release from either of these sources provides a plausible explanation for our data. Interestingly, a previous study in endothelial cells showed that p38 inhibition (chemical and siRNA mediated) increased calcium entry via SOCE activation through a mechanism of blocking STIM1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sundivakkam et al., 2013</xref>). Future investigation, beyond the scope of this manuscript, is required to parse out the specific mechanisms related to the improvement seen with p38 inhibition.</p><p>An alternative explanation for some of our positive hits, is that they functioned by activating the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and/or by overcoming its inhibition by nemadipine-A. This would be consistent with the observation that gain-of-function mutations in <italic>egl-19</italic>, the<italic>C. elegans</italic>homolog of DHPR, suppress the effects of nemadipine-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwok et al., 2006</xref>) This mechanism could also explain the observed benefit of p38 inhibition in C2C12 myotubes, as DHPR has previously been shown to interact with and activated by RyR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sheridan et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Of note, our data indicates that p38 chemical inhibitors may alter RyR1-mediated calcium dynamics in wild type zebrafish, wild type C2C12 cells, and YS mouse myotubes. Whether this is directly through p38 inhibition, or instead through other pathways, is not completely clear, as these chemicals may have off-target effects and our siRNA knockdown of p38 isoforms in wild type C2C12 cells did not replicate these effects. However, if we assume direct inhibition on the p38 pathway, plausible mechanisms include direct action on RyR1 (which has several phosphorylation sites known to impact its calcium release activity) or else modulation of RyR1 regulators (such as FKBP12, junctin or calsequestrin, proteins which bind to RyR1 and influence its channel function). To our knowledge, there is no evidence currently showing direct modulation of RyR1 phosphorylation status by the p38 pathway, nor any data supporting action on known RyR1 modifiers.</p><p>One shortcoming of our study is the relative lack of positive hits in the zebrafish. This may reflect the specific nature of our primary outcome measure in fish, which is focused on improving swimming locomotion. Locomotion is a complex trait that may be difficult to modify, especially in the double mutant fish which are completely paralyzed. We have observed mixed results with this outcome measure in other zebrafish myopathy models, where we have successfully identified chemicals that rescue the swimming defect in <italic>mtm1</italic> mutant zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sabha et al., 2016</xref>), meanwhile we found no positive hits in <italic>neb</italic> deficient zebrafish which show complete paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>). As discussed below, we believe development of new models that do not completely lack RyR1 expression and that more closely mirror human mutations will overcome this limitation in the future.</p><p>One potential explanation for why we identified hits in <italic>C. elegans</italic> but not zebrafish is that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> screen was based on a developmental phenotype, and it is very plausible that alternative calcium pathways (e.g. DHPR, SOCE and/or IP3 receptor) are better able to compensate for developmental arrest as opposed to locomotor behavior, which is more specifically related to mature skeletal muscle function and likely has a more absolute requirement for RyR1-dependent ECC. This would be consistent with our positive results in our cell studies as well, which reflect immature/developing myotubes that may more readily utilize other calcium release pathways.</p><p>Another consideration of our study is that our screens were performed on models that completely lack expression of RyR1. There are currently no human patients with bi-allelic null mutations, and thus our models do not accurately mirror the human disease. In addition, our screens may miss chemicals that positively modulate mutant RyR1 channels but that cannot compensate for its complete loss. One of our primary future directions is therefore to develop new models of RYR1-RM that are better suited to drug discovery and for subsequent testing in mammals. In this vein, there are very recent publications detailing new recessive RYR1-RM mouse models including a p.G2435R mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lopez et al., 2018</xref>), a p.A4329D/p.Q1970fsX16 compound heterozygote model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elbaz et al., 2019</xref>), and a p.T4706M/indel compound heterozygote model generated by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennan et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, seven RYR1-RM equivalent mutations in <italic>unc-68</italic> were modeled by transgenic overexpression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and these mutants exhibited hypersensitivity to caffeine and the malignant hyperthermia triggering agent halothane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baines et al., 2017</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We established a unique ‘multi species’ pipeline for drug discovery for RYR1-RM.

A total of 40 μL of NEM+NGM+HB101 was dispensed into each well of a 96-well plate, and 300 nL of chemical dissolved in DMSO was pinned into the wells using a 96-well pinning tool (V and P Scientific). At Day 0, approximately 20 synchronized first larval-stage (L1), <italic>unc-68</italic>(<italic>r1162</italic>) (TR2171) worms obtained from an embryo preparation were added to each well in 10 μL of M9 buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burns et al., 2015</xref>). The <italic>unc-68(r1162)</italic> strain TR2171 was selected for screening because its growth rate was comparable to N2 wild type whereas strain TR2170 grew noticeably slower than N2.

A stereomicroscope was used to assess developmental stage after 6 days incubation. All preliminary screens and re-tests were performed in duplicate. Post-hoc statistical analysis was performed by assuming 20 worms in each well and assigning each individual worm in L1-L3, L4, or adult stage a rank score of 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Library stocks of 10 mM in DMSO were added to 0.1% of the final volume to egg water to prepare a 10 μM screening concentration. Specifically, 150 µL of egg water was added to every well of two separate 96-well plates. Double mutants were generated by in-cross of <italic>ryr1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>ryr1b</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mutants. Embryos were manually dechorionated at one dpf. Then at two dpf two double mutant embryos were added to each well of one plate while two phenotypically wild type siblings were added to the second plate as a control. We reasoned that testing two larvae would be sufficient to detect if a chemical rescued the striking immotile phenotype. Care was taken to lower embryos to the bottom of a Pasteur pipette tip and deposit embryos into the well by surface tension to minimize changes to well volume. Next, 250 µL of the drug library was prepared at 40 µM working concentration in a separate 96-well plate by adding 1 µL of the 10 mM stock to 249 µL of egg water. Next, 50 µL of the 40 µM working concentration was added to the 150 µL water containing embryos to give a final concentration of 10 µM drug. After 24 hr incubation in chemical, motility of 3 dpf wild type and double mutant larvae was assessed by touch-evoked response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirata et al., 2007</xref>) under a stereomicroscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Photoactivation of motor behavior assay</title><p>At three dpf, <italic>ryr1b</italic> mutants were segregated from wild type (<italic>ryr1b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> or <italic>ryr1b</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) siblings based on their phenotype and distributed into sterile 6 cm tissue culture dishes containing 10 mL of egg water plus chemical. Please note that care was taken to evenly distribute larvae from one pair of parents across all conditions, that is sibling-matching, to minimize potential effects arising from clutch-to-clutch variability. Additionally, dysmorphic or underdeveloped larvae were not used.

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Modern &quot;target-based&quot; drug discovery is a costly, time-consuming, and frankly inefficient endeavor, with new drugs now costing billions of dollars. This paper exemplifies how screening drugs directly in living miniaturized disease models (e.g., worms, fish, and mammalian cell culture) has the potential to streamline the discovery process and reveal promising new drug targets. Using a novel cross-species screening cascade, the authors implicate the p38 signaling pathway in mediating ryanodine receptor type I-related myopathies (RYR1-RMs), suggesting that p38 inhibition could provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating this devastating childhood muscle disease for which no current treatments are available.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification of drug modifiers for RYR1 related myopathy using a multi-species discovery pipeline&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Jeff S Mumm as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Isaac Pessah (Reviewer #2); Guy M Benian (Reviewer #3); Clarissa Henry (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript reports results from extensive whole organism chemical screens in worms and fish, as well as a mouse cell culture models, of a debilitating muscle disease associated with mutations in the ryanodine receptor type I-related (RYR1) gene, specifically: (a) Mitigation of developmental arrest in RyR mutant nematodes (aka, &quot;unc68&quot;) exposed to nemadipine-A; (b) Mitigation of motor function deficits in zebrafish models with and without expression of ryr1 isoforms (WT and Ca-leaky RYR1 mutations), and; (c) An in vitro myotube model that assesses mitigation of ER/SR Ca leak due to expression of ryanodine receptor (RyR) pathogenic mutations. The pipeline the authors developed is a substantial achievement and exemplifies the potential for cross-species phenotypic screening to enhance modern drug discovery. The authors finding that p38 inhibition could provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating ryanodine receptor type I-related myopathies (RYR1-RMs) is intriguing and deserving of further study. Overall, the study is innovative and enlightening. However, several key issues were flagged by the reviewer's which need to be addressed to improve the quality of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Power calculations should be performed and confirmatory tests of positive hits performed with adequate samples sizes to overcome shortcomings of the primary screen regarding inadequate sample size.</p><p>2) Given the high concentrations of compounds used in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> assays (sometimes &gt;4 orders of magnitude higher than published affinities for target), target dependency of p38 inhibitor effects in <italic>C. elegans</italic> should be validated using RNAi. Similarly, siRNA should be used to validate p38 as a target in C2C12 myotube cultures. Alternatively, dose-responses could be performed to better define concentrations range producing observed effects.</p><p>3) &quot;…loss of expression mutation…&quot; for the <italic>unc-68</italic> allele used, <italic>unc-68</italic>(r1162), is not supported.

Additionally, we performed post-hoc statistical analyses on the primary <italic>C. elegans</italic> screen (subsection “Large-scale chemical screen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> identifies 74 <italic>unc-68</italic> suppressors”, fourth paragraph) and on our re-testing (seventh paragraph of the aforementioned subsection), as well as follow-up dose-response testing in worms for a select number of strong suppressors from the screen (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). The post-screen testing and analysis provides assurance that effects from chemicals from the primary screen were true positive hits. This is outlined in detail in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the high concentrations of compounds used in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> assays (sometimes &gt;4 orders of magnitude higher than published affinities for target), target dependency of p38 inhibitor effects in <italic>C. elegans</italic> should be validated using RNAi. Similarly, siRNA should be used to validate p38 as a target in C2C12 myotube cultures. Alternatively, dose-responses could be performed to better define concentrations range producing observed effects.</p></disp-quote><p>RNAi against the three p38 orthologs (<italic>pmk-1, pmk-2</italic>, and <italic>pmk-3</italic>) was tested in wildtype N2 and <italic>unc-68</italic>(r1162) <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the presence and absence of nemadipine-A, using developmental arrest as a readout (see Materials and methods and subsection “Large-scale chemical screen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> identifies 74 <italic>unc-68</italic> suppressors”, seventh paragraph). We observed that p38 knockdown significantly increased the proportion of L4/adult stage <italic>unc-68</italic> worms versus empty vector control (Figure 2). Similarly, siRNA knockdown of <italic>Mapk14</italic> (p38α), <italic>Mapk11</italic> (p38β), and <italic>Mapk12</italic> (p38γ) was performed in wildtype and <italic>Ryr1</italic> knockout C2C12 myotubes (see Materials and methods and subsection “Testing positive hits in C2C12 myotubes”, third and last paragraphs). The knockdown efficiency was validated by qPCR (Figure 5—figure supplement 2) and effect of knockdown on caffeine-induced intracellular calcium release was assessed (Figure 5C). We observed similar effects to chemical inhibitor treatment after knockdown of <italic>Mapk11</italic> (p38β), where calcium concentrations were slightly elevated in Ryr1 KO vs. control siRNA (Figure 5C and the aforementioned paragraphs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;…loss of expression mutation…&quot; for the unc-68 allele used, unc-68(r1162), is not supported. A Western Blot to showing loss of protein is needed to confirm.

The r1162 allele is a large deletion that spans the RyR1 calcium channel pore. Based on this existing published Western blot, the mutation results in complete loss of RyR1 protein expression and thus is considered a functional null. We updated the first paragraph of the subsection “Large-scale chemical screen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> identifies 74 <italic>unc-68</italic> suppressors” to clarify these published results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
