Given that the checkpoint is necessary for DNA damage-induced chromosome mobility, we propose that the importance of the checkpoint, and therefore long-range resection, in interchromosomal recombination is due to a need to increase chromosome mobility to facilitate pairing of distant sites.

If unrepaired, DSBs can lead to cell death, and if repaired improperly, DSBs can lead to loss of genetic information or chromosomal rearrangements associated with various pathologies such as neurodegeneration and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moynahan and Jasin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rass et al., 2007</xref>). Cells have two primary pathways to repair DSBs: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR is the high-fidelity mode of DSB repair because it uses a homologous template, generally the sister chromatid, for repair. HR is essential for maintaining genome integrity. For example, there is increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and increased frequencies of chromosome rearrangements in HR-deficient yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Putnam and Kolodner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Symington et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, defects in human HR proteins, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, are associated with increased risk for breast and ovarian cancers, as well as Fanconi anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prakash et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To repair DSBs by HR, the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/NBS1 (MRX/N) complex, stimulated by CDK-phosphorylated Sae2/CtIP, nicks the 5′-terminated strands on either side of the DSB, followed by 3′–5′ exonucleolytic processing back towards the break ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cannavo and Cejka, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>). This end-clipping reaction is followed by further processing from the 5′ ends by Exo1 or Dna2-Sgs1/BLM to create longer 3′ overhangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>). This second step, termed long-range resection, has been shown to be required for several HR processes, including single-strand annealing (SSA), yeast mating-type switching and interchromosomal gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gobbini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mimitou and Symington, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, resection initiation by MRX is essential to process DSBs with end-blocking lesions, whereas clean DSBs can be processed directly by the long-range resection machinery in the absence of MRX, albeit with delayed kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>). Once initiated, resection proceeds at about 4 kb/h in cells that lack a homologous template for repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). Measurements of resection tract lengths in cells undergoing recombination have primarily utilized site-specific endonucleases, which cleave both sister chromatids, thus preventing use of the preferred donor duplex to template HR. By using a donor allele that lacks the endonuclease cleavage site, either in diploids or haploids with repeats on different chromosomes, average resection tracts of &gt;2 kb in length were reported and resection tract length correlated with the time required for repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this finding, a more recent study found that resection tracts were short for a rapid sister chromatid repair event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jakobsen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although long-range resection is part of canonical models of repair by HR, the physiological role of this process is not completely understood given that several lines of evidence suggest minimal homology or reduced resection is sufficient for HR. For example, spontaneous recombination can occur with ~250 bp of homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jinks-Robertson et al., 1993</xref>). Additionally, efficient gene conversion can occur with as little as 250 bp of homology on either side of a programmed DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inbar et al., 2000</xref>), which is within the range of resection tract lengths produced by MRX-catalyzed short-range resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cannavo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gnügge et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mimitou et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that recombination can occur through much shorter tracts of ssDNA than are produced by long-range resection. Indeed, it has been shown that in G2-phase <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells, repair efficiency in response to ionizing radiation is only slightly reduced and kinetics are delayed by around one hour compared to wild-type (WT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Westmoreland and Resnick, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, diploids lacking Exo1 or its nuclease activity exhibit near WT levels of joint molecule formation and meiotic divisions even though resection tract lengths are greatly reduced (~270 nucleotides in <italic>exo1-nd</italic> cells compared with ~800 nucleotides in WT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mimitou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zakharyevich et al., 2010</xref>). These findings suggest that long-range resection may not be necessary for HR in all scenarios; however, the reason for this context dependence remains unclear.</p><p>In addition to generating ssDNA substrates for Rad51-catalyzed HR, the end resection machinery is associated with DNA damage checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waterman et al., 2020</xref>). The MRX/N complex recruits and activates the Tel1/ATM kinase in response to DSBs, after which signaling transitions to Mec1/ATR once resection generates sufficient ssDNA for RPA and Ddc2/ATRIP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shiotani and Zou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waterman et al., 2020</xref>). Once activated, the DNA damage checkpoint limits extensive resection to prevent accumulation of excessive ssDNA through multiple mechanisms. Rad9/Crb2 antagonizes the Dna2-Sgs1 mechanism in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonetti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lazzaro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leland et al., 2018</xref>), while Rad53, the effector kinase for Tel1 and Mec1, inhibits Exo1 activity by phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). The 9-1-1 DNA damage clamp (Ddc1, Mec3, and Rad17 in budding yeast) and Rad24, the large subunit of the 9-1-1 clamp loader complex, attenuate resection by MRX and promote resection by Exo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gobbini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ngo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ngo and Lydall, 2015</xref>). The Tel1 and Mec1 kinases positively influence resection initiation by MRX and Sae2 but limit extensive resection by promoting recruitment and retention of Rad9 to chromosome in the vicinity of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cannavo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cartagena-Lirola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waterman et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The DNA damage checkpoint and end resection are also linked to chromosome mobility. DNA damage induces mobility of the broken chromosome (local), and, to a lesser extent, mobility of undamaged chromosomes (global; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seeber et al., 2013</xref>). The checkpoint proteins Mec1 and Rad9 are necessary for local and global DNA damage-induced chromosome mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seeber et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, checkpoint activation in the absence of DNA damage is sufficient to increase chromosome mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seeber et al., 2013</xref>). Chromosome mobility is also linked to end resection, as deletion of Sae2, which delays resection, also delays chromosome mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2012</xref>). Therefore, resection, checkpoint activation, and chromosome mobility likely collaborate to facilitate DNA repair, especially when a repair template is not in close proximity to the broken chromosome.</p><p>Given that the requirement for long-range resection seems to be context dependent, we wanted to explore further the role of long-range resection in HR. Here, we show that interchromosomal gene conversion is significantly impaired in the absence of long-range resection, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gobbini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Remarkably though, we find that intrachromosomal recombination between closely linked repeated sequences occurs at almost WT levels when long-range resection is eliminated, providing evidence that long-range resection is dispensable under certain circumstances. Thus, the ssDNA tracts exposed by MRX-Sae2 alone must be sufficient to facilitate HR, and the requirement for long-range resection in the interchromosomal context must go beyond simply exposing adequate ssDNA. We suggest that the main role for long-range resection in mediating interchromosomal recombination is in DNA damage checkpoint activation. When the DSB and repair template are spatially separated, cells require time and a more active homology search facilitated by chromosome mobility, and therefore long-range resection is necessary. When the DSB and repair template are in close proximity, the homology search is rapid enough that the need for checkpoint activation and chromosome mobility is circumvented, and long-range resection is dispensable.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Long-range resection is necessary for interchromosomal recombination but dispensable for intrachromosomal recombination</title><p>To investigate the need for long-range resection in different contexts, we employed two different reporter systems designed to measure intrachromosomal or interchromosomal HR. The intrachromosomal assay system measures recombination between two non-functional <italic>ade2</italic> alleles (<italic>ade2-I</italic> and <italic>ade2-n</italic>), separated by a 4.3 kb sequence containing the <italic>TRP1</italic> gene integrated at the native <italic>ADE2</italic> locus on Chr XV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mozlin et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>ade2-I</italic> allele was generated by replacement of the endogenous <italic>Aat</italic>II site with an I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cut site, and <italic>ade2-n</italic> contains a frame shift mutation at the <italic>Nde</italic>I site. A cassette expressing the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I endonuclease under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter was integrated at the <italic>LYS2</italic> locus on Chr II.

In both assays, after induction of I-<italic>Sce</italic>I, cells must repair the DSB introduced at the <italic>ade2-I</italic> locus in order to survive, and most do so using the <italic>ade2-n</italic> donor allele; thus, survival frequency is a measure of recombination efficiency. The surviving colonies can be categorized as Ade<sup>+</sup>/Ade<sup>-</sup> by colony color (Ade<sup>+</sup>=white; Ade<sup>-</sup>=red) and Trp<sup>+</sup>/Trp<sup>-</sup> by growth on SC -Trp plates.

Intrachromosomal repair in WT cells was slightly faster than interchromosomal repair or intrachromosomal repair in <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). While the WT cells reached the same level of intra- and interchromosomal repair by the 6 hr timepoint, <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> intrachromosomal recombination levels lagged behind throughout the time course, only reaching levels comparable to WT at 8 hr. <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells did not show detectable levels of interchromosomal recombination throughout the 8 hr time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>), consistent with the strong reduction in survival observed in plating assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Checkpoint activation was robust in the WT interchromosomal strain but absent in the intrachromosomal strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This result suggests that the relatively short delay (~0.5–1 hr) in interchromosomal repair leads to checkpoint activation. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that Rad53 is not activated during mating-type switching, a fast, intrachromosomal DSB repair process, but is activated during interchromosomal ectopic repair or when the recombination enhancer for mating-type switching is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim and Haber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mehta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pellicioli et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Others have shown that checkpoint activation in response to a DSB is abrogated in the absence of long-range resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balogun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bantele et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gobbini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gravel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). We also evaluated checkpoint activation during intra- and interchromosomal repair in the absence of Exo1 and Sgs1. Consistent with what other groups have reported, there was a defect in DSB-induced Rad53 phosphorylation in <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic>, although there was a low level of phosphorylation even before DSB induction that persisted throughout the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Any shift in Rad53 mobility after DSB induction is comparable between the intra- and interchromosomal <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> strains, which is not the case in the WT strains, indicating that the phosphorylation detected is not associated with slower repair. The DSB-independent Rad53 phospho-shift in <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells requires the checkpoint proteins Rad9 and Rad24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of Exo1 and Sgs1 there is likely ssDNA accumulation throughout the genome, possibly arising during replication, which triggers low-level checkpoint activation. Taken together, these results support the idea that interchromosomal repair is slower than intrachromosomal repair, allowing enough ssDNA to accumulate to activate the checkpoint, which then promotes repair. However, in the absence of long-range resection, the checkpoint is not properly activated during interchromosomal repair, potentially leading to progression through the cell cycle before repair of the DSB.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The requirement for long-range resection in interchromosomal recombination correlates with an increased requirement for the DNA damage checkpoint</title><p>We hypothesized that if the checkpoint defect of <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> contributes to the interchromosomal recombination defect, then checkpoint mutants should also exhibit a defect in interchromosomal recombination, while minimally influencing intrachromosomal recombination.

Briefly, upon addition of galactose to the medium, cells express Ddc1-LacI and Ddc2-LacI fusions that are recruited to a LacO array, thereby co-localizing the 9-1-1 complex (Ddc1-Mec3-Rad17) and Mec1 (via Ddc2) to artificially activate the checkpoint. Importantly, checkpoint activation in this system does not rely on ssDNA generation. Using this system and measuring interchromosomal repair by the PCR assay, we found that the HR defect of the <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> strain was partially rescued and Rad53 phosphorylation was modestly restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). One technical limitation of the artificial checkpoint system is that the Ddc1- and Ddc2-LacI fusions are over-expressed from <italic>GAL</italic> promoters, and induction of longer than ~2 hr has a dominant negative effect on Rad53 activation (D. Toczyski, personal communication). Since I-<italic>Sce</italic>I is also expressed from the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter, reduced I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cutting resulting from the shorter induction time could contribute to lower HR efficiency. Interestingly, a longer galactose induction (5 hr) resulted in delayed repair in the WT strain, consistent with the dominant negative effect on Rad53 phosphorylation and the need for checkpoint activation for repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>One function of the DNA damage checkpoint is to halt cell cycle progression in the presence of unrepaired damage.

Analysis of previously published Hi-C data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>) showed that total contacts between the DSB allele and the interchromosomal site on Chr III ranked in the bottom 10% among all <italic>ADE2</italic> contacts genome-wide. We sought to alleviate this spatial challenge by bringing the DSB and repair alleles in closer proximity, which has previously been shown to improve recombination in WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agmon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). We chose two interchromosomal sites with higher contact frequencies (on Chr IV and XVI) and an additional site with a low contact frequency (on Chr VIII). Recombination assays were carried out with these strains in both WT and <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> backgrounds. In all cases, there was a significant defect in the <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> strains compared to the respective WT strains. There was a weak trend towards improved interchromosomal recombination in the absence of long-range resection by using a higher contact donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the recombination efficiency at these sites was still substantially lower than intrachromosomal recombination, likely due to the fact that even what we qualified as high contact frequency interchromosomal sites are relatively low contact compared to intrachromosomal sites.</p><p>We next explored whether moving the donor allele further away from the recipient allele on the same chromosome influenced the dependence on long-range resection for recombination. The intrachromosomal strains that have been used in all prior experiments have the <italic>ade2-n</italic> donor located ~4 kb from the <italic>ade2-I</italic> allele. We integrated <italic>ade2-n</italic> into six additional locations across Chr XV and measured recombination efficiency in both WT and <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> backgrounds. Again, survival frequency remained high for all donor locations in the WT strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, survival frequency showed a proximity-based effect in the <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> strains. The two sites located within 20 kb of the broken allele facilitated efficient repair, independent of long-range resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The donor located 54 kb from the DSB showed a mild dependency on long-range resection, and beyond 100 kb on either chromosome arm, cells were more dependent on long-range resection for recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Spearman correlation analysis confirmed that survival frequency showed a negative correlation with the linear distance between donor and recipient (<italic>r</italic>=–0.857; p=0.024), and a positive correlation with total contacts according to the Lazar-Stefanita Hi-C data (<italic>r</italic>=0.821; p=0.034; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>).

However, we detected weak Rad53 phosphorylation in the strain where the donor was located 54 kb from the DSB, and more robust Rad53 phosphorylation for the 448 kb donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, checkpoint activation correlated with the requirement for long-range resection, as was observed for interchromosomal recombination. These findings demonstrate that long-range resection-independent recombination occurs over a relatively short distance (~50 kb) within the same chromosome. Beyond this distance, checkpoint activation, and therefore long-range resection, are necessary to promote efficient recombination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Rad51 over-expression suppresses the interchromosomal HR defect of <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells</title><p>Rad51 is required for increased mobility of a damaged locus even though the checkpoint is active in Rad51-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalocsay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). It has been suggested that Rad51 binding to resected ends stiffens them, thereby enhancing the homology search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miné-Hattab et al., 2017</xref>). Since resection tracts are ~300 nt long in <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells, nucleation of Rad51 might be slower, resulting in less efficient interchromosomal HR. Expression of Rad51 from a high copy number plasmid partially suppressed the interchromosomal recombination defect of the <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data suggest that Rad51 is not completely saturated on the short overhangs, contributing to lack of mobility of the damaged site and reduced recombination efficiency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Current models of HR include MRX-Sae2 catalyzed resection initiation, followed by long-range resection by Exo1 and/or Dna2-Sgs1. Here, we show that long-range resection is dispensable for DSB-induced HR when a repair template is located in close proximity on the same chromosome, suggesting that sufficient ssDNA is generated by MRX-Sae2 for Rad51-catalyzed repair. Long-range resection becomes crucial for efficient recombination when the donor allele is located on a different chromosome or greater than ~50–100 kb from the DSB site on the same chromosome where the DNA damage checkpoint is activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The necessity for long-range resection in these scenarios is consistent with previous work showing a requirement for Exo1 and Sgs1-Dna2 in interchromosomal repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gobbini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Our results provide a possible explanation for why others have observed long-range resection-independent recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Westmoreland and Resnick, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zakharyevich et al., 2010</xref>). First, when G2 cells are treated with IR, a broken chromatid is likely in close proximity to its sister, facilitating the homology search and subsequent repair. Second, multiple DSBs are induced by IR and during meiosis, and even the limited resection at each of these sites is likely to cumulatively yield sufficient ssDNA to activate the checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gobbini et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>One caveat to our findings and those of others reporting long-range resection independent recombination is that resection tracts produced by MRX under physiological conditions are likely to be shorter than those formed in <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells due to engagement of the long-range resection machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mimitou and Symington, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, long-range resection may be playing a more important role than is apparent in cells lacking Exo1 and Sgs1.</p><p>Given that the DNA damage checkpoint is activated in scenarios where repair is delayed, long-range resection may act as a timing mechanism for checkpoint activation. Relatively quick repair circumvents the need for the checkpoint. However, if repair takes longer, long-range resection serves to create sufficiently long ssDNA tracts for checkpoint activation. In the absence of long-range resection, and therefore robust checkpoint activation, cells may proceed through to the next cell cycle with a broken chromosome, leading to cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Artificial G2/M arrest of <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells is insufficient to rescue the HR defect, indicating that the DNA damage checkpoint is responsible for eliciting effects other than cell cycle delay in order to promote HR. A more active role for the DNA damage checkpoint is supported by our finding that artificial induction of the checkpoint can partially rescue the interchromosomal repair defect of <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The rescue we see is likely incomplete due to the short galactose induction time used to avoid a dominant negative effect of the checkpoint system. Additionally, we do not know whether inducing the checkpoint elsewhere in the genome will have the same effect on mobility at the DSB site as the native checkpoint response. Finally, there is likely some effect of having short resection tracts that limits DSB mobility as well, possibly through inefficient Rad51 loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for the requirement for long-range resection in recombination.</title><p>In intrachromosomal recombination, short resection tracts are sufficient to facilitate the homology search and repair due to the close proximity of the DSB allele (yellow) and repair allele (orange) (top panels). An intramolecular repair event is represented, but an inter-sister repair event is also possible. In interchromosomal recombination (or distal intrachromosomal recombination), the homology search takes longer. Therefore, resection tracts continue to be extended and the DNA damage checkpoint is activated in WT cells (bottom left panel). This would pause the cell cycle and activate mobility, facilitating the homology search and repair. However, in the absence of long-range resection, checkpoint activation is impaired, likely leading to a mobility defect and a failure to delay cell cycle progression (bottom right panel). This would result in cell death as cells would divide with a broken chromosome. The large light gray oval represents the nucleus and the dark gray oval represents clustered centromeres. Only two chromosomes are shown for simplicity.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84322-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The more substantial recombination deficiencies of <italic>mec1∆ sml1∆, rad53∆ sml1∆, rad9∆</italic>, and <italic>rad24∆</italic> cells in the interchromosomal versus the intrachromosomal context further supports the role of the checkpoint in the former, but not the latter scenario. As noted above, the failure of these mutants to facilitate efficient interchromosomal recombination is due to their checkpoint defect and not to a resection defect. The observation that loss of Rad9 or Rad24 in long-range defective cells is either epistatic or suppressive, respectively, supports the checkpoint defect in <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells. Restoring the checkpoint by expression of a Ddc2-Rad53 fusion protein in <italic>rad9∆</italic> cells rescued the interchromosomal defect indicating that Rad9 is not required for HR per se and its function is to activate Rad53. It is also interesting to consider that the checkpoint, and therefore Mec1 and Rad9, are necessary for DNA damage-induced chromosome mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seeber et al., 2013</xref>). Rad24 is linked to chromosome mobility since the loading of the 9-1-1 complex at resected DNA ends is necessary for Mec1 activation, and therefore checkpoint signaling (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finn et al., 2012</xref>). Given that interchromosomal recombination is likely to be more spatially challenging than proximal intrachromosomal repair, it is reasonable to think that the need for chromosome mobility would be increased for interchromosomal recombination. Consistent with this idea, we do observe a partial rescue of interchromosomal recombination in the absence of Exo1 and Sgs1 by overexpressing Rad51. This result likely reflects the fact that Rad51 is necessary for chromosome mobility and that this mobility helps facilitate repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalocsay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miné-Hattab et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). Rad51 loading stiffens and extends ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ogawa et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sung and Robberson, 1995</xref>), possibly reducing the complexity of the homology search as has been shown recently for RecA in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wiktor et al., 2021</xref>). The rate limiting step of Rad51 filament formation is the nucleation step, which requires ~6 Rad51 monomers, and increased concentrations of Rad51 promote nucleation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Candelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miné et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paoletti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>). The increased Rad51 concentration likely increases the probability of nucleation on short resection tracts, thereby promoting filament polymerization for homology search. Interestingly, it was recently shown that distal global mobility is facilitated by and enhances HR and is dependent on Rad51 and Rad9, while proximal global mobility occurs independent of these factors and is dispensable for HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">García Fernández et al., 2022</xref>). Given that long-range resection is an important upstream step of both checkpoint activation and Rad51 loading, this result may explain why we observe that long-range resection is required for distal (interchromosomal) recombination but is dispensable for proximal (intrachromosomal) recombination.</p><p>We find that WT cells repair the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I break at high efficiency, independent of the donor location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is in contrast to findings that showed differences in both intra- and interchromosomal repair efficiency that correlated with contact frequency in WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agmon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Although the difference between these results and our own is unclear, it may be due to donor homology and/or use of HO versus I-<italic>Sce</italic>I. Donor size positively impacts repair efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), and our system contains significantly more homology than prior studies (3.7 kb vs 2 kb or 1.2 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agmon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). The difference in cutting efficiency of the endonuclease may also influence repair proficiency as determined by plating assays. Since I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cleavage is less efficient than HO, some cells might divide on galactose-containing medium before the DSB is induced and survival of only one daughter cell would be required for colony formation leading to an over-estimation of repair efficiency. Based on our results, it seems that regardless of the donor position, sufficient end resection and checkpoint activation can facilitate repair, accounting for the fact that we only see differences in repair efficiency in the absence of long-range resection.</p><p>The failure to robustly rescue interchromosomal recombination deficiency of long-range resection deficient cells by using higher contact donors was unexpected at first, given previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). However, even the higher contact frequency interchromosomal donors that were used are still relatively low compared to intrachromosomal contacts within Chr XV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, it might not be as surprising that we only observed improvement of recombination efficiency for the closest donor sites on the same chromosome. We also do not see an effect of centromere proximity on repair that was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). However, this could be due to not using donors within 240 kb of the centromere. Nevertheless, our intrachromosomal data suggest that linear distance between the DSB site and donor site is the primary determinant of repair efficiency in the absence of long-range resection. Together, these results demonstrate that cells deficient for long-range resection are only proficient for recombination when the recombining sequences are in close proximity, but that WT cells can facilitate recombination independent of donor proximity.</p><p>Based on our results, it becomes clear that the importance of long-range resection does not necessarily lie in its ability to expose multiple kilobases of homology, although there may be certain contexts in which this is important. For example, long-range resection promotes the usage of more extensive stretches of homology, even if they are not in the immediate vicinity of the DSB. This may be especially important if a DSB occurs in a repetitive element, as long-range resection should suppress usage of short homologies between repeats and favor recombination with more extensive homologies in the surrounding sequence. Long-range resection may also promote a more efficient homology search by permitting invasion of multiple substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wright and Heyer, 2014</xref>). However, this multi-invasion process has also been shown to be mutagenic, so there may be a trade-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Piazza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ruiz et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, long-range resection has been shown to suppress telomere addition at slowly-repaired DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lydeard et al., 2010</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that loss of recombinants in the <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> interchromosomal assay is due to de novo telomere addition, it is unclear why this would not also occur in the intrachromosomal system.</p><p>We suggest that an additional function of long-range resection is to activate the checkpoint when repair is delayed, thereby increasing chromosome mobility and promoting the search for homology. This function may be relevant in a context in which recombination with the sister chromatid is inefficient, thus necessitating repair with a non-allelic donor, potentially resulting in a compromise between cell survival and genome integrity. Despite the circumvention of long-range resection in scenarios of rapid repair, this process clearly serves an important purpose in multiple contexts and is supported by the evolutionary maintenance of two redundant pathways to create longer tracts of ssDNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

contained 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 10 µg/mL adenine, and either 2% glucose (YPAD), or 2% raffinose (YPAR) as a carbon source. Galactose was added to YPAR to 2% final from a 20% stock for conditions of DSB induction. Synthetic media contained 1 X yeast nitrogen base, 1 X amino acid dropout mix, and 2% glucose or 2% raffinose.</p><p>All yeast strains are in the W303 background and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>: Yeast strains. Strains were constructed by standard genetic methods. Lithium acetate transformations were used to introduce deletion cassettes containing a marker of choice and homology arms flanking the gene to be deleted. Other strains were made by crossing, followed by tetrad dissection and marker selection.</p><p>For introducing the Chr III <italic>ade2-n</italic> cassette, a 3.7 kb fragment containing <italic>ade2-n</italic> and flanking genomic sequence was isolated from pAL78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rattray and Symington, 1994</xref>) by BamHI digest and cloned into a BamHI-digested pRG205MX to make pLS515. Then the plasmid was integrated into the <italic>leu2</italic> locus of an <italic>ade2∆</italic> strain (LSY2584). The resulting strain was then crossed to LSY1738-3B, which contained the <italic>ade2-I</italic> allele at the native locus on Chr XV and <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>-I-Sce</italic>I at the <italic>lys2</italic> locus, generating LSY4540-7B. For other inter- and intrachromosomal <italic>ade2-n</italic> integrations, the 3.7 kb <italic>ade2-n</italic> fragment was isolated from pLS515 by BamHI digest and cloned into a BamHI-digested pAG25 (NatMX) to generate pLS617. Oligos were designed to amplify <italic>ade2-n-NatMX</italic> with homology arms corresponding to the site of integration. Homology arms were extended to 80 bp total by two rounds of PCR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>: Oligonucleotides). These fragments were integrated into LSY1738-3B by standard LiAc-TE transformation. Integrations were confirmed by PCR screen of Nat<sup>+</sup> colonies.</p><p>For introducing the Ddc1-LacI Ddc2-LacI 256 x LacO checkpoint co-localization system into the interchromosomal strains, LSY5325-448A (WT) and LSY5326-252D (<italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic>) were first derived from a genetic cross with CBY88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonilla et al., 2008</xref>).

Trp<sup>+</sup> transformants were subsequently screened by Southern blot using a <italic>TRP1</italic> probe and BglII digest of genomic DNA to identify those with a full-length integrated LacO array.</p><p>All yeast strains and plasmids are available by e-mail request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Recombination plating assays</title><p>Cells were grown on YPAD (interchromosomal) or SC-Trp (intrachromosomal) agar plates at 30 °C for ~3 days. Single red colonies were picked and resuspended in 2 mL of YPAR media and incubated while shaking for 4 hr. Cultures were then centrifuged at 2000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. After removing supernatant, cells were resuspended in 200 µL of H<sub>2</sub>O. Cells were then diluted to the appropriate plating dilution to ideally yield 100–200 colonies per plate (1:10,000 for most strains on YPAD, variable dilutions on YPA-GAL). A total of 200 µL of each dilution was plated onto 2 YPAD and 2 YPA-GAL plates. Plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days. Colonies were counted and colony color (red/white) was noted. For the intrachromosomal strains with the <italic>TRP1</italic> marker between the repeats, YPA-GAL plates were replica plated to SC -Trp plates, which were grown for 2 days and counted to determine whether recombinants were Trp<sup>+</sup> or Trp<sup>-</sup>.</p><p>To calculate survival frequency, an average of the colony count on the two YPA-GAL plates was divided by the average of the colony count on the two YPAD plates. Survival frequencies were determined for at least three independent cultures of each strain. The average survival frequency for each genotype is plotted in the bar graphs. Significance was determined by a two-tailed t-test. To determine the relationship between survival frequency and contact frequency or distance in the intrachromosomal assays, a two-tailed Spearman correlation analysis was applied in Prism using a 95% confidence interval. Additionally, a nonlinear, one-phase decay model was applied to each data set and is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>.</p><p>For Rad51 overexpression experiments, WT (LSY4540-7B) and <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> (LSY4614-2-2D) interchromosomal assay strains were transformed with pLS506 (pRS423-<italic>RAD51</italic>) or pRS423 (EV). Plating assays were carried out as described above, except that strains were grown in media lacking histidine to maintain the plasmid. Survival frequency was determined based on colony number on SC -His+GAL as compared to SC -His plates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Repair kinetics</title><p>A single red (Ade<sup>-</sup>) colony was picked from a YPAD (interchromosomal) or SC -Trp (4 kb intrachromosomal) plate into 5 mL of SC -Trp (w/ 2% glucose and 10 µg/mL adenine) (intra) or the same media supplemented with 80 µg/mL Trp (inter). Cultures were grown for 8 hr and cell concentrations were determined. Cultures were diluted to 7x10<sup>4</sup> cells/mL in 50 mL of SC -Trp (w/ 2% raffinose and 10 µg/mL adenine) (intra) or 50 mL of the same media supplemented with 80 µg/mL Trp (inter). Raffinose cultures were grown overnight. A sample was taken prior to DSB induction (t<sub>0</sub>), galactose was added to 2% final concentration to induce I-<italic>Sce</italic>I, and samples were collected at the indicated times after induction. ~3.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells were taken at each timepoint.</p><p>For G2-arrested conditions, cells were grown as described above and exponentially growing raffinose cultures were arrested with nocodazole at a final concentration of 20 µg/mL, plus DMSO at 1% final. For this purpose, DMSO was added to 1% final and nocodazole was added to 13.3 µg/mL final and cultures were grown for 1 hr. An additional 6.7 µg/mL of nocodazole was added, and cultures were grown for another hour. Arrest was confirmed by checking for large-budded cells under the microscope. DSB induction and timepoint collection was performed as described above.</p><p>For checkpoint co-localization experiments, cells were grown as described above and exponentially growing raffinose cultures were induced for DSB and checkpoint co-localization simultaneously by addition of galactose to 2% final. After the indicated time, glucose was added to 2% final to repress expression of I-<italic>Sce</italic>I and the checkpoint.</p><p>Genomic DNA was extracted with the MasterPure Yeast DNA Purification Kit (Biosearch Technologies) and DNA concentrations were measured using the Qubit Flex fluorometer and 1 x HS dsDNA assay kit (Invitrogen). PCR amplification followed by restriction digestion was used to measure repair kinetics. Twenty µL Phusion (NEB) reactions were set up according to manufacturer’s protocol with primers MK193, MK197, MK238, and MK239 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), 100 ng of genomic DNA, and 30 cycles. 1 µL of PCR product was then used in a 20 µL digest reaction with AatII restriction enzyme and rCutSmart buffer (NEB). Digestion products were separated on 0.8% agarose gels made with 0.5 X TBE. Percent repair is a ratio of band intensity of repair products normalized to control product in the same reaction. The band intensity at t<sub>0</sub> was subtracted from all timepoints and the resulting intensities were used to calculate percent repair, setting the Ade<sup>+</sup> products at 100% repair.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Rad53 Western Blotting</title><p>Culturing was performed as described for the repair kinetics experiments.~1.4 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells were taken at each timepoint. Protein was extracted using Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation. Cell pellets were washed once in 500 µL of 20% TCA and then resuspended in 200 µL of 20% TCA and transferred to 2 mL screw cap tubes on ice. An equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) was added. Cells were physically lysed in the FastPrep-24 5 G homogenizer (MP-Biomedicals) at 4 °C. The machine was run at 10 m/s for 20 s for three rounds. Supernatants were transferred to a new Eppendorf tube, beads were washed twice with 200 µL of 5% TCA, and all supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and cell pellets were resuspended in 1 x Laemmli SDS-PAGE loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Bromophenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Samples were then boiled for 5 min before loading on a 10% Acrylamide/Bis-acrylamide gel. Protein bands were transferred to PVDF membranes using the iBlot 2 Transfer Stacks, mini and the iBlot 2 Gel Transfer Device. Membranes were then stained with Ponceau S for 10 min, followed by two to three 5 min rinses in water until protein bands were apparent. Stained membranes were imaged and then further de-stained in 1 x TBS-T (TBS +0.1% Tween) to remove the remaining dye. Membranes were gently shaken in blocking solution (5% milk in TBS-T) for 1 hr at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Then the blocking solution was removed and the primary antibody was added (Anti-Rad53 EL7 antibody (gift from M. Foiani) diluted 1:500 in fresh blocking solution). For detection of Rad53-HA, anti-HA antibody (12CA5 from mouse (Roche)) diluted 1:1,000 in blocking solution was used. Membranes were incubated in the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C while gently rocking on a nutator. The following day, the primary antibody was removed, membranes were washed in TBS-T 3 x for 5 min each. The secondary antibody was then added (anti-mouse IgG kappa binding protein [Santa Cruz Biotechnology] diluted 1:5000 in blocking solution) and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature while rocking on a nutator. The secondary antibody was removed and membranes were washed in TBS-T 3 x for 5 min each. One final 5-min wash with TBS was performed to remove Tween. Membranes were developed using a 1:1 ratio of SuperSignal West Femto Max Sensitivity ECL reagents (Thermo Fisher) for 2 min. Membranes were then exposed to film and developed in a Kodak X-OMAT processor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantitative PCR-based resection assay</title><p>Resection assays were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gnügge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zierhut and Diffley, 2008</xref>).

between distal, but not proximal, homologous sequences. It is thus proposed that a major role of long resection of a double strand break mediated by Sgs1 and Exo1 is to activate the DNA damage checkpoint to allow the chromosomal mobility needed for the DNA ends to find a distant homologous sequence for repair via homologous recombination. Consistently, <italic>exo1 sgs1</italic> mutants show defects specifically in interchromosomal homologous recombination. The study adds a new biological meaning to the role of long DNA resection, providing a new mechanism for the control of homologous recombination.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84322.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Aguilera</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03nb7bx92</institution-id><institution>CABIMER, Universidad de Sevilla</institution></institution-wrap><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Smolka</surname><given-names>Marcus B</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05bnh6r87</institution-id><institution>Cornell University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.10.19.512848">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.19.512848v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. Reviewers opted not to reveal their identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Related to the rescue of interchromosomal recombination using the Ddc2-Rad53 chimera, it would be important to test the rescue of rad24Δ exo1Δ sgs1Δ mutants with the chimera. In Figure 4A, the authors show that Ddc2-Rad53 fusion can rescue the defects in rad9Δ, but this construct fails to rescue the defects in exo1Δ sgs1Δ (Figure S4A). The authors propose that the lack of rescue is related to the short tracks in sgs1Δ exo1Δ cells. If this is the case, Ddc2-Rad53 expression should robustly, although partially, rescue recombination defects in rad24Δ exo1Δ sgs1Δ cells given the longer ssDNA tract that should be able to sustain Ddc2-Rad53 recruitment and activation. The authors may want to consider fusing a Mec1-activating domain (MAD) from Ddc1 into their Ddc2-Rad53 chimera to make sure Mec1 is robustly activated in the absence of 9-1-1 loading.</p><p>2. Given the difficulties to demonstrate a robust rescue of interchromosomal recombination in exo1Δ sgs1Δ cells with strategies for forced Rad53 recruitment, the authors could also consider alternative strategies. For example, it was previously shown that mutation of serine 486 to alanine (S486A) in Slx4 leads to persistent Rad9 recruitment, and persistent Rad53 hyperactivation (Ohouo et al. 2013; Cussiol et al., 2015; Dibitetto et al., 2016). Therefore, this mutation is expected to robustly rescue interchromosomal recombination defects in exo1Δ sgs1Δ cells. The experiment to test this should be feasible (S486A mutation is also not synthetic lethal with deletion of SGS1 (unpublished data)) and straightforward.</p><p>3. The double band pattern of Rad53 in the exo1Δ sgs1Δ mutant should be investigated further since the constitutive Rad53 activation status could be relevant for the recombination outcomes. Is the shift dependent on Rad9? The authors should discuss more what would be the implications of a constitutively active Rad53 in their system. Moreover, because the authors show constant Rad53 phosphorylation in exo1Δ sgs1Δ cells, it would be useful to monitor Rad53 phosphorylation-induced mobility shift in rad24Δ exo1Δ sgs1Δ and check if the rescue is, or not, associated with altered checkpoint signaling.</p><p>4. Related to the previous point, in Figure 4C, left panel, exo1Δ sgs1Δ shows Rad53 phosphorylation at 0h timepoint, consistent with Figure 2D. However, the phosphorylation disappears at 0h timepoint when the co-localization system is functional. Since the authors mention the dominant-negative effect, is it possible that the constant Rad53 phosphorylation in exo1Δ sgs1Δ is toxic to distal recombination, so when the dominant-negative effect dampens Rad53 phosphorylation recombination gets partially rescued? (it has been demonstrated that rad53-K227A can suppress the sensitivity of exo1Δ sgs1Δ cells to DNA damage (Gobbini et al., 2020)). In addition, the authors show that Ddc2-Rad53 expression enhances the recombination defects in exo1Δ sgs1Δ (Figure S4A), consistent with the idea that constant Rad53 activation in exo1Δ sgs1Δ may impair the repair process. Discuss.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84322.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

As expected, Ddc2-Rad53 was unable to suppress the <italic>rad24Δ</italic> HR defect because it is unable to rescue the checkpoint defect caused by loss of Rad24 (Lee et al., 2004). However, we did observe a partial rescue of the severe recombination defect observed in <italic>exo1Δ sgs1Δ</italic> Ddc2-Rad53 cells, these data are now included in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Given the difficulties to demonstrate a robust rescue of interchromosomal recombination in exo1Δ sgs1Δ cells with strategies for forced Rad53 recruitment, the authors could also consider alternative strategies. For example, it was previously shown that mutation of serine 486 to alanine (S486A) in Slx4 leads to persistent Rad9 recruitment, and persistent Rad53 hyperactivation (Ohouo et al. 2013; Cussiol et al., 2015; Dibitetto et al., 2016). Therefore, this mutation is expected to robustly rescue interchromosomal recombination defects in exo1Δ sgs1Δ cells. The experiment to test this should be feasible (S486A mutation is also not synthetic lethal with deletion of SGS1 (unpublished data)) and straightforward.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we incorporated <italic>SLX4-FLAG::</italic>K<italic>anMX</italic> and <italic>slx4-S486AFLAG::KanMX</italic> cassettes into the wild-type interchromosomal recombination reporter strain. However, we discovered that the strains exhibited a growth defect on YP-Gal plates, with &lt;1% viability relative to growth on YPD. The colonies grown on YPD exhibited white sectoring from leaky expression of I-SceI indicating normal levels of recombination, suggesting that the growth defect on YP-Gal was not due to HR deficiency. To obviate the need for galactose induction, we turned to a β-estradiol-inducible Cas9 construct (Al-Zain et al., 2023) with a gRNA targeted to the I-SceI cut site that we developed for another project. The strains with <italic>KanMX</italic> marked <italic>SLX4</italic> and <italic>slx4-S486A</italic> alleles were crossed to an <italic>exo1Δ sgs1Δ</italic> derivative with the alternate endonuclease induction system. Although the <italic>SLX4</italic> and <italic>slx4-S486A</italic> strains exhibited similar recombination frequencies to WT, we failed to detect a suppression of the <italic>exo1Δ sgs1Δ</italic> recombination defect by <italic>slx4-S486A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Consistently, <italic>slx4-S486A</italic> did not rescue the Rad53 phosphorylation defect of the <italic>exo1Δ sgs1Δ</italic> mutant. We suspect that the defect in Mec1 signaling caused by short resection tracts results in reduced Rad9 accumulation in the <italic>exo1Δ sgs1Δ</italic> mutant. Surprisingly, we did not observe hyperactivation of Rad53 by the <italic>slx4-S486A</italic> mutation in the WT W303 strain background. We do not have an explanation for this discrepancy other than a potential strain background difference, and for this reason did not include these data in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Interchromosomal recombination in the presence of <italic>slx4S486A</italic>.</title><p>(A) Results from the recombination plating assay using a modified interchromosomal strain expressing Cas9 and an I<italic>Sce</italic>I-targeted gRNA rather than GAL-I-<italic>Sce</italic>I.

The double band pattern of Rad53 in the exo1Δ sgs1Δ mutant should be investigated further since the constitutive Rad53 activation status could be relevant for the recombination outcomes. Is the shift dependent on Rad9? The authors should discuss more what would be the implications of a constitutively active Rad53 in their system. Moreover, because the authors show constant Rad53 phosphorylation in exo1Δ sgs1Δ cells, it would be useful to monitor Rad53 phosphorylation-induced mobility shift in rad24Δ exo1Δ sgs1Δ and check if the rescue is, or not, associated with altered checkpoint signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer has suggested, we measured Rad53 phosphorylation in both <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆ rad9∆</italic> and <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆ rad24∆</italic> cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).

Given that <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆ rad9∆</italic> and <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆ rad24∆</italic> cells show a similar Rad53 phosphorylation pattern, but only <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆ rad24∆</italic> shows a partial rescue of recombination, we favor the conclusion that this is due to the partial rescue of resection in <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆ rad24∆</italic> cells as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Resection 640bp from the DSB in <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆ rad9∆</italic> cells is the same as <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Related to the previous point, in Figure 4C, left panel, exo1Δ sgs1Δ shows Rad53 phosphorylation at 0h timepoint, consistent with Figure 2D. However, the phosphorylation disappears at 0h timepoint when the co-localization system is functional. Since the authors mention the dominant-negative effect, is it possible that the constant Rad53 phosphorylation in exo1Δ sgs1Δ is toxic to distal recombination, so when the dominant-negative effect dampens Rad53 phosphorylation recombination gets partially rescued? (it has been demonstrated that rad53-K227A can suppress the sensitivity of exo1Δ sgs1Δ cells to DNA damage (Gobbini et al., 2020)). In addition, the authors show that Ddc2-Rad53 expression enhances the recombination defects in exo1Δ sgs1Δ (Figure S4A), consistent with the idea that constant Rad53 activation in exo1Δ sgs1Δ may impair the repair process. Discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the reason for the lack of Rad53 phosphorylation at the 0 hr timepoint with the co-localization system is not due to the dominant negative effect, but rather due to the fact that Ddc1 is only expressed under galactose conditions (endogenous <italic>DDC1</italic> is deleted; <italic>GAL</italic>-<italic>DDC1</italic>LacI is only expressed in the presence of galactose). As we showed in response to the previous reviewer comment, the Rad53 phosphorylation observed in <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells in the absence of damage is Rad24-dependent, and therefore Ddc1 dependent. We do see an induction of Rad53 phosphorylation ajer induction of the co-localization system with a concomitant rescue of recombination, supporting our claim that the recombination defect in <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells is connected to its checkpoint deficiency.</p><p><italic>DDC2-RAD53</italic> has replaced <italic>RAD53</italic> in our strains and is therefore under the control of the endogenous <italic>RAD53</italic> promoter. Therefore, <italic>DDC2-RAD53</italic> will be expressed the same as native <italic>RAD53</italic> and will not be constitutively activated. It will only bypass the need for Rad9-mediated recruitment of Rad53 to sites of damage. It is unclear why the fusion causes an increased recombination defect in <italic>exo1∆ sgs1∆</italic> cells, however we determined it is not due to further decreasing resection (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
