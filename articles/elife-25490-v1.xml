genetic disorders. Replication fork barriers are a commonly encountered problem, which can cause fork collapse and act as hotspots for replication termination. Collapsed forks can be rescued by homologous recombination, which restarts replication. However, replication restart is relatively slow and, therefore, replication termination may frequently occur by an active fork converging on a collapsed fork. We find that this type of non-canonical fork convergence in fission yeast is prone to trigger deletions between repetitive DNA sequences via a mechanism we call Inter-Fork Strand Annealing (IFSA) that depends on the recombination proteins Rad52, Exo1 and Mus81, and is countered by the FANCM-related DNA helicase Fml1. Based on our findings, we propose that IFSA is a potential threat to genomic stability in eukaryotes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25490.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25490.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>Rad52</kwd><kwd>replication fork collapse</kwd><kwd>replication fork barrier</kwd><kwd>Mus81</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>090767/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitby</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EP Abraham Cephalosporin Trust Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitby</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The discovery of a mechanism that causes DNA deletions during non-canonical DNA replication termination is described.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic DNA replication initiates at multiple origin sites along each chromosome and terminates when replication forks (RFs) from adjacent origins converge. DNA lesions in the template strands, and physical barriers, such as tightly bound proteins, threaten this seamless progression from initiation to termination by impeding RFs and precipitating their collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berti and Vindigni, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lambert and Carr, 2013</xref>). RF collapse involves either remodelling or disassembly of the replisome, and can occur with or without DNA breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berti and Vindigni, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dungrawala et al., 2015</xref>). Regardless of its precise form, collapse renders the fork incompetent for further DNA synthesis. In such cases, DNA replication, initiated from a downstream origin, can ensure that genome duplication is completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yekezare et al., 2013</xref>). However, to guard against the possibility that this second RF may also fail, cells deploy homologous recombination (HR) enzymes to the collapsed fork, which can restart replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mohebi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeeles et al., 2013</xref>). This so-called recombination-dependent replication (RDR) helps ensure that DNA is fully replicated prior to sister chromatid segregation, thereby avoiding mitotic catastrophes.</p><p>The Rad52 protein plays a pivotal role in processing collapsed RFs in both yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhowmick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sotiriou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Symington et al., 2014</xref>). In yeast, Rad52 mediates the nucleation of the Rad51 recombination protein onto single-stranded (ss) DNA at collapsed forks, which in turn catalyzes strand invasion of homologous DNA to form a displacement (D) loop, at which replication proteins can reassemble to restart DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Symington et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to aiding Rad51’s nucleation onto DNA, Rad52 is also able to anneal complementary ssDNAs coated in Replication protein A (RPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mortensen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reddy et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shinohara et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sugiyama et al., 1998</xref>). This activity promotes several different HR pathways, including a Rad51-independent mode of replication restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Symington et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, Rad51-independent RDR, catalysed by Rad52, appears to be the major pathway in human cells for processing collapsed RFs under conditions of replication stress, and during mitotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhowmick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sotiriou et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, yeast mostly use Rad51-dependent RDR, with the Rad52-only pathway seemingly employed as a less efficient alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>RDR can initiate from a collapsed fork where the DNA is either broken or remains intact. Where broken, the exposed DNA is typically resected by a nuclease to generate a ssDNA tail onto which first RPA and then Rad52 loads, leading to a version of RDR called break-induced replication (BIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2013</xref>). However, where the collapsed RF remains unbroken, restart is thought to involve its regression, where the parental DNA strands re-anneal and cause the nascent strands to unwind and base-pair with each other, forming a free double-stranded end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkinson and McGlynn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). Nucleolytic resection of this end generates the requisite ssDNA tail onto which the recombination proteins can load and drive the restart process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berti and Vindigni, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, the loading of Rad52 at DSBs and collapsed RFs takes approximately 10 min, but DNA synthesis takes even longer to start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hicks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). This means that DNA replication will frequently complete by an active fork, initiated from a downstream replication origin, converging on a collapsed fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Completing DNA replication in this manner is thought to be desirable, because it prevents the risk of chromosomal rearrangements and copy-number variations (CNVs), which can be caused by the restart process inadvertently recombining repetitive DNA elements both at, and downstream of, the collapsed fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is unknown whether this type of replication termination, where an active fork converges on a collapsed fork, can itself cause genome instability.</p><p>In this study we show that convergence of an active fork with a collapsed fork can result in surprisingly high rates of inter-DNA repeat recombination leading to genomic deletions. Three key recombination proteins that drive deletion formation, including Rad52, are identified, as well as one that actively suppresses it. We propose a mechanism to explain how the deletions are formed, and speculate that it may be responsible for some of the CNVs that give rise to disease in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental system</title><p>To investigate how RF collapse influences inter-repeat recombination, we used the site-specific RF barrier <italic>RTS1</italic> to block forks at the <italic>ade6</italic> locus on chromosome 3 in fission yeast. <italic>RTS1</italic> is a unidirectional barrier, formed by a myb domain-containing DNA binding protein called Rtf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vengrova et al., 2002</xref>). Due to the position of flanking replication origins, the direction of replication at the <italic>ade6</italic> locus is strongly polarized in the telomere to centromere direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consequently only one orientation of <italic>RTS1</italic> blocks RFs at this site, and this is referred to as the active orientation (AO). The opposite orientation, that does not block RFs, is called the inactive orientation (IO). By live cell imaging, we have shown that recombination protein foci are recruited to <italic>RTS1</italic>-AO within approximately 10 min of RF blockage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>).

The major recombination proteins Rad51 and Rad52 are both required for gene conversion, whereas Rad52 can form approximately 40–50% of deletions without Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lorenz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2008</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25490.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The effect of inter-DNA repeat distance on RF barrier-induced recombination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the location of <italic>RTS1</italic>, <italic>ade6<sup>-</sup></italic> direct repeats, sites of DNA spacer insertion, nearby replication origins, and products of inter-repeat recombination.

Modest increases in inter-repeat recombination were observed with the addition of 0.5 and 1 kb spacers on the telomere-proximal side of <italic>RTS1</italic>-AO, whereas 4 and 8 kb spacers resulted in a 4- and 10-fold reduction, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This reduction in inter-repeat recombination is consistent with ChIP data showing that Rad52 enrichment on DNA extends only up to ~2 kb behind RFs blocked at <italic>RTS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsang et al., 2014</xref>). In stark contrast, the addition of DNA spacers on the centromere-proximal side of <italic>RTS1</italic>-AO resulted in a dramatic increase in inter-repeat recombination, rising from an ~1.9 fold increase, with a 1 kb spacer, to ~5.4 fold with a 5 kb spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, no increase in spontaneous inter-repeat recombination was observed with the 5 kb spacer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Crucially, most of the extra recombinants (~90%) were Rad51-independent deletions, which depended on Rad52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Indeed the frequency of these deletions increased by ~10 fold with the addition of the 5 kb spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

We propose a new model, called Inter-Fork Strand Annealing (IFSA), to explain how Rad52 could promote deletions in the absence of RF breakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Following RF blockage and collapse at <italic>RTS1</italic>-AO, the fork regresses exposing a DNA end that is resected by Exo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, step 2). Resection generates a ssDNA tail, incorporating the <italic>ade6<sup>-</sup></italic> repeat on the telomere proximal side of the barrier, which Rad52 binds to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, step 3). During RF convergence, Rad52 inadvertently anneals its <italic>ade6</italic> repeat to the complementary ssDNA of the other <italic>ade6</italic> repeat that is exposed in the lagging strand gap of the incoming fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, step 4). Strand annealing would be aided by the DNA repeats being closely juxtaposed in three-dimensional space, which may be facilitated by the addition of the DNA spacer. Inter-fork strand annealing establishes a connection between the two RFs bounded by three/four-way DNA junctions at either end of the annealed DNA. Appropriate cleavage of this ‘IFSA junction’ by Mus81-Eme1 would generate one intact sister chromatid and one with the DNA repeat region deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, steps 4 and 5).

Therefore, it may limit deletion formation by modulating the extent of RF regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, step 4).

Step 3: Rad52 anneals its bound ssDNA to the complementary ssDNA exposed in the lagging strand gap of the incoming fork.

Previously, we, and others, have reported that RDR, promoted by fork collapse at the <italic>RTS1</italic> barrier, generates chromosomal rearrangements and CNVs, both during the act of restarting replication, and from the increase in template switching associated with the restarted fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mizuno et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). However, IFSA is distinct from previously described forms of <italic>RTS1</italic>-induced recombination due to its dependence on RF convergence. Indeed, this requirement contrasts markedly with RDR-associated template switching, which is constrained by RF convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). It is also distinct from other types of replication slippage event, which typically envisage the ‘slippage’ occurring between DNA repeats at the same RF rather than between converging RFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lovett, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Through the application of microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies, there has been a growing appreciation of the prominent role that CNVs play in human genetic diversity and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stankiewicz and Lupski, 2010</xref>). For example, chromosomal deletions arising in germ cells have been linked to a variety of genetic disorders, including complex syndromes such as autism and schizophrenia, whilst their occurrence in somatic cells has been associated with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beroukhim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watson et al., 2014</xref>). The formation of CNVs and other types of structural variants (SVs) in humans has been attributed to three main types of mechanism: non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR); non-homologous end joining (NHEJ); and replication based mechanisms, such as fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS), and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</xref>). The class of mechanism responsible for any given CNV or SV is typically inferred by characterization of the breakpoint junctions, with the presence of long stretches of homologous sequence signifying NAHR, little or no homology indicating NHEJ, and microhomology, together with a short inserted sequence, pointing towards a replication based mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weckselblatt and Rudd, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In our experimental system, IFSA occurs between directly orientated DNA repeats that share ~1.7 kb of almost perfect homology and, as such, would be classed as a type of NAHR. NAHR is generally thought to occur when ectopic homologous sequences (typically low-copy repeats that are &gt;10 kb in size and share &gt;95–97% sequence identity) are inadvertently aligned during Rad51 family recombinase-mediated DSB repair, in which intermediates are resolved to give a crossover outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed the majority of recurrent SVs, associated with known genomic disorders, are most likely formed during the repair of meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Could IFSA be responsible for a subset of SVs that have been attributed to homology-directed DSB repair? The following observations encourage us to think that it might. Firstly, the principle players that direct IFSA in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Rad52 and Mus81, are not only conserved in humans but also act in the same pathway to process collapsed RFs and, therefore, are likely to be present at sites of non-canonical RF convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhowmick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sotiriou et al., 2016</xref>). Secondly, many of the documented SVs are simple deletions formed by recombination between either low-copy repeats, or far more abundant transposon sequences, such as long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and Alu elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flynn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Startek et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, these repetitive sequences make up ~50% of the human genome and, therefore, there are likely to be occasions when non-canonical RF convergence occurs in the vicinity of sites that can be annealed. Thirdly, inter-repeat recombination is implicated in the formation of a growing number of disease-associated non-recurrent SVs, including those where there is no enrichment for the PRDM9 meiotic DSB hotspot motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</xref>). This highlights the possibility that some SVs, associated with DNA repeats, are formed by mechanisms other than Rad51 family recombinase-mediated meiotic DSB repair. Indeed, it has been proposed that many of the non-recurrent SVs that are associated with Alu elements are formed by FoSTeS or MMBIR, since these elements can share as little as 75% identity and the SV breakpoint junctions often exhibit only microhomology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</xref>). Currently, we do not know what tolerance IFSA has for divergent repeat sequences and, therefore, it is unclear whether it could contribute to deletions formed between Alu elements, such as those responsible for the genetic disorders neurofibromatosis type one and autosomal-dominant spastic paraplegia 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsiao et al., 2015</xref>). However, in a DSB-induced chromosomal translocation assay in mouse cells, SSA accounted for 85% of translocations when identical Alu elements were adjacent to the DSBs, but only 4% when the Alu elements diverged by 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elliott et al., 2005</xref>). Whether IFSA is similarly affected by divergence of DNA repeat sequences remains to be determined.</p><p>In mammals, the average distance between active replication origins during S phase is ~150 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takebayashi et al., 2017</xref>) and, therefore, this would limit the size of chromosomal deletions that IFSA could generate if it only occurs during RF convergence. However, we suspect that IFSA might act between any collapsed and active RF that share a repetitive sequence, as long as they are in close proximity with each other (e.g. RFs in the same replication factory). If true, this would provide additional scope for generating larger deletions and even other types of SV. For example, strand annealing between RFs travelling in the same direction through inverted repeats could result in the formation of an additional acentric or dicentric chromosome, with the former predisposed to micronuclei formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fenech et al., 2011</xref>), and the latter capable of causing breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsui et al., 2013</xref>). Both of these events are thought to drive tumorigenesis, either by promoting chromothripsis (in the case of micronuclei formation), or by oncogene amplification (in the case of BFB cycles) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leibowitz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsui et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In some respects, IFSA is reminiscent of models, such as FoSTeS and MMBIR, that have been proposed to explain stress-induced gene amplification in bacteria, and various complex non-recurrent genome rearrangements in humans, which similarly invoke the concept of strand annealing between RFs, where one of the two RFs is stalled or broken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Slack et al., 2006</xref>). In the case of MMBIR, it has also been suggested that Rad52 promotes the strand annealing step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>). However, the genomic rearrangements that these models describe are characterised by microhomology (typically 2–33 bp in humans) at the breakpoint junctions rather than the ~1.7 kb regions of homology used in our experimental system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</xref>). Moreover, FoSTeS and MMBIR depend on template switching events, which can prime DNA synthesis and lead to the copying of nearby genomic sequences that are found inserted at the breakpoint junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</xref>). In contrast, our model for IFSA does not invoke a requirement for DNA synthesis following strand annealing. However, it has been suggested that FoSTeS/MMBIR may also account for many simple non-recurrent SVs, including interstitial deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>). Such deletions could also be formed during DSB repair by so-called microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ – also known as alternative end joining) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, in one study of somatic SVs in multiple cancer types, 41% of deletions were attributed to MMEJ based on the presence of between 2–40 bp of microhomology at their breakpoint junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Whilst we have not demonstrated that IFSA can function when there is only microhomology shared between the converging RFs, we suspect that it might be responsible for some of the deletions documented in cancer genomes, which have hitherto been attributed to MMEJ or FoSTeS/MMBIR. Our suspicion is based on: (1) knowledge that the genomic regions marking the boundaries of somatic CNVs found in many cancers tend to be replicated at the same time and share a long-range interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De and Michor, 2011</xref>); (2) reports that Rad52 promotes DSB repair by MMEJ in fission yeast, and during antibody class-switch recombination in mouse B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Decottignies, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zan et al., 2017</xref>), albeit the same may not be true in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>). If Rad52 is capable of annealing DNA strands that share only microhomology at a DSB, then it might also be able to do the same to strands exposed during non-canonical RF convergence.</p><p>Our discovery that non-canonical RF convergence can result in chromosomal deletions by IFSA highlights a potential novel risk to genomic stability. However, whether it is likely to be a significant contributor to pathogenic CNVs in humans will depend on how efficiently it can operate when sequence homology between the converging RFs is limited. Finally, it is interesting to speculate on whether IFSA might serve a beneficial function to the cell similar to SSA, which promotes cell survival by repairing DSBs at the expense of generating DNA deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhargava et al., 2016</xref>). In this regard, we imagine that IFSA may aid the termination of DNA replication at specific problem sites, enabling sister chromatids to segregate successfully during mitosis. This possibility warrants investigation in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, plasmids and PCR primers</title><p><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> strains and PCR primers used for this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">2</xref>, respectively.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Inter-fork Strand Annealing causes genomic deletions during the termination of DNA replication&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, the authors investigate the mechanism of replication restart by homologous recombination in fission yeast. A directional replication fork barrier, RTS1, had been shown to stimulate recombination between repeat sequences located close to RTS1. Here, the authors investigated the effect of increasing the distance between repeats, either before or after RTS1 (RTS1 is inserted between direct repeats of ade6). Having the RFB in the &quot;active&quot; orientation stimulates inter-repeat recombination. Placing a spacer sequence between the repeats, especially past the RFB, increases recombination events, particularly those occurring by a mechanism that requires Rad52 but is independent of Rad51. Deletion formation was also suppressed in exo1 and mus81 mutants. The requirement for Mus81 supports the idea that deletions do not result from fork collapse and SSA. This spacer effect appears to depend on the probability that a converging fork will encounter the stalled fork. Genetic requirements suggest a model coined inter-fork strand annealing (IFSA) accounts for the spacer effect. One appealing aspect of the model is that it involves Rad52 annealing activity without suggesting that Rad52 promotes strand invasion.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that problems arising during DNA replication are potent drivers of genomic instability. Here the authors identify a mechanism for deletion formation at stalled forks that is distinct from SSA and relies on Rad52, Exo1 and Mus81. Given the current interest in how Rad52 and Mus81 facilitate replication fork restart in mammalian cells, the findings will be of interest to a wide audience.</p><p>Overall, the work represents a significant contribution and should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. No additional experiments are required. However, the authors need to revise the manuscript to correct the following limitations of the manuscript:</p><p>1) The authors need to tone-down the discussion about IFSA being a &quot;new mechanism&quot;: their statements to that effect are over-stated, and they disregard work on strand annealing during DNA replication in bacteria. The model is, in fact, a replication-slippage model that has been discussed for decades, with the added – important – feature that the target is in a separate replication fork. The authors need to credit prior precedents while acknowledging the novel aspects that implicate two replication forks.</p><p>2) Related to the model, as indicated, the single-strand derives from a resected regressed fork. However, an alternative, which they should acknowledge, is that the nascent 3' strand is simply unwound by helicases from the template.</p><p>3) The text from subsection “RF convergence is needed for DNA spacer-dependent deletions” is difficult to follow, and it needs to be rewritten to make their argument clearer.</p><p>4) It is difficult to guess whether IFSA might account for any genome instability under normal growth conditions – the authors need to address the frequency of physiological occurrence of IFSA. As far as the reviewers know, e.g., there are no orphan examples of natural or genotoxin-induced CNVs that are explained by IFSA. Hence, the authors need to discuss whether IFSA might explain a significant class of CNVs, natural or genotoxin-induced, or any other common genomic rearrangement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25490.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors need to tone-down the discussion about IFSA being a &quot;new mechanism&quot;: their statements to that effect are over-stated, and they disregard work on strand annealing during DNA replication in bacteria.
