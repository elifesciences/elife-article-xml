Free or bound to ligands, polyubiquitins are found in different arrangements of ubiquitin subunits. To understand the structural basis for polyubiquitin quaternary plasticity and to explore the target recognition mechanism, we characterize the conformational space of Lys63-linked diubiquitin (K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>). Refining against inter-subunit paramagnetic NMR data, we show that free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> exists as a dynamic ensemble comprising multiple closed and open quaternary states. The quaternary dynamics enables K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> to be specifically recognized in a variety of signaling pathways. When binding to a target protein, one of the preexisting quaternary states is selected and stabilized. A point mutation that shifts the equilibrium between the different states modulates the binding affinities towards K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> ligands. This conformational selection mechanism at the quaternary level may be used by polyubiquitins of different lengths and linkages for target recognition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05767.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05767.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05767.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins can be tagged with other molecules that indicate what the cell should do with that protein. For example, proteins tagged with a small protein called ubiquitin—which is linked to other ubiquitin molecules to form ‘polyubiquitin’—may be destroyed or relocated within a cell.</p><p>Like all proteins, a ubiquitin is made up of chains of amino acids. Specific amino acids form the linkages between individual ubiquitins to form a polyubiquitin, and the nature of these linkages influences the effect that a polyubiquitin has on the tagged protein. One linkage involves a lysine amino acid at position 63 (known as Lys63). This linkage is found in the polyubiquitin that is involved in repairing damaged proteins and relocating target proteins to a part of the cell where they are utilized for immune response. To perform these different roles, the polyubiquitin must be able to distinguish between a variety of target proteins.</p><p>The shape that a protein takes on determines how it works, and most proteins constantly and rapidly switch between different shapes.

Multiple ubiquitins are covalently linked to form a polyubiquitin, which can then be attached to a substrate protein. The process is known as ubiquitination, a post-translational modification of the substrate protein. Three classes of enzymes catalyze ubiquitination: ubiquitin-activation enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugation enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3). E2 and E3 dictate ubiquitin linkage and substrate specificities. Additionally, deubiquitinases (DUBs) are responsible for specifically erasing ubiquitin signals from a substrate protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clague et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Catalyzed by a linkage-specific E2, two or more ubiquitins are linked up via an isopeptide bond between the carboxylate at the C-terminus of one ubiquitin (referred to as the distal unit) and the ε-amine of a lysine residue (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, or Lys63) or the α-amine at the N-terminus of another ubiquitin (referred as the proximal unit). Lys48-linked polyubiquitin is the most abundant linkage in cells, and signals substrate proteins for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kravtsova-Ivantsiv et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Other types of linkages mostly perform non-degradative functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kulathu and Komander, 2012</xref>). Lys63-linked polyubiquitin is another common linkage, and has been found to be involved in DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoege et al., 2002</xref>), multivesicular body mediated protein sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacDonald et al., 2012</xref>), NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen and Chen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zinngrebe et al., 2014</xref>), and oxidative stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Silva et al., 2015</xref>). Lys63-linked polyubiquitin also exists as an unanchored form without being attached to a substrate protein, and the unanchored form may serve as a scaffold for recruiting proteins in the signaling pathways of innate immunity and protein aggregate removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hao et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>How does Lys63-linked polyubiquitin perform different functions? To do so, Lys63-linked polyubiquitin has to specifically recognize multiple target proteins. Structural studies of Lys63-linked diubiquitin (K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>) have indicated that K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> mostly adopts open extended conformations in the absence of a ligand and in complex with many target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Datta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Komander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sato et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weeks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sekiyama et al., 2012</xref>). It has been proposed that such an open extended structure differentiates K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> from Lys48-linked polyubiquitin that predominantly exists in a closed structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varadan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fushman and Walker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirano et al., 2011</xref>). Notwithstanding, K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> has been found in closed conformations when complexed with the Npl4 zinc-finger domain (NZF) of TAK1-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulathu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sato et al., 2009b</xref>) for the activation of NF-κB signaling pathways. K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> is also selectively recognized by the fourth zinc-finger (ZnF4) of A20, a ubiquitin-editing enzyme for the termination of NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wertz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wertz and Dixit, 2014</xref>). The crystal structure of the complex between ZnF4 and ubiquitin monomer indicated that K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> likely exists in a closed conformation when binding to ZnF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bosanac et al., 2010</xref>). So are the closed-state structures already present for the free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, but have hitherto eluded structural characterization? Or is the closed-state structure induced by a specific ligand?</p><p>To recognize a target protein and to perform specific functions, a protein has to fluctuate among a variety of conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Henzler-Wildman and Kern, 2007</xref>). For a ubiquitin monomer, studies have shown that the protein exists as an ensemble of tertiary conformations which can accommodate different target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lange et al., 2008</xref>). As ubiquitin mainly functions as polyubiquitins, a more pertinent question is how does a polyubiquitin fluctuate at the quaternary level and achieve its target recognition specificity?</p><p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is well suited to characterize protein ensemble structures and to visualize protein dynamics. NMR depiction of dynamic fluctuation for multi-domain proteins such as pre-mRNA splicing factor U2AF and DNA-binding protein CAP, has uncovered conformational selection and equilibrium shift mechanisms for these systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mackereth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44a">Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Among the NMR techniques, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) is exquisitely sensitive to transient and fleeting interactions between proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sekhar and Kay, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xing et al., 2014</xref>). Owing to dipolar interactions between the paramagnetic center and protein nuclei, PRE is proportional to the inverse sixth power of the distance between the paramagnetic center and protein nuclei, and is ensemble-averaged over all the conformational states sampled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clore and Iwahara, 2009</xref>). To explore the target recognition mechanism for K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, we used PRE NMR in conjunction with other biophysical methods. We characterized the arrangements between the ubiquitin units, and we determined the ensemble structure for K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> in the absence of a ligand. Our findings indicated a conformational selection mechanism at the quaternary level, whereby a target protein selects and stabilizes one of the preexisting conformational states of ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> exists in both open and closed states</title><p>We first compared the chemical shift differences between the subunits in K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> and ubiquitin monomer. Except for residues near the covalent ubiquitin linkage, the differences in chemical shifts are small (&lt;0.04 ppm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Residues with relatively large chemical shift differences (&gt;0.01 ppm) can be tentatively mapped, and form rather contiguous surfaces on each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, insets). However, it is unclear whether the perturbations are due to the covalent linkage, or due to non-covalent interactions between the two subunits. We also performed a half-filtered NMR experiment, which failed to reveal any inter-subunit nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) between the proximal and distal units of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. Our data are consistent with the previous NMR studies of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tenno et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varadan et al., 2004</xref>); in the latter work, the authors failed to detect cross-saturations between the two subunits. Together, the diamagnetic NMR studies indicated that the closed-state structure of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, if existing, is loosely packed and possibly adopts multiple conformations.</p><p>To visualize the quaternary arrangement between the subunits of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, we resorted to PRE NMR. We prepared K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> protein with the proximal unit <sup>15</sup>N-labeled and the distal unit unlabeled. A cysteine point mutation was introduced to Asn25 or Lys48 in the distal unit of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. An MTS paramagnetic probe was conjugated at N25C or K48C site. Each of the conjugation sites was designed so that the paramagnetic probe was away from the binding partners of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, which include Rap80 tUIM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sekiyama et al., 2012</xref>), TAB2 NZF domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulathu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sato et al., 2009b</xref>), and A20 ZnF4 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bosanac et al., 2010</xref>), and therefore the conjugation does not interfere with ligand binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, the binding affinities between K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> and tUIM or NZF remain unchanged for the paramagnetically tagged K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, the paramagnetic NMR spectrum can be overlaid onto the diamagnetic spectrum, except for residues that are completely broadened out due to the PRE effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Together, the modifications do not perturb the conformational space of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> or have an effect on K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> function.</p><p>We previously reported that ubiquitin monomer dimerizes non-covalently with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value of 4.9 ± 0.3 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the PRE effect could arise both intramolecularly and inter-molecularly. The inter-molecular PREs were measured on an equimolar mixture of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> (each at 500 µM), with paramagnetic tagging and isotope labeling on different subunits in separate proteins. With a paramagnetic probe conjugated at either N25C or K48C site and using the inter-molecular data for reference, our measurements revealed large intra-molecular inter-subunit PREs for many residues in the proximal unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). At relatively low protein concentration (50 µM), the inter-molecular contribution to the overall PRE is negligible. We found that the relative decreases in peak intensities between the paramagnetic and diamagnetic spectra recorded at 50 µM are highly correlated with the relative decreases between the paramagnetic and inter-molecular spectra recorded at 500 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). This corroborates the PRE measurement at the higher concentration. In addition, when a different paramagnetic probe, EDTA-Mn<sup>2+</sup>, was conjugated at N25C, the PRE profile is similar to that using the MTS probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Thus, the intra-molecular inter-subunit PREs are independent of the paramagnetic probe used, and reveal intrinsic structural features of ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05767.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intra-molecular inter-subunit paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) measured for ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>.</title><p>With the paramagnetic probe conjugated at (<bold>A</bold>) N25C or (<bold>B</bold>) K48C in the distal unit, the PRE <sup>1</sup>H Γ<sub>2</sub> rates were measured for amide protons of the <sup>15</sup>N-labeled proximal unit.

The linker between the two subunits (Lys63 side chain in the proximal unit and C-terminal flexible residues 72–76 of the distal unit) was given full torsional freedom. A grid search was performed by varying the number of conformers representing the closed state (from a single conformer to a five-conformer ensemble), and by varying the overall population of the closed state (from 10% to 90%). A single-conformer representation for the closed state does not satisfy the inter-subunit PREs, as assessed by the PRE Q-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwahara et al., 2004</xref>). This means that the closed state of ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> should exist in multiple conformations. The PRE Q-factor rapidly decreases as the number of conformers representing the closed state increases, and levels off with four or more conformers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). On the other hand, a closed-state population of at least 30% is required to achieve a good fit to the PRE data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For reasons that will be discussed below, the population of the K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> closed state is about 70%. At a 70% population for the closed state with a four-conformer representation, the back-calculated PREs agree well with the experimental ones, affording a PRE Q-factor of 0.22 and correlation coefficient of 0.94 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1, 3B</xref>). Importantly, the two paramagnetic conjugation sites, N25C and K48C, provide cross-validating PRE measurements—when refining the ensemble structure of the K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> closed state against the N25C data alone, the PRE values predicted for the K48C site largely agree with the experimental values, affording a free Q-factor of 0.46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As C1 is represented with multiple conformers, it is possible to further partition the closed state into more conformational states. As the ligand-bound closed structures are similar to ligand-free structures of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> in either C1 or C2 state, a cognate ligand of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> can be preferentially recognized and accommodated into one of the preexisting conformations. As there are some differences between the ligand-free and ligand-bound K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> in the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), the binding may require some induced fit, especially towards the end of the binding process. On the other hand, the open-state conformation of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> may specifically recognize its corresponding ligand like Rap80 tUIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sekiyama et al., 2012</xref>) via a conformational selection mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Perturbation of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> conformational space</title><p>How does K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> inter-convert among the preexisting conformations? To address this, we introduced a charge reversal mutation to residue Glu64 in the proximal unit, resulting an E64R<sub>P</sub> mutant of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. Glu64 is located at the interface between the two subunits in both C1 and C2 closed states, opposing the positively charged residues Arg72 and Arg74 in the distal unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We reasoned that this mutation should affect the conformational space of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. Indeed, the E64R<sub>P</sub> mutation results in chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) in the K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> distal unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although the perturbations are small, almost the same residues are perturbed upon E64R<sub>P</sub> mutation as upon the covalent linkage of ubiquitin monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, the NMR peaks for the perturbed residues in the mutant do not simply move in the direction towards the chemical shift values of the ubiquitin monomer. This can be either due to altered non-covalent interactions around the mutation site, or to a change in the relative population of the conformational states. Therefore, it is difficult to quantitate the CSPs in terms of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> structural change.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05767.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Changes in NMR parameters for K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> upon E64R<sub>P</sub> mutation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical shift differences of the distal unit upon mutation.

The respective <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values are 9.7 ± 0.3 µM and 12.2 ± 0.6 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), which agree with the literature values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulathu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sekiyama et al., 2012</xref>). We attempted to measure the binding affinity between A20 ZnF4 domain and K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. However, the heat was too small to be fitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus we resorted to NMR titration for the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> measurement. Upon titrating A20 ZnF4, a large set of residues in the distal unit of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> was perturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Among the perturbed residues, residues 50–62 are located at the interface with ZnF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bosanac et al., 2010</xref>), and their peaks disappear upon A20 ZnF4 titration, indicating a slow exchange between ZnF4-free and bound species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). We were only able to fit the CSPs at an elevated temperature (313 K instead of 303 K), and determined the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value at 384.1 ± 39.4 µM. A number of other residues in the K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> distal unit also experience CSPs upon A20 ZnF4 titration. However, their peaks shift progressively at increasing ZnF4 concentrations, which indicates a fast exchange and should belong to a separate binding event.</p><p>Upon the E64R<sub>P</sub> mutation, the binding between K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> and the open-state ligand tUIM becomes tighter, with the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value decreasing by more than fourfold to 2.2 ± 0.1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). On the other hand, the binding towards closed-state ligands weakens—the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> binding towards NZF increases by ∼50% to 17.8 ± 1.1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, the enthalpy change Δ<italic>H</italic> values are almost identical for the bindings involving the wild type and mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). For the interaction between K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> mutant and A20 ZnF4, more peaks at the interface (residues 50–62 of the distal unit) can be traced, which can be attributed to a faster exchange than that of the wild type. Significantly, the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value increases by almost threefold to 1199.9 ± 104.9 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Together, the binding affinity towards the open-state ligand increases at the expense of the binding affinities towards the closed-state ligands, and the changes in binding affinities are caused entropically due to the perturbation of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> conformational space.</p><p>The difference in binding affinity can be accounted for by the difference in the conformational energy of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. Based on the PRE measurement, the closed-state population decreases by ∼50% upon E64R<sub>P</sub> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). At the same time, the population for the open state increases by the same amount. Thus, the gain in conformational energy will be manifested as the free energy difference for the increase in binding affinity between K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> and its open-state partner tUIM (−0.89 ± 0.04 kCal/mol). On the other hand, the C1 and C2 closed states forfeit 0.71 ± 0.08 kCal/mol and 0.23 ± 0.09 kCal/mol in binding free energies, respectively. Our calculation indicated that only when the closed-state population decreases from ∼70% to ∼35% upon the mutation, in which C1 state population decreases from ∼52.5% to ∼22.5% and C2 state population decreases from ∼17.5% to ∼12.5%, could the binding free energy change be the same as the conformational energy change. Indeed, upon the point mutation, a larger decrease was observed for the PRE corresponding to the C1 state than the PRE for the C2 state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and the binding affinity of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> towards a C1 state ligand decreases more than the affinity towards a C2 state ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6, 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although the SAXS data have insufficient resolution to resolve multiple closed states, and may include contributions from high-order non-covalent oligomers, linearly combining the SAXS data calculated for the closed and open states at 70% and 30% and without further refinement, we were able to recapitulate the experimental SAXS data with a χ<sup>2</sup> value of 1.24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have shown that about 70% of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> exists in the closed state, whereas only about 30% of the protein exists in the open state. Our findings disagree with many previous structural characterizations of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varadan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Datta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dikic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Komander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weeks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>), which reported that ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> exists only in the open state. Nevertheless, the closed-state population is in line with our previous finding that ubiquitin monomer non-covalently dimerizes with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value of 4.9 ± 0.3 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In the non-covalent dimer of ubiquitin monomer, a ubiquitin adopts an array of orientations in respect to the other. With a covalent linkage, the non-covalent interaction between ubiquitin becomes intra-molecular and restricted. Therefore, a significant population of diubiquitin should exist in the closed compact conformation regardless of the ubiquitin linkage. Indeed, studies have indicated that K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> mainly exists in the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cook et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Phillips et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Varadan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eddins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ye et al., 2012</xref>). For ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, however, only a recent single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) study has provided direct experimental evidence and indicated that the protein exists in a closed state at a population of ∼75% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ye et al., 2012</xref>). Here, using paramagnetic NMR, SAXS, and mutational analysis, we found that the population of the closed state of ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> is ∼70%. But why have only open-state structures been reported for ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>? A possible explanation is that the open-state structure is more readily captured owing to non-covalent interactions between neighboring unit cells, and becomes enriched during crystallization processes.</p><p>Further, we have identified two distinct closed states, namely C1 and C2, with different populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The PRE NMR provides 1/<italic>r</italic><sup>6</sup> ensemble-averaged distance information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clore and Iwahara, 2009</xref>). So the inverse problem is to determine the constituting conformational states that give rise to the ensemble-averaged PRE observables. Here by projecting the structures with spherical coordinates, we were able to visualize the distinct conformational states of ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. In comparison, the smFRET study on ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ye et al., 2012</xref>) measured just a single distance between the N-terminus of the distal unit and the C-terminus of the proximal unit, and could not distinguish multiple closed states or provide a structural description for each state. Similarly, SAXS analysis is unable to reveal how two nearly globular proteins are docked to each other in atomic detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Our structural analysis based on the PRE revealed that the C1 and C2 closed states utilize different binding interfaces. Importantly, the ligand-free structures of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> are similar to the respective ligand-bound structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulathu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sato et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bosanac et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). This suggests a conformational selection mechanism for K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> target recognition. This mechanism is further supported by conformational energy analysis. The inter-conversion between K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> conformational states and ligand binding are coupled equilibria, and the population for each conformational state weights on the binding affinity towards a respective ligand. For the interaction between K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> and tUIM, an open-state ligand, the change in binding free energy accompanying an E64R<sub>P</sub> mutation can be fully accounted for by the increase in the relative population of the open state. On the other hand, the change in conformational energy also accounts for the difference in binding affinities between wild type and mutant K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> towards closed-state ligands TAB2/TAB3 NZF and A20 ZnF4.</p><p>Together, our ensemble structural refinement and mutational analysis revealed that ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> adopts at least three conformational states, including one open state and two closed states, each of which can accommodate cognate ligands. Closed compact structures have been reported for ligand-free diubiquitins with Lys48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cook et al., 1992</xref>), Lys11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsumoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Castaneda et al., 2013</xref>), Lys29, and Lys33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kristariyanto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Michel et al., 2015</xref>) linkages. These structures are different from the C1 or C2 closed-state conformations of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, and therefore are involved in different functions. As such, a covalent ubiquitin linkage dictates how the two subunits non-covalently interact with each other in a diubiquitin, and resulting quaternary arrangements encode specific cell signals. For K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, the open state recognizes tUIM of Rap80 and is involved in DNA damage repair, the C2 closed state recognizes the NZF domain of TAK1 binding proteins and is involved in the activation of NF-κB signaling, while the C1 state recognizes the ZnF4 domain of A20 and is involved in the termination of NF-κB signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Constructed from repeating units of diubiquitins, a polyubiquitin should exist in a combination of quaternary structures of the diubiquitins and participate in diverse functions.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05767.027</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism for K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> signaling.</title><p>In the absence of a ligand, K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> alternates between an open and two closed states.

A three-conformer representation for each paramagnetic probe at each conjugation site (N25C or K48C) was employed, to thus recapitulate the conformational flexibility for the paramagnetic probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwahara et al., 2004</xref>). With the protein backbone fixed, the dihedral angles for the rotatable bonds between the paramagnetic center and the protein backbone were optimized. Excluding structures with large van der Waals violations, intra-molecular and intra-subunit PREs were calculated for each structure, which were employed as the target values to restrain the spatial distribution of the paramagnetic probes in the subsequent calculations.</p><p>The starting coordinates of each ubiquitin subunit were taken from Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure 1UBQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vijay-Kumar et al., 1987</xref>), and two ubiquitin molecules were patched together with an isopeptide bond between the Lys63 side chain of the proximal unit and the C-terminus of the distal unit. While keeping the coordinates of the distal unit fixed (conjugated with the paramagnetic probes at N25C and K48C sites, each in three-conformer representation), the proximal unit of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> was treated as a rigid body that can rotate and translate as a whole. The Lys63 side chain of the proximal unit and residues 72–76 of the distal unit were given full torsional freedom.</p><p>To initiate the ensemble rigid-body simulated annealing, the coordinates for the proximal unit (also including residues 72–76 of the distal unit) were replicated to make additional members of the ensemble. Each ensemble member was subjected to random rotational and translational movement, and was allowed to overlap. The simulated annealing ensemble refinement was performed with a target function that comprises the inter-subunit PRE restraints for residues 1–71, theoretical intra-subunit PRE restraints to confine the spatial distribution of the paramagnetic probes, the van der Waals repulsive term, and covalent energy terms. Square-well energy potential was used for the PRE term—no energy penalty was given when the back-calculated PRE value was within ± the experimental error of the target value. Residues that are completely broadened out in the paramagnetic spectrum were given a large PRE target value with the lower bound at 120 s<sup>−1</sup>. An apparent PRE correlation time (τ<sub>c</sub> = 7.2 ns) was estimated based on the rotational correlation time of the diamagnetic protein (∼7.6 ns for the closed state) and the large electron relaxation time of the nitroxide spin radical (∼150 ns) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). The population of the closed state was varied from 10% to 90% in 10% increments, which was implemented as a scaling factor for the back-calculated PRE value. In simulated annealing refinement, the PRE energy force constant was ramped from 0.01 to 1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>2</sup>, and the temperature was cooled from 3000 to 25 K. For each combination of closed-state population and number of conformers, 160 structures were calculated. The agreement between the observed and calculated PRE rates was assessed with PRE Q-factor for both conjugation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwahara et al., 2004</xref>). To better visualize the structures, a spherical coordinate system was constructed, with the origin set at the center-of-mass of the distal unit.

The proteins were extensively dialyzed to the same buffer used for NMR, and the SAXS profile for the matching buffer was recorded for background subtraction. To remove high molecular weight aggregate, the protein samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min prior to each experiment, and the upper portion of the supernatant (the concentration was measured again at UV 280 nm) was pipetted and loaded into a quartz cuvette. The sample was placed 306 mm from the detector with a slit width of 10 mm. The SAXS data were collected in 30 min increments for a total of 5 hr (10 hr for the 0.5 mM sample); no difference was found between the first and last frames of SAXS data.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper presents a thorough and nice analysis of the major conformation space of the dynamic K63-linked diubiquitin. The results are of considerable interest for this field, and present also a nice example for a broader community.</p><p>Technically, the work is mostly sound and well done. However, there are a number of concerns and technical issues that should be addressed before considering publication of the manuscript.</p><p>1) The statistical significance and validation of the ensemble selection is not fully clear. The analysis appears biased as simultaneously the number of members in the ensemble and their fractional contribution are varied. The authors simply propose that with four members and a 70% contribution a small Q-factor is observed, but no independent multi-parameter optimization is presented (and may not be possible without additional data). In my view, this is not statistically sound and introduces a bias that represents an overfitting of the data. There is no cross-validation presented (using other experimental data, i.e. with different spin label positions or using other experimental data). It is not clear how the K11Cp or K48Cd PRE data should provide an independent cross-validation, as the data are not shown and interpreted (for cross-validation). Have the authors considered SAXS measurements to provide additional independent data that could help fitting populations if the predicted SAXS data are sufficiently different for the open and closed conformations?</p><p>2) Have the authors analyzed chemical shift differences (comparing single and linked ubiquitins) or looked for potential interdomain NOEs that could support the observed interfaces?</p><p>3) Complete data for ITC data need to be provided, especially considering the important conclusions the authors derive from them. Fitted stoichiometries and blank titrations (dilution heats) should be shown for all ITC data (including replicates). The ITC data for the UBP NZF (prefers C2 state) are not convincing. The authors state that the mutation decreases the affinity by 50%. However, especially taking into account the fitting error it is much less than 50%. It is also not clear the errors indicated are fitting errors or averages and uncertainties from the replicate measurements, which they should be, given the conclusions based on the rather small difference in binding affinities. The authors mention in the Methods section, that they have measured duplicates. They should provide all the ITC measurements in the supplement so that the quality and validity of their conclusions can be assessed. For NZF, it seems that repeating the measurement three or even four times would be necessary.

The analysis appears biased as simultaneously the number of members in the ensemble and their fractional contribution are varied. The authors simply propose that with four members and a 70% contribution a small Q-factor is observed, but no independent multi-parameter optimization is presented (and may not be possible without additional data). In my view, this is not statistically sound and introduces a bias that represents an overfitting of the data.</italic></p><p>We performed the grid search in the ensemble refinement against inter-subunit PRE data, by varying the number of conformers and the population of the closed state. The plot is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> of the revised manuscript, which shows that the PRE Q-factor reaches a minimum with at least four conformers at population of &gt;30%. A more accurate percentage for the closed state can be determined based on mutation and energy analysis. The closed-state population of ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> is consistent with both the smFRET study (Ye et al., Nature 2012) and the dimerization tendency of ubiquitin monomer (Liu et al.<italic>,</italic> Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2012). Further, we deduced that there are at least two distinct closed states of ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> at about 3:1 molar ratio, and the ligand-free structures are similar to the known ligand-bound structures. We linearly combined the back-calculated PREs for the two ligand-bound structures of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> (PDB codes 3OJ3 and 2WX0) with scaling factors of 52.5% and 17.5% (molar ratio of 3:1 with a total population of 70%), respectively. The generated PREs are similar to the experimental data, thus corroborating the robustness of our ensemble refinement against the PRE data. The comparison is presented in Figure 3–figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>There is no cross-validation presented (using other experimental data, i.e. with different spin label positions or using other experimental data). It is not clear how the K11Cp or K48Cd PRE data should provide an independent cross-validation, as the data are not shown and interpreted (for cross-validation).</italic></p><p>We performed ensemble structure refinement against only one set of the PRE data (K25C). We were able to cross-validate the PREs at the other conjugation site, K48C. The back-calculated PRE data agree quite well with the experimental data (free Q-factor 0.46). The result is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Have the authors considered SAXS measurements to provide additional independent data that could help fitting populations if the predicted SAXS data are sufficiently different for the open and closed conformations?</italic></p><p>We did perform SAXS measurement on K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. It should be noted that K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> can noncovalently dimerize. The resulting K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> dimer (or oligomer) has larger molecular weight and scatters more X-ray, even though its population can be quite low. Therefore, interpreting the populations of the constituting conformational states for SAXS would not be straightforward. For the same reason, we used 1:1 equimolar mixture for the PRE reference.</p><p><italic>2) Have the authors analyzed chemical shift differences (comparing single and linked ubiquitins) or looked for potential interdomain NOEs that could support the observed interfaces?</italic></p><p>The chemical shift differences between individual subunits of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> and ubiquitin monomer is very small, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> of the revised manuscript. The chemical shift differences can be either resulted from covalent linkage or due to noncovalent interactions between the two subunits. Therefore we were not able to dissect the contribution of the latter and unambiguously map the interface.</p><p>We also attempted to measure inter-subunit NOEs between <sup>13</sup>C-labeled proximal unit and unlabeled distal unit using a half-filtered scheme, but to no avail. Our data are consistent with the previous NMR studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varadan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tenno et al., 2004</xref>). In the latter work the authors failed to detect cross-saturations between the two subunits.</p><p><italic>3) Complete data for ITC data need to be provided, especially considering the important conclusions the authors derive from them. Fitted stoichiometries and blank titrations (dilution heats) should be shown for all ITC data (including replicates). The ITC data for the UBP NZF (prefers C2 state) are not convincing. The authors state that the mutation decreases the affinity by 50%. However, especially taking into account the fitting error it is much less than 50%. It is also not clear the errors indicated are fitting errors or averages and uncertainties from the replicate measurements, which they should be, given the conclusions based on the rather small difference in binding affinities. The authors mention in the Methods section, that they have measured duplicates. They should provide all the ITC measurements in the supplement so that the quality and validity of their conclusions can be assessed. For NZF, it seems that repeating the measurement three or even four times would be necessary.</italic></p><p>For each ITC titration experiments reported in the manuscript, we repeated for at least four times. In addition, for each ligand to K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> titration, we performed ligand to buffer titration accordingly, for separate background subtraction. The reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values (as well as ΔH and ΔS) values are average ± SD over all the ITC fitting results.</p><p><italic>Also, as the authors say that the mutations should have a stronger impact on the C1 state, it would therefore be informative that the authors do similar ITC measurements and analyses with a C1 ligand, e.g. the mentioned antibody, to further corroborate the conclusions.</italic></p><p>We realized that the antibody-bound maybe not be an ideal ligand to illustrate the target recognition mechanism of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. Firstly, an antibody/antigen complex is much tighter than a typical signaling complex, and therefore induced fit may play a bigger role in the binding process. Secondly, in the antibody complex structure of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> ((PDB codes 3DVN and 3DVG), two extra residues were left at the N-terminus of the distal unit (Newton et al., Cell 2008), which may perturb the conformational space of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. We also predicted the inter-subunit PREs with MTS conjugation at K48C site, had the ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> adopts a structure similar to this complex structure. The resulting PRE profile is different from the experimental one, and therefore, such structure may not be present at a significant population for ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>During the revision process, we found another physiological ligand of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, the fourth zinc finger domain of ubiquitin editing enzyme A20. Though A20 ZnF4 specifically binds to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin (Bosanac et al. Mol. Cell. 2010), the structure (PDB code 3OJ3) was only determined for the complex of A20/ubiquitin monomer (which however contains multiple ubiquitins in one asymmetric unit). This was the reason that we overlooked this ligand in the first place. The C1-state structure obtained for ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> is very similar to the complex structure with ZnF4. When introducing E64R<sub>P</sub> mutation, the binding affinity between K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> and ZnF4 is weakened by about three fold.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should illustrate that the spin labels introduced do not directly interfere with either the open or the closed state structures, or potentially increase the tendency towards a closed state structure. This should be shown by highlighting the position of K11/K48 in structural figures (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) for K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> alone, and when to bound to the two ligands investigated.</italic></p><p><italic>In addition, the authors should also verify that the spin labels themselves do not affect binding of the ligands, i.e. by comparing ITC data for wild type and spin labeled proteins.</italic></p><p>We have illustrated the mutation site and conjugated paramagnetic probe in the complex structures, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref> of the revised manuscript. These modifications are distant from the bound ligands and from the other subunit.</p><p>We have compared paramagnetic spectrum with the reference spectrum, and we assessed the binding affinities for the modified K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> using ITC towards NZF and tUIM. Among the two conjugation sites we used previously, K11C conjugated protein displays some chemical shift perturbations, and the bindings affinity towards tUIM is significantly increased. Finally, we identified N25C site at the distal unit that gives good inter-subunit PREs: conjugation of the paramagnetic probe at this site does not cause NMR chemical shift perturbations, nor affect the binding affinities towards K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> ligands. In addition, conjugation of a different kind of paramagnetic probe, EDTA-Mn<sup>2+</sup>, at N25C site, affords inter-subunit PREs of similar profile as the MTS probe. These control experiments are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3 fig1s4 fig1s6">Figure 1–figure supplement 3, 4, and 6</xref> of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) The authors propose that the reduced τ<sub>c</sub> values for the charge reversal mutation indicates a shift to more open conformations. However, it could also be that the charges also reduce the (known) tendency of (di)ubiquitin to dimerize. Can the authors rule out this possibility? Have they measured relaxation data for the monomer harboring the same charge reversals?</italic></p><p>We performed the R<sub>1</sub>/R<sub>2</sub> experiments at a lower protein concentration (50 µM). The difference in τ<sub>c</sub> values of the wild type and mutant K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> diminishes. Therefore, it is likely that the difference we observed at higher concentration (500 µM) is due to different dimerizing tendencies for the wild type and mutant proteins. Thus we removed related sections about relaxation measurements.</p><p><italic>6) The Abstract is phrased as addressing a biophysical rather than an important biological/biochemical problem. Also the compact introduction may appeal more to a smaller expert community. On both I would suggest to change the emphasis towards the biochemical result and its possible biological impact, and add a short section to the Introduction and Discussion.</italic></p><p>We have carefully revised the Abstract, Introduction and final Discussion, in particular about how different conformational states are involved in different functions of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>.

Judging from the closed-state structures (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>), the E64R mutation should have a larger impact on the C1 state than one the C2 state, which were supported by the experimental data. Note that electrostatic attraction or repulsion is 1/r distance dependent, and can be effective even though the C-terminal tail of the distal unit is flexible.</p><p><italic>8) Published literature where multi-domain conformations have been studied should be appropriately referenced, i.e. work by the groups of Berlin/Fushman (theoretical analysis), Blackledge, Luchinat, Sattler, Grzesiek, Kay and others (using PRE, RDC, SAXS data).</italic></p><p>We have added several relevant references about characterizing the dynamics of multi-domain/subunit proteins.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) The authors suggest that the use of SAXS data, which could help fitting populations, is not feasible as K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, or mono-Ub dimerize non-covalently and this strongly affects the scattering.

The <italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub> values of the SAXS data are larger at higher concentrations than the values at lower concentrations. This indicates the contribution from intermolecular species, presumably high-order noncovalent ubiquitin oligomers.

Nevertheless, owing to the limited resolution of SAXS and possible contribution from higher-order oligomers, multiple conformational states cannot be resolved from the SAXS.</p><p>The SAXS data are now reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (including two supplementary figures) of the revised manuscript.
