experience-dependent manner. In the human cortex, however, direct experimental evidence for coordinated structural and functional synaptic adaptation is currently lacking. Here, we probed synaptic plasticity in human cortical slices using the vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), a putative treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Our experiments demonstrated that the excitatory synapses of superficial (layer 2/3) pyramidal neurons underwent coordinated structural and functional changes in the presence of atRA. These synaptic adaptations were accompanied by ultrastructural remodeling of the calcium-storing spine apparatus organelle and required mRNA translation. It was not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice, which lack spine apparatus organelles. We conclude that atRA is a potent mediator of synaptic plasticity in the adult human cortex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain has an enormous capacity to adapt to its environment. This ability to continuously learn and form new memories thanks to its malleability, is known as brain plasticity. One of the most important mechanisms behind brain plasticity is the change in both the structure and function of synapses, the points of contact between neurons where communication happens. These sites of synaptic contact occur through microscopic protrusions on the branches of neurons, called dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are very dynamic, changing their shape and size in response to stimuli.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that alterations in synaptic plasticity occur in various animal models of brain diseases. However, it remains unclear whether human cortical neurons express synaptic plasticity similarly to those in the rodent brain. Recently, a derivative of vitamin A has been linked to synaptic plasticity. In addition, several studies have evaluated the effects of this derivative in patients with cognitive dysfunctions, including Alzheimer’s disease, Fragile X syndrome, and depression. However, there is no direct experimental evidence for synaptic plasticity in the adult human cerebral cortex related to vitamin A signaling and metabolism.</p><p>To investigate this, Lenz et al. used human cortical slices prepared from neurosurgical resections and treated them with a solution of the vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid for 6-10 hours. Lenz et al. employed a variety of techniques, including patch-clamp recordings to measure neuron function as well as different types of microscopy to evaluate structural changes in dendritic spines. These experiments demonstrated that the derivative promoted the synaptic plasticity in the adult human cortex. Specifically, it increased the size of the dendritic spines and strengthened their ability to transmit signals. In addition, Lenz et al. found that the spine apparatus organelle – a structure found in some dendritic spines – was a target of the vitamin A derivative and promoted synaptic plasticity.</p><p>These findings advance the understanding of the pathways through which vitamin A derivatives affect synaptic plasticity, which may aide the development of new therapeutic strategies for brain diseases. More generally, the results contribute to the identification of key mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in the adult human brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptopodin</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>human cortex</kwd><kwd>vitamine A</kwd><kwd>retinoic acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010794</institution-id><institution>Faculty of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EQUIP-Medical Scientist</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lenz</surname><given-names>Maximilian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010794</institution-id><institution>Faculty of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Berta-Ottenstein-Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Straehle</surname><given-names>Jakob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 1080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deller</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Vlachos</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vlachos</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The vitamin A derivative, all-trans retinoic acid, induces protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity in the human brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability of neurons to express plasticity by responding to specific stimuli with structural and functional changes is critical for physiological brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Citri and Malenka, 2008</xref>).

In support of this hypothesis, atRA application in our study triggered changes in spine head size in both synaptopodin-positive and synaptopodin-negative spines from human cortical slices, suggesting that the rapid/initial atRA-mediated spine enlargement does not require the actual presence of synaptopodin clusters, that is, spine apparatus organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>). Considering that synaptopodin clusters are highly dynamic structures that can change their position within spines, and may appear in existing spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yap et al., 2020</xref>), it is interesting to speculate that atRA may trigger a molecular cascade that promotes rapid spine growth, even in spines that do not contain a spine apparatus organelle, eventually leading to the formation and enlargement of spine apparatus organelles. However, more work is required to identify the precise downstream signaling pathways through which atRA mediates synaptopodin- and protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity in the adult human cortex. Similarly, the role of synaptopodin in atRA-mediated changes in intrinsic cellular properties, for example, reductions in the input resistance of principal neurons in the mouse cortex, warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of recent work on the distinct electrical properties of human and murine cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gidon et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Both atRA and synaptopodin have been linked to the expression of Hebbian and homeostatic synaptic plasticity in rodent brain tissue and are associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent AMPA receptor synthesis and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arendt et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vlachos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>). In turn, alterations in retinoid signaling and synaptopodin expression have been associated with synaptic plasticity defects in pathological brain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bremner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maggio and Vlachos, 2014</xref>). Considering that increased sEPSC amplitudes and frequencies were observed in the cortical neurons of <italic>Synpo<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, it would be interesting to evaluate whether alterations in retinoid metabolism are present in this mouse model. Accordingly, alterations in synaptopodin expression and retinoid signaling have been observed in the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodman and Pardee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mingaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Misner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reddy et al., 2005</xref>). Given that retinoids have been proposed as a potential therapeutic avenue for Alzheimer’s disease-associated cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Endres et al., 2014</xref>), it is conceivable that atRA may act – at least in part – by modulating synaptopodin expression, thereby improving the ability of adult human cortical neurons to express synaptic plasticity. We are confident that the translational approach used in this study investigating both murine and human cortical slices will facilitate the identification of key mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in the adult human brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Synaptopodin <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 163002 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_887825">AB_887825</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (‘1:1000’) <break/>EM (‘1:100’)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-NeuN <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat#: ab104225 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10711153">AB_10711153</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (‘1:500’)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 <break/>(Goat polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat#: A-11034, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2576217">AB_2576217</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (‘1:1000’)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor Plus 555 <break/>(Goat polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat#: A-32732, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2633281">AB_2633281</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (‘1:1000’)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Rabbit IgG Nanogold-Fab' <break/>(goat polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Nanoprobes</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46135#bib19">Cat#:</ext-link> 2004 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2631182">AB_2631182</ext-link></td><td valign="top">EM (‘1:100’)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>), male and female</td><td valign="top">Sample</td><td valign="top">Biobank of the Department for Neurosurgery at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, AZ 472/15_160880</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Approval of the Local Ethics Committee, University of Freiburg, AZ 593/19</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">DAPI (1 mg/ml in water)</td><td valign="top">Thermo Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 62248</td><td valign="top">IF and post hoc labeling (‘1:5000’)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Pierce16% Formaldehyde (w/v), methanol-free</td><td valign="top">Thermo Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 28906</td><td valign="top">Final concentration: (4% in PBS)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Glutardialdehyd</td><td valign="top">Carl Roth</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 4157.2</td><td valign="top">Final concentration: 2.5% (TEM) and 0.1% (Immunogold)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">All-trans retinoic acid</td><td valign="top">Sigma–Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat#: R2625</td><td valign="top">Final concentration: 1 µM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Anisomycin</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat#: ab120495</td><td valign="top">Final concentration: 10 µM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Actinomycin D</td><td valign="top">Sigma–Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat#: A9415</td><td valign="top">Final concentration: 5 µg/ml</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">HQ Silver Enhancement Kit</td><td valign="top">Nanoprobes</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 2012</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/><italic>Mus musculus</italic>, male</td><td valign="top">B6.129-Synpo<sup>tm1Mndl</sup>/Dllr;

For experiments with acute mouse brain slices, superficial (layer 2/3) pyramidal cells in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex were visually identified using an LN-Scope (Luigs and Neumann, Ratingen, Germany) equipped with infrared dot-contrast and a 40× water-immersion objective (numerical aperture [NA] 0.8; Olympus). For experiments with human cortical slices, superficial (layer 2/3) pyramidal cells were visually identified on the pia-white matter axis at a distance of 500–1000 µm from the pial surface. Electrophysiological signals were amplified using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, digitized with a Digidata 1550B digitizer, and visualized with the pClamp 11 software package. For sEPSC and intrinsic cellular property recordings, patch pipettes (tip resistance: 3–5 MΩ) contained (in mM) 126 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 10 PO-creatine, and 0.3% (w/v) biocytin (pH = 7.25 with KOH; 285 mOsm/kg). For sEPSC recordings, pyramidal neurons were held at −70 mV in voltage-clamp mode. To record intrinsic cellular properties in current-clamp mode, a pipette capacitance of 2.0 pF was corrected, and series resistance was compensated using the automated bridge balance tool of the Multiclamp commander. Input–output (I-V) curves were generated by injecting 1-s square pulse currents starting at −100 pA and increasing in 10 pA increments (sweep duration: 2 s).

The series resistance of one cell from a human cortical slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; control group) exceeded 30 MΩ during I-V curve recording. The respective I-V-curve was therefore excluded from further analysis. In five human superficial pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the number of sweeps in the I-V curve recordings was lower compared to other recordings (40 sweeps vs. 60 sweeps). Thus, cells were excluded from further analysis of action potential frequency. Furthermore, one I-V-curve recording in the actinomycin-only treated group became unstable during the last sweeps and was consecutively excluded from action potential frequency analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For the in-sample analysis of human cortical slices (paired experimental design), we used a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. p-values&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001); results that did not yield significant differences are designated ‘ns’. Statistical differences in XY-plots were indicated in the legend of the figure panels (*) when detected through multiple comparisons, irrespective of their localization and the level of significance. In the text and figures, values represent the mean ± standard error of the mean (s.e.m.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Graphical illustrations</title><p>Figures were prepared using Photoshop graphics software (Adobe, San Jose, CA).

reporting the acute effect of retinoic acid on excitatory synaptic transmission and its underlying mechanisms in human cortical neurons is very timely and important.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael A Sutton (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>All three reviewers are highly enthusiastic about the study reporting the acute effects of retinoic acid on excitatory synaptic transmission and its underlying mechanisms.

Aside from some minor comments that require minimal additional experiments or further clarification, the reviewers expressed one major concern regarding the dentate gyrus LTP data. Although further experiments are required to clarify the concerns, the reviewers recommended removing the LTP figure from the present study as it is not well connected with the rest of the study. Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>1) The LTP experiments are a bit problematic for several reasons.

The effects of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) on excitatory neurotransmission (i.e., the main focus of the present study) are readily observed in both mouse and human cortical slices. In contrast, synaptopodin-deficient superficial (layer 2/3) pyramidal neurons do not exhibit atRAmediated synaptic strengthening. While it is worth noting that atRA-mediated synaptic plasticity is not observed in the dentate gyrus of synaptopodin-deficient mice, the reviewers have raised several valid, important points here (e.g., pertaining to baseline synaptic transmission and possible metaplastic effects in the mouse dentate gyrus). Indeed, the work of Arendt et al., (2015) must be carefully considered in this context. Following the reviewers’ recommendation, we decided to remove these results from the revised version of our manuscript and will use them in a follow-up communication. Julia Muellerleile and Peter Jedlicka, who were responsible for performing these experiments, are no longer listed as coauthors. Instead, their input has been acknowledged in the revised manuscript. We will address the reviewers’ questions in a detailed follow-up study, “atRA-mediated (meta)plasticity in the mouse dentate gyrus”. However, our results obtained in the mouse dentate gyrus in vivo will remain available to the research community via the preprint of the present manuscript on bioRxiv (Lenz et al., 2020; bioRxiv, doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.267104">https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.267104</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding the experiments in synaptopodin deficient mice, in both WT neurons (stated in main text, not in figure) and rescue neurons (Figure 3B), the baseline sEPSC amplitudes are significantly smaller than those of the KO neurons. Some discussion of this observation is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this careful observation. Previous work revealed no major differences in the baseline structural and functional properties of excitatory synapses in the dentate gyrus or CA1 between wild type and synaptopodin-deficient mice (e.g., Deller et al., 2003; Vlachos et al., 2013). However, based on the data in the present manuscript, layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse mPFC appear to behave differently.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ concern, we carried out another series of single-cell recordings in cortical slices from synaptopodin-deficient mice and their age- and time-matched wild type littermates. While the basic intrinsic properties of these cortical neurons were not significantly different between the groups (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1), the amplitudes and frequencies of sEPSCs (spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents) were increased in synaptopodin-deficient preparations (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Transgenic expression of GFP/Synpo rescued the effects of synaptopodin deficiency on sEPSC amplitudes (but not frequency) and restored the ability of neurons to express atRA-mediated excitatory synaptic strengthening (c.f., revised Figure 3). Results obtained from wild type mice are now presented in Figure 3.</p><p>Accordingly, the text of the revised manuscript now reads:</p><p>“In Synpo<sup>-/-</sup> preparations, no significant changes in sEPSC properties were observed following atRA treatment (Figure 3C, D), thus demonstrating the relevance of synaptopodin in atRA-mediated synaptic plasticity. Additionally, a reduction in the input resistance was not observed in atRA-treated Synpo<sup>-/-</sup>preparations (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, the active and passive membrane properties of Synpo<sup>+/+</sup> and Synpo<sup>-/-</sup> neurons were indistinguishable (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), despite significant increases in the baseline sEPSC properties of Synpo<sup>-/-</sup> preparations (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>We provide further speculation and offer potential avenues for future research in the Discussion, as follows:</p><p>“Considering that increased sEPSC amplitudes and frequencies were observed in the cortical neurons of Synpo<sup>-/-</sup> mice, it would be interesting to evaluate whether alterations in retinoid metabolism are present in this mouse model.”</p><p>“Similarly, the role of synaptopodin in atRA-mediated changes in intrinsic cellular properties, e.g., reductions in the input resistance of principal neurons in the mouse cortex, warrant further investigation, particularly in the context of recent work on the distinct electrical properties of human and murine cortical neurons (Gidon et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1C illustrates responses of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons to intracellular current injection. While the passive membrane properties are quantified and similar regardless of atRA exposure, it is not clear if atRA affects intrinsic excitability of these neurons (i.e., the number of spikes elicited by different levels of injected current). These data should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. Action potential frequencies as a function of injected current are presented in the revised version of our manuscript, as alterations therein were observed at high current injections in the presence of actinomycin D or anisomycin (see revised Figure 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Interestingly, a reduction in the input resistance of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons was seen in wild type mice but not in synaptopodin-deficient animals. However, since our study focused on the structural and functional changes of excitatory synapses in the human cortex, further follow up on these interesting findings is outside the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>Accordingly, the text now reads: “Since no major changes in active or passive membrane properties were detected in these initial experiments, we focused on the effects of atRA on excitatory synapses and dendritic spines.”</p><p>Results pertaining to intrinsic cellular properties are provided in the supplementary information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The pharmacological treatments (ActD, anisomycin etc.) in this study are in general very long (6 hr) compared to conventional methods (less than 2 hr). To control for potential toxicity associated with prolonged treatment, vehicle control should be added in both Figure 5 and Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that needs further clarification. Thank you. During the experiments with acute slice preparations, we did not observe any overt signs of toxicity. For example, we established a giga-ohm seal in whole-cell recordings of neurons in each group with equal success. The plasma membranes behaved normally when approached with the patch pipette. Likewise, no apparent signs of extensive cell death within the tissue were evident under brightfield microscopy. However, we decided to err on the side of caution and carry out the following additional experiments:</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, vehicle-only controls were included in experiments with each pharmacological agent (i.e., actinomycin D and anisomycin); these experiments confirmed our primary results (new Figure 4). Please note that baseline synaptic transmission in the mouse neocortex was not affected by anisomycin or actinomycin D (Figure 4). Similarly, anisomycin did not affect sEPSC properties in human cortical slices (Figure 5). Although these experiments do not directly demonstrate a lack of toxicity, alterations in neurotransmission and network activity are readily observed when neurons die.</p><p>We also analyzed the active and passive membrane properties of all neurons recorded in Figure 4 (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Accordingly, the text now reads:</p><p>“To control for possible toxic effects, the basic active and passive membrane properties of cortical slices treated with actinomycin D or vehicle-only were recorded (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Other than a reduction in AP frequencies at high-current injections, we did not observe any significant differences between the two groups (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Moreover, baseline sEPSC properties were indistinguishable between actinomycin D- and vehicle-treated slices (Figure 4A). However, we observed a significant increase in the amplitudes of AMPA receptor-mediated sEPSCs in the atRA-treated group in both vehicle-only and actinomycin D co-incubated slices (Figure 4A, B), thus further confirming that atRA mediates synaptic strengthening.”</p><p>“Anisomycin incubation had no major effects on passive membrane properties, while reductions in AP frequencies were observed at high-current injections (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). In contrast to our experiments with actinomycin D (Figure 4C), however, no significant changes in sEPSC amplitudes were detected in the presence of both atRA and anisomycin (Figure 4C, D).”</p><p>Please also note that synaptopodin cluster sizes, as well as the sizes of synaptopodin(+) and synaptopodin(-) spine heads (Figure 5), were comparable in control and anisomycin-treated human cortical slices (c.f., Figure 2). Therefore, we are confident that our results cannot be readily attributed to neurotoxic effects of actinomycin D and anisomycin.</p></body></sub-article></article>
