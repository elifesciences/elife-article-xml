Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates act by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway in bone-resorbing osteoclasts but, surprisingly, also appear to reduce the risk of death from pneumonia. We overturn the long-held belief that these drugs act only in the skeleton and show that a fluorescently labelled bisphosphonate is internalised by alveolar macrophages and large peritoneal macrophages in vivo. Furthermore, a single dose of a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) in mice was sufficient to inhibit the mevalonate pathway in tissue-resident macrophages, causing the build-up of a mevalonate metabolite and preventing protein prenylation. Importantly, one dose of bisphosphonate enhanced the immune response to bacterial endotoxin in the lung and increased the level of cytokines and chemokines in bronchoalveolar fluid. These studies suggest that bisphosphonates, as well as preventing bone loss, may boost immune responses to infection in the lung and provide a mechanistic basis to fully examine the potential of bisphosphonates to help combat respiratory infections that cause pneumonia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>pneumonia</kwd><kwd>bisphosphonate</kwd><kwd>prenylation</kwd><kwd>alveolar macrophage</kwd><kwd>inflammasome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>NHMRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1079522</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rogers</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Perpetual IMPACT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Munoz</surname><given-names>Marcia A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>NHMRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1175134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansbro</surname><given-names>Philip M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fletcher</surname><given-names>Emma K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mrs Janice Gibson and the Ernest Heine Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rogers</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>As well as preventing bone loss, bisphosphonate drugs may boost early immune responses in the lung by acting directly on alveolar macrophages that form one of the first lines of defence against infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) are a class of bone-seeking drugs used worldwide as the frontline treatment for disorders of excessive bone resorption such as post-menopausal osteoporosis and cancer-associated bone disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Russell, 2011</xref>). By virtue of their avidity for calcium ions, N-BPs bind rapidly to the skeleton, where they are internalised by bone-degrading osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Russell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>). Intracellularly, N-BPs disable osteoclast function by inhibiting the enzyme farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase in the mevalonate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Beek et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunford et al., 2001</xref>), thereby preventing the post-translational prenylation of small GTPase proteins necessary for osteoclast function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luckman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fisher et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>There is increasing evidence that N-BP drugs, such as zoledronic acid (ZOL), have benefits beyond preventing bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Center et al., 2020</xref>), and, unexpectedly, N-BP therapy has recently been linked to reduced risk of mortality from pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colón-Emeric et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sing et al., 2020</xref>). In a randomised, controlled trial of &gt;2000 hip fracture patients, ZOL therapy reduced the risk of death by 28% compared to placebo infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lyles et al., 2007</xref>). Retrospective analysis also suggested that ZOL-treated patients were less likely to die from pneumonia than placebo-treated subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colón-Emeric et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, a ‘real-world’ population-based, observational study of hip fracture patients aged 50 years or above also showed a significant reduction in risk of pneumonia and pneumonia mortality in hip fracture patients that had received N-BP therapy compared to no treatment or other osteoporosis medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sing et al., 2020</xref>). Similar findings were reported in the post hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial of ZOL in women over the age of 65 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reid et al., 2021</xref>). Pneumonia is the most frequent cause of admission to ICU, and a study of long-term patients in respiratory ICU revealed a significant reduction in mortality in people treated with the N-BP pamidronate compared to those without treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schulman et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, in a retrospective cohort study of ICU subjects, we showed a 59% reduction in mortality in patients treated with bisphosphonate prior to hospitalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the surprising beneficial effects of these drugs on pneumonia and in ICU patients are unknown.</p><p>Globally, respiratory diseases constitute the most common cause of death, and thus, therapies that boost the immune response to common lung infections are urgently needed. Bacterial infections such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia pneumoniae,</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> are the main cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Importantly, these pathogens also underlie severe complications of viral respiratory disease that can significantly increase morbidity and mortality. For example, influenza-related mortality is often associated with pneumonia caused by co- or secondary bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morris et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we debunk the long-held view that N-BP drugs act only in the skeleton in healthy mice and show that even a single dose of N-BP in mice is sufficient to affect tissue-resident macrophages, including lung alveolar macrophages (AMΦ), boosting their response to bacterial endotoxin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Systemically administered N-BP is internalised by tissue-resident macrophages outside the skeleton</title><p>We previously reported that cultured macrophages and tumour-associated macrophages in vivo, like osteoclasts, have the ability to internalise N-BP by endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Junankar et al., 2015</xref>).

Like most other fluorescently labelled N-BPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roelofs et al., 2010</xref>), AF647-ZOL did not inhibit protein prenylation compared to the parent N-BP (ZOL) when tested in cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), but can be used to track drug uptake by cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Junankar et al., 2015</xref>). Animals were injected with a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of AF647-ZOL, and cells collected by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were analysed by flow cytometry. In the absence of immune challenge in mice, approximately 90% of cells in BAL were AMΦ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In contrast, the CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>int</sup> small PMΦ incorporated negligible amounts of fluorescently labelled ZOL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). The reason why uptake of N-BP occurred selectively in large PMΦ rather than in small PMΦ remains to be determined, although these subsets differ in their origin, phenotype, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cassado Ados et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the well-described uptake of N-BP by osteoclasts in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coxon et al., 2008</xref>), these findings clearly demonstrate that N-BP can also be efficiently internalised in vivo by tissue-resident macrophages outside the skeleton, including AMΦ in the lung and LPMΦ in the peritoneal cavity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A single i.v. dose of N-BP is sufficient to inhibit the mevalonate pathway in alveolar and peritoneal macrophages</title><p>Despite the rapid bone-targeting property of N-BPs, it has been shown in rodents that small amounts of ZOL can accumulate in soft tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green and Rogers, 2002</xref>); however, the concentrations that can be achieved are unknown. To determine whether tissue-resident macrophages can incorporate sufficient N-BP in vivo to have a pharmacologic effect, we analysed two biochemical outcomes that, together, are reliable features of intracellular N-BP action in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>): (i) the cytoplasmic build-up of the upstream metabolite isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Räikkönen et al., 2009</xref>); and (ii) reduced production of the isoprenoid lipid geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), with the consequent accumulation of unprenylated small GTPase proteins including those of the Rab and Rho superfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luckman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

Importantly, ZOL treatment also resulted in a marked accumulation of unprenylated Rab proteins in BAL and PL cell samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). It is unlikely that such an effect of N-BP on protein prenylation in macrophages in vivo could have been detected using the relatively insensitive western blot approach previously employed to study bone-resorbing osteoclasts, which engulf large amounts of N-BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frith et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>). However, the development of a much more sensitive in vitro prenylation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2015</xref>) now allows the detection of subtle effects on protein prenylation in cells outside the skeleton that may internalise much smaller quantities of N-BP.</p><p>Together with the evidence for uptake of N-BP by AMΦ and large PMΦ and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), these findings demonstrate unequivocally that systemic administration of N-BP has pharmacological activity outside the skeleton in healthy mice. We show that a single dose of ZOL is sufficient to inhibit the mevalonate pathway in tissue-resident macrophages (AMΦ and PMΦ), causing a build-up of IPP/DMAPP metabolites and an accumulation of unprenylated small GTPase proteins – characteristic hallmarks of N-BP action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>). Although still to be confirmed in humans, our findings overturn the long-standing textbook paradigm that N-BP drugs, which have been in clinical use for several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Russell, 2011</xref>), act only in the skeleton. Our findings also shed new light on the commonest side effect of N-BP therapy, a transient acute phase response. This was previously thought to be caused by the accumulation of IPP in circulating monocytes, which then activates Vγ9Vδ2-T cells to produce TNFα and IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roelofs et al., 2009</xref>). Our findings suggest that tissue-resident macrophages, such as AMΦ and large PMΦ, are in fact a more likely source of the IPP responsible for the activation of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Treatment with N-BP in vivo enhances the production of cytokines and chemokines in response to immune challenge</title><p>We recently reported that loss of protein prenylation in cultured monocytes promotes the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in increased caspase-1-mediated processing of pro-IL-1β following bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skinner et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we next examined whether N-BP-mediated inhibition of protein prenylation in tissue-resident macrophages alters the response to LPS in vivo, particularly in the lung.

LPS challenge of ZOL-treated mice also resulted in a significant elevation in IL-1β in peritoneal fluid, and CCL2 and CCL5 in serum, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Furthermore, peritoneal cells from ZOL-treated mice produced almost three times more IL-1β upon ex vivo stimulation with LPS and nigericin (a well-described NLRP3 activator) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) than cells from control mice. IL-1β is primarily produced by monocytes/macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kany et al., 2019</xref>), the predominant cell type in PL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, our results strongly suggest that macrophages are the most likely source of IL-1β in PL fluid. Importantly, treating the mice with ZOL did not cause IL-1β release from peritoneal cells stimulated ex vivo with LPS in the absence of nigericin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), and this is in accord with our previous finding that inhibition of the mevalonate pathway alone does not trigger NLRP3 inflammasome assembly but enhances its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skinner et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The observations described here begin to provide a plausible mechanistic explanation for the decreased risk of pneumonia mortality associated with N-BP treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colón-Emeric et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reid et al., 2021</xref>). AMΦ are one of the first lines of defence against common respiratory tract infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Byrne et al., 2015</xref>), and inhibition of the mevalonate pathway in these cells may help boost the initial response to bacterial as well as viral lung infections by a variety of routes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). First, uptake of N-BP into cells causes the accumulation of IPP/DMAPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), which activates human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thompson and Rogers, 2004</xref>). Vγ9Vδ2-T cells are non-conventional T cells with potent antibacterial and antiviral activity that recognise phosphoantigens, including IPP, derived from the mevalonate or DOXP pathways in bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tanaka et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jomaa et al., 1999</xref>). There is considerable interest in the use of N-BP-expanded γ,δ-T cells as an immunotherapy for cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clézardin and Massaia, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanaka, 2020</xref>) as well as viral diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Juno and Kent, 2020</xref>). Indeed, N-BP-expanded Vγ9Vδ2-T cells reduce disease severity and mortality from influenza A virus (IAV) infection in humanised mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Second, the genome of some pathogens such as IAV encodes proteins with a prenylation motif, which require the host cells' mevalonate pathway to enable prenylation and allow pathogen propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marakasova et al., 2017</xref>). Agents that block the mevalonate pathway (such as statins) or that inhibit prenylation (such as lonafarnib, currently in clinical trials for hepatitis delta virus infection), have well-described antiviral or antimicrobial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parihar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Einav and Glenn, 2003</xref>). Intriguingly, simvastatin was shown to improve outcomes in hospitalised older adults with community-acquired pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sapey et al., 2019</xref>). Third, inhibition of FPP synthase by N-BP in AMΦ mimics the decreased flux through the mevalonate pathway in macrophages in response to endogenous IFN signalling, which serves to limit viral uptake and replication by several mechanisms including the synthesis of 25-hydroxycholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robertson and Ghazal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cyster et al., 2014</xref>). Fourth, lack of protein prenylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) enhances NLRP3 inflammasome activation and promotes the release of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skinner et al., 2019</xref>). IL-1β is a central mediator of the innate immune response that orchestrates the production of a cascade of cytokines and chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garlanda et al., 2013</xref>). Our observation that systemic ZOL treatment significantly enhanced the release of IL-1β and several other cytokines and chemokines in lung, peritoneum, and serum after LPS challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is consistent with increased inflammasome activation. Our findings are also consistent with previous reports suggesting that ZOL treatment causes polarisation of tumour-associated macrophages towards an M1-like, pro-inflammatory phenotype by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coscia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Comito et al., 2017</xref>). Further studies are necessary to determine exactly how ZOL alters the phenotype of AMΦ. Importantly however, despite the ability of ZOL to enhance cytokine and chemokine production, to our knowledge there is no evidence that N-BP therapy exacerbates lung inflammation in pneumonia patients and, on the contrary, N-BP treatment appears to have a beneficial effect on pneumonia risk and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colón-Emeric et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reid et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Potential routes of antimicrobial activity of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (N-BP) via effects on the mevalonate pathway in alveolar macrophages.</title><p>Inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase by N-BP prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids required for normal protein prenylation (step 1). Lack of prenylation leads to enhanced inflammasome activation and increased IL-1β release in response to bacterial endotoxin, boosting the initial inflammatory response and pathogen clearance. Lack of isoprenoid biosynthesis may also hinder the propagation of intracellular pathogens that depend on the host cells' mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of FPP synthase by N-BP causes the accumulation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP)/dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) phosphoantigens (step 2) capable of triggering activation and proliferation of human Vγ9VδT cells with antimicrobial activity. Inhibition of FPP synthase by N-BP may also mimic the endogenous antiviral effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), one of the routes by which IFN signalling suppresses the flux through the mevalonate pathway.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72430-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Finally, it is noteworthy that ZOL was recently identified, using computational biology approaches, as one of the 200 clinically approved drugs that are predicted to target pathways induced by SARS-CoV-2 and could be suitable for drug repurposing against COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2021</xref>).

These findings add further weight to the view that N-BP therapy has benefits beyond just preventing bone loss and could be considered as prophylactic treatment to reduce the risk of pneumonia in individuals with osteopenia or osteoporosis, who are already eligible for bisphosphonate treatment under standard clinical guidelines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"

PL cells were collected by injecting 5 mL of solution into the peritoneal cavity, and BAL cells by pooling three consecutive 1.5 mL washes administered via an insertion in the trachea. To generate BMDM, the femora and tibiae of adult mice were flushed with sterile PBS. Bone marrow cells were cultured for 4 days in Petri dishes in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, 50 units/mL penicillin; 50 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco) and 50 ng/mL rhM-CSF (Sino Biological), in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>A single dose (47.5 μg /40 nmoles) of AF647-ZOL (BioVinc, CA) or 500 μg/kg ZOL (or saline vehicle) was administered i.v. in a final volume of 100 μL. Uptake of AF647-ZOL was assessed in BAL and PL cells 4 hr later. For LPS challenge, mice were treated with i.v. ZOL 48 hr prior to administration of i.n. LPS (10 μg LPS in 20 μL saline) or i.p. LPS (100 μg in 200 μL saline). Cell viability and total cell numbers in BAL and PL were assessed by trypan blue staining using a Corning CytoSMART cell counter. For flow cytometric analysis, cells were pre-incubated with mouse-Fc block and viability marker (Zombie Aqua viability stain, 1:700), prepared in calcium/magnesium-free PBS (Gibco), before staining with fluorescently conjugated antibodies prepared in staining buffer (2 mM EDTA, 0.02% azide; 0.5% foetal calf serum, in calcium/magnesium-free PBS). Antibodies and dilutions are listed in the Key resources table. Samples were analysed using a BD LSRII SORP flow cytometer/DIVA software. The post-acquisition analysis was performed using FlowJo 10.6.2 (BD).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>LC-MS/MS analysis of IPP/DMAPP</title><p>10-week-old female mice were administered a single 100 μL retro-orbital i.v. dose of 500 μg/kg ZOL (or saline control). Animals were culled 48 hr later, and bronchoalveolar cells and peritoneal cells were collected by pooling the BAL or PL lavages from n = 8 mice (BAL) or n = 5 mice (PL). Cell pellets were then stored at –80°C. For analysis of IPP/DMAPP, 1 mL cold extraction solvent (80:20 methanol:water) was added to the cell pellets, then vortexed for 10 s and incubated in a ultrasonic bath filled with ice water for 1 hr, then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. Aliquots (850 μL) of supernatant were dried under vacuum in an Eppendorf Concentrator Plus then reconstituted in 42.5 μL 70% methanol, 30% 10 mM ammonium acetate. Samples (injection volume 1 μL) were analysed by targeted LC-MS/MS using an Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC system coupled to an Agilent 6495B triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Separation was achieved using an Agilent Infinity Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (3.0 × 150 mm, 2.7 μm) fitted with an Agilent Infinity Poroshell 120 EC-C18 UHPLC guard column (3.0 × 150 mm, 2.7 μm), maintained at 20°C. The mobile phases were 10 mM ammonium acetate in water (A) and methanol (B), both containing 5 μM medronic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) to chelate metal ions (gradient 98% A from 0 to 3 min, decreased to 2% A from 3.5 to 6.5 min at 0.5 mL/min, then increased to 98% A at 0.4 mL/min from 6.5 to 12 minutes; total run time 12 min). Autosampler temperature was 4°C. The mass spectrometer was operated in negative electrospray ionisation mode: source gas temperature was 250°C with flow at 17 L/min, sheath gas temperature was 400°C with flow at 12 L/min, and nebuliser pressure was 45 psi. Data were acquired in Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode and were processed using Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Analysis software version B08.00.00. By comparison with pure standard compounds (Sigma-Aldrich), the isomers IPP and DMAPP eluted at the same retention time (approximately 2.4 min) and were calculated as total area under the curve. The limit of detection in cell extracts was 20 nM.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Detection of unprenylated Rab proteins</title><p>To assess the accumulation of unprenylated Rab GTPase proteins, we used an in vitro prenylation assay as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2015</xref>). Mice were treated with i.v. ZOL or saline as described above, then cell pellets were obtained by BAL or PL (each pooled from n = 5 mice) and lysed by sonication in prenylation buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 μM GDP, 1× Roche cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail). To compare the effect of ZOL and AF647-ZOL, BMDMs were treated with 1, 5, or 10 μM ZOL or AF647-ZOL for 24 hr before cells were collected and lysed in prenylation buffer.</p><p>For the in vitro prenylation assay, 10 μg of protein were incubated with recombinant GGTase II, REP-1, and biotin-conjugated GPP (a synthetic isoprenoid lipid) for the labelling of unprenylated Rab proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2015</xref>). The resulting biotinylated Rabs were then detected on PVDF blots using streptavidin-680RD (LiCOR). A narrow doublet (often appearing as a broad singlet) of endogenous biotinylated 75 kDa proteins was used as a sample loading control.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Immune responses to LPS in vivo</title><p>10-week-old female mice were administered a single retro-orbital i.v. dose of 500 μg/kg ZOL (or saline control), 48 hr before immune challenge with LPS (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich) administered either i.n. (10 μg LPS in 20 μL saline) or i.p. (100 μg in 200 μL saline). Mice were culled 2 hr later, and BAL or PL fluid were collected by injecting 500 μL or 1 mL PBS into the lungs or peritoneal cavity, respectively. Cytokines and chemokines in BAL, PL, and serum were measured using a Bio-Plex multiplex immunoassay (Bio-Rad) and a MAGPIX (Luminex) multiplex reader according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>IL-1β release by peritoneal cells ex vivo</title><p>PL samples were obtained from ZOL- or saline-treated mice as described above. PL cells were placed in 96-well plates (400,000 cells/well) and treated at 37°C for 5.25 hr with 200 ng/mL LPS, in a final volume of 200 μL serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Gibco), followed by stimulation for 45 min with 10 μM nigericin (Sigma-Aldrich). The level of mature (17 kDa) IL-1β in conditioned medium was analysed by western blotting on nitrocellulose membrane with a goat anti-mouse IL-1β antibody (AF-401-NA, R&amp;D Systems, 1:1000 dilution), donkey anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (A15999, Thermo Fisher, 1:5,000 dilution), and enhanced chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher). The signal was detected using a Fusion FX7 imaging system (Etablissements Vilber Lourmat SAS), and densitometry was performed on blots using ImageJ (v2.0.0).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>FHE is an employee of BioVinc (Pasadena, CA, USA).

You show that drugs in this class act on pulmonary macrophages and block protein prenylation. This leads to an enhanced response to bacterial endotoxin and immune response to bacterial endotoxin with increased levels of cytokines and chemokines in bronchoalveolar fluid – a series of events that may explain reduced rates of pneumonia seen in patients treated with these drugs.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: T. Jack Martin (Reviewer #1); Massimo Massaia (Reviewer #2); Lilian Plotkin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The Reviewing Editor believes that there are very few time-consuming requests in the 3 reviews above, unless I am incorrect. I believe the authors can respond to each Reviewer in a succinct manner as they are enthusiastic overall regarding the data, the paper and the topic.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 1. AF647ZOL after IV injection in the mouse was clearly localized in pulmonary alveolar and in peritoneal macrophages. AF647-ZOL is a fluorescent-labelled zoledronate. The authors should provide more details in Methods about this reagent, its preparation and properties. There is nothing published about it of which I am aware. The literature on the corresponding risedronate analog, AF647-RIS, is confusing. It was used in Junankar et al., where it was described as bone-seeking but pharmacologically inactive , but this appears to differ from the original description, in Roelofs et al., (JBMR 2010 ). Perhaps the authors could clarify.</p><p>2. The AF647-ZOL was used only in the work of Figure 1, where the localization in macrophages is clearly shown. A couple of questions arise. First, if the labelled compound is active, sufficient was injected in Figure 1 to show a pharmacological effect as was studied in Figure 2 – was there any biological activity of AF647ZOL – or a reduced activity?? Second, it is assumed, but not shown, that the labelled ZOL behaves as unlabelled. As one would do with any binding or &quot;receptor&quot; study, one would see if it were possible to block the label from entering cells. This could be done, for example, by examining mice co-injected with an increased amount of unlabelled ZOL. The question is being asked to increase confidence that the pharmacological effects shown in Figures2 and 3 are indeed the result of direct action of the unlabelled ZOL.</p><p>3. The present experiments were carried out with one N-BP, the most potent of all those in common use. Much higher doses of that drug are required in mice than in human subjects, but it would be very helpful to know what is needed to produce the pharmacologic effects that are shown. The impracticality of of dose responses is obvious, but what about repeating the Figure 2 experiment with less active N-BPs/ – e.g. risedronate, alendronate, pamidronate?</p><p>4. Given that ZOL is active on bone in human studies when given with as little as 1 microgram intermittent doses, the authors would do well to discuss how this question of bioavailability is to be addressed. It might well be beyond the scope of this paper, but it surely should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I would recommend a more cautious approach before stating that &quot;these findings demonstrate unequivocally for the first time that systemic administration of N-BP has pharmacological activity outside the skeleton&quot; (page 5, line 10, and thereafter). Similar results have already been reported by several groups (Rogers TL et al., Macrophages as potential targets for zoledronic acid outside the skeleton-evidence from in vitro and in vivo models. Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2013 Dec;36(6):505-14; Comito G et al., Zoledronic acid impairs stromal reactivity by inhibiting M2-macrophages polarization and prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts. Oncotarget. 2017 Jan 3;8(1):118-132; Coscia et al., J Cell Mol Med. 2010 Dec;14(12):2803-15). The paper by Coscia et al., was the first one to demonstrate that ZOL at clinically achievable doses targets the mevalonate pathway of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and tumor cells in a mouse model of primary tumor not located in the bone. In the same paper, it was shown a marked inhibition of the Mev pathway of peritoneal macrophages after ZOL treatment, as shown by the intracellular decrease of FPP, cholesterol, and ubiquinone, and the concurrent increase of IPP. As expected, protein prenylation was also affected as shown by the decreased intracellular contents of prenylated Ras and Ras-GTP. The Authors should reconsider and discuss again their results in light of these published data.</p><p>2. Interestingly, the uptake of the fluorescently-labelled ZOL analog (AF647-ZOL) is mostly restricted to large peritoneal (LP) macrophasegs sparing small peritoneal (SP) macrophages. The Authors should explain the functional difference between these 2 subsets and provide some hypotheses why uptake is restricted to the former (i.e, activated macrophages?). Is AF647-ZOL uptake specific or is this the consequence of a general increased phagocytic activity of LP macrophages (control expts with FITC-dextran could answer the question).</p><p>3. Another interesting set of data is represented by the enhanced cytokines and chemokines production induced by LPS after in vivo ZOL priming. These results confirm previous findings (Coscia et al., J Cell Mol Med. 2010 Dec;14(12):2803-15) that ZOL repolarizes TAM from M2 (protumoral) to M1 (antitumoral) activity by inhibiting intracellular protein prenylation. iNOS is considered a hallmark of M1 polarized macrophages and an important player of the M1-mediated tumoricidal activity. Do the Authors believe that some sort of M1 polarization and iNOS induction can play a role in the improved capacity of ZOL-primed to resist to LPS challenge and survive pneumonia?</p><p>4. As reported by the Authors, clinical data associating improved pneumonia outcome with ZOL treatment have been generated in aged patients. Have the Authors any evidence that age can influence the ability to prime alveolar or peritoneal macrophages in C57BL/6J mice in relation to age? Do the Authors have any explanation about a possible selective effect of ZOL in the elderly, or the possible association is simply because ZOL is used in the elderly to treat hip fractures or osteoporosis? Is any evidence about a protective effect of ZOL in young cancer patients treated with ZOL for bone disease (i.e., myeloma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, etc)?</p><p>5. It is very exciting that ZOL has been identified, using computational biology approaches, as one of 200 clinically-approved drugs that are predicted to target pathways induced by SARS-CoV-2 and could be suitable for drug repurposing against COVID-19 (page 7, line 11 onwards). However, one major cause of Sars-CoV-2 induced morbidity and mortality is the exaggerated inflammatory response in the lung. How do the Authors reconcile a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the capacity of ZOL to boosts the reactivity of alveolar macrophages? Is LPS challenge a suitable surrogate to mimic viral infection? My personal feeling is that the concurrent activation of Vg9Vd2 T cells can be more important in viral infections. The Authors should comment on a possible difference between ZOL and statins in regulating inflammatory and immune responses against bacteria and viruses. I am also wondering whether statins (that induce and accumulate unprenylated small GTPase proteins like ZOL, but do not activate Vg9Vd2 T cells) have the same ability to prime alveolar macrophages reactivity to LPS challenge.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is clearly written, and the data are properly presented. While the conclusions and potential relevance of the studies are clear and appropriate, the authors should also discuss the potential implications of their finding on the acute phase response observed in patients receiving bisphosphonates. Further, the potential of eliciting an exacerbated response that could be deleterious to the patients should also be noted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72430.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

It is a commercially-available reagent and was sourced from BioVinc (as stated in the Methods). We now include an additional panel (a) in Figure 1 showing that AF647-ZOL, like AF647-RIS (described in Roelofs <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010) does not inhibit protein prenylation in cultured macrophages at equimolar concentrations to unlabelled ZOL. AF647-ZOL is therefore a valuable tool to examine the distribution of bisphosphonate compounds in vivo but lacks pharmacologic activity. This is now made clear in the revised text (1<sup>st</sup> paragraph of Results and Discussion). To clarify, the study by Roelofs <italic>et al.,</italic> (JBMR 2010) demonstrates that FAM-RIS is pharmacologically active but clearly states that, unlike FAM-RIS, “AF647-RIS did not inhibit Rap1A prenylation in J774.2 cells in vitro”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In Figures 2 and 3, only unlabelled ZOL was used. Given that ZOL is a well-described, potent bisphosphonate inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, and that the only cells in BAL and PL samples that internalised bisphosphonate were macrophages, we cannot think of any other explanation for the results in Figure 2 other than a direct effect of ZOL on the mevalonate pathway in AMφ and PMφ. We do not suggest that all of the cytokines and chemokines measured in Figure 3 are derived solely from macrophages, and the exact source and mechanism for the increase remains to be determined. Single cell RNA sequencing experiments are underway in a follow-up study to examine this in more detail but we feel that this is beyond the scope of the current Short Report. Nevertheless, intranasal or intraperitoneal administration of LPS is an established method for activating AMφ and PMφ and inducing IL-1β release from these cells. We state (page 7) that: “IL-1β is a central mediator of the innate immune response that orchestrates the production of a cascade of cytokines and chemokines (Garlanda et al., 2013)” therefore it is reasonable to expect that at least some of the acute increase in IL1-β and other cytokine/chemokines in BAL fluid and PL fluid occurs directly from AMφ and PMφ respectively. Furthermore, cytokine/chemokine release in BAL and PL fluid was measured just 2 hours after LPS administration, before infiltration by other immune cells occurs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Because of the bone-targeting property of bisphosphonates such as ZOL the exact concentration that is present in soft tissues such as lung is extremely low (see Green and Rogers, Drug Dev Res 55:210–224, 2002). As we suggest in the text (page 3), the ability of macrophages to internalise bisphosphonate in tissues outside the skeleton presumably reflects their enormous capacity for rapid endocytosis. We agree that it will be important to assess the ability of orally-administered bisphosphonates to have effects on AMφ, but we respectfully consider this to be beyond the scope of this initial Short Report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Despite the rapid bone-targeting property of bisphosphonates it has been shown in rodents that small amounts of ZOL can accumulate in soft tissues (Green and Rogers, <italic>Drug Dev Res</italic> 55:210–224, 2002) but the concentrations that can be achieved are unknown. This has now been stated in the text (page 4). The randomised clinical trial by Grey <italic>et al.,</italic> (<italic>J Bone Miner Res</italic> 2014) showed that ZOL is pharmacologically active in humans when administered intravenously at intermittent doses of 1 milligram (not 1 microgram). In our study in mice we used a single dose of 500 micrograms/kg, which is equivalent to about 10 micrograms per mouse, and was delivered intravenously (as in humans). As discussed in response to point 3 above, it will be important to determine in future studies whether orally-administered N-BP is sufficiently bioavailable to affect tissue-resident macrophage populations such as AMφ, but this is beyond the scope of the current study in which we clearly show an effect of a single dose of intravenous ZOL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

The paper by Coscia et al., was the first one to demonstrate that ZOL at clinically achievable doses targets the mevalonate pathway of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and tumor cells in a mouse model of primary tumor not located in the bone. In the same paper, it was shown a marked inhibition of the Mev pathway of peritoneal macrophages after ZOL treatment, as shown by the intracellular decrease of FPP, cholesterol, and ubiquinone, and the concurrent increase of IPP. As expected, protein prenylation was also affected as shown by the decreased intracellular contents of prenylated Ras and Ras-GTP. The Authors should reconsider and discuss again their results in light of these published data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s comment. Our intention was to make the point that a single dose of ZOL can affect cells outside the skeleton under benign conditions i.e. not in mice bearing tumours and with potentially tumour-influenced immune systems, but we realise that this was not clear. We propose to rephrase the title, from “Bisphosphonate drugs have actions outside the skeleton and inhibit the mevalonate pathway in alveolar macrophages” to “Bisphosphonate drugs have actions in the lung and inhibit the mevalonate pathway in alveolar macrophages”. This more specifically reflects the novel findings that we present in the Short Report. As suggested, we have also modified the sentence on page 5 and added an additional short section toward the end of the Results and Discussion (page 7) to acknowledge previous findings in tumour-bearing mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Interestingly, the uptake of the fluorescently-labelled ZOL analog (AF647-ZOL) is mostly restricted to large peritoneal (LP) macrophasegs sparing small peritoneal (SP) macrophages. The Authors should explain the functional difference between these 2 subsets and provide some hypotheses why uptake is restricted to the former (i.e, activated macrophages?). Is AF647-ZOL uptake specific or is this the consequence of a general increased phagocytic activity of LP macrophages (control expts with FITC-dextran could answer the question).</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an interesting question. An explanation for the specific uptake of bisphosphonate by large PMφ compared to small PMφ requires further detailed studies (both subsets are capable of phagocytosis and endocytosis). Since our studies were more focused on AMφ rather than PMφ we consider this to be beyond the scope of this Short Report. However, we now indicate (page 4) that these two PMφ subsets differ in their origin, phenotype and function, which is explained in detail in the cited review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Another interesting set of data is represented by the enhanced cytokines and chemokines production induced by LPS after in vivo ZOL priming. These results confirm previous findings (Coscia et al., J Cell Mol Med. 2010 Dec;14(12):2803-15) that ZOL repolarizes TAM from M2 (protumoral) to M1 (antitumoral) activity by inhibiting intracellular protein prenylation. iNOS is considered a hallmark of M1 polarized macrophages and an important player of the M1-mediated tumoricidal activity. Do the Authors believe that some sort of M1 polarization and iNOS induction can play a role in the improved capacity of ZOL-primed to resist to LPS challenge and survive pneumonia?</p></disp-quote><p>We take a more cautious approach and have now stated in the revised text that:</p><p>“Our findings are also consistent with previous reports suggesting that ZOL treatment causes polarisation of tumour-associated macrophages towards an M1-like, pro-inflammatory phenotype….”</p><p>We do not wish to state that our findings <italic>confirm</italic> this suggestion because this requires detailed analysis of the phenotype of AMφ and PMφ. As indicated to Reviewer #1, single cell RNA sequencing studies (not just iNOS expression) are underway to address this question in far more detail and to provide a complete explanation for the effect of ZOL, but we feel that this is beyond the scope of the current Short Report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. As reported by the Authors, clinical data associating improved pneumonia outcome with ZOL treatment have been generated in aged patients. Have the Authors any evidence that age can influence the ability to prime alveolar or peritoneal macrophages in C57BL/6J mice in relation to age? Do the Authors have any explanation about a possible selective effect of ZOL in the elderly, or the possible association is simply because ZOL is used in the elderly to treat hip fractures or osteoporosis? Is any evidence about a protective effect of ZOL in young cancer patients treated with ZOL for bone disease (i.e., myeloma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, etc)?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of any studies to suggest that there is a selective effect of ZOL in the elderly and this could be a topic to address in future work. Of course, the elderly population are the most likely to receive bisphosphonate therapy for age-associated bone disorders such as osteoporosis, and are also more susceptible to pulmonary infections and pneumonia. We have now rephrased the last sentence of the Conclusion to make the clinical significance of our findings clearer:</p><p>“These findings add further weight to the view that N-BP therapy has benefits beyond just preventing bone loss and could be considered as prophylactic treatment to reduce the risk of pneumonia in individuals with osteopenia or osteoporosis, who are already eligible for bisphosphonate treatment under standard clinical guidelines”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It is very exciting that ZOL has been identified, using computational biology approaches, as one of 200 clinically-approved drugs that are predicted to target pathways induced by SARS-CoV-2 and could be suitable for drug repurposing against COVID-19 (page 7, line 11 onwards). However, one major cause of Sars-CoV-2 induced morbidity and mortality is the exaggerated inflammatory response in the lung. How do the Authors reconcile a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the capacity of ZOL to boosts the reactivity of alveolar macrophages? Is LPS challenge a suitable surrogate to mimic viral infection? My personal feeling is that the concurrent activation of Vg9Vd2 T cells can be more important in viral infections. The Authors should comment on a possible difference between ZOL and statins in regulating inflammatory and immune responses against bacteria and viruses. I am also wondering whether statins (that induce and accumulate unprenylated small GTPase proteins like ZOL, but do not activate Vg9Vd2 T cells) have the same ability to prime alveolar macrophages reactivity to LPS challenge.</p></disp-quote><p>It is worth re-emphasising that ZOL is only <italic>predicted</italic> to target pathways important for SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is no evidence yet, to our knowledge, that ZOL has any clinical benefit against COVID-19. Whether there is any clinical benefit, or indeed a deleterious effect, of ZOL therapy remains to be determined. We state (towards the end of the Results and Discussion) that there is evidence from epidemiological studies for only a <italic>beneficial</italic> effect of bisphosphonates on pneumonia and no evidence for a <italic>deleterious</italic> effect, despite the apparent pro-inflammatory actions of ZOL. The possible mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect on pneumonia are described in the text and in Figure 4. It is important to bear in mind that a rapid response to pathogens may lead to a better resolution of the infection. Hence an improved acute and early immune response in the lung may lead to overall better outcomes. The findings that we present in this Short Report reveal a possible explanation for the apparent beneficial effects of bisphosphonates against pneumonia and open a whole new area of research – the questions raised by the Reviewer remain to be explored. We do not suggest that LPS administration is a model of viral infection and we cite the studies that have previously reported anti-viral effects of ZOL. We totally agree that activation of Vγ9Vծ2 T cells is likely to be a major component of any effect of bisphosphonates to combat infection (both viral and bacterial) and discuss this in the text and in Figure 4, but naturally this cannot be examined in normal mice because they lack this subset of γ,ծ-T cells. Whether statins, or other pharmacologic agents that are capable of inhibiting steps of the mevalonate pathway, can also prime alveolar macrophages in vivo remains to be determined and is beyond the scope of this Short Report, but we cite key references that describe the effects of statins on infection (e.g. Parihar et al., 2019; Sapey et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript is clearly written, and the data are properly presented. While the conclusions and potential relevance of the studies are clear and appropriate, the authors should also discuss the potential implications of their finding on the acute phase response observed in patients receiving bisphosphonates. Further, the potential of eliciting an exacerbated response that could be deleterious to the patients should also be noted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment and to address it we have added a sentence (page 5) that states:</p><p>“Our findings also shed new light on the commonest side-effect of N-BP therapy, a transient acute phase response. This was previously thought to be caused by the accumulation of IPP in circulating monocytes, which then activates Vγ9Vծ2 cells to produce TNFα and IFNγ (Roelofs et al., 2009). Our findings suggest that tissue-resident macrophages, such as AMφ and large PMφ, are in fact the more likely source of IPP responsible for the activation of Vγ9Vծ2 cells”.</p><p>As described in the response to Reviewer #2, we already state that there is no evidence that enhanced cytokine production caused by N-BP therapy worsens lung inflammation in pneumonia patients, and on the contrary, N-BP treatment appears to have a beneficial effect on pneumonia risk and mortality. We have now emphasised this further in the revised text (page 7) by stating:</p><p>“Further studies are necessary to determine exactly how ZOL alters the phenotype of AMφ. Importantly however, despite the ability of ZOL to enhance cytokine and chemokine production, to our knowledge there is no evidence that N-BP therapy exacerbates lung inflammation in pneumonia patients, and on the contrary, treatment appears to have a beneficial effect on pneumonia risk and mortality (Colon-Emeric et al., 2010, Sing et al., 2020, Reid et al., 2021)”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
