EVs produced by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) have raised significant interest for their potential in cell communication, nutrient acquisition, and immune evasion. However, the relevance of vesicle secretion during tuberculosis infection remains unknown due to the limited understanding of mycobacterial vesicle biogenesis. We have previously shown that a transposon mutant in the LCP-related gene <italic>virR</italic> (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) manifested a strong attenuated phenotype during experimental macrophage and murine infections, concomitant to enhanced vesicle release. In this study, we aimed to understand the role of VirR in the vesicle production process in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We employ genetic, transcriptional, proteomics, ultrastructural, and biochemical methods to investigate the underlying processes explaining the enhanced vesiculogenesis phenomenon observed in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. Our results establish that VirR is critical to sustain proper cell permeability via regulation of cell envelope remodeling possibly through the interaction with similar cell envelope proteins, which control the link between peptidoglycan and arabinogalactan. These findings advance our understanding of mycobacterial extracellular vesicle biogenesis and suggest that these set of proteins could be attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>biogenesis</kwd><kwd>cell

Similar to other intracellular pathogens, <italic>Mtb</italic> releases proteins and lipids, that interfere with host cellular processes, via canonical or specialized secretion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Majlessi et al., 2015</xref>). How mycobacteria confined within phagosomes delivers virulence factors to other cellular compartments and/or into the extracellular milieu to affect the physiology of neighboring cells is currently a matter of investigation. Understanding the physiology of this phenomenon during the infection process might be critical to develop alternative therapies against tuberculosis (TB).</p><p>Like most forms of life, <italic>Mtb</italic> uses an alternative antigen release process based on extracellular vesicles (EVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>). Mycobacterial EVs (MEVs) are membrane walled spheres of 60–300 nm in diameter, released by live bacteria in vitro and in vivo. MEVs contain iron scavenging molecules, immunologically active complex lipids and lipoproteins, and classical virulence factors such as the <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> toxin mycolactone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marsollier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>). Several studies have clearly established a role of MEVs in immunomodulation and shown that MEVs deliver factors that impair macrophage effector functions, inhibit T cell activation, and modify the response of host cells to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Athman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). MEVs have also shown potential as biomarkers of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schirmer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ziegenbalg et al., 2013</xref>). Although the importance of MEVs has been recognized, hardly anything is known regarding both how such vesicles are exported across the mycobacterial cell wall and the molecular mechanisms underlying vesicle formation in mycobacteria. To date, several modulators of MEVs have been described. Our group identified two conditions leading to stimulation of vesicle production, namely: iron starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>) and the deletion of <italic>virR</italic> (Rv0431, <underline>v</underline>esiculogenesis and <underline>i</underline>mmune <underline>r</underline>esponse <underline>R</underline>egulator) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, it was shown that the Pst/SenX3-RegX3 signal transduction system regulates MEVs production independent from VirR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">White et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting an alternative mechanism of vesicle production. We have recently demonstrated that both iron starvation and deletion of VirR in <italic>Mtb</italic>, two hypervesiculating conditions, trigger the induction of the isoniazid-induced gene operon <italic>iniBAC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>). It was determined that both IniA and IniC are dynamin-like proteins (DLP) presumably assisting MEV release through the fission of the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding how defects in VirR lead to hypervesiculation through DLPs is important to provide mechanistic explanation for the vesiculation process in mycobacteria.</p><p>Several lines of evidence support the notion that VirR might be involved in maintaining cell wall integrity: (i) First, sequence analysis of the VirR protein indicates that it contains a conserved LytR_C domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is usually found in combination with another domain named LytR-Cps2A-Psr (LCP), and proteins carrying both domains have been associated with the remodeling of the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hübscher et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> has six genes encoding for LCP proteins, three with both LCP and LytR_C domains (Rv3267, Rv3484 and Rv0822), two with a solo LytR_C domain (VirR and Rv2700) and one protein with a solo LCP domain (Rv3840; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The LCP family includes enzymes that transfer glycopolymers from membrane-linked precursors to peptidoglycan (PG) or cell envelope proteins and are central to cell envelope integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawai et al., 2011</xref>). In mycobacteria its was demonstrated that some members of the (LCP) family of proteins are responsible for the linkage between arabinogalactan (AG) and PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). Rv3267, Rv3484 and Rv0822 appear to have overlapping functions in cell wall assembly, Rv3267 being the primary ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, while knocking down the gene encoding for the main AG-PG ligase (cg0847, <italic>lcpA</italic>) in <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> leads to the release of outer membrane material to the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumgart et al., 2016</xref>), this phenotype is not observed in any knockout strain in the <italic>Mtb</italic> orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016</xref>), probably reflecting the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate the biosynthesis of cell wall constituents in response to a decrease in ligase activity; (ii) Second, we and others have determined the increased susceptibility of the transposon <italic>virR</italic> mutant (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) with respect to the WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rath et al., 2013</xref>), and the mutant in the <italic>virR</italic> ortholog, Rv2700 (cell envelope integrity, <italic>cei</italic>) to cell wall targeting drugs such as meropenem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these results, we hypothesize that LytR_C solo domain proteins including VirR and Cei Rv2700 have critical roles in the maintenance of cell wall homeostasis and their absence provokes cell wall alterations leading to enhanced vesiculation.</p><p>In this work, we show that the absence of VirR leads to ultrastructural changes in the cell envelope as observed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These changes are compatible with enhanced permeability and enlargement of the PG layer, as measured by high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM). We demonstrate that VirR interacts with canonical LCP proteins and propose a model for such interaction. These results indicate that VirR is a central scaffold at the cell envelope remodeling process assisting the PG-AG linking process and that this function is important for vesicle production in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High EV production linked to the lack of VirR is associated with an altered cell envelope in <italic>Mtb</italic> in the absence of cell lysis</title><p>While Gram-negative bacteria can release outer membrane vesicles directly into the extracellular environment from their outermost compartment, Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria have thick cell envelopes surrounding the cytoplasmic membrane that acts as a permeability barrier. The mycobacterial cell envelope is composed of PG covalently linked to AG, which in turn is decorated with exceptionally long-chain mycolic acids (MA). These MA, together with intercalating glycolipids, form the unique mycobacterial outer membrane (OM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalscheuer et al., 2019</xref>). Previous analysis of mycobacterial vesicle associated lipids showed predominantly polar lipids, consistent with the cytoplasmic membrane being the likely origin of the vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>). This is also true in EV produced by Fe-limited <italic>Mtb</italic> whose lipid content consists mainly of polar lipids and the lipidic siderophore, mycobactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>). Given that these vesicles must traffic from their point of origin in the plasma membrane through the cell envelope, we hypothesized that local remodeling of the cell envelope is necessary for EV release, and that this process may be exacerbated in a <italic>virR</italic> mutant (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>). To test this, we examined the cell envelope structure of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> grown in minimal medium (MM), as well as wild type (WT) and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> complemented (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-C) strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rath et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) on whole cells, which allows the study of mycobacterial cell surface-associated compartments in a close-to-native state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sani et al., 2010</xref>), we could easily discern three layers comprising the mycobacterial cell envelope: (i) the outer membrane (OM); (ii) an intermediate layer composed of two sublayers (L1 and L2, previously assigned to the mycolate-PG-AG (mAGP) network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sani et al., 2010</xref>); and (iii) the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We observed a significant increase in the thickness of the overall cell envelope (OM-CM) in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain compared to the WT. This difference was largely explained by the expansion of the CM-L1 layer, which appeared also more granulated, suggesting cell wall alterations closer to the cell membrane and indicating aberrant production of either AG, PG or both.

Moreover, a novel mechanism of vesicle production common to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria has recently been described, in which a cell explosion phenomenon driven by bacteriophages leads to the formation of EVs in culture when bacteria are under genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nagakubo et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, we tested whether the enhanced vesiculation described in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rath et al., 2013</xref>) could be linked to cell lysis events. To do this, we analyzed the presence of cytoplasmic IdeR, a transcription factor which is not present in EVs and is not detected in secreted proteins preparations, in culture supernatants of <italic>Mtb</italic> strains, assuming that its detection could be linked to a loss of envelope integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>). We first confirmed that the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain manifested an enhanced vesiculation by measuring EVs using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We did not detect differences in size distribution of isolated EVs between strains. The same supernatants and cell lysates were used to detect the presence of IdeR by immunoblot using a specific polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pandey and Rodriguez, 2014</xref>). As a control for normal release of an extracellular protein, we used a monoclonal antibody against Ag85b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prados-Rosales et al., 2017</xref>). We could not detect IdeR in the supernatant of WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain, but a faint band corresponding to IdeR could be observed in the SN of the <italic>virR</italic> complemented strain (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp). These results suggest that the absence of <italic>virR</italic> does not lead to cell lysis but its overexpression may compromise cell envelope integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We validated this approach by serially diluting WT, <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains on 7H10 solid media. As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we did not observe differences in the number of cells across the diluted spots between strains.

When focusing on the most prominent of these enrichments (OR &gt;2), the analyses highlighted several groups of biological processes and cell compartment ontologies that appeared altered in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> with respect to both WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>First, among genes that were expressed at lower levels in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, we found terms related to several stresses associated with the intra-phagosomal environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schnappinger et al., 2003</xref>), such as response to hypoxia (FDR = 1.7E-5), heat (FDR = 2.2E-2) or response to metal ions (FDR = 3.4E-2), suggesting that responses to host-induced stress are compromised in the mutant, as it is also suggested by the weaker, albeit significant enrichments of responses to host immune response (OR = 1.88, FDR = 7.47e-02, not highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Furthermore, the mutant strain showed a reduction in transcripts related with secretion (FDR = 7.6e-03), and, specifically, protein secretion by the type VII secretion system (FDR = 5.2 e-03). Contributing to this enrichment, we found that the key antigen ESAT-6 was significantly down-regulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> with respect to both WT (log2FC = −0.17, FDR = 4.1E-3) and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains (log2FC = −0.19, FDR = 2.6E-3), while <italic>cfp10</italic> (Rv3874), was similarly less expressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> than in WT (log2FC = −0.24, FDR = 2.6E-3).</p><p>Second, we found enriched terms related with lipid metabolism and transport both among the sets of genes up and downregulated in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain. On the one hand, genes downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> appeared enriched in fatty acid biosynthetic processes (FDR = 6.7E-2), suggesting that the regulation of both anabolic and catabolic pathways of lipids, key for bacterial survival and pathogenesis upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghazaei, 2018</xref>), are, at least in part, VirR-dependent. Furthermore, the mutant strain also shows a significant induction of a number of GO terms related with cell wall composition (e.g. cell wall organization: FDR = 3.9e-2), including terms associated with the biosynthesis key components of the mycobacterial cell wall such as PDIMs (DIM/DIP cell wall layer assembly enrichment FDR = 9.5e-03) and importantly peptidoglycan (peptidoglycan-based cell wall biogenesis FDR = 2.2e-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Third, we found a series of enrichments related with global regulation of gene expression (positive: FDR = 4.4e-2, negative: FDR = 5.4e-2), and RNA biosynthesis (positive: FDR = 5.4e-2, negative: FDR = 5.8e-2), among genes downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, suggesting a global alteration of the transcriptional landscape in the mutant.</p><p>Fourth, we found that metabolic reprogramming in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain is not restricted to lipids but also involves amino acids (cellular amino acid metabolic processes FDR = 2.1e-3), and carbohydrates (cellular carbohydrate biosynthetic process FDR = 6.8e-3), enriched among genes upregulated in the mutant. Similarly, energy production also appears altered in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, with related GO terms enriched among downregulated genes, such as electron transfer activity, (FDR = 4.2e-2), as well as terms enriched among upregulated genes in the mutant such as NADH dehydrogenase activity, (FDR = 3.3e-3).

Capitalizing on these data, we interrogated whether the sets of genes up- (N=399) and downregulated in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain (N=502) were significantly enriched among each of the regulons reported by Minch et al.

To test this, we treated <italic>Mtb</italic> with sublethal concentrations of thioridazine (TRZ), a known enhancer of cell permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Keijzer et al., 2016</xref>); and, alternatively, we cultured the bacillus with cholesterol as a sole carbon source, a condition which reduces mycobacterial cell permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brzostek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The enrichment of the DevR regulon among the genes that are downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> is also suggestive of the existence of a convergent regulatory route controlling both cell permeability and vesiculation under control of this transcription factor, whose activation has been described as a key part of the pathogen’s transcriptomic response to cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Soto-Ramirez et al., 2017</xref>), concomitant to a reduction in cellular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brzostek et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, neither cholesterol nor TRZ altered bacterial viability as measured by the absence of the release of the transcription factor IdeR, as an indication of cell lysis or by spotting serially diluted cultures on solid medium from the corresponding conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then measured vesicle levels in culture supernatants and found that <italic>Mtb</italic> significantly releases more EVs upon treatment with TRZ, and significantly reduces vesicle release in the presence of cholesterol as a sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), as measured by dot blot after normalization to colony forming units (CFUs). These results strongly suggest that cell envelope permeability determines the magnitude of the vesiculation phenomenon in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We next investigated whether common transcriptional features underpin the regulation of cell envelope permeability in the tested conditions. To do that, we compared the transcriptional response of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> with that of available datasets including <italic>Mtb</italic> cultured in the presence of 0.01% of cholesterol as a sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pawełczyk et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>Mtb</italic> treated with 6 μg ml-1 of TRZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dutta et al., 2010</xref>).

These results validate the initial hypothesis according to which changes in permeability induced by these two treatments are linked to the activation of a common transcriptional program. The inspection of genes that are simultaneously upregulated in treatments associated with low permeability in both studies identified DevR as a putative regulator associated with the orchestration of this transcriptional footprint of low cell permeability. The two-component system DevS-DevR (also known as DosS-DosR) has a well-known role as a global regulator of the transition to dormancy, and its regulon is consistently upregulated in non-permeable dormant bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honaker et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cell permeability is a major driver of vesicle production in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of the uptake of ethidium bromide (EthBr) by <italic>Mtb</italic> grown in the indicated conditions, as measured by fluorescence at 590=nm for 65 min.

Taken together, these analyses highlight the transcriptional parallels between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and both TRZ and cholesterol conditions, which strongly suggests the existence of a common transcriptional signature associated with the control of cell permeability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Modulation of EV levels and permeability in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> by cholesterol and TRZ</title><p>We next wondered about the effect of culturing <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> on both cholesterol or TRZ could have on cell growth, permeability and EV production. In the case of cholesterol, it has also been shown to affect other aspects of physiology (redox, respiration, ATP), which can directly affect permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). We monitored <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> growth in MM supplemented with either glycerol, cholesterol as a sole carbon source, or TRZ at 3 µg ml<sup>–1</sup> for 20 days. While cholesterol significantly enhanced the growth <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> after 5 days relative to glycerol medium, supplementation of glycerol medium with TRZ restricted growth during the whole time-course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The study of cell permeability in the same conditions indicated that the enhanced cell permeability observed in glycerol MM was reduced when <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> when cultured with cholesterol as sole carbon source. Conversely, the presence of TRZ increased cell permeability relative to the medium containing solely glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). As we have previously observed for the WT strain, either condition (Chol or TRZ) also modified vesiculation levels in the mutant accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Interestingly, TLC analysis of cell membrane polar lipids showed that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> grown in cholesterol restores the previously observed higher Ac<sub>2</sub>PIM<sub>2</sub> levels relative to WT when growing in glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results strongly indicate that other aspects of mycobacterial physiology besides permeability are also affected in the absence of VirR and may contribute to the observed enhanced vesiculation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title><italic>virR</italic> regulates the protein content of EVs in <italic>Mtb</italic></title><p>To capture the impact of transcriptional adaptation to the proteome, and the degree of divergence between transcriptional shifts and proteins changes observed in the absence of <italic>virR</italic>, we next performed label-free peptide mass spectrometry (LF-MS) of whole cell lysates (WCLs) of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, WT, and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains. Additionally, we isolated EVs from axenic cultures and obtained their proteomic composition to examine for potential VirR-dependent differences in protein cargo that may alter the functionality of EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As a result, we obtained proteomic profiles across strains and cell compartments for a total of N=935 proteins. Upon PCA analysis of the proteomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), we found that the first principal component (PC1), explaining 36.9% of total variance, separated samples from WCLs and EVs in all strains (PC1 differs across cell compartments: one-tailed Mann Whitney test p=2.1e-05), while the second PC (PC2; 13.6% of total variance explained) captured strain effects on the proteomic footprint only among EVs one tailed Mann Whitney t test for PC2 differences between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs and those from either WT or <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> -Comp strains (one-tailed Mann Whitney p=1.2 e-02).

Similarly to what was observed at the level of RNA expression, differences in expression for the contrasts (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-WT) and (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup>- virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp) were directionally enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), thus motivating the definition of two sets of proteins that (1) were observed at higher levels in the EVs isolated from <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> than in those from both WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> -Comp strains (N=117 <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> -upregulated proteins); or (2) were observed at lower levels in the EVs from <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> than in those from any of the other two strains (N=108 <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-downregulated proteins).

Consistent with these results, 44 ribosomal proteins (out of 49 detected) were found to be significantly less expressed in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain relative to either WT or <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains (FDR &lt; 0.05 for at least one comparison), while no ribosomal protein appeared significantly upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. Furthermore, 30 of these proteins were simultaneously downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> when compared to both VirR-containing strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) implying a stark ribosomal depletion in the EVs in the absence of VirR.

We also found a series of metabolic pathways enriched among proteins upregulated in the EVs of the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain, including enzymes involved in metabolism of nucleotides (e.g. purine nucleotide biosynthetic process FDR = 2.0e-02, amino acids (alpha amino acids FDR = 8.3e-04), as well as carbohydrates hexose metabolic process FDR = 6.3e-2), whose catabolism appears also enriched among proteins downregulated in the mutant (e.g. glycolytic process FDR = 2.2e-2 and carbohydrate catabolic process FDR = 4.7E-2). The simultaneous enrichments of these metabolic pathways observed both among upregulated and downregulated vesicular proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicates a complex, VirR-dependent, rewiring of metabolic routes in the vesicles from the mutant strain.</p><p>Further, proteins upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs (N=117) were enriched in terms related to mycolic acids metabolic processes (FDR = 2.1E-2), and peptidoglycan-based cell-wall biogenesis (FDR = 9.0 e-02). Proteins such as InhA (logFC = 3.71, 2.26 FDR = 2.20 e-05, and 1.4E-3 for comparisons <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp, respectively), and KasB (logFC = 1.83; 2.49 FDR = 2.23 e-02; 4.4e-3), involved in mycolic acid metabolism were also upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p><p>The upregulation of these proteins, along with the enrichments at the transcriptional level of DIM/DIP biosynthetic pathways (upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>), suggests a shift in the control of the pool of propionyl-CoA, both at the level of its production, -as a byproduct of the catabolism of methyl-branched lipids, odd-chain-length fatty acids as well as cholesterol- and its detoxification by the bacterium through different routes, such as the methylmalonyl pathway, the glyoxylate cycle and the methylcitrate cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). To shed light on these changes at the metabolic level, we conducted a metabolic profiling to quantify the concentration of metabolites that are central in these different detoxification routes including propionyl-CoA: acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, methylcitrate, and methylmalonyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Only methylmalonyl-CoA was found to be significantly repressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (p=0.028). We also observed differences between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> -Comp strains in methylcitrate. This result, along with the trend towards increased protein, and especially gene expression that is observed for genes involved in the biosynthesis of PDIMs from methylmalonyl (including phenolpthiocerol synthesis type-I polyketide synthases A-E, (ppsA-E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), among others), suggests that the methylmalonyl pool is depleted in the mutant strain because of an increased activity of the PDIM biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, most of the subunits of the acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylase Acc (AccA1, AccA2, AccA3, AccD1, AccD5) appear repressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), suggesting that the production of methylmalonyl Co-A from the degradation of propionyl CoA is inhibited within EVs of the mutant strain.</p><p>Taken together, the omics analyses align with the structural and functional differences observed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. We reasoned that the increased expression of PDIMs biosynthetic genes and the reduced expression of genes related to protein synthesis may be triggered to compensate the enhanced permeability measured in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. In addition, this enhanced permeability leads to an increase in the release of EV, which seems to be depleted in ribosomes and iron storage proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The absence of VirR leads to an aberrant enlargement of PG in <italic>Mtb</italic></title><p>To elucidate the specific molecular defects that explain the periplasm enlargement, the enhanced permeability, and the antibiotic sensitivity phenotypes, we performed a biochemical analysis of WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> cell envelopes. First, we analyzed the total lipid profile by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and observed significant differences in prevalent polar lipids linked to the cell membrane including, lysophosphatidic and phosphatidic acid, species of monoacylated and diacylated glycerol, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannoside (PIM) species, being more abundant in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> relative to WT and complementing strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). To validate these results, we ran thin layer chromatography (TLC) experiments on the same lipid extracts and found that the mutant carries more phospholipids in the membrane including more AcPIM<sub>2</sub> and PE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Moreover, we could not measure major differences in the level of mycolic acid species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), while significantly more PDIMs were detected in the mutant relative to the other strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This later result partially validates proteomics and metabolomic data and suggests that the methylmalonyl pool is depleted in the mutant strain because of an increased activity of the PDIM biosynthetic pathway. However, other lipids including SL1 or PAT/DAT that share a common precursor (propionyl- CoA) with PDIM may also explain the depletion of methylmalonyl. Notably, we observed a reduction in the level of these lipids (SL1 or PAT/DAT) in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> cultured in glycerol relative to WT and complemented strains, suggesting that the excess of PDIM synthesis can take away methyl malonyl CoA from the biosynthesis of SL-1 and PAT/DAT in the absence of VirR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Lipidomic analysis of the cell envelope and EVs from <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparative total lipid analysis of the indicated strains by nano-LC-MS.

This technique has been recently used to investigate the nanometric features of isolated Gram-positive bacterial cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pasquina-Lemonche et al., 2020</xref>). Semi-automated analysis of liquid AFM images from mycobacterial isolated PG samples revealed that: (i) the absence of VirR leads to a significant reduction in PG pore diameter (down to 9.2±0.6 nm) relative to WT (16±3.3 nm) and complemented strains (10±0.8 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>); (ii) the number of pores is significantly higher in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> compared to WT and complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>); (iii) manual analysis of AFM images in ambient conditions revealed that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> PG is significantly thicker than that of the other strains of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). These results show for the first time the nanometric architecture of isolated PG in mycobacteria by AFM and suggest a role for VirR in regulating PG thickness and porosity. Strikingly, we found that the PG enlargement observed in the <italic>virR</italic><sup>mut</sup> correlated with increased susceptibility to the muramidase lysozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating modifications in PG remodeling in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. In fact, a deeper MS analysis of PG showed a significant increase in the abundance of deacetylated muropeptides in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> relative WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G and H</xref>). This PG feature has been linked to variability in lysozyme susceptibility in other Gram-positive bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bera et al., 2005</xref>). Collectively, although the structural changes at nanoscopic level of the peripheral areas of the cell observed by AFM leads to a more dense and thick structure harder to penetrate, the chemical changes in the peptidoglycan structure observed and biochemical assays suggest that changes associated with alterations in VirR-regulated PG remodeling makes the wall more permeable and support increased release of EV in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>VirR interacts with canonical LCP proteins</title><p>As mentioned above VirR is a LytR_C solo domain protein with no catalytic LCP domain. Other members of the LCP protein family like Rv3267 and Rv3287 are the main PG-AG ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>) and also carry a LytR_C domain. We have previously shown that VirR interacts with itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, we reasoned that if VirR contributed to PG-AG ligation it could do it via interaction with canonical LCP proteins through the LytR_C domain. Although VirR is one of the most abundant proteins found in tuberculin preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prasad et al., 2013</xref>), we determined that it localizes at sites of nascent cell wall by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, its location could initially allow for interactions with other cell surface proteins like LCP. Both recombinant VirR and the main AG-PG ligase Lcp1 (Rv3267) oligomerize in a blue-native PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). This observation suggests that they interact with proteins sharing similar domain features. We next performed a flotation assay where we examined the behavior of VirR on an iodixanol gradient in the presence or absence of Lcp1. Using a specific antibody raised against VirR, we observed that the presence of Lcp1 displaces the relative location of VirR toward upper fractions of the gradient, indicating a potential interaction of both proteins and the formation of higher molecular weight complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). To investigate the interaction of virR and Lcp1, along with other Lcp proteins, in a more physiological environment we used the bipartite splitGFP approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cabantous et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>), which has been recently utilized to demonstrate the co-localization and interaction of the membrane-bound metal ATPase CtpC with the chaperon PacL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boudehen et al., 2022</xref>). We first recapitulated the VirR self-interaction and added that such interaction implicates the LytR_C domain since no differences in fluorescence were measured between full and truncated versions of VirR (VirRsol) lacking the first 41 amino acids. As negative controls, we included interactions between VirR and the cell surface associated metal ATPase CtpC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). When testing interactions between VirR and other Lcp proteins (Rv0822c, Lcp1 (Rv3267) and Rv3284) we could not measure any GFP signal when full Lcp proteins were used in the assay. Conversely, a significant increase in fluorescence was measured for all combinations when truncated Lcp proteins including either the C-terminal domain or specifically the LytR_C domain were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). These results strongly suggest that VirR interacts with Lcp proteins and that these interactions occur via LytR_C terminal domains.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>VirR interacts with Lcp1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Blue-native PAGE analysis of recombinant VirR and Lcp1.

A transposon mutant in <italic>virR</italic> (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) overproduces MEVs and this provokes augmentation of cytokine responses in mouse and human macrophages. This mutant manifested an attenuated phenotype in experimental infections on macrophages and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beaulieu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). Such studies established that VirR has a role in virulence by negatively modulating the release of MEVs. These studies provided evidence that vesiculogenesis in <italic>Mtb</italic> is genetically regulated. Since then, conditions such as iron starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>) and other genes, including the bacterial dynamin-like <italic>iniAC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>), and the Pst/SenX3-RegX3 signal transduction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">White et al., 2018</xref>) have been shown to contribute to the biogenesis of MEVs. Interestingly, VirR, a LytR_C solo domain protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), shares homology with Lcp proteins, which in <italic>Mtb</italic> are known to participate in the enzymatic connection between AG and PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests VirR function might be linked to cell wall remodeling.</p><p>In this study, we investigated how VirR can control the magnitude of MEV release in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We did this by studying the underlying enhanced vesiculogenesis phenomenon observed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> using genetic, transcriptiomics, proteomics and ultrastructural and biochemical methods. It was clear from our cryo-EM studies that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> has an aberrant cell wall as the layer above the cell membrane was significantly larger than that of WT and complemented strains. The enlarged compartment showed higher granular texture, a feature that has been previously associated to PG precursors in unrelated Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zuber et al., 2006</xref>). This observation and previous studies showing the increased sensitivity of <italic>VirR<sup>mut</sup></italic> to vancomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>) strongly suggested that the cell wall defect is connected to PG remodeling. The use of AFM on isolated PG confirmed this and showed for the first time the nanostructure of PG in <italic>Mtb</italic>, providing information on PG thickness, pore size and number of pores. AFM indicated that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> PG is thicker, has significantly more pores of small size. Considering the pore sizes measured across strains (ranging from 9 to 16 nm), we initially ruled out the notion that EVs (which are spheres of 50–300 nm in diameter) are released through the peripheral cell wall. Therefore, <italic>Mtb</italic> must have an alternative mechanism to release EVs, possible during the division process where the PG is most fragile, presumably due to defects in crosslinking, something that awaits further experimental verification. These events were not possible to visualize in AFM given that PG fragments from all the strains were lacking the poles or clearly defined division sites but could be the subject of further studies in the future. However, we cannot exclude that MEV plasticity could allow for crossing the cell wall via PG pores.</p><p>A recent study showed that <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> can produce and release different types of MVs through different routes, including mycomembrane blebbing or bubbling cell death, depending on the stress at which <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> is exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nagakubo et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we have shown that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> overproduces EVs under normal growing conditions in the absence of cell lysis, according to our assay which measured cytoplasmic leaking of the transcription factor IdeR or serially diluted spots on solid medium. Overall, we show that EV production in <italic>Mtb</italic> under our growing conditions, is not linked to cell death. This fact largely excludes the bubbling cell death mechanism. Moreover, our past and current lipidomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>) indicates the absence of mycomembrane lipids in isolated MEVs from all strains, ruling out that MEVs originate at the mycomembrane. These apparent disagreements with the <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nagakubo et al., 2021</xref>) might indicate that <italic>Mtb</italic> EV biogenesis may differ from that of <italic>C glutamicum</italic>, and other mycolic acid-containing bacteria with shorter fatty acids. Additional variables that may explain differences between studies is the growth media and the time at which vesicles are isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>). Of note, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> EVs were isolated at day 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nagakubo et al., 2021</xref>), a time at which this fast-growing mycobacteria is already in stationary phase.</p><p>The transcriptional profile of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> can provide a partial explanation for the attenuated phenotype of the mutant due to a downregulation of genes activated upon stresses associated to the intraphagosomal environment. It is particularly interesting to observe the specific reduction in transcript levels of the two most important effectors of the esx-1 secretion system. On the other hand, genes involved in PDIM synthesis were upregulated. It is possible that the specific upregulation of PDIM synthesis in absence of <italic>virR</italic> is part of compensatory response to a reduced permeability. We were surprised to find no differences between protein profiles in whole cells between WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strains, despite difference in transcriptomics. A biological interpretation of these results would point to the existence of global compensatory mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation used by the bacteria to partially recover comparable proteomic profiles in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> to those observed in the WT.</p><p>Contrary to whole cell lysates, EV protein profiles between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and WT were largely different. In this context, it is accepted that certain proteins and lipids are enriched in bacterial EVs and that preferential inclusion of such antigens in MVs supports a specific vesicle biogenesis mechanism. In Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria both membrane and cytosolic proteins are included in EVs since the origin of these structures is linked to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>) and, presumably, the incorporation of intracellular proteins may occur during the process of vesicle formation. We found a higher abundance of proteins related to PG and MA synthesis in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs relative to WT. Therefore, these two processes seem to contribute to EV biogenesis in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Additional data presented in this study, which includes ultrastructural and chemical analyses confirm this. Both PG and MA synthesis are complex processes, including a diverse set of genes. What parts of the biogenesis of these molecules are important for the formation of EVs is a matter of future investigations.</p><p>Another finding of the study is the connection between permeability and the magnitude of the vesiculation process in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We linked these two phenomena first, by measuring enhanced vesiculation and permeability in the same strain (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) and second, by modifying the permeability using chemical (via sublethal exposure to TRZ) and nutritional supplements (via providing cholesterol as sole carbon source) in WT <italic>Mtb</italic>. TRZ, a repurposed drug that belongs to the class of phenothiazines, is known to affect respiration in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaral et al., 1996</xref>). It is also assumed that TRZ can inhibit efflux pumps leading to an increased susceptibility to first-line antitubercular drugs when tested in combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Knegt et al., 2014</xref>). This provides an explanation for the synergistic effects of such combinations. An independent explanation of such synergy may also come from the increased permeability, as it has been recently shown by a quantitative proteomics analysis of <italic>Mtb</italic> cells exposed to sublethal concentration of TRZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Keijzer et al., 2016</xref>). When we grew <italic>Mtb</italic> with cholesterol as a sole carbon source, a condition that slows mycobacterial growth but also reduces cell permeability via cholesterol accumulation in the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brzostek et al., 2009</xref>), we observed the opposite trend on MEV biogenesis. We consider this finding of high relevance since <italic>Mtb</italic> permeability is one the major concerns when developing potential antimycobacterial drugs. Nevertheless, bacterial cell permeability is a complex property that it is controlled by physiochemical, biological, and chemical processes such as stereochemistry, lipophilicity, saturation and unsaturation, flexibility, viscosity, fluidity, pressure, temperature and physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nagamani and Sastry, 2021</xref>). How these variables change to allow the release of MEVs is not known.</p><p>This study also proposes a model VirR function whereby VirR may work as a scaffold for canonical Lcp proteins, which in <italic>Mtb</italic> links PG to AG. Based on the demonstration that VirR interacts with canonical Lcp proteins, we believe that the absence of VirR deregulates the localization of canonical Lcp proteins. Although we cannot rule out the contribution of other phenomena including alteration of the PG molecule, VirR is a central scaffold in the cell wall remodeling process. Taking into consideration the fact that <italic>VirR<sup>mut</sup></italic> is attenuated in virulence on preclinical models of infections and manifests an enhanced vesiculogenesis and permeability, VirR may represent a novel and interesting drug target. We envision that targeting VirR may not only make <italic>Mtb</italic> weaker and more permeable to other antitubercular drugs, but to stimulate the immune system, via MEVs, to fight infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, media and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv (ATCC) and derivative strains <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and <italic>virR<sup>mut-</sup>C</italic> (complemented strain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rath et al., 2013</xref>) were used in this study.

The resulting insoluble PG was washed four times by centrifugation in deionized water and stored at 4 °C or room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Analysis of diaminopimelic acid</title><p>For DAP quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsuruoka et al., 1985</xref>), samples were hydrolyzed overnight in 6 N HCl at 100 °C in 1 ml capacity-crystal ampoules (Wheaton). Samples were dried and resuspended in water and mixed in a 1:1:1 ratio with pure acetic acid and ninhydrin reagent (250 mg ninhydrin, 4 ml phosphoric acid 0.6 M, and 6 ml pure acetic acid). Samples were measured at OD 434 nm, and the amounts of DAP were calculated based on a standard curve with pure DAP. The data displays the average ± standard deviations n=3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Glycosyl composition of isolated cell walls</title><p>500 μg of purified cell walls were mixed with 10 μg of inositol and hydrolyzed with 0.1 M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 2 hr at 121 °C. The monosaccharides released were then converted into alditol acetates by reduction with NaBH<sub>4</sub> and acetylation with acetic anhydride in pyridine. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in a 7890 A/5975 C system from Agilent, using a DB-5ht (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.1 μm) fused silica capillary column. The compounds were identified by comparing the retention times of the peaks with those recorded for standards analyzed under identical conditions. Quantification was carried out considering the area of the peaks and the response factors of each compound with respect to inositol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Atomic force microscopy and data analysis</title><p>The dry pellets of purified peptidoglycan from the three strains were dissolved in pure water and further broken by tip sonication at 2 mA for 30 s, three cycles. Then 10 µl of the PG suspension was added to standard AFM substrate made of mica coated with 0.01% Poly-L-lysine by incubating the sample during 90 min to achieve good coverage. The sample was further rinsed with water and dried with Nitrogen flow. The AFM in ambient conditions (i.e. air) was performed using Tapping mode in a Bruker FastScan Bio machine (Santa Barbara, CA, United States) with Nunano SCOUT 350 - Silicon AFM probes (spring constant: 42 N/m, Resonance frequency: 350 kHz). The images were taken using a free amplitude of 10 nm with set point of 70–80% of free amplitude (e.g. 7 nm). For AFM high-resolution imaging in liquid the images were acquired in Peak force Tapping mode in imaging buffer made of 10 mM Tris and 150 mM KCl, pH: 8, with the FastScan Bio machine using Bruker Fastscan-D AFM probes (spring constant: 0.1 N/m, Resonance frequency: 70 kHz) at the force range of 1–3 nN peak force set point. The imaging parameters used are as follows; Scan rate: 1 Hz; Scan angle: 0 °; Peak force amplitude: 80–100 nm and with high pixel resolution (512-880).</p><p>The thickness measurements were performed with standard Gwyddion 1D height distribution tool (selecting an area containing background and a single leaflet of peptidoglycan). The number of cells analysed varied from n=23 (for Mtb WT), n=36 (for <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>), and n=25 (for <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-C). The comparisons extracted from this data is statistically relevant with t test with Welch’s correction performed. The analysis of the high-resolution images obtained in liquid was performed using the semi-automated custom-made routine from (Pasquina-Lemonche, et al. ‘Pore AFM’, 2024) where the pore area, later converted in diameter, and the pore number were measured from the 2D slice of each image containing the maximum number of pores (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). The number of images similar to images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> were n=8 for all strains, analyzing both pore size and pore number, the statistical comparisons were also performed using a t test with Welch’s correction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Blue native PAGE</title><p>Oligomerization of VirR and Lcp1 was analyzed by Blue native PAGE (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, United States).

The authors used various techniques, including genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and ultrastructural and biochemical methods. Several observations were made to link VirR-mediated vesiculogenesis with PG metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cell wall permeability. Finally, the authors presented evidence of a direct physical interaction of VirR with the LCP proteins involved in linking PG with AG, providing clues that VirR might act as a scaffold for LCP proteins and remodel the cell wall of Mtb. Since the Mtb cell wall provides a formidable anatomical barrier for the entry of antibiotics, targeting VirR might weaken the permeability of the pathogen along with the stimulation of the immune system due to enhanced vesiculogenesis. Therefore, VirR could be an excellent drug target. Overall, the study is an essential area of TB biology.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have done a commendable job of comprehensively examining the phenotypes associated with the VirR mutant using various techniques. Application of Cryo-EM technology confirmed increased thickness and altered arrangement of CM-L1 layer. The authors also confirmed that increased vesicle release in the mutant was not due to cell lysis, which contrasts with studies in other bacterial species.</p><p>Another strength of the manuscript is that biochemical experiments show altered permeability and PG turnover in the mutant, which fits with later experiments where authors provide evidence of a direct physical interaction of VirR with LCP proteins.</p><p>Transcriptomics and proteomics data were helpful in making connections with lipid metabolism, which the authors confirmed by analyzing the lipids and metabolites of the mutant.</p><p>Lastly, using three approaches, the authors confirm that VirR interacts with LCP proteins in Mtb via the LytR_C terminal domain.</p><p>Altogether, the work is comprehensive, experiments are designed well, and conclusions were made based on the data generated after verification using multiple complementary approaches.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The major weakness is that the mechanism of VirR-mediated EV release remains enigmatic. Most of the findings are observational and only associate enhanced vesiculogenesis observed in the VirR mutant with cell wall permeability and PG metabolism. Authors suggest that EV release occurs during cell division when PG is most fragile. However, this has yet to be tested in the manuscript-the AFM of the VirR mutant, which produces thicker PG with more pore density, displays enhanced vesiculogenesis. No evidence was presented to show that the PG of the mutant is fragile, and there are differences in cell division to explain increased vesiculogenesis. These observations, counterintuitive to the authors' hypothesis, need detailed experimental verification.</p><p>Transcriptomic data only adds a little substantial. Transcriptomic data do not correlate with the proteomics data. It remains unclear how VirR deregulates transcription. TLCs of lipids are not quantitative. For example, the TLC image of PDIM is poor; quantitative estimation needs metabolic labeling of lipids with radioactive precursors. Further, change in PDIMs is likely to affect other lipids (SL-1, PAT/DAT) that share a common precursor (propionyl- CoA).</p><p>The connection of cholesterol with cell wall permeability is tenuous. Cholesterol will serve as a carbon source and contribute to the biosynthesis of methyl-branched lipids such as PDIM, SL-1, and PAD/DAT. Carbon sources also affect other aspects of physiology (redox, respiration, ATP), which can directly affect permeability and import/export of drugs. Authors should investigate whether restoration of the normal level of permeability and EV release is not due to the maintenance of cell wall lipid balance upon cholesterol exposure of the VirR mutant.</p><p>Finally, protein interaction data is based on experiments done once without statistical analysis. If the interaction between VirR and LCP protein is expected on the mycobacterial membrane, how SPLIT_GFP system expressed in the cytoplasm is physiologically relevant. No explanation was provided as to why VirR interacts with the truncated version of LCP proteins and not with the full-length proteins.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have addressed my comments. I have no further issues.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94982.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, Vivian Salgueiro et al. have comprehensively investigated the role of VirR in the vesicle production process in Mtb using state-of-the-art omics, imaging, and several biochemical assays. From the present study, authors have drawn a positive correlation between cell membrane permeability and vasculogenesis and implicated VirR in affecting membrane permeability, thereby impacting vasculogenesis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have discovered a critical factor (i.e. membrane permeability) that affects vesicle production and release in Mycobacteria, which can broadly be applied to other bacteria and may be of significant interest to other scientists in the field.

I understand that the authors could not get knock out despite attempts and hence they have guide RNA mediated knockdown strategy. However, I wondered if the authors looked at the levels of the downstream genes in this knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this up since it is known that certain artifacts derived from this approach may be related with changes in expression of downstream genes. We run a qPCR of Rv0432 and Rv0433 and confirmed that no significant differences in expression of <italic>virR</italic> downstream genes were detected in the <italic>virR</italic> mutant or the complemented strains relative to WT. This is now indicated in the method section on Generation of the CRISPR mutants. The data is now presented as Supplementary Figure 13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors have used the virmut-Comp strain for some of the experiments. However, the materials and methods must describe how this strain was generated. Given the mutant is a CRISPR-guide RNA mediated knockdown. The CRISPR construct may have taken up the L5 loci. Did authors use episomal construct for complementation? If so, what is the expression level of virR in the complementation construct? What are the expression levels of downstream genes in mutant and complementation strains? This is important because the transcriptome analysis was redone by considering complementation strain. The complemented strain is written as virmut-C or virmut-Comp. This has to be consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not having included the information about the generation of the complemented strain in our last version of the manuscript. We took the complementing vector from a previous paper on VirR (Rath et al., (2013) PNAS 110(49):E4790). This vector was constructed as follows: Complementation plasmids were cloned using Gateway Cloning Technology (Invitrogen). <italic>E. coli</italic> strains expressing the following Gateway vectors were kindly provided by Dirk Schnappinger and Sabine Ehrt: pDO221A, pDO23A, pEN23A-linker1, pEN41A-TO2, pEN21A-Hsp60, pDE43-MEH. PCR was used to amplify the following target sequences from H37Rvgenomic DNA: coding sequence of Rv0431, coding sequence of Rv0431 with a FLAG tag either in its C-terminus or its N-terminus, and the predicted cytosolic sequence of Rv0431 with a FLAG tag in its new C-terminus. The primers used for PCR were designed such that the amplicons would be flanked with Gateway cloning- specific attachment (att) sites. These PCR products were recombined into Gateway donor vectors using bacteriophage-derived integrase and integration host factor, resulting in entry vectors. The recombination events are specific to the attB sites on the PCR products and to the attP sequences on the donor vectors, such that the orientation of the target sequence is maintained during the recombination reaction, also known as the BP reaction, for attB-attP recombination. Using the MultiSite Gateway system, three DNA fragments, derived from each of three distinct entry vectors, can be simultaneously inserted into a final complementation vector called the destination vector in a specific order and orientation. Multisite recombination events are mediated by Integrase and Integrase Host Factor, in a process called the LR reaction (for the attL and attR sites in the entry and destination vectors). The Gateway entry vectors thus generated were recombined with another entry vector containing either the Hsp60 promoter, an empty entry vector, and a complementation vector (episomal) to give rise to the final destination vector. The destination vector (episomal) was engineered to contain a hygromycin resistance cassette. These vectors were used to transform competent Rv0431-deficient <italic>Mtb</italic>. The transformation mixture was plated on 7H11 plates containing OADC and hygromycin (50 μg/ml). Colonies, typically observed 3-5 weeks later, were isolated and grown in 7H9 media and characterized.</p><p>For simplicity, we have just referenced our previous paper to indicate that the complementing plasmid is the same used in that study.</p><p>Regarding the <italic>virR</italic> expression levels in the WT, <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and complemented <italic>virR</italic> strains please see previous Figure 6 C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The authors have revised the manuscript in light of previous reviews. The authors have addressed some of my concerns appropriately. However, the specific dataset remains unchanged and unclear.</p><p>Fig 8G and H: In response to a comment on the mechanism of how VirR mediates EV release, the authors have added new data showing an increase in the abundance of deacetylated muropeptides in the mutant. This observation is linked to altered lysozyme activity or PG fragility. In my opinion, this is another indirect observation. More concerning is the complemented strain, which also showed a comparable increase in deacetylated muropeptides, indicating that the altered muropeptides could be unrelated to VirR.</p></disp-quote><p>We must disagree here with the reviewer assessment about the fact that the abundance of deacetylated muropeptides is an indirect indication of PG fragility. We consider that this observation and quantitative fact is another additional evidence that indicate a more fragile PG. We believe that considering each of the supporting facts individually may be seen as indirect, but we would like that the reviewer take all the evidence together: (i) sensitivity to lysozyme; (ii) enlargement and altered physicochemical morphological characteristics including porosity or thickness; (iii) altered penetrance of FDAAs; and (iv) increased released of muropeptides. In this later fact, the complemented strain may not display the WT features, but this may be due to some artifacts derived from the complementation.</p><p>Taking all together, we believe that the PG of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> is more fragile than that of the WT and the complemented strains based on a series of evidence. We hope the reviewer may consider this perspective when analyzing such a complex feature like PG fragility. So far, there is not a direct method to assess this condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lipid analyses are not comprehensive. The issue related to the need for more clarity of DIMA and DIMB still needs to be addressed. I understand that the authors do not have facilities to perform radioactive assays. However, they could have repeated the experiment to generate a better-quality image. Similarly, the newly generated SL-1, PAT, and DAT TLC could be of better quality. Bands still need to be resolved. The solvent front is irregular. The same is true for PIMs and DPG TLCs. With the evidence provided, the deregulation of cell wall lipids is incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the quality of the TLC is not appropriate. We have no repeated the PDIM TLC (new Fig 7D). In addition, we have repeated the TLCs resolving sulfolipids in a 2D mode. For simplicity we just run the glycerol condition including the three strains. This is now part of a new Supplementary figure 8 B. For PIMs, we have a 1D and a 2D analysis that, after checking previous papers using similar approaches with no radioactivity, we consider that it has the desired quality to identify the indicated lipids.</p><p>We hope this new data and repeated experiments satisfy the reviewer concerns.</p><p>Thank you very much for your assessment and time to review this paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
