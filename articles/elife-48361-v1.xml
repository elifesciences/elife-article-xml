The extent to which nervous systems are sexually dimorphic and the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate these differences are only beginning to be understood. We reveal here a novel mechanism by which male-specific neurons are generated in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> through the direct transdifferentiation of sex-shared glial cells. This glia-to-neuron cell fate switch occurs during male sexual maturation under the cell-autonomous control of the sex-determination pathway. We show that the neurons generated are cholinergic, peptidergic, and ciliated putative proprioceptors which integrate into male-specific circuits for copulation. These neurons ensure coordinated backward movement along the mate’s body during mating. One step of the mating sequence regulated by these neurons is an alternative readjustment movement performed when intromission becomes difficult to achieve. Our findings reveal programmed transdifferentiation as a developmental mechanism underlying flexibility in innate behaviour.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sexual

of innate, stereotyped sexual behaviours, such as courtship and mating, requires sexually dimorphic sensory-motor circuits that are genetically specified during development (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auer and Benton, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barr et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang and Shah, 2014</xref>). Studies in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, in which the development and function of neural circuits can be interrogated with single cell resolution, have revealed two general developmental mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism in the nervous system. The first involves the acquisition of sexually dimorphic features in sex-shared neurons during sexual maturation, which include changes in terminal gene expression, such as odorant receptors, neurotransmitters and synaptic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hilbert and Kim, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oren-Suissa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ryan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weinberg et al., 2018</xref>). The second mechanism involves the generation of sex-specific neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sammut et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sulston et al., 1980</xref>). Sex-specific neurons are primarily involved in controlling distinct aspects of reproductive behaviours, such as egg-laying in the hermaphrodite and mating in the male (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Emmons, 2018</xref>). Generation of sex-specific neurons requires sex-specific cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>) or neurogenesis events resulting from sex differences in the cell division patterns and neurodevelopmental programmes of post-embryonic cell lineages (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barr et al., 2018</xref>). Here we identify a novel way in which sex-specific neurons are generated in the nervous system: through a direct glia-to-neuron transdifferentiation of sex-shared cells.</p><p>In one of his seminal papers, John Sulston described a sexual dimorphism in the phasmid sensilla of adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sulston et al., 1980</xref>). The phasmid sensillum is one of the seven classes of sense organs that are common to both sexes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. These sense organs are organised in sensilla which are concentrated in the head and the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bird and Bird, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ward et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doroquez et al., 2014</xref>). Each sensillum is composed of the dendrites of one or more sensory neurons enveloped by a channel, usually composed of a single sheath glial cell and a single socket-glial cell. These sensilla can be viewed as part of an epithelium, continuous with the skin, and are shaped by mechanisms shared with other epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Low et al., 2019</xref>). Socket-glial cells are highly polarised and adhere to the hypodermis at the distal end of their process where they form a small, ring-like hollow pore in the cuticle through which the sensory dendrites can access the outside world. The bilateral phasmid sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), situated in the tail, are unusual in that they are each composed of two socket-glial cells (PHso1 and PHso2). John Sulston observed that in juvenile animals (L2 stage) of both sexes, PHso1 forms the primary pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sulston et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At adulthood, the hermaphrodite retains a similar structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In males, however, it is PHso2 that forms the main pore and PHso1 was described as having retracted from the hypodermis and to protrude into the phasmid sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). It was also described to contain basal bodies, a structural component of cilia, in the region enveloped by the phasmid sheath. As sensory neurons are the only ciliated cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perkins et al., 1986</xref>), this is suggestive of neuronal fate, yet Sulston observed no other neuronal characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sulston et al., 1980</xref>). We previously showed that in the amphid sensillum (a similar organ located in the head) the amphid socket-glial cell (AMso) acts as a male-specific neural progenitor during sexual maturation, dividing to self-renew and generate the MCM neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sammut et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore sought to investigate the PHso1 cells in more detail.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The phasmid sensillum.</title><p>Diagram of the phasmid sensillum in either sex at the L2 larval stage (<bold>A</bold>), in adult hermaphrodites (<bold>B</bold>) and in adult males (<bold>C</bold>).

This cell-fate plasticity is regulated by the sex-determination pathway, likely cell-intrinsically. However, we find the cell-fate plasticity does not depend on certain molecular mechanisms known to regulate the only other well-described direct transdifferentiation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kagias et al., 2012</xref>). This bilateral pair of previously unnoticed neurons are putative proprioceptors that regulate male locomotion during specific steps of mating. One of these steps is a novel readjustment movement performed when intromission becomes difficult to achieve. Our results reveal sex-specific direct transdifferentiation as a novel mechanism for generating sex-specific neurons and also show the importance of proprioceptive feedback during the complex steps of mating for successful reproduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The sex-shared PHso1 cells undergo glia-to-neuron transdifferentiation in males</title><p>Using a <italic>lin-48/OVO1</italic> reporter transgene to identify and visualise the PHso1 cell bodies both before and during sexual maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wildwater et al., 2011</xref>), we observed no distinguishable differences between the hermaphrodite and male PHso1 cells at the L3 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The PHso1 cells display a polarised morphology and a visible socket structure in both sexes. In hermaphrodites, this morphology is maintained during the transition to adulthood and PHso1 cells elongate as the animal grows. In males, by contrast, the PHso1 cells display morphological changes that can be observed during the L4 stage, the last larval stage before adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We find that during this stage PHso1 retracts its socket process and extends a short dendrite-like posterior projection into the PHsh cell and a long axon-like anterior process projecting towards the pre-anal ganglion region. For this reason and those described below, we use the name PHD to refer to the PHso1 cells after these morphological changes take place. A time-lapse of an individual male reveals that socket retraction is initiated at early L4, when the male gonad has almost reached the tail, and that the nascent axon is first observed at mid-L4, when the vas deferens has joined with the cloaca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The axon-like outgrowth is complete by the end of tail-tip retraction, when ray precursor cells start to fuse into the tail seam syncytium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations corroborate those of John Sulston and identify the stage of sexual maturation as the time during which the PHso1 cells undergo radical remodelling in males.

In adult hermaphrodites, we find that both cells express the panglial microRNA <italic>mir-228</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wallace et al., 2016</xref>) and the AMso and PHso glial subtype marker <italic>grl-2</italic> (a Hedgehog-like and Ground-like gene protein: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hao et al., 2006</xref>) at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In males, by contrast, <italic>mir-228</italic> and <italic>grl-2</italic> expression is noticeably dimmer in PHso1 than in PHso2 by the mid-to-late L4 stage and completely absent by day 2 of adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B and C</xref>). Importantly, expression of these reporters appears equal in brightness in both cells at the late L3 stage and only becomes noticeably dimmer in PHso1 following the morphological changes, such as the retraction of the socket, that occur during the L4 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, in hermaphrodites, no morphological changes of PHso1 are observed and the reporters appear equal in brightness through to adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). After the posterior hypodermal cells begin to retract leaving the characteristic fluid-filled extracellular space at the tail, PHso1 begins to express the pan-neuronal marker <italic>rab-3</italic> (a synaptic vesicle associated Ras GTPase: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stefanakis et al., 2015</xref>) in males but not in hermaphrodites, and this expression persists throughout adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B and C</xref>). In addition to <italic>rab-3</italic> expression we also observe sequential expression of other neuronal markers such as: the vesicle acetylcholine transporter <italic>unc-17</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfonso et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>); the phogrin orthologue for dense-core vesicle secretion <italic>ida-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zahn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>); the intraflagellar transport component required for proper sensory cilium structure <italic>osm-6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collet et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>); and the IG domain containing protein <italic>oig-8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howell and Hobert, 2017</xref>; Figure 6A). None of these neuronal markers are observed in PHso2 or in the hermaphrodite PHso1. The switch in gene expression in PHso1 is therefore initiated concomitantly with morphological changes during sexual maturation and in a male-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate that the male PHso1 bilateral pair of glial cells transdifferentiate into a novel class of cholinergic and likely peptidergic ciliated neurons, which we have termed phasmid D neurons (PHDs).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The sex-shared PHso1 cells undergo glia-to-neuron molecular changes in males occasionally accompanied by a division.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of the glial marker reporter transgenes <italic>mir-228<sup>prom</sup>::gfp</italic> and <italic>grl-2<sup>prom</sup>::gfp</italic> and pan-neuronal marker <italic>rab-3<sup>prom</sup>::rfp</italic> in the phasmid socket cells (PHso1 and PHso2) and the PHD neuron in adult male animals.

We therefore explored the possibility that PHso1 could divide asymmetrically, to give rise to the PHD neuron and a sister cell that undergoes rapid apoptosis. For this purpose, we analysed mutants of the canonical cell death protein CED-4, homologue to the apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), required to activate the CED-3 effector caspase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellis and Horvitz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yuan and Horvitz, 1992</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conradt et al., 2016</xref>). Strong loss-of-function mutations in <italic>ced-4</italic> result in the survival of somatic cells that normally undergo programmed cell death during development. We observe no statistically significant increase in the frequency of ‘survivor cells’ in <italic>ced-4(n1162)</italic> mutants compared to controls, when scoring the number of cells per side of each animal. This suggests there is no cell death in the PHso1 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Moreover, we never observed an apoptotic cell body in the vicinity of the PHD neuron.</p><p>To our surprise, we observed the presence of an extra cell that co-expressed <italic>lin-48<sup>prom</sup>::tdTomato</italic> and <italic>rab-3<sup>prom</sup>::yfp</italic> in 13–24% of sides of both <italic>ced-4</italic> mutant and control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This extra cell had a similar morphology to PHD, was located immediately anterior to PHD and was detected from the early L4 stage onwards. It also expressed all the markers known to be expressed by the PHD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B–G</xref>). We realised, however, the percentage occurrence of this extra cell was variable between strains suggesting its presence/absence is background-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2H</xref>). In the cases where we did observe an extra cell, we wanted to distinguish between the following possibilities: additional expression of the transgenes in a highly similar neuronal subtype, perduring expression of the transgenes from earlier in the lineages of the phasmid sockets or an infrequent division of PHso1. To this end, we performed 5-ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining in a <italic>lin-48<sup>prom</sup>::tdTomato</italic> background. EdU is a thymidine analogue that is incorporated into the replicating DNA of dividing cells. EdU was fed to a synchronised population of animals at late L2-to-early L3 (22 hr after L1 arrest), after the PHso1 cells are born and before they remodel into the PHD neurons, and adult animals were scored. As a positive control, the divison of the bilateral AMso cells that give rise to the MCM neurons were also scored, as it occurs at a similar time as the PHso1-to-PHD transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sammut et al., 2015</xref>). In the majority of cases (79% of sides scored), no EdU signal was detected, indicating that PHso1 mainly transdifferentiates directly into the PHD neuron. In 21% of sides however, EdU signal was detected in two <italic>lin-48<sup>prom</sup>::tdTomato</italic>-expressing cells per side in the tail of male animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) but never in hermaphrodites (data not shown). Importantly, EdU is never present in the PHD neuron unless observed in two cells on the same side, eliminating the possibility of cell death via non-apoptotic machinery, as is the case of the male linker cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, we were able to observe the division of PHso1 in a single animal in a time-lapse of an individual male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>All together, these observations indicate that PHso1 can sometimes divide symmetrically to give rise to two neurons, which we term PHD1 and PHD2. However, in the vast majority of cases, the PHso1 cells undergo direct remodelling, without wholesale DNA replication or cell division, during which they directly acquire neuronal fate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Biological sex regulates PHso1-to-PHD transdifferentiation cell-autonomously</title><p>We next addressed whether the PHso1-to-PHD cell fate switch is regulated by the genetic sex of the cell rather than the sex of the rest of the animal, in a manner similar to that of several other sexual dimorphisms in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fagan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hilbert and Kim, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee and Portman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oren-Suissa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ryan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sammut et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weinberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">White and Jorgensen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">White et al., 2007</xref>).

In Y-to-PDA, the erasure of the original epithelial fate requires the action of a complex of conserved nuclear factors (SOX-2/Sox, CEH-6/Oct, SEM-4/Sall, and EGL-27/Mta) and the acquisition of the final motor neuron fate involves the cholinergic terminal selector EBF transcription factor UNC-3, in addition to specific combinations of histone modifier complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kagias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Richard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zuryn et al., 2014</xref>).

Within an individual animal the array is inherited in a mosaic fashion and this is validated by the presence of dead embryos positive for the array.

We identified a ~1 kb promoter region that specifically drives the expression of <italic>oig-8</italic> in the PHD neurons. Expression of a <italic>rab-3</italic> translational fusion under the control of this <italic>oig-8</italic> promoter reveals that PHDs form synapses in the pre-anal ganglion, where the synaptic vesicle associated mCherry-tagged RAB-3 protein can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). At the ultrastructural level, we observed both synaptic and dense-core vesicles in PHD, proximal to the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Ultrastructural analysis of the PHD dendrite in seven different animals independently confirms John Sulston’s original observation on the presence of cilia, including the basal body and axonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sulston et al., 1980</xref>). The basal body of PHD lies just dorsal and anterior to the phasmid sheath channel containing the PHA and PHB cilia. It has 2, 1, or 0 short cilia extending within the phasmid sheath very close to PHA and PHB cilia, but within a separate sheath channel. Interestingly, the PHD cilia can lie in variable positions relative to the PHA and PHB cilia: medial, lateral, dorsal, or ventral. In addition, we observe that the dendrite is more elaborate than previously described and has a number of unciliated finger-like villi within the phasmid sheath cell, proximal to the basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Through reconstruction of serial electron micrographs all the synaptic partners of PHD were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>). PHD neurons project from the dorsolateral lumbar ganglia anteriorly and then ventrally along the posterior lumbar commissure and into the pre-anal ganglion. In the pre-anal ganglion, these establish chemical synapses and gap junctions with sensory neurons and interneurons, most of which are male-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Previously, the axonal process of PHD was attributed to the R8B ray neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>). A re-examination of the lumbar commissure allowed us to disambiguate PHD’s axon. PHDs receive synaptic input from male-specific ray sensory neurons involved in the initiation of the mating sequence in response to mate contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr and Sternberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koo et al., 2011</xref>). The main PHD output is to the male-specific EF interneurons (35.4% of chemical synapses), both directly and through their second major post-synaptic target, the sex-shared PVN interneuron. The EF interneurons are GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b</xref>) and synapse onto the AVB pre-motor interneurons which drive forward locomotion. Other PHD outputs include the PVV (male-specific) and PDB (sex-shared but highly dimorphic in connectivity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cook et al., 2019</xref>) interneurons, which synapse onto body-wall muscle, and the cholinergic male-specific interneurons PVY and PVX whose output is to the AVA pre-motor interneurons, which drive backward locomotion. PVN, PVY, and PVX form disynaptic feed-forward triplet motifs that connect PHD strongly to the locomotion circuit interneurons AVB and AVA.

We began by asking what sensory stimuli might activate them. To monitor neuronal activity, we co-expressed GCaMP6f and RFP in the PHDs and performed ratiometric measurements of fluorescence. We imaged calcium transients in restrained animals glued to a slide without anaesthetic. To our surprise, without applying any exogenous stimulation, we observed intermittent calcium transients in the PHDs of <italic>wildtype</italic> animals, every 30 s on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We observed calcium transients in 73% of the neurons imaged and no peaks could be identified in the remaining traces (n = 19). Since in restrained animals there are small tail and spicule movements due to the defecation cycle and sporadic muscle contractions, one explanation could be that PHDs may be proprioceptive. We reasoned that if PHD activity resulted from internal tissue deformation caused by muscle contractions, inhibition of muscle activity should eliminate or reduce calcium transients. To inhibit muscle contractions, we generated transgenic worms in which muscles can be silenced in an inducible manner through the expression of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> histamine-gated chloride channel HisCl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pokala et al., 2014</xref>), under the <italic>myo-3</italic> promoter.

To test this, we imaged PHD activity in <italic>unc-13(e51)</italic> mutant males with impaired synaptic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller et al., 1996</xref>) and in <italic>unc-31(e169)</italic> mutant males with impaired dense-core vesicle secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Speese et al., 2007</xref>). In both these mutants, PHD calcium transients persisted at similar frequencies to those in <italic>wildtype</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). This suggests that PHD activity does not require chemical input from the network. However, we cannot completely rule out that residual neurotransmission in the hypomorphic <italic>unc-13(e51)</italic> mutants may be sufficient to trigger <italic>wildtype</italic> levels of PHD activity in response to muscle contractions. Together, these results suggest that PHDs may respond directly to internal cues arising from muscle contractions, and that they may be proprioceptive neurons.

Mating consists of a temporal sequence of discrete behavioural steps: response (to mate contact); scanning (backward locomotion while scanning the mate’s body during vulva search); turning (at the end of the mate’s body to continue vulva search); location of vulva (stop at vulva); spicule insertion (intromission); and sperm transfer (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barr et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

This movement occurs when the male has been trying to insert its spicules in the mate’s vulva for a period of time without success and subsequently loses vulva apposition. Unsuccessful spicule insertion attempts occurred in 65% of males, resulting in either a long displacement from the vulva, which led to the re-initiation of the scanning sequence, or in a small displacement (less than two tail-tip length) from the vulva (98% of vulva losses), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Correa et al., 2012</xref>). We find that these small displacements from the vulva lead either to local shifts to relocate the vulva (68% of total vulva losses) or to a Molina manoeuvre (32% of vulva losses) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The Molina manoeuvre consists of the initiation of forward locomotion along the mate’s body away from the vulva to the end of the mate’s body (or at least two male tail-tips distance away from the vulva), at which point the male tail acquires a deeply arched posture, followed by a return to the vulva with backward locomotion along the same route (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). Males perform this movement towards either end (head or tail) of the mate as a smooth, continuous sequence. Although we used paralysed <italic>unc-51</italic> mutant hermaphrodites to aid our mating analysis, males also perform this readjustment movement with moving <italic>wildtype</italic> mates (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>).</p><media id="video5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48361-video5.mp4"><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Males performing Molina manoeuvres during mating: <italic>wildtype </italic>male performing a Molina manoeuvre during mating with a paralysed <italic>unc-51(e359) </italic>hermaphrodite.</title><p>Videos are played at 40 fps (sped up x2).</p></caption></media><media id="video6" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48361-video6.mp4"><label>Video 6.</label><caption><title>Males performing Molina manoeuvres during mating: <italic>wildtype</italic> male performing a Molina manoeuvre during mating with a <italic>wildtype</italic> hermaphrodite.</title><p>Videos are played at 40 fps (sped up x2).</p></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The PHD neurons are required for coordinated backward locomotion and effective intromission during mating</title><p>To test the hypothesis that PHDs regulate reproductive behaviours, we performed behavioural tests of intact and PHD-ablated males and functional imaging of PHD activity in freely behaving males during mating. Target specificity of the laser ablations was confirmed 1-day after ablation by absence of fluorescence returning from the transgene used to label the PHD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). We found no defects in food-leaving behaviour, response to mate contact, turning, location of vulva, or spicule insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B,D,E and H</xref>). However, these experiments revealed a role for PHDs in initiation and/or maintenance of backward locomotion during scanning and during the Molina manoeuvre. PHD-ablated males often switched their direction of locomotion during scanning, performing fewer continuous backward scans during vulva search compared to intact males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed higher activity (i.e. Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels) in PHD during backward locomotion than during forward locomotion while scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). PHD activity also peaked just after the switch to backward locomotion during Molina manoeuvres, when the tail tip displays an acute bent posture, and PHD-ablated males performed defective, discontinuous manoeuvres, often stopping at the transition from forward to backward locomotion to return to the vulva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). Importantly, we did not find significant differences between intact and PHD-ablated males in number of events that trigger the initiation of manoeuvres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), indicating that PHDs are specifically required for coordinated locomotion during the manoeuvre itself, at the transition point to backward locomotion. Similar locomotion defects resulting in discontinuous manoeuvres were observed when PHD neurons were acutely silenced with an inducible chloride channel transgene (<italic>oig-8<sup>prom</sup>::HisCl1::sl2::rfp)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that without intact PHD neurons, backward movement along the mating partner becomes slightly erratic, often interrupted by a switch in direction (during scanning), or its initiation is delayed by a stop (during Molina manoeuvres). The qualitative difference in locomotion defects between these two steps of mating may result from differences in the state of the neural network before and after spicule insertion attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Correa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Correa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Sometimes while pausing, particularly during Molina manoeuvres but also during scanning, <italic>wildtype</italic> and PHD-ablated males prodded their spicules at locations other than the vulva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Ectopic prodding happened rarely but it occurred significantly more often in ablated than in <italic>wildtype</italic> males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Because ectopic prodding occurred only during pauses and PHD-ablated males produced many more discontinuous manoeuvres than <italic>wildtype</italic> males, we interpret the increase in ectopic prodding as a secondary consequence of pausing rather than as the main defect of PHD-ablated males. Consistent with this interpretation, there was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of ectopic prodding events between ablated and <italic>wildtype</italic> males when only discontinuous manoeuvres were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><media id="video7" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48361-video7.mp4"><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>Males performing Molina manoeuvres during mating: PHD-ablated male performing a defective, discontinuous Molina manoeuvre.</title><p>Videos are played at 40 fps (sped up x2).</p></caption></media><p>In addition to the aforementioned changes in neuronal activity, the highest level of PHD activation was observed during intromission, the penultimate step of the mating sequence, which precedes sperm transfer and involves full insertion of the spicules into the mate’s vulva while sustaining backward locomotion. PHD activity increased two-fold upon spicule insertion and remained high for several seconds while the spicules were inserted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). PHDs are required for the efficiency of these two last steps of mating since PHD-ablated males that were observed to complete the mating sequence, including intromission and ejaculation, during a single mating with one individual mate, produced fewer cross-progeny than intact males in the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Intact PHDs may increase the efficiency of sperm transfer by controlling the male’s posture during intromission. While the cues and network interactions that activate PHDs during mating are presently not known, the high levels of PHD activity upon spicule insertion are consistent with a putative proprioceptive role for these neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The data presented here extend John Sulston’s original observations and demonstrate that male PHso1 cells undergo a direct glia-to-neuron transdifferentiation to produce a novel class of bilateral cholinergic, peptidergic, and ciliated sensory neurons, the phasmid D neurons. This updates the anatomy of the adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> male: it now comprises 387 neurons (93 of which are male-specific) and 90 glia (two are lost during the transdifferentiation to the PHDs). This is the second example of neurons arising from glia in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, confirming that glia can act as neural progenitors across metazoan taxa. In both cases we have demonstrated that fully differentiated, functional glia can retain neural progenitor properties during normal development. The complete glia-to-neuron cell fate switches we observe strongly suggest the production of neurons from glia is a process of natural transdifferentiation. In the first case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sammut et al., 2015</xref>), this is an indirect transdifferentiation as it occurs via an asymmetric cell division, leading to self-renewal of the glial cell and the production of a neuron. In contrast, the work described here characterises a direct transdifferentiation and as such is the second direct transdifferentiation to be described in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The first involves the transdifferentiation of the rectal epithelial cell Y into the motor neuron PDA, which occurs in hermaphrodites at earlier larval stages, before sexual maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jarriault et al., 2008</xref>). Excitingly, most of the key genes that regulate the Y-to-PDA cell fate switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kagias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Richard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zuryn et al., 2014</xref>) appear dispensable for PHso1-to-PHD and AMso-to-AMso+MCM transdifferentiation, indicating that independent molecular mechanisms exist that control cell-fate plasticity in a sex-specific, time-specific and/or a cell-specific manner. Intriguingly, direct conversion of glial-like neural stem cells has been observed in the adult zebrafish brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbosa et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that this may be a conserved mechanism for post-embryonic generation of neurons. Furthermore, it will be interesting to understand the molecular basis underlying the variability in the low frequency, background-dependent division of PHso1 and whether it has any functional or evolutionary consequence. The fact that a cell’s terminal division can be variable is especially surprising in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> as its cell lineage is considered highly stereotyped and invariable. The only other neurons known to be variable in their generation are the post-embryonic and male-specific DX3/4 and EF3/4 interneurons located in the pre-anal ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>). It is intriguing that the EF neurons are the main post-synaptic partners of PHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and as such it is tempting to speculate there may be a possible link between cell division and cell connectivity.</p><p>Based on our manipulations and imaging of PHD activity in restrained and freely mating animals, we propose that PHDs may be proprioceptive neurons which become activated by tail-tip deformations and engage the circuits for backward locomotion. The high levels of PHD activity during intromission and upon tail-tip bending during the Molina manoeuvre, steps which require inhibition of forward locomotion and sustained backward movement, are consistent with such a model. PHDs may ensure sustained backward locomotion through excitation of their post-synaptic targets PVY, PVX, and EF interneurons, all of which have been shown to promote backward movement through AVA and AVB during scanning and location of vulva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sherlekar and Lints, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sherlekar et al., 2013</xref>). As <italic>wildtype</italic> hermaphrodites are highly uncooperative during mating and actively move away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kleemann and Basolo, 2007</xref>), any erratic and uncoordinated movement by the male is likely to result in the loss of its mate.</p><p>Sensory input from the mating partner is essential for successful mating and accordingly, many sensory neurons in copulation circuits are dedicated to this purpose (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Villella and Hall, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barr et al., 2018</xref>). However, coordinated motor control in all animals also requires proprioception, sensory feedback from internal tissues that inform the individual about its posture and strength exerted during movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sherrington, 1907</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tuthill and Azim, 2018</xref>). Several putative proprioceptive neurons have been identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schafer, 2015</xref>). Within the male copulation circuit, a putative proprioceptive role has been attributed only to the spicule neuron SPC, on the basis of the attachment of its dendrite to the base of the spicules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sulston et al., 1980</xref>). The SPC neuron is required for full spicule protraction during intromission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">García et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</xref>). The presence of proprioceptive neurons in copulation circuits may be a broadly employed mechanism to regulate behavioural transitions during mating. In this light, it would be interesting to determine whether the mechanosensory neurons found in the mating circuits of several other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ng and Kopp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavlou et al., 2016</xref>) may play a role in self-sensory feedback.</p><p>In summary our results provide new insight into the developmental mechanisms underlying the neural substrates of sexually dimorphic behaviour. The glia-to-neuron transdifferentiation that results in PHD represents an extreme form of sexual dimorphism acquired by differentiated sex-shared glial cells during sexual maturation. The PHD neurons, perhaps through proprioception, enable the smooth and coordinated readjustment of the male’s movement along its mate when spicule insertion becomes difficult to attain. This readjustment movement represents an alternative step within the stereotyped mating sequence. These findings reveal the extent to which both cell fate and innate behaviour can be plastic yet developmentally wired.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>C. elegans</italic>: Strain N2</td><td valign="top">Caenorhabditis <break/>Genetics Center</td><td valign="top">WormBase: N2</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AW827</td><td valign="top">Dr Alison <break/>Woollard laboratory</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>him-5(e1490), heIs63</italic> <break/><italic>[wrt-2p::GFP::PH +</italic> <break/><italic>wrt-2p::GFP::H2B +</italic> <break/><italic>lin-48p::mCherry] V</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CHL56</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>drpIs3 [lin-48p::tdTomato] I;</italic> <break/><italic>him-5(e1490) V</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BAR37</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>nsIs198 [mir-228p::GFP +</italic> <break/><italic>lin-15(+)]; otIs356</italic> <break/><italic>[rab-3p::2xNLS::TagRFP],</italic> <break/><italic>him-5(e1490) V</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CHL32</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>dpy-5(e907) I; otIs356</italic> <break/><italic>[rab-3p::2xNLS::TagRFP],</italic> <break/><italic>him-5 (e1490) V; drpIs1</italic> <break/><italic>[grl-2p::GFP, dpy-5(+)] X</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="top">OH13083</td><td valign="top">Pereira et al.

The <italic>lin-48<sup>prom</sup>::tdTomato</italic> construct was a kind gift from Mike Boxem and contains a 6.8 kb promoter fragment upstream of the coding sequence of <italic>tdTomato</italic> and the <italic>unc-54</italic> 3’ UTR. It was injected into <italic>him-5(e1490)</italic> animals and spontaneously integrated generating <italic>drpIs3</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>PHso1-to-PHD single animal live imaging</title><p>Animals containing the <italic>lin-48<sup>prom</sup>::tdTomato drpIs3</italic> transgene were synchronised via sodium hypochlorite treatment and allowed to develop until the early L3 stage. Next, they were mounted individually on 5% agarose pads in a droplet of the minimum concentration of sodium azide that paralysed the animals (which varied within experimental replicates) and viewed under a compound microscope to determine their developmental time. A total of 10–20 males in which the gonad had just turned to grow posteriorly were imaged. Care was taken to use the lowest fluorescent light intensity and exposure in order to minimise toxicity. After the initial imaging, animals were gently recovered by aspiration, washed in a droplet of M9 buffer, transferred to individual plates and allowed to develop overnight at 15°C. Each animal was then immobilised and imaged as described above. In those animals where the leading edge of the gonad had crossed back over to the ventral side, a sequence of time-lapse images was taken every 2–4 hr until PHso1-to-PHD remodelling was complete, 10–12 hr later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry and EdU staining</title><p>EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) feeding was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van den Heuvel and Kipreos, 2012</xref>) combined with immunohistochemistry to enhance reporter transgene fluorescence. In short, MG1693 bacteria (Thy-deficient, <italic>E. coli</italic> stock centre: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cgsc.biology.yale.edu/">http://cgsc.biology.yale.edu/</ext-link>) were grown in 100 ml of minimal medium containing 20 mM EdU for at least 24 hr, concentrated by centrifugation and seeded on NGM plates with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. A synchronised population of L1 larvae, obtained by hypochlorite treatment and hatching in M9 buffer, was allowed to feed on OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic> until early L3 (24–28 hr at 20°C). Worms were washed thoroughly in M9, plated onto MG1693 EdU containing plates and allowed to grow until late L4 – early adult stage (22–24 hr). Hard-tube fixation was chosen in order to preserve the male tail morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McIntire et al., 1992</xref>). Worms were washed thoroughly, transferred to DNA LoBind tubes (Eppendorf) and fixed for 12 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C in a rocking nutator, followed by 5% β-mercapto-ethanol for another 12 hr at 37°C in a rocking nutator. Worms were then incubated for 6 hr in 1 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma Aldrich) at 37°C and 700 rpm, followed by 24 hr with rabbit anti-RFP antibody (1:500, MBL) to detect the tdTomato fluorescence from the <italic>drpIs3</italic> reporter transgene. Alexa 555-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:200; Molecular probes) was used as secondary antibody. As EdU reaction can interfere with antibody staining, this was performed after the immunohistochemistry. The Click-IT reaction was performed in a total volume of 50 µl per tube, in the dark, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Click-IT EdU Alexa Fluor 594 kit, Invitrogen). Slides were mounted in Vectashield antifade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Samples were analysed the same day or the day after mounting, to minimise fading of fluorescence. Only animals where both head and tail were properly stained for tdTomato (cell body) and EdU (nucleus) were scored. Four independent EdU experiments were performed (see Source Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and all animals scored were plotted in the same bar chart.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>RNAi feeding experiments</title><p>The RNAi bacterial clone for <italic>sox-2</italic> was obtained from the Ahringer RNAi Collection (Source BioScience) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kamath et al., 2003</xref>). RNAi feeding experiments were performed following standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kamath et al., 2001</xref>). Briefly, isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.6 mM to NGM medium to prepare the RNAi plates. 24 hr later, HT115 bacteria transfected with the <italic>sox-2</italic> RNAi clone was seeded onto RNAi plates. Staged early-L4 larvae were transferred to seeded RNAi plates and 4–5 days later their progeny, which had developed under the embryonic effects of RNAi knock-down (F1 generation), were scored at the stage of young adult. To exclusively analyse post-embryonic effects, a synchronised population of L1 larvae was transferred to RNAi seeded plates and young adult males were scored 2–3 days later (P0 generation).</p><p>All experiments were performed at 20°C. The <italic>nre-1(hd20) lin-15b(hd126)</italic> background was used to sensitise worms to the RNAi effects. One experiment was performed with three replicate plates per condition.

In the case of <italic>oleEx24</italic> the presence/absence of the array in PHso1 and PHso2 was monitored by the <italic>mCherry</italic> expression from the array itself and the expression of an <italic>ida-1<sup>prom</sup>::gfp</italic> reporter (<italic>inIs179</italic>), in the background of the strain was used to monitor neuronal fate in PHso1/PHD. In the case of <italic>oleEx18,</italic> we had difficulty visualising the <italic>mCherry</italic> from the array in PHD and crossed a <italic>lin-48<sup>prom</sup>::tdTomato</italic> transgene (<italic>drpIs3</italic>) into the strain to visualise PHso1/PHD. The presence/absence of the array in whole animals was assessed using the array co-injection marker <italic>elt-2<sup>prom</sup>::gfp</italic>.

Mock-ablated animals underwent the same treatment as ablated males except for laser trigger. Animals were left to recover overnight and behavioural assays were performed the next day. After behavioural assays, animals were checked for lack of GFP expression in the tail-tip region where PHD is normally located to confirm correct cell ablation. The few animals in which PHD had not been efficiently ablated (judged by the presence/return of GFP) were discarded from the data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Behavioural assays</title><p>All behavioural assays were scored blind to the manipulation. Males carried either an <italic>oig-8<sup>prom</sup>::gfp</italic> or an <italic>unc-17<sup>prom</sup>::gfp</italic> transgene to identify the PHD neurons for ablation. For the experiments in which PHD was silenced with a HisCl1 transgene, mating assays were performed in 2-day-old adults, as in the ablations. Before the assay, <italic>wildtype</italic> or array-carrying animals with RFP-positive PHD neurons were moved to a 20 mM histamine plate with food for 1 hr. As controls, array-carrying animals not treated with histamine were also tested. Histamine plates were prepared as regular NGM plates adding 20 mM histamine when the agar cooled to a temperature below 56°C.</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Food leaving</title><p>Animals were tested as 3-day-old adults (the day after they had been tested for mating).

Males were tested at two days of adulthood with 1-day-old <italic>unc-51(e369)</italic> hermaphrodites picked the night before as L4s. Each male was tested once for all steps of mating. Those males that were not successful at inserting their spicules with the first hermaphrodite were tested again with a maximum of three hermaphrodites to control for hermaphrodite-specific difficulty in penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</xref>). Assays were replicated at least three times on different days and with different sets of males. Videos of mating events were recorded and scored blind by two independent observers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Response</title><p>A male was scored as responding to mate contact if it placed its tail ventral down on the mate’s body and initiated the mating sequence by backing along the mate’s body to make a turn. The response efficiency was calculated by dividing 1 (response) by the total number of contacts made with the mate before responding. If a male did not respond within three minutes, it was scored as having 0 efficiency. As a more sensitive measure of the quality of response, we scored hesitation during response. Hesitation is a switch in direction between forward and backward locomotion from the time the male establishes contact with the mate to the first turn (or to location of vulva if this occurs without the need of a turn).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>Scanning</title><p>A single scan was scored as the journey around the mate’s body away from and returning to the vulva position.

Since the transition between the forward and backward steps could take up to 3 s in a <italic>wildtype</italic> male, the category of discontinuous manoeuvre ‘stop before backward step’ was scored if the pause was longer than 3 s. Any other visible pause during forward or backward locomotion was considered a STOP regardless of its duration. The category of discontinuous manoeuvre ‘switching’ was scored as a change in direction of locomotion while travelling away or towards the vulva without reaching it.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-7"><title>Displacements from the vulva</title><p>Scored as movements of one or two tail-tip lengths away from the vulva.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-8"><title>Fertility assays</title><p>Each individual male was monitored for all mating steps during a single mating until it ejaculated. After disengagement from the mate, the hermaphrodite was picked and placed in a fresh plate to lay progeny.

findings showing that neurons can arise via transdifferentiation from other cell types in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Here, they show that a sex-shared socket glial cell transdifferentiates to a male-specific sensory neuron type, and suggest that these neurons play a proprioceptive role in male mating behavior. This work provides insights into mechanisms by which the nervous system generates sexually dimorphic behaviors.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A direct glia-to-neuron natural transdifferentiation ensures nimble sensory-motor coordination of male mating behaviour&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Douglas Portman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All reviewers were supportive of this work, noting that the discovery of a sex-specific glia-to-neuron transdifferentiation event, and the correlation of this neuron with behavioral phenotypes, is of great interest. However, since the existence of this cell was previously suggested by Sulston, and both transdifferentiation and the role of glia as neuronal precursors have been reported previously, all reviewers felt (and I concur) that this work requires additional mechanistic insights at this point.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Strengthen the evidence for transdifferentiation. As currently presented, it is not completely clear whether this is direct transdifferentiation or whether a cell division event occurs. A few experimental avenues were suggested. These include:</p><p>a) Examining whether you detect an apoptotic cell in the vicinity of PHso1 during its transdifferentiation. If not, this might help bolster the direct transdifferentiation model, as opposed to division of PHso1 followed by rapid death of one of the daughters. Along these lines, also consider looking at a canonical cell death mutant.</p><p>b) Provide time lapse video of the differentiation event so that the cell dynamics can be easily followed. A reviewer felt that the images in Figure 2 were not very clear and suggested using a membrane-tagged reporter for easier visualization.</p><p>c) A number of genes have previously been shown to regulate the Y-to-PDA transdifferentiation (Jarriault and others). Determining whether these genes or a subset also play a role in the PHso1 transdifferentiation process would help to establish whether the processes are shared or distinct and begin to outline the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>2) Clarify and strengthen the behavioral analysis.

However, since the existence of this cell was previously suggested by Sulston, and both transdifferentiation and the role of glia as neuronal precursors have been reported previously, all reviewers felt (and I concur) that this work requires additional mechanistic insights at this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed a number of additional experiments – described in more detail below – that provide several additional cellular and mechanistic insights. In summary we find that, at the molecular level, the “plasticity cassette” described by Sophie Jarriault’s lab is not required for either PHso1-to-PHD or AMso-to-AMso’+MCM. This suggests not all transdifferentiations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are equivalent and that the genes involved in Y-to-PDA transdifferentiation are not the only plasticity genes. We also now provide data that demonstrate that PHso1 actually divides at low frequency and in a background dependent manner to generate PHD1/PHD2. We find this variability incredibly intriguing of course, as the only other variable lineages in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are the EF neurons, the DX neurons and P3.p vulval precursor cells. The EFs are the major post-synaptic target of the PHDs. We are continuing our work on both the molecular regulation and variable cell division aspects in our ongoing studies, outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>Although the potential existence of PHD had indeed been suggested by John Sulston, he also stated “no other neuronal characteristics were observed” aside from the presence of cilia. Here we demonstrate the acquisition of neuronal features at the morphological, ultrastructural and molecular levels as well as the function of the PHD neuron in male mating behaviour. We think that a second report of a glia-to-neuronal cell fate switch actually cements this process as a fundamental mechanistic principle of neural development (which in many ways is very similar to vertebrate adult neurogenesis). This is also only the second well-described example of a direct transdifferentiation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (the other being Y-to-PDA). The number of transdifferentiation paradigms described with clear lineage relationships pre/post cell fate switch and at such cellular resolution are few and far between and so should be of interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Strengthen the evidence for transdifferentiation. As currently presented, it is not completely clear whether this is direct transdifferentiation or whether a cell division event occurs. A few experimental avenues were suggested. These include:</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have now performed a number of additional experiments to address this and we thank the reviewers for pushing us to look into this in much more detail. We find that ~80% of the time PHso1-to-PHD is a direct transdifferentiation. However, in ~20% of cases (variable depending on background) PHso1 actually divides to generate what we have termed PHD1 and PHD2. We note that in all our behaviour experiments we ensured following laser ablation that no PHDs remained and that the drivers we used to silence the cells would also silence PHD2. We find PHD2 indistinguishable from PHD1 in terms of gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Examining whether you detect an apoptotic cell in the vicinity of PHso1 during its transdifferentiation. If not, this might help bolster the direct transdifferentiation model, as opposed to division of PHso1 followed by rapid death of one of the daughters. Along these lines, also consider looking at a canonical cell death mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>John Sulston originally described all the apoptotic events in the male tail and in corroboration of his data we do not observe any apoptotic cell corpses in the vicinity of PHso1. However, given that the male tail is undergoing quite dramatic morphogenetic changes at the same time as PHso1-to-PHD transdifferentiation, we have also analysed <italic>ced-4(n1164)</italic> mutants. We find no evidence for a cell death arising from PHso1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). To our surprise however, at a low frequency we did observe the presence of one or two extra cells in the tail (maximum one extra cell per side) co-expressing <italic>lin-48<sup>prom</sup>::tdTomato</italic> and <italic>rab-3<sup>prom</sup>::yfp</italic> in both mutant and control animals and have now investigated the origin of these cells in more detail (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Provide time lapse video of the differentiation event so that the cell dynamics can be easily followed. A reviewer felt that the images in Figure 2 were not very clear and suggested using a membrane-tagged reporter for easier visualization.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide, in an updated version of Figure 2, a time-series of an individual animal imaged every 2–4 h over the 10–12 h period of PHso1-to-PHD transdifferentiation. We think that this experiment unambiguously demonstrates that in the majority of cases PHso1-to-PHD is a direct transdifferentiation.</p><p>Following our observation of additional cells expressing <italic>lin-48/rab-3</italic> in the vicinity of PHD (see above), we have now characterised in more detail the battery of glial/neuronal markers at our disposal and find the presence of an additional PHD-like cell at a low and background-dependent frequency (13-24%). This data is now presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We find these extra cells indistinguishable from PHD both in terms of morphology and gene expression. To determine the origin of these cells we performed Edu staining experiments, to look for dividing cells, in a <italic>lin-48<sup>prom</sup>::tdTomato</italic> background. We only detect Edu staining in <italic>lin-48<sup>prom</sup>::tdTomato</italic> labelled cells in the tail if, and only if, two cells per side are observed. We observe this at a frequency of 21% (Figure 3). In addition, we observed the division of PHso1 “live” in one of our time-lapses of single animals (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). All together this indicates that while PHso1 mainly transdifferentiates directly into PHD it can also, at low frequency, divide symmetrically to generate two neurons, which we now refer to as PHD1 and PHD2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) A number of genes have previously been shown to regulate the Y-to-PDA transdifferentiation (Jarriault and others). Determining whether these genes or a subset also play a role in the PHso1 transdifferentiation process would help to establish whether the processes are shared or distinct and begin to outline the underlying mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analysed loss-of-function mutants in <italic>sem-4</italic> and <italic>egl-27</italic>, as well as both RNAi and a mosaically-rescued null allele of <italic>sox-2</italic>. These genes are all core members of the Y-to-PDA “plasticity cassette” which has been shown by the Jarriault lab to be required for the initiation of Y-to-PDA transdifferentiation, specifically in the erasure of Y identity. We find that these factors are largely dispensable for PHso1-to-PHD transdifferentiation. This data is presented in Figure 5, a new figure. Being somewhat surprised (but rather excited) by these results we extended our analysis to AMso-to-AMso’+MCM transdifferentiation and again find these factors are dispensable. All together our results demonstrate that AMso-to-AMso’+MCM indirect transdifferentiation and PHso1-to-PHD direct transdifferentiation are likely governed by distinct mechanisms. This suggests that the “plasticity cassette” are not the only plasticity genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and we are looking forward to discover the molecular mechanisms of glia-to-neuron cell fate switches in our future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clarify and strengthen the behavioral analysis.

Please determine whether response behavior is less smooth, even if it ultimately occurs just as frequently as in wildtype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-analysed the videos from the ablation experiments scoring “hesitation” as a more sensitive measurement of the quality of the Response step. As described in Materials and methods, we have termed “hesitation” a switch in direction between forward and backward locomotion from the time the male establishes contact with the mate to the first turn (or to location of vulva if this occurs without the need of a turn). Although the proportion of PHD-ablated males that hesitate during response is slightly higher than mock males, the difference is not statistically significant. One possible reason for a less pronounced discontinuity in movement during response compared to during scanning may be that we are measuring locomotion during a shorter period of time during response and so the full defects cannot reveal themselves. We have added this data to Figure 7B</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In Video 4, it seems that, after moving away from the vulva, the male repeatedly attempts intromission &quot;ectopically&quot;, near the tail.

If this is observed, it could be that the PHDs instead inhibit Lov (location-of-vulva) behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-analysed the videos of the ablations experiments and scored ectopic prodding during Molina manoeuvres (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A and B) and during scans (Figure 7—figure supplement 2C and D). We only observed a small but statistically significant increase in ectopic prodding during Molina manoeuvres in PHD-ablated males compared to mocks (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A). However, ectopic prodding occurred exclusively during discontinuous manoeuvres and the proportion of discontinuous Molina manoeuvres with ectopic prodding was similar in mock and PHD-ablated males (Figure 7—figure supplement 2B). Therefore, we conclude that the main defect resulting from the ablation of PHD is discontinuity in locomotion during manoeuvres and that ectopic prodding may be a secondary consequence of pausing and interrupting locomotion. Because PHD-ablated males perform many more discontinuous manoeuvres than mocks, ectopic prodding also increases.</p><p>We have also changed the graph showing the percentage of discontinuous scans in Figure 7C and added categories so that the plot matches the one for Molina manoeuvres in Figure 7F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Videos 3, 4, S3: it would be helpful to indicate in the video itself exactly when the &quot;Molina manoeuvre&quot; takes place and, in Video 4, when the defect occurs.

We have also indicated that the videos are sped up 2x in the video legend. We have also renamed the videos so that they are all main and not supplemental videos. Current Videos 1 to 7 were respectively, video 1, 2, S1, S2, 3, S3 and 4</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) While the ablation data are nice, there are some issues regarding how you determined that the cells were ablated, and the absence of an orthogonal method of ablation for confirmation. Reviewers suggested a couple of possibilities for experiments: you have a PHD-specific oig-8 promoter version. You could try to feminize driving TRA-2(IC) under this promoter and checking behavior although it is possible that this promoter comes on too late to feminize. Alternatively, you could silence/ablate PHD using this promoter to confirm the behavioral phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s view that there were issues regarding how we determine the PHD cells are ablated. We believe laser ablations are the cleanest and most specific way to remove neurons in an otherwise intact animal and we have extensive expertise in larval ablations. Any other type of manipulation that relies on a genetic driver has the caveat of lack of specificity without a single-cell-specific driver. The most specific promoter at our disposal, the <italic>oig-8</italic> promoter, is not uniquely expressed in PHD but also in two classes of sensory neurons in the head. To further demonstrate the specificity of our laser ablations and the method by which we ensure PHD cell death, we have included a new ablation control experiment in which we specifically ablate PHDR, leaving PHDL intact (the cells are ~5µm apart). These control experiments are presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><p>We have additionally pursued a genetic approach as requested by the reviewers. We initially tried driving a reconstituted <italic>ced-3</italic> caspase in the PHD neurons but we either failed to get transgenic lines at mid-range concentrations (15 ng/µl) or failed to efficiently kill all PHD neurons in a significant proportion of animals at low concentrations (5 ng/µl). We then generated an inducible silencing transgene driving an histamine-gated chloride channel in PHD neurons<italic>, oig-8::HisCl1::sl2::rfp</italic>. We could confirm expression of this transgene in PHD neurons by red fluorescence. This approach recapitulated the discontinuity in Molina manoeuvres that we had previously observed in the laser ablation experiments. We have included this data in Figure 7F. However, we would like to note that we did not observe a statistically significant difference in the quality of scans (discontinuous versus discontinuous) in PHD-silenced males compared to controls (data not shown). We don’t know the reasons for a lack of a scan phenotype in the silencing experiments but having extra oig-8 expressing neurons silenced in the head may compensate for the absence of PHD activity. Alternatively, removing the neuron completely through ablation may impact the circuit more severely than just silencing it.</p></body></sub-article></article>
