Here we report a cancer-promoting role for ATM. ATM depletion in metastatic cancer cells reduced cell migration and invasion. Transcription analyses identified a gene network, including the chemokine IL-8, regulated by ATM. <italic>IL-8</italic> expression required ATM and was regulated by oxidative stress. IL-8 was validated as an ATM target by its ability to rescue cell migration and invasion defects in ATM-depleted cells. Finally, ATM-depletion in human breast cancer cells reduced lung tumors in a mouse xenograft model and clinical data validated IL-8 in lung metastasis. These findings provide insights into how ATM activation by oxidative stress regulates <italic>IL-8</italic> to sustain cell migration and invasion in cancer cells to promote metastatic potential. Thus, in addition to well-established roles in tumor suppression, these findings identify a role for ATM in tumor progression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07270.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07270.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07270.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Damaged DNA threatens the normal activity of living cells, so cells use a number of mechanisms to ensure that this damage is repaired. When DNA is damaged, an enzyme called ATM activates several other proteins that ultimately lead to the DNA being repaired. Problems with detecting and repairing damaged DNA have been linked to cancer. Thus, these pathways, including the activity of ATM, were previously thought to only be involved in cancer suppression.</p><p>Now, Chen et al. report a new cancer-promoting role for ATM. The experiments reveal that reducing the amount of ATM in cancer cells actually made them less able to migrate and less invasive. Likewise, human breast cancer cells in which the levels of ATM had been depleted formed fewer lung tumors than normal breast cancer cells when they were transplated into mice.</p><p>Oxidative stress—a build-up of harmful chemicals inside cells—is a signature feature of cancer cells and is known to be another signal that activates ATM. Chen et al. found that activating ATM through oxidative stress, but not by DNA damage, encouraged the cancer cells to migrate and become invasive. Further analysis of cellular responses following ATM activation by oxidative stress revealed that this enzyme regulates the production of a small protein called interleukin-8. This protein is an important pro-inflammatory molecule that has been implicated in cancer, in particular, in helping cancer cells to migrate to other tissues. When interleukin-8 was added to ATM-depleted cancer cells, it rescued their defects in spreading and invasiveness, thereby providing strong evidence that interleukin-8 is a biologically important target of ATM.</p><p>Clinical data confirmed that breast cancer cells that had also spread to the patient's lungs often produced high levels of interleukin-8. Together, these findings suggest that ATM could be a potential target for anti-cancer therapies, as inhibiting this enzyme would inhibit interleukin-8, and in turn slow the progression and spread of cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07270.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07270.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>ATM</kwd><kwd>IL-8</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2012-39521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stracker</surname><given-names>Travis H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Kyle M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ATM kinase has an unanticipated role in tumor progression through the regulation of cell migration by oxidative stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer treatments rely heavily on DNA damaging agents, including radiation and chemotherapeutics, to eliminate cancer cells and decrease tumor burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Begg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lord and Ashworth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung-Ong et al., 2013</xref>). These cancer therapies activate complex signaling networks, termed the DNA damage response (DDR), that detect and signal the presence of DNA damage to promote cell cycle arrest and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>). The apical protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) initiates a large signaling cascade in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by phosphorylating many key proteins, including the tumor suppressor p53, to orchestrate the DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shiloh and Ziv, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stracker et al., 2013</xref>). The DDR regulates cell fate decision pathways including apoptosis, senescence and differentiation. Many of these pathways depend on ATM and/or p53 to enforce tumor suppressive anti-cancer barriers to limit proliferation in response to, and in the presence of, DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Norbury and Zhivotovsky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartkova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gorgoulis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Micco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vousden and Lane, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sherman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roos and Kaina, 2013</xref>). However, cancer cells exhibit genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>) and often contain endogenous oxidative and replicative damage that can promote genetic alterations to drive malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klaunig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hills and Diffley, 2014</xref>). Cancer cells evolve a defective DDR to allow cell proliferation in the presence of DNA damage, furthering genome instability and cancer progression. Defects in the DDR can also profoundly influence DNA damage-dependent therapies both positively and negatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bouwman and Jonkers, 2012</xref>). Thus, DDRs can influence both cancer promoting and suppressing mechanisms. This concept is perhaps best exemplified by p53, which is normally activated by stress signals and promotes tumor suppressor pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bieging et al., 2014</xref>). However, the tumor-associated gain-of-function p53 mutations that are most commonly observed in human cancers exhibit several tumor-promoting functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muller and Vousden, 2013</xref>). Thus, tumor suppressive or promoting activities from the same protein can be dictated by many factors including mutations, cell type, and/or disease context.</p><p>ATM regulates complex signaling networks that are involved in many biological processes in addition to DSB signaling and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stracker et al., 2013</xref>). Aside from increased tumorigenesis, ATM-deficiency results in altered metabolism, aberrant immune and inflammatory responses and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schneider et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freund et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kulinski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Valentin-Vega et al., 2012</xref>). Several of the pathological outcomes in ATM deficient mice have been linked to ROS and many of these pathologies can be reversed by the addition of antioxidants, highlighting the important role of ATM in regulating redox-homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reliene and Schiestl, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reliene et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freund et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okuno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">D'Souza et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, ATM can be directly activated by ROS, independently from DSB signaling, and has been implicated in mitochondrial quality control, potentially through an ability to localize to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Valentin-Vega et al., 2012</xref>). The substrates of ATM following ROS mediated activation, and how distinct they are from those modified following DNA damage, remains unknown.</p><p>The NF-κB family of transcription factors are similarly activated by multiple stimuli that include DNA damage and ROS. NF-κB signaling regulates inflammation and is involved in cancer where it has been associated, like p53, with both anti and pro-tumorigenic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Neriah and Karin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oeckinghaus et al., 2011</xref>). NF-κB signaling can be regulated by ATM through the phosphorylation of NEMO, which aids in transmitting nuclear ATM signaling to activate NF-κB in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). Upon activation, NF-κB translocates to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression and influences cell survival pathways. Understanding the crosstalk between the NF-κB and ATM signaling in complex pathologies including inflammation and cancer remains an area of active investigation.</p><p>Cancer cells acquire several capabilities in addition to uncontrolled proliferation during the multistep process of tumorigenesis, including cell migration and invasion that promote tumor metastasis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedl and Alexander, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Valastyan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Metastasis occurs when a tumor spreads by means of cell migration and invasion to a secondary site, a process linked with the majority of cancer deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Several pathways suppress this dangerous process as part of tumor suppressive mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mehlen and Puisieux, 2006</xref>). Although the role of DNA damage and the DDR in this process has not been extensively explored experimentally, increased genomic instability due to the acquisition of DDR defects has been proposed to play a role in the acquisition of these traits based on human patient data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halazonetis et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here, we studied the contribution of the DDR kinase, ATM, in metastatic programs operating in cancer cells. We found that ATM supports migration and invasion, cellular processes intimately linked with metastasis. Our data is consistent with endogenous oxidative stress triggering these responses independently from DSB signaling. Gene expression analysis identified an ATM and mutant p53 transcriptional program that contained pro-migration and invasion genes, including interleukin-8 (IL-8). Addition of IL-8 rescued defects in cell migration and invasion observed in ATM-depleted cells thus validating this target. Consistent with the biological relevance of these findings, ATM promoted tumor formation in a xenograft human breast cancer cell model. Based on the data, we propose a non-canonical role for ATM in supporting pro-tumorigenic behavior of cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ATM promotes cell migration and invasion independent of DNA DSBs</title><p>Given the prevalence and success of DNA-damage based cancer treatments, we sought to determine whether DNA damage and the DDR could inhibit pro-metastatic processes as part of its well-established role as an anti-cancer barrier. To this end, we first determined the effects of DNA damaging agents on cell migration, a process intimately linked with metastasis. DNA damage, including ionizing radiation (IR), topoisomerase II poisons etoposide (Et) and doxorubicin (Dox), had little effect on cell migration in the highly metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 as measured by wound healing assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Induction of the DNA damage marker, phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (γH2AX), confirmed DNA DSBs formations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These treatments arrested the cell cycle and inhibited proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Thus, cell migration is independent from DSB induction by DNA damaging agents, as well as cell cycle and growth arrest.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07270.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is required for cell migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wound-healing assays of MDA-MB-231 cells untreated (Unt) or treated with doxorubicin (Dox, 100 nM), phleomycin (Phleo, 90 μg/ml), etoposide (Et, 40 μM) or ionizing radiation (IR, 20 Gy).

As ATM mediates many initial DNA damage signaling events and regulates multiple cellular responses to DNA damage, we tested its role in cell migration. Strikingly, ATM depletion reduced cell migration in the presence or absence of IR-induced damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Increased DDR signaling as evidenced by phosphorylated H2AX, p53 and KAP1 confirmed DNA damage by IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We independently verified the requirement of ATM for cell migration and invasion using an xCelligence system that measures cell migration and invasion, as well as proliferation in real-time and in the same cell populations which provides standardized experimental conditions. Reduced invasion and migration in ATM-depleted cells was independent from proliferation as control and ATM-depleted cells grew similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Experiments with two additional independent ATM siRNAs confirmed these observations thus ruling out possible off-target effects by siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, ATM promotes cell migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells in the absence of exogenous DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ATM and p53 operate to promote cell migration and invasion</title><p>ATM is activated by at least two distinct mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shiloh and Ziv, 2013</xref>). DSBs activate ATM through interactions with the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex. ATM phosphorylates many targets, including the effector kinase CHK2, which collectively orchestrate the DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee and Paull, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsuoka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shiloh and Ziv, 2013</xref>). ATM is also activated by oxidative stress independently of DSBs, MRN or CHK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo et al., 2010</xref>), although the downstream pathways reliant on this ATM activation are unclear. In contrast to ATM inhibition, depletion of CHK2, MRE11 or NBS1 did not reduce cell migration, suggesting ATM-mediated cell migration occurred independently of DSB-dependent ATM activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; depletion analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that ATM could promote migration through oxidative stress. In support of this idea, chemical inhibition of oxidative stress in MDA-MB-231 cells using the reducing agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced cell migration similarly as depletion of ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also showed that NAC treatment inhibits intracellular oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To rule out any influence of proliferation on cell migration in our analyses, we performed live-cell imaging to track the migration of individual cells.

However, p53 is phosphorylated by ATM after oxidative stress and mutant p53 is involved in TGFβ-dependent cell migration in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adorno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore speculated that mutant p53 could act in concert with ATM to promote cell migration. To test this hypothesis, we depleted ATM, mutant p53 or both and analyzed cell migration. As expected, inhibition of mutant p53 resulted in reduced cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We confirmed and extended these results using real-time, simultaneous analyses of proliferation, migration and invasion. Although mutant p53 depletion mildly reduced proliferation, co-depletion of ATM resulted in an epistatic reduction of cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

The identification of an epistatic relationship between ATM and mutant p53 in promoting cell migration pointed towards a common molecular pathway.

Out of the hundreds of genes in ATM-depleted cells whose mRNA levels were differentially regulated more than 1.5-fold compared to control siNon-coding (siNC) cells, only ∼40 genes showed equivalent regulation between siATM and si mutant p53 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A,B</xref>).

There, we observed an increase in primary tumor growth, consistent with the well-established role of ATM in tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To address whether ATM depletion could influence the ability of these cells to colonize secondary sites, we performed tail vein injections with shATM and shNC MDA-MB 231 cells and assessed lung colonization after 9 weeks. In contrast to the pro-tumorigenic effects of ATM depletion on primary growth, lung colonization was strongly suppressed in cells with reduced ATM levels compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>), consistent with the ability of ATM activity to regulate IL-8 mediated cell migration and invasion capacity. To examine the relationship between ATM and IL-8 expression and metastasis in human breast cancer, we analyzed a set of expression arrays from 560 breast cancer patients with clinical annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morales et al., 2014</xref>). The expression of IL-8 was significantly associated with metastasis to the lung but not bone or brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These data suggest that IL-8, and potentially ATM, do not affect all metastatic processes similarly in all tissues. The mRNA expression levels of ATM were not similarly associated with the probability of metastasis, however, ATM is regulated primarily at the post-transcriptional level and these analyses do not reflect its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that ATM can play dual functions in breast cancer tumor progression. On the one hand, ATM serves as a tumor suppressor to limit the proliferation or survival of cancer cells during primary tumor formation. However, based on our findings, ATM can also promote pro-metastatic processes such as lung colonization. These functions of ATM are likely through its ability to control the transcription of key regulators, including IL-8, that promote cell migration and invasion to influence metastatic colonization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, we have identified a tumor promoting activity for ATM. Our data is consistent with this pathways being triggered by intrinsic oxidative stress that occurs in highly metastatic cancer cells. This ATM-dependent pathway regulates the transcription of pro-metastatic genes including <italic>IL-8</italic> through the activation of the transcriptional regulator NF-κB. The expression of these genes, including <italic>IL-8</italic>, results in increased cell migration and invasion that aid in tumor progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). ATM is known to regulate several pro-inflammatory cytokines as part of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coppe et al., 2010</xref>). The SASP can be mediated by DNA damage induced ATM signaling through MRN and CHK2, but not p53. In addition, a role for p38 MAPK in the SASP has been defined that is independent of the initial ATM-dependent damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freund et al., 2011</xref>). Senescent cells are thought to promote tumor progression in the microenvironment through paracrine signaling by secreted pro-inflammatory factors including cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coppe et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2010</xref>). ATM has also been shown to regulate IL-8 secretion in response to DSB formation by etoposide, which is dependent on NF-κB and NEMO but independent from p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11a">Biton and Ashkenazi., 2011</xref>). From our data, we conclude that ATM, through a pathway requiring mutant p53, can support a transcriptional program that includes several pro-metastatic genes including IL-8 that maintain cell migration and invasion. These processes are operational in cancer cells and have the ability to support cellular activities contributing to tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a recent study identified a fundamentally different type of anti-cancer pathway mediated by ATM in a MLL-AF9 driven acute myeloid leukemia model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Santos et al., 2014</xref>). In this instance, ATM was required to block the differentiation capacity of these cells, thereby promoting their tumorigenic properties. p38 MAPK plays both pro and anti-tumorigenic roles and its downregulation has been demonstrated to reduce tumor growth and survival but also to promote the metastasis of colorectal cancer to the lung through the modulation of inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Urosevic et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, emerging evidence indicates that ATM represents another DDR factor that, like p53 or p38, can differentially influence pathways relevant to diverse aspects of tumorigenesis in a context dependent manner.</p><p>Our study emphasizes the ability of ATM to regulate the transcription of a sub-set of genes involved in tumor promoting pathways. Comparative expression analysis revealed wound healing as a major pathway regulated by both ATM and mutant p53. Several pro-metastatic genes from this analysis in addition to <italic>IL-8</italic>, including <italic>CXCL11, CCL2</italic>, <italic>MMP1</italic> and <italic>SAA2</italic>, were identified. By identifying <italic>IL-8</italic> as a target of oxidative stress and ATM, we provide a link between activated ATM by oxidative stress and pro-metastatic pathways operating in cancer cells. Our results provide additional insights into other disease pathways involving ATM including angiogenesis, a pathway triggered by oxidative stress and dependent on IL-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koch et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okuno et al., 2012</xref>). Inhibitors of the IL-8 pathway are actively being developed and evaluated in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for cancer and inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waugh and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). Our work provides a rationale for evaluating the clinical efficacy of IL-8 inhibition in the context of lung metastasis, including the use of ATM inhibitors beyond their ability to radio-sensitize cancer cells. It is intriguing that high IL-8 expression levels in breast cancers were specifically correlated with lung metastasis, a tissue location with high oxygen burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rosanna and Salvatore, 2012</xref>). Thus, regulation of IL-8 by ATM could promote a metastatic program that is important in an organ-specific context where oxidative stress and cytokine secretion occur. We hypothesize based on our findings that targeting ATM could inhibit IL-8 dependent processes involving tumor progression and metastasis in certain cancers. In addition, based on our study and those of others, ATM inhibition could also be efficacious in the setting of other diseases involving oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines including inflammation, angiogenesis and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Osorio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okuno et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, reagents and treatments</title><p>MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine and BT-549 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium with the same supplements.

Mouse lungs were perfused with India ink to quantify metastatic lesions as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 2004</xref>). For orthotopic tumor experiment, 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> shATM or shNC MDA MB 231 cells were injected into the #4 mammary fat pad of 6 week-old Balb/c mice. Mice were palpated three times weekly until tumors reached 750 mm<sup>3</sup>. Tumor size was expressed as tumor volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) and calculated by the formula: volume = (smaller dimension<sup>2</sup> × larger dimension)/2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of breast cancer patient gene expression data</title><p>Publically available breast cancer patient gene expression data from GEO was pooled (GSE2603, GSE2034, GSE5327, and GSE12276) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Minn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morales et al., 2014</xref>). In order to remove systematic biases, expression measurements were converted to <italic>z</italic>‐scores for all genes before merging. Multiple probes from the same gene were converted to a mean, patients were grouped based on expression levels and Kaplan–Meier survival was plotted. The hazard ratio (HR) and p value for each gene was calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model and performing likelihood ratio tests. The HR was checked for consistency over time, fulfilling assumptions of the Cox model. All significance measurements were done using expression as a continuous variable.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Miller lab for helpful discussions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission:</p><p>In their manuscript, Chen et al. describe an interesting dataset revealing an oncogenic, pro-metastatic role for the protein kinase ATM. Using breast cancer cells, they report that ATM is required for cell migration in a ‘wound healing’ experimental system, that this function of ATM is independent of its canonical role in the DNA damage response (DDR), acting instead through an alternative ROS-mediated activation pathway. They report that mutant p53 also contributes to cell migration in this system. Gene expression analysis downstream of ATM and mutant p53 reveals that both factors are positive regulators of IL-8 expression in a mechanism likely involving the transcription factor NF-κB. In turn, they demonstrate that IL-8 partially mediates the pro-invasive roles of ATM and mutant p53 in their system. They also show data from mouse xenograft experiments demonstrating a pro-metastatic role for ATM.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript displays great scholarship, with a strong dataset, and conclusions are fully supported by the data. Over the past few years it has become apparent that ATM plays other roles outside of its canonical role as the apical kinase in the DDR, and that some of these non-canonical roles may be oncogenic rather than tumor suppressive. Several lines of evidence point to a role for ATM as a sensor of oxidative stress playing roles in mitophagy, ROS control and central metabolism. Within this context, the pathway described here (i.e. ROS&gt;ATM&gt;NF-κB&gt;IL8&gt;invasion/metastasis) is deemed significant. The data are convincing and the connection to lung metastasis in particular is intriguing, especially given the high oxygen burden in lung in particular.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers assessed the manuscript as potentially meritorious of publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after addressing the following major concerns:</p><p>The reviewers pointed out that some aspects of the molecular pathway elucidated have been previously reported including the role of ATM in regulation of IL-8 production via NF-κB (Costa et al. Plos Pathog. 2013, PMID:24068928) and the ability of ATM to promote migration in a ROS-dependent manner (Singh et al. Cell Signal. 2014, PMID: 24705025). Additionally, pro-migratory roles for various p53 mutants have been well established (Muller and Vousden, Cancer Cell 2014, PMID: 24651012). In order to increase the impact and novelty of this work, the reviewers recommend additional experiments that would raise mechanistic insight and significance.</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate that ATM, mutant p53, and p65, are all involved in the regulation of IL-8 and that p65 associates with the IL-8 promoter. What is lacking is an explanation of exactly how ATM and mutant p53 are involved in this process. Does ATM directly phosphorylate mutant p53 or p65? Is this effect via the established NEMO-RIPK1 complex? Does mutant p53 bind to the IL-8 promoter? Is mutant p53 associated with p65 in the cytoplasm and preventing its nuclear import? A more thorough investigation of the mechanism of IL-8 regulation would improve this manuscript significantly.</p><p>2) ATM is known to regulate NF-κB signals at multiple levels, especially through direct phosphorylation of NEMO. The epispastic relationship between ATM and p53 in IL-8 regulation is intriguing and could have important implication in lung metastasis. Given both MDA-MB-231 or BT549 cell lines express mutant versions of p53 (R280K for MDA-MB-231 and R249S for BT549), it would be important to determine whether ATM regulates IL-8 expression in the context of WT p53 protein or only in the presence of mutant p53.</p><p>3) Given ATM regulates cell migration and IL-8 expression independent of DNA damage, it would be very helpful to determine whether ATM kinase activity is required for cell migration using the specific kinase inhibitors.</p><p>4) ATM is known to promote NF-κB signal, an important regulator of IL-8 expression.

Cell Signal. 2014, PMID: 24705025)</italic>.</p><p>We agree that some aspects of our work are related to those reported in these publications. In Costa et al., data was presented that induction of DNA damage by a viral protein induced the secretion of IL-8, which was ATM-dependent. We believe that our data suggest a very different scenario whereby endogenous oxidative stress results in ATM activation, which induces the transcription of IL-8. In Singh et al., macrophage conditioned medium was shown to induce cell migration in an ATM-dependent manner in MCF7 cells. MCF7 cells contain wild-type p53, and we now provide new data showing that ATM does not promote IL-8 expression levels in a wild-type p53 background, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A-B</xref>. In addition, IL8 was not studied in Singh et al. Thus, the pathway described in Singh et al. is likely to be very different in many aspects from our study. Therefore, although one can draw similarities between these studies, we believe our work is clearly novel and complimentary.</p><p><italic>Additionally, pro-migratory roles for various p53 mutants have been well established (Muller and Vousden, Cancer Cell 2014, PMID: 24651012)</italic>.</p><p>We completely agree and also cited this same review in the Introduction of our manuscript. We believe the significance of our work is the identification of ATM in a pro-migratory oxidative stress induced pathway involving IL-8 that promotes oncogenic functions, a finding that is significant and novel. Our data suggests that ATM is involved with these well-established pro-migratory roles of mutant p53, which is an exciting new finding.</p><p><italic>In order to increase the impact and novelty of this work, the reviewers recommend additional experiments that would raise mechanistic insight and significance</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) The authors demonstrate that ATM, mutant p53, and p65, are all involved in the regulation of IL-8 and that p65 associates with the IL-8 promoter.

These results are consistent with our observation that IL-8 levels are highly reduced under these conditions. Upon DNA damage, ATM is known to phosphorylate p53 on S15 which is involved in promoting its activity. NEMO is also phosphorylated by ATM upon DNA damage which activates the NF-κB pathway. How these pathways operate in cancer cells with high ROS levels is unknown. To further investigate how IL-8 is regulated by these pathways we have performed several additional experiments as suggested by the reviewers. We have found that ATM can phosphorylate p53 on S15 in MDA-MB-231 cells <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C</xref> suggesting that ATM could regulate mutant p53 directly. We have also analyzed the role of NEMO in regulating IL-8. Depletion of NEMO resulted in reduced IL-8 mRNA levels, the same result obtained in siATM or simutantp53 cells. These data demonstrate that NEMO is required for this pathway, data consistent with its established role in activating NF-κB. We have included these new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>.</p><p>We have also performed several additional experiments to determine how mutant p53 could regulate NF-κB. We tested whether mutant p53 associates with the IL-8 promoter. Unlike NF-κB, we were unable to observe enrichment of mutant p53 on the IL-8 promoter (data not shown). Although not definitive given this negative result, our inability to identify mutant p53 bound to the IL-8 promoter suggests that mutant p53 functions within a different context to regulate the promoter activity of IL-8. We also tested whether mutant p53 could interact with NF-κB in MDA-MB-231 cells. co-IP western experiments with mutant p53 or p65 did not detect any physical interaction between these proteins in MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). This suggests that it is perhaps unlikely that mutant p53 interacts with p65 in the cytoplasm to inhibit NF-κB activity. We instead favor a model whereby mutant p53 affects NEMO activation. We have new data showing that depletion of mutant p53 results in reduced NEMO phosphorylation (see 4 below). This suggests that mutant p53 helps promote NEMO activation, which is a known modulator of NF-κB. How gain-of-function p53 mutations alter p53 to promote pro-tumorigenic functions is known to be complex. Our additional experiments have identified the requirement of NEMO in regulating IL-8 and suggest that mutant p53 participates in this pathway. From these lines of evidence, we conclude that mutant p53 does not regulate IL-8 directly by binding to its promoter or through direct interactions with p65. We are excited to follow-up on these results in detailed and extensive future studies to analyze in-depth the molecular mechanisms that govern the crosstalk between ATM, mutant p53 and NF-κB signaling pathways, especially in regards to promoting cellular migration and invasion in response to oxidative stress.</p><p><italic>2) ATM is known to regulate NF-κB signals at multiple levels, especially through direct phosphorylation of NEMO. The epispastic relationship between ATM and p53 in IL-8 regulation is intriguing and could have important implication in lung metastasis. Given both MDA-MB-231 or BT549 cell lines express mutant versions of p53 (R280K for MDA-MB-231 and R249S for BT549), it would be important to determine whether ATM regulates IL-8 expression in the context of WT p53 protein or only in the presence of mutant p53</italic>.</p><p>Several previous studies have shown that WT p53 represses transcription of IL-8 (ex. Hidaka et al., J Exp Clin Cancer Res 2005, PMID: 15945132 and Yeudall et al., Carcinogenesis 2012, PMID: 22114072). Similar to WT p53, we observed that IL-8 mRNA levels increased upon siRNA-depletion of ATM in two different human cancer cell lines containing WT p53, U2OS and MCF7, respectively. These data support the idea that ATM functions to promote IL-8 expression in the context of gain-of-function mutant p53. We have included these new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2A-B</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Given ATM regulates cell migration and IL-8 expression independent of DNA damage, it would be very helpful to determine whether ATM kinase activity is required for cell migration using the specific kinase inhibitors</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we tested whether an ATM kinase inhibitor could affect cell migration. Consistent with our genetic studies of ATM depletion by siRNA or shRNA, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with the specific ATM kinase inhibitor KU-55933 resulted in reduced cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>). This data suggests that ATM kinase activity is required for cell migration. We now include this new data along with additional text describing this new result in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) ATM is known to promote NF-κB signal, an important regulator of IL-8 expression. In this context, it is helpful to determine the impact of mutant p53 on NF-κB signal (e.g. phosphorylation status NEMO or levels and phosphorylation of p65), whether both ATM and mutant p53 promotes NF-κB signal to regulate IL-8 expression</italic>.</p><p>Our data suggests that, like ATM, mutant p53 also regulates NF-κB signaling. We have shown that depletion of mutant p53 results in: 1) reduced IL-8 and IL-8 promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref>), 2) reduced nuclear p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and 3) reduced p65 accumulation on the IL-8 promoter by ChIP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). These results were all obtained also in ATM depleted cells, suggesting that ATM and mutant p53 regulate this NF-κB pathway similarly. In response to the reviewers’ suggestions, we have performed additional experiments to analyze how mutant p53 could regulate NF-κB signaling. We observe that ATM or mutant p53-depleted cells do not reduce expression of NF-κB or NEMO at either the mRNA or protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2C-F</xref>). However, we did observe reduced phosphorylation of NEMO in p53-depleted cells that was similar to the reduction in ATM-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2F</xref>). These data, along with our new data showing the reduction of IL-8 mRNA in NEMO-depleted cells, suggest that NF-κB activity is regulated by ATM and mutant p53 through NEMO. Collectively, these data indicate that mutant p53 regulates NF-κB signaling in a similar fashion as ATM. These results are in agreement with ATM and mutant p53 cooperating to regulate NF-κB signaling that results in IL-8 expression.</p></body></sub-article></article>
