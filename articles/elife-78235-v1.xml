We recently developed the first herbicidal inhibitors of lysine biosynthesis, which provided proof-of-concept for a promising novel herbicide target. In this study, we expanded upon our understanding of the mode of action of herbicidal lysine biosynthesis inhibitors. We previously postulated that these inhibitors may act as proherbicides.

However, our current options are dwindling as the prevalence of herbicide-resistant weeds continues to rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hall et al., 2020</xref>). Weeds have now evolved resistance to 21 out of the 31 herbicide modes of action, yet there has been a lack of herbicides with new modes of action brought to market over the last 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Duke and Dayan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heap, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Despite the success of targeting amino acid biosynthesis enzymes for the development of herbicides (e.g. glyphosate and chlorsulfuron), the inhibition of plant lysine biosynthesis has never been explored commercially. Our group was the first to discover inhibitors of lysine biosynthesis with herbicidal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Soares da Costa et al., 2021</xref>). We showed that the most potent of these inhibitors, (<italic>Z</italic>)-2-(5-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-2,4-dioxothiazolidin-3-yl)acetic acid (MBDTA-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) targets lysine production by inhibiting dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), the enzyme that catalyses the first and rate-limiting step in the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Soares da Costa et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the mode of DHDPS inhibition by MBDTA-2 was through binding at a novel allosteric site distinct from the allosteric lysine-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which enables regulation of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hall et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure and mode of binding of (<italic>Z</italic>)-2-(5-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-2,4-dioxothiazolidin-3-yl)acetic acid (MBDTA-2).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structure of MBDTA-2.

Usually, herbicides inhibit their enzyme targets with greater potency than they inhibit <italic>in vivo</italic> plant growth. This is because the amount of herbicide reaching the target site is less than the amount applied. We proposed that this unusual similarity between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> activity may be due to MBDTA-2 acting as a proherbicide, which is modified <italic>in vivo</italic> to a form that is more active at the target site. Proherbicides have been reported in the literature such as diclofop-methyl, which is demethylated via ester hydrolysis <italic>in vivo</italic> to produce the more active compound diclofop . Whilst MBDTA-2 could not undergo the same process as it does not contain an ester, we postulated that a similar proherbicidal effect may be observed through the <italic>in vivo</italic> demethylation of the aryl methyl ether.</p><p>The present study sought to extend our understanding of the mode of action of our previously developed DHDPS inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Christoff et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Soares da Costa et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, we used biochemical enzyme kinetic assays to demonstrate that MBDTA-2 does not act as a proherbicide, and that the apparent similarity between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> potency may instead be explained by this series of compounds having a novel, dual-target mode of action through inhibition of the second lysine biosynthesis enzyme in the pathway, dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DHDPR). Static docking and biochemical assays revealed that in contrast to the allosteric binding of these inhibitors to DHDPS, active site binding is responsible for their inhibition of DHDPR. Additionally, we extended our previous <italic>in vivo</italic> activity studies on <italic>A. thaliana</italic> to include one of the most agriculturally problematic weeds in the world, rigid ryegrass (<italic>Lolium rigidum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajwa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Busi and Beckie, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibitory activity of a demethylated MBDTA analogue</title><p>Given that proherbicides are metabolised <italic>in vivo</italic> to produce compounds with greater potency at the target site, it can be assumed that the metabolised form will have greater activity than the proherbicidal form against the target <italic>in vitro</italic>. As such, to assess whether MBDTA-2 is a proherbicide that is demethylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, we measured the inhibitory activity of the demethylated analogue, (<italic>Z</italic>)-2-(5-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)-2,4-dioxothiazolidin-3-yl)acetic acid (HBDTA), against both recombinant <italic>A. thaliana</italic> DHDPS enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Christoff et al., 2021</xref>).

These values are slightly greater than those we reported for MBDTA-2 (IC<sub>50</sub> (AtDHDPS1) = 63.3 ± 1.80 µM, IC<sub>50</sub> (AtDHDPS2) = 64.0 ± 1.00 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Soares da Costa et al., 2021</xref>).

It is well established that proteins catalysing sequential reactions within a metabolic pathway often have conserved binding site features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jensen, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jenwitheesuk et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). As such, we hypothesised that DHDPS inhibitors may also have activity against the enzyme following DHDPS in the plant lysine biosynthesis pathway, DHDPR. The activity of both recombinant <italic>A. thaliana</italic> DHDPR enzymes was measured whilst titrating MBDTA-2 to determine the IC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.92 ± 0.92 µM against AtDHDPR1 and 8.58 ± 1.19 µM against AtDHDPR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Given that these results revealed a new target site for MBDTA-2, we assessed whether the compound could be proherbicidal with respect to DHDPR. To do so, we assessed the inhibitory activity of HBDTA against both AtDHDPR isoforms to determine the IC<sub>50</sub> values of 169 ± 0.92 and 155 ± 0.90 µM for AtDHDPR1 and AtDHDPR2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). HBDTA is therefore &gt;18-fold less potent at the DHDPR target site relative to MBDTA-2, suggesting that the MBDTA-2 methyl group is beneficial for DHDPR inhibition. As such, MBDTA-2 is unlikely to be a proherbicide. Moreover, these results demonstrate that MBDTA-2 is a multi-targeted inhibitor of two consecutive enzymes in the lysine biosynthesis pathway, AtDHDPS and AtDHDPR. This compound represents the first example of a dual-target inhibitor of the lysine biosynthesis pathway.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><italic>In vitro</italic> potency of (<italic>Z</italic>)-2-(5-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-2,4-dioxothiazolidin-3-yl)acetic acid (MBDTA-2) and (<italic>Z</italic>)-2-(5-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)-2,4-dioxothiazolidin-3-yl)acetic acid (HBDTA) against AtDHDPR.</title><p>Dose–response curves of (<bold>A</bold>) MBDTA-2 and (<bold>B</bold>) HBDTA against recombinant AtDHDPR1 (⚬) and AtDHDPR2 (+) enzymes.

Given that our attempts were unsuccessful, we employed a static docking approach using the published AtDHDPR2 crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Watkin et al., 2018</xref>). The resulting data suggested that MBDTA-2 binds in the active site with a binding affinity of −6.2 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The hydrophobic pocket occupied by MBDTA-2 overlaps with the probable NADPH cofactor-binding site, based on the crystal structure of cofactor-bound <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DHDPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reddy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Scapin et al., 1997</xref>). The predicted MBDTA-2 orientation suggests its stabilisation by polar interactions between the heterocyclic ring and Thr122 and Gly120. Additionally, the MBDTA-2 acid is within hydrogen bonding proximity to Asp185. To validate the mechanism of inhibition of MBDTA-2 against AtDHDPR, further enzyme kinetic experiments were performed. The previous dose–response experiments were conducted according to standard practice in that substrate and cofactor were kept at limiting concentrations to ensure that inhibition may be measured regardless of the kinetic mechanism of inhibition. Subsequently, the activity of AtDHDPR was measured whilst titrating MBDTA-2, this time in the presence of excess amounts of substrate and nucleotide cofactor, that is at concentrations 10-fold above the respective <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> values determined were 72.7 ± 1.07 and 69.5 ± 1.06 µM for AtDHDPR1 and AtDHDPR2, respectively, which are 10- and 8-fold greater than those determined for AtDHDPR1 and AtDHDPR2 when substrate and cofactor were limiting. This apparent reduction in potency indicates that MBDTA-2 is a competitive inhibitor, and therefore likely binds at the AtDHDPR active site as suggested by the docking results. Interestingly, this contrasts with the allosteric mode of inhibition of MBDTA-2 against AtDHDPS.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mode of AtDHDPR2 inhibition by (<italic>Z</italic>)-2-(5-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-2,4-dioxothiazolidin-3-yl)acetic acid (MBDTA-2).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The predicted MBDTA-2 (green)-binding site resulting from static docking with AtDHDPR2 (PDB ID: 5UA0) overlaps with the probable NADPH cofactor-binding site (cyan, left panel).

In our previous study, we described the development of the first herbicidal lysine biosynthesis inhibitors, providing proof-of-concept for a novel herbicide mode of action. Whilst we previously explored the molecular mode of action of these inhibitors at their target site, namely the DHDPS enzyme, an explanation for their unusual similarity in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> potency remained to be delineated. Specifically, we hypothesised that they may be acting as proherbicides, through demethylation of their aryl methyl ethers. While this mechanism of proherbicide conversion has not been reported to date, the demethylation of aryl methyl ethers on prodrugs, such as codeine, is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dayer et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kirchheiner et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, our finding that the demethylated analogue of the MBDTA-2 aryl methyl ether did not positively impact activity against the target enzyme DHDPS demonstrated that these compounds are not proherbicides.</p><p>Given that we could not attribute the similarity between the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> potency of our compounds to their modification to a more active form <italic>in vivo</italic>, we postulated that we may have previously failed to capture the totality of their target site effects. Our discovery that MBDTA-2 is an inhibitor of not only DHDPS, but also of the subsequent enzyme in the lysine biosynthesis pathway DHDPR, supported this hypothesis. Moreover, the ~8-fold greater potency of MBDTA-2 against DHDPR than DHDPS reveals that the <italic>in vitro</italic> potency is actually ~6-fold greater than the <italic>in vivo</italic> potency. Furthermore, the low-micromolar potency of MBDTA-2 at the DHDPR target site is comparable to the potency of glyphosate, the most successful commercial herbicide active ingredient, at its enzyme target 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sammons et al., 2018</xref>). The phenomenon of inhibitors having dual-target activity against consecutive enzymes in metabolic pathways has sometimes been attributed to conserved active site features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Toulouse et al., 2020</xref>). However, there are also many examples of inhibitors of multiple targets from distinct pathways, which have been identified regardless of binding site similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hashmi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first time a dual-target inhibitor has been shown to have allosteric and orthosteric inhibitory activity at two different enzymes. The advantages of multi-target inhibitors over single-target inhibitors have been well reported for the development of novel drugs and fungicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gullino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oldfield and Feng, 2014</xref>). Such advantages include a reduced susceptibility to the generation of resistance, which is also a highly desirable property in herbicide development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gressel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hall et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, there has been a focus on the use of herbicide mixtures inhibiting multiple molecular targets in attempts to reduce the generation of resistance to existing herbicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gressel, 2020</xref>). Despite the recognition of the potential of inhibiting multiple targets for the reduction of target site resistance generation, little work has been done on the development of new herbicides that do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Giberti et al., 2017</xref>). Dual-target compounds such as MBDTA-2 are therefore promising candidates for progressing the herbicide development field beyond the ‘one target-one herbicide’ approach.</p><p>For the future development of dual-target herbicides, the previously published DHDPS co-crystal structure and the DHDPR-binding model presented here could be used for the rational design of new MBDTA-2 analogues with increased target site activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Soares da Costa et al., 2021</xref>). Such rational design efforts could also be guided by additional kinetic assays in the presence of sub-saturating amounts of MBDTA-2. Examining any changes in the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values for the DHDPR substrate and cofactor under these conditions may provide further insights into MDBTA-2 interactions at the binding site. Additionally, exploring the structure–activity relationship of MBDTA-2 through the screening of analogues against whole plants may also provide insights into modifications that are advantageous to <italic>in vivo</italic> potency.</p><p>Although these methods offer opportunities to optimise inhibitor potency, formulation also has a substantial impact on the performance of herbicide active ingredients and is therefore an important avenue to pursue for potency maximisation. Whilst the <italic>in vivo</italic> assays conducted here provide proof-of-concept for the potential of dual-target lysine biosynthesis inhibitors as herbicide active ingredients, controlled-dosage spraying experiments with the formulated compound will be pertinent to assess the application rate required for herbicidal efficacy in comparison to commercial herbicides. Furthermore, metabolomics experiments to quantify changes in lysine and other aspartate-derived amino acid levels in response to treatment with dual-target lysine biosynthesis inhibitors would be of interest to validate the mode of action at the target site, as well as elucidate whether pathway deregulation contributes to the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity.</p><p>The development of new herbicides that are effective against <italic>L. rigidum</italic>, particularly those with a reduced propensity to generate resistance, is of the highest priority given the economic impact of this species. An overreliance on a small number of herbicide modes of action has culminated in the widespread evolution of multiple resistance mechanisms in <italic>L. rigidum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajwa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Owen et al., 2014</xref>). In Australia alone, herbicide-resistant <italic>L. rigidum</italic> invades 8 million hectares of cropping land, resulting in revenue losses of AUD$93 million annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Llewellyn et al., 2016</xref>). Our finding that MBDTA-2 can significantly reduce <italic>L. rigidum</italic> germination and growth further illustrates the potential utility of lysine biosynthesis inhibitors in combatting the global herbicide resistance crisis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DHDPS1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TAIR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AtG60880</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DHDPS2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TAIR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AtG45440</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DHDPR1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TAIR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">At2G44040</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DHDPR2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TAIR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">At3G59890</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PyRX</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Source Forge</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 0.8</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemical synthesis</title><p>Compounds were synthesised as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Christoff et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Perugini et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Recombinant AtDHDPS1, AtDHDPS2, AtDHDPR1, and AtDHDPR2 proteins were produced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mackie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Soares da Costa et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Enzyme inhibition assays</title><p>DHDPS enzyme activity was measured using methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Soares da Costa et al., 2021</xref>).

two targets in lysine synthesis. Further, the first enzyme has allosteric inhibition, while the second enzyme is a competitive inhibitor. The authors do a good job explaining why this is high interest for herbicide resistance management in a new compound. The authors demonstrated that the compound is not a pro-herbicide, and propose that the higher in vivo activity relative to in vitro activity is due to the simultaneous in vivo inhibition of two separate steps in lysine synthesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78235.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Gaines</surname><given-names>Todd</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03k1gpj17</institution-id><institution>Colorado State University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Gaines</surname><given-names>Todd</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03k1gpj17</institution-id><institution>Colorado State University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Schmitzer</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02pm1jf23</institution-id><institution>Corteva Agriscience</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.04.482975">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.04.482975v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Todd Gaines as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Paul Schmitzer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide the chlorsulfuron positive control data for the Lolium rigidum bioassay figure. Alter the claims for biological activity on Lolium rigidum and remove the extrapolated application rate, or conduct a new bioassay with methods suggested in the reviews.</p><p>2) The question arose in the reviews as to whether the compound is a pro-herbicide with respect to DHPDR. Please alter the discussion to raise this question, or consider conducting the experiment to add the demethylated compound to the DHPDR inhibition assay to test its activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Excellent paper. The authors could include a reference to work in fungicides to provide further evidence that multi-site inhibitors are lower risk for resistance evolution than single-site inhibitors. The bioassay method used for Lolium rigidum is unusual. The authors pipetted 2 mL of a 1200 mg/L solution directly onto seeds when sowing. Alternatives that could be used would include soaking seeds for 24 hour in herbicide solution; using an agarose based assay; spraying post-emergence on emerged seedlings; or spraying directly onto seeds or seedlings in soil. The authors report a calculated application equivalent of 48 kg/ha. It is not clear how this extrapolated number is obtained, nor is it realistic. No pesticide could be applied at such a high rate (the compound would be coated like salt onto everything in the field), and the sheer volume of water application required to achieve that would also represent drenching a field. I suggest that the authors remove this extrapolated calculation, and perhaps instead discuss the relative activity/toxicity of their compound in comparison to other known herbicides based on in vitro inhibition of the two enzymes. I don't think that more experiments are needed for this paper, but future work could conduct bioassays using methods that would provide more accurate ways to extrapolate to potential field use rates. Future work could also conduct biochemical measurements to ask whether lysine is reduced in Lolium rigidum following treatment with this herbicide, supporting the prediction that the mode of action is two-site inhibition of lysine synthesis. I also suggest that the authors provide more methods in the figure caption for Figure 5 so that it stand alone. Currently the caption only states the application concentration of 1200 mg/L, but it does not provide the application volume of 2 mL pipetted onto each seed, so in the current presentation the reader must examine the methods to understand the total dose applied to the plants. Suggest adding the 2 mL pipetting onto each seed to the caption.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper was a joy to read as it represents many processes in the design of new herbicides. I don't like creating additional work but through my review of the paper I kept wondering if the analogs presented in your previous publications (FBDTA and MBDTA-1), as well as any other available analogs, could build the knowledge of the inhibition of DHDPR and show a limited SAR. This may be a topic for a future publication so please disregard it if not appropriate for this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a well-written description of experiments to further determine the mode of action of novel lysine synthesis inhibitor. The expansion of the mode of action to two consecutive enzymes of the lysine synthesis pathway is a surprising result, especially with different binding modes for the two enzymes. Again, the in vitro activity MBDTA-2 is rather poor for an effective herbicide. Perhaps inhibition of two enzymes makes up for the poor activity on each of the enzymes. Was the demethylated form of the compound tested in an in vitro assay of AtDHDPR1 and AtDHDP2? This must be done. If HBDTA is much more active than MBDTA-2 on DHDPR, the results would make more sense to me.</p><p>The bioassay method is very weak, as it is impossible to determine whether MBDTA-2 is an effective herbicide from these results. Herbicides are not pipetted onto weed seeds in the field. MBDTA-2 was applied three times, on three consecutive days. In the field, a herbicide is applied once. I suggest that the compounds be applied once to the soil containing weeds seeds and watered into soil, as soil applied herbicide are used, or applied to foliage as a foliar spray with an adjuvant. I would try both methods, as some herbicides that are excellent soil-applied herbicides are poor foliar herbicides and vice versa. This way, you can compare the efficacy in g/ha with the positive control. Finally, herbicides are expected to kill weeds. Figure 5 shows only growth stunting. Where are the chlorsulfuron results?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78235.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide the chlorsulfuron positive control data for the Lolium rigidum bioassay figure.

To do so, we assessed the inhibitory activity of HBDTA against both AtDHDPR isoforms to determine the IC<sub>50</sub> values of 169 ± 0.92 µM and 155.3 ± 0.90 µM for AtDHDPR1 and AtDHDPR2, respectively (Figure 3B). HBDTA is therefore &gt;18-fold less potent at the DHDPR target site relative to MBDTA-2, suggesting that the MBDTA-2 methyl group is beneficial for DHDPR inhibition. As such, MBDTA-2 is unlikely to be a proherbicide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Excellent paper.

Direct pipetting onto seeds on soil, as employed in this study, is similar to soaking the seeds prior to planting, but is more relevant to herbicide use in the field. Pipetting directly onto seeds also functions similarly to spraying directly onto the seeds, however it provides a more consistent and controlled dosage as over-spray can occur with spray application. Experiments with Arabidopsis indicated that these inhibitors are more effective when applied pregermination. The value of further bioassays, as highlighted by the reviewer, has been acknowledged with the addition of the following at Line 287:</p><p>“Whilst the in vivo assays conducted here provide proof-of concept for the potential of dual-target lysine biosynthesis inhibitors as herbicide active ingredients, controlled-dosage spraying experiments with the formulated compound will be pertinent to assess the application rate required for herbicidal efficacy in comparison to commercial herbicides.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors report a calculated application equivalent of 48 kg/ha.

The IC<sub>50</sub> values of MBDTA-2 against AtDHDPR1 and AtDHDPR2 are 6.9 and 8.6 µM, respectively.

Future work will focus on optimisation of the inhibitors presented in this study in order to develop them as herbicides. This point is now included in the Discussion at line 281 as follows: ‘Additionally, exploring the structure activity relationship of MBDTA-2 through the screening of analogues against whole plants may also provide insights into modifications that are advantageous to in vivo potency.’ Future work will also optimise the formulation of these compounds to improve efficacy and this is included in the Discussion at Line 285 as follows: ‘Although these methods offer opportunities to optimise inhibitor potency, formulation also has a substantial impact on the performance of herbicide active ingredients and is therefore an important avenue to pursue for potency maximisation (Pacanoski, 2015). Whilst the in vivo assays conducted here provide proof-of-concept for the potential of dual-target lysine biosynthesis inhibitors as herbicide active ingredients, controlled-dosage spraying experiments with the formulated compound will be pertinent to assess the application rate required for herbicidal efficacy in comparison to commercial herbicides.’ The compounds presented demonstrate that they inhibit the germination and growth of a weed species and therefore could potentially be developed into herbicides with future optimisation. Accordingly, the claims for biological activity on <italic>Lolium rigidum</italic> have been altered as discussed in Response 1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Where are the chlorsulfuron results?</p></disp-quote><p>The chlorsulfuron positive control data has been added to Figure 5, panel A.
