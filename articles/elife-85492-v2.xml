population history in deep time has been assisted by fitting admixture graphs (AGs) to data: models that specify the ordering of population splits and mixtures, which along with the amount of genetic drift and the proportions of mixture, is the only information needed to predict the patterns of allele frequency correlation among populations. The space of possible AGs relating populations is vast, and thus most published studies have identified fitting AGs through a manual process driven by prior hypotheses, leaving the majority of alternative models unexplored. Here, we develop a method for systematically searching the space of all AGs that can incorporate non-genetic information in the form of topology constraints. We implement this <italic>findGraphs</italic> tool within a software package, <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic>, which is a reimplementation of the <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> software with new features and large performance gains. We apply this methodology to identify alternative models to AGs that played key roles in eight publications and find that in nearly all cases many alternative models fit nominally or significantly better than the published one. Our results suggest that strong claims about population history from AGs should only be made when all well-fitting and temporally plausible models share common topological features. Our re-evaluation of published data also provides insight into the population histories of humans, dogs, and horses, identifying features that are stable across the models we explored, as well as scenarios of populations relationships that differ in important ways from models that have been highlighted in the literature.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dogs</kwd><kwd>horses</kwd><kwd>humans</kwd><kwd>admixture graphs</kwd><kwd><italic>f</italic>-statistics</kwd><kwd>population genetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LL2103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flegontov</surname><given-names>Pavel</given-names></name><name><surname>Changmai</surname><given-names>Piya</given-names></name><name><surname>Flegontova</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Işıldak</surname><given-names>Ulaş</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LM2015070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flegontov</surname><given-names>Pavel</given-names></name><name><surname>Changmai</surname><given-names>Piya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LTAUSA18153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flegontov</surname><given-names>Pavel</given-names></name><name><surname>Changmai</surname><given-names>Piya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM100233</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maier</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Reich</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG012287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maier</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Reich</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000925</institution-id><institution>John Templeton Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant 61220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maier</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Reich</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21-27624S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flegontov</surname><given-names>Pavel</given-names></name><name><surname>Changmai</surname><given-names>Piya</given-names></name><name><surname>Flegontova</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Many published findings about population history that rely on inference of admixture graph models fitted to f-statistics are not robust since the method is generally inappropriate for extracting new information about population history.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Admixture graph models provide a powerful intellectual framework for describing the relationships among populations that allows not only branching of populations from a common ancestor but also mixture events. An admixture graph (abbreviated below as AG), as fit in the widely used software packages <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>TreeMix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pickrell and Pritchard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Molloy et al., 2021</xref>), is a directed acyclic bifurcating graph with two types of edges: those representing genetic drift, and those representing gene flow. Each admixture event is represented as a confluence of two gene flow edges. Nodes of such a graph represent unsampled intermediate populations, and terminal nodes (leaves) represent sampled present-day or ancient groups (see a mathematical definition in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Soraggi and Wiuf, 2019</xref>). An attractive feature of AGs is that they can summarize important features of population history without requiring specification of all parameters such as population sizes, split times, mixture times, and distinguishing between sudden splits or drawn-out separations. All these parameters describe important features of demographic history and are fit by many methods for fitting demographic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gutenkunst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gronau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schiffels et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flegontov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamm et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rogers, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubisz et al., 2020</xref>). However, the fact that it is possible to factor this difficult problem by first inferring important aspects of the topology (AGs fitted to allele frequency correlation statistics), and then fitting additional demographic parameters to data such as site frequency spectra, simplifies demographic inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pickrell and Pritchard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lipson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leppälä et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Molloy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). AGs thus serve both as conceptual frameworks that allow us to think about the relationships of populations deep in time, and as mathematical models we can fit to genetic data.</p><p>AGs are fitted to <italic>f</italic>-statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Soraggi and Wiuf, 2019</xref>). For convenience, below we use a concise definition of <italic>f</italic>-statistics by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipson, 2020a</xref>: ‘The most general definition is that of the <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistic <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>(<italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>; <italic>C</italic>, <italic>D</italic>), which measures the average correlation in allele frequency differences between (1) populations <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> and (2) populations <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic> that is, (<italic>p<sub>A</sub> – p<sub>B</sub></italic>)∗ (<italic>p<sub>C</sub> – p<sub>D</sub></italic>), for allele frequencies <italic>p</italic>, typically averaged over many biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms. This <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistic is the same as the <italic>D</italic>-statistic up to a normalization factor.’ The other <italic>f</italic>-statistics (<italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>) can be defined as special cases of <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics: <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>) = <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>(<italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>; <italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>) and <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>(<italic>A</italic>; <italic>B</italic>, <italic>C</italic>) = <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>(<italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>; <italic>A</italic>, <italic>C</italic>). <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-Statistics can be written as linear combinations of <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>- or <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>-statistics, and <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics can be written as linear combinations of <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>- and <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>-statistics. <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>-, <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-, and <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics have straightforward interpretations in terms of drift edges along the tree, see Figure 2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patterson et al., 2012</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1b</xref>. A challenge for fitting AG models is that they are often not uniquely constrained by the data, with many providing equally good fits to the <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>-, <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-, and <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub><italic>-</italic>statistics used to constrain them within the limits of statistical resolution. Previously published methods for finding fitting AGs (mainly <italic>qpGraph</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patterson et al., 2012</xref> and <italic>TreeMix</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pickrell and Pritchard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Molloy et al., 2021</xref>) were not well equipped to handle the large range of equally well-fitting models for three reasons: (1) They did not reliably provide information on whether there is a uniquely fitting parsimonious model or alternatively whether there are many models that fit equally well to the limits of statistical resolution, (2) they did not provide formal goodness-of-fit tests, and related to this, (3) they did not provide tests for whether the difference between the fits of any two models is statistically significant. As a consequence, and as we demonstrate in what follows, many published AG models have been interpreted as providing more confidence than is merited about the extent to which genetic data allows us to disentangle ancestral relationships.</p><p>To appreciate these problems, we first need to consider two main approaches that were utilized to study demographic history with AGs.</p><p>The first approach is to identify AGs automatically, either without human intervention or with guidance. It is possible in theory to exhaustively test all possible graphs for a given set of populations and pre-specified number of admixture events, as implemented, for example, in the <italic>admixturegraph</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leppälä et al., 2017</xref>). An exhaustive approach can provide a complete view of the range of models that are consistent with the data for a specified level of parsimony (total number of admixture events allowed in the graph), which is not biased by the algorithm used to explore the space of possible AGs. However, this approach is limited to small graphs (typically up to six groups, two admixture events) due to the rapid increase in the number of possible AGs as the number of populations and admixture events grows. As we show in our discussion of case studies, the simple models explored with an exhaustive approach can lead to misleading conclusions about population history because not including additional populations can blind users to additional mixture events that occurred (and whose existence is revealed by examining data from additional populations). Furthermore, models with additional admixture events that are qualitatively different to the best-fitting parsimonious graph and that capture the true history, will sometimes be completely missed when constraining the number of gene flows. Alternatively, the programs <italic>TreeMix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pickrell and Pritchard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Molloy et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>MixMapper</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lipson et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>miqoGraph</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yan et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>AdmixtureBayes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nielsen et al., 2023</xref> preprint) all address the problem of how to rapidly explore the vast space of AGs relating a set of populations by applying algorithmic ideas or heuristics; all of these methods speed up model search by orders of magnitude.</p><p>The second approach to fitting AGs is to manually build them up by grafting additional populations onto simpler smaller graphs that fit the data. This approach involves stepwise addition of populations in an order that is chosen based on the best judgment of the user, and for each newly added population involves adding admixture events or tweaks in the graph until a fit is obtained; the user then moves on to adding the next population (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seguin-Orlando et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skoglund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McColl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreno-Mayar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tambets et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van de Loosdrecht et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flegontov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sikora et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajdinjak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergström et al., 2022</xref> for examples). The program <italic>qpGraph</italic> in the <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>) has been the most common computational method used for testing fits of individual AGs. Most AGs in the literature have been constructed manually in this way, often acknowledging the existence of alternative models by presenting plausible models side-by-side, and this approach has been the basis for many claims about population history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Posth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sikora et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajdinjak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergström et al., 2022</xref>). A strength of this approach is that it takes advantage of human judgment and outside knowledge about what graphs best fit the history of the human or animal populations being analyzed. This external information is powerful as it can incorporate non-genetic evidence such as geographic plausibility and temporal ordering of populations or linguistic similarity, or other genetic data such as estimates of population split times, or shared Y chromosomes, or rejection of proposed scenarios based on joint analysis of much larger numbers of populations than can reasonably be analyzed within a single AG. Thus, while manual approaches explore many orders of magnitude fewer topologies than automatic approaches often do, they still may provide inferences about population history that are more useful than those provided by automatic approaches. These methods’ strength is also their weakness: by relying on intuition, following a manual approach has the potential to validate the biases users have as to what types of histories are most plausible (these may be the only types of histories that will be carefully explored). This can blind users to surprises: to profoundly different topologies that may correspond more closely to the true history, and we discuss examples of this in the Results section.</p><p>In this study, we introduce a new method, <italic>findGraphs</italic>, that belongs to the first class of algorithms (those for automated AG topology inference). Algorithmic innovations and speedups in <italic>findGraphs</italic> enable us to explore a much larger proportion of plausible AG space than many other methods reported to date. The <italic>findGraphs</italic> method combines the advantages of automated and manual topology exploration by allowing users to encode various sources of information as constraints on the space of AGs, which is then explored automatically. However, the main innovations in <italic>findGraphs</italic> are not computational, but instead conceptual. Instead of finding one or a few AGs fitting the data well, we use <italic>findGraphs</italic> for exploring AG spaces and assessing if any reliable information on population history can be extracted from a given AG space (defined by a population set and parsimony constraints) in the first place.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Regardless of the approach used to search through the space of possibly fitting AGs, a challenge in the effort to find a uniquely well-fitting AG (or group of topologically similar AGs) is that it has been difficult to quantify the absolute goodness of fit of a model to date. We have not been entirely successful with this and are not aware of other work that has been successful. It is also difficult to assess the relative fits of multiple models, especially if they differ in complexity. Performance gains relative to the original implementation of <italic>qpGraph</italic> allow us to address this problem by obtaining bootstrap confidence intervals and p-values for estimated parameters of single models, as well as for the difference in fit quality of two models (see Appendix 1, Sections 1.B.3 and 2.E). In combination with the approach to automating the search of well-fitting AGs, this leads to a situation where we are able to find and test a large number of models, many of which fit equally well despite often having very different topological features. Published approaches to comparing the fits of AG models based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Bayesian information criterion (BIC), see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flegontov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref> have the problem that it is often not clear what the effective number of degrees of freedom is in the two models being compared since in the case of AGs it depends not only on the number of graph edges, but also on graph topology.</p><p>The methods for automated graph topology inference and model comparison relying on bootstrap resampling are implemented in <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic>, a comprehensive platform for learning about population history from <italic>f</italic>-statistics. It is built to provide a stand-alone workspace for research in this area and is implemented as an R package. For all computations, <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> exhibits large speedups relative to previously published platforms for <italic>f</italic>-statistic analysis (e.g., <italic>popstats</italic> and <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> version 6.0 which we call ‘Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic>’ in what follows to distinguish it from updated <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> version 7.0.2 which implements some of the speedup ideas also implemented in <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic>). This is achieved by deploying a series of algorithmic improvements, most notably storage of precomputed <italic>f</italic>-statistics in random access memory, which avoids having to rely on reading in extremely large genotype matrices to perform most computations. In addition to the new algorithmic ideas allowing efficient searching through the space of AGs and comparing the fits of two AGs, <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> also provides a solution to the question of which parameters of an AG are identifiable in the limit of infinite data. Methodological details are presented in Appendix 1, and below we focus on documenting problems of AG inference on simulated data and revisiting AGs from the literature to understand the extent to which methodological challenges with AG fitting biased previous studies.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Topological diversity of well-fitting models and effects of parsimony constraints on simulated data</title><p>First, we explored the performance of the <italic>findGraphs</italic> method for automated topology inference on simulated AGs of random topology, focusing on the following questions: (1) among <italic>findGraphs</italic> results, how common are AGs fitting nominally or significantly better than the true one but different topologically; (2) what is the degree of topological diversity among these models fitting the data better than the true one? For this purpose, we simulated AGs of four complexity classes using <italic>msprime v.1.1.1</italic>: eight or nine non-outgroup populations, and four or five admixture events. Only simulations where pairwise <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> for groups were in the range characteristic for anatomically modern and archaic humans were selected for further analysis, resulting in 20 random topologies per complexity class, each including a distant outgroup that facilitates automated exploration of the topology space.</p><p>We ran <italic>findGraphs</italic> on each simulated dataset starting from random graphs and pre-specifying the true number of admixture events (<italic>n</italic>), or <italic>n</italic> − 1, or <italic>n</italic> + 1 events. For each of these graph complexity levels, we performed 100 independent <italic>findGraphs</italic> runs and recorded 5 AGs from each run having the best log-likelihood (LL) scores. Topologically redundant AGs were discarded, and for the remaining AGs we calculated worst <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistic residuals (WR) and tested if the newly found models fit significantly better than the true model, using the bootstrap model comparison method developed in this study (see Appendix 1, Sections 1.B.3 and 2.E). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>, we show the following statistics for each simulated AG, summarized across simulated complexity classes and parsimony levels allowed at the stage of topology exploration: fraction of topologies found with <italic>findGraphs</italic> that fit better than the true AG (according to LL score), or that fit significantly better than the true AG, or those with plausible absolute fits (WR &lt; 3 SE). It is clear that for the great majority of simulated datasets, even a shallow exploration of the topology space with <italic>findGraph</italic> (100 independent runs) uncovers AGs that fit nominally better than the true topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and d</xref>) and are topologically diverse (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> for examples). When allowing for <italic>n</italic> admixture events, at least one AG fitting significantly better than the true one was found for 60% of simulated datasets. When <italic>n</italic> + 1 admixture events were allowed, this grew to 100% (all 80 datasets). It should be noted that some admixture events are indistinguishable with <italic>f</italic>-statistics; for instance, successive gene flows between two lineages, with no other edges branching off between the gene flows. If such gene flows were included in the random topologies we simulated, AGs with <italic>n</italic> events were overly complex for representing the true history. Thus, if we are dealing with random histories, choosing an optimal complexity class for topology search is not straightforward.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Computer simulations show that when the true admixture graph (AG) topology is complex, <italic>findGraphs</italic> frequently finds AGs fitting the data better than the true AG.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Fractions of distinct AGs found with <italic>findGraphs</italic> that fit the data nominally better than the true AG (according to log-likelihood [LL] scores).

Model parameters (graph edges) that were inferred to be unidentifiable (see Appendix 1, Section 2.F) are plotted in red.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85492-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>These results on simulated data raise concerns about the extent to which fitting AG topologies provide reliable information about population history. Even for histories including eight or nine groups, an outgroup, and four or five pulse-like admixture events, perfect diploid data, and groups as differentiated as Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans—a complexity class that is simpler than many models fitted to real genetic data in published papers—models fitting the data as well as or better than the true one are common, and their topological diversity is in most cases so high that it precludes consensus inference of topology by analysis of multiple topologies. As we demonstrate on another set of simulated data in Appendix 1 (Section 1.B.1), the probability of finding a ‘wrong’ model that fits better than the true one grows with increasing graph complexity, and that effect is reproduced with both <italic>findGraphs</italic> and <italic>TreeMix</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). We expect this problem to be even more acute when researchers are dealing with realistic complex histories. However, geneticists often rely on external constraints on AG topologies (such as temporal plausibility of a topology, results from <italic>qpAdm</italic> modelling, <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics, PCA, <italic>ADMIXTURE</italic>, geographical, archaeological, and linguistic considerations) that were not used for filtering the results of our topology searches on simulated data. Thus, it is possible in principle that published AG models are more robust than our results on simulated data, and we explore this issue in depth in the next section and in Appendix 2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Revisiting published AGs</title><p>We studied AGs from eight publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sikora et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajdinjak et al., 2021</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) with the goal of comparing published models to models identified by our algorithm for automatically inferring optimal (best-fitting) AGs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In all but one study, <italic>qpGraph</italic> or its automated reimplementation (<italic>admixturegraph</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leppälä et al., 2017</xref>) was used for fitting topologies to genetic data, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref> relied on the automated <italic>OrientAGraph</italic> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Molloy et al., 2021</xref>). The main question we were interested in is whether we can find alternative models which (1) fit as well as, or better than the published graph, (2) differ in important ways from the published graph, and (3) cannot immediately be rejected based on other evidence such as temporal plausibility. The studies were selected according to the criterion that an AG model inferred in the study is used as primary evidence for at least one statement about population history in the main text of the study. In other words, the AG method was used in the original studies to support new conclusions about population history, and not simply to show that there is a model that exists that does not contradict results of other genetic analyses, an approach that is a valid use of AGs and has been taken in some studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seguin-Orlando et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). There are many published studies that could have been included in our re-evaluation exercise as they meet our key criterion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McColl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Posth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flegontov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlhoff et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kutanan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergström et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lipson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vallini et al., 2022</xref>).

In every example, some of these graphs have topologies that are qualitatively different in important ways from those of the published graphs. Features such as which populations are admixed or unadmixed, direction of gene flow, or the order of split events, if not constrained a priori, are generally not the same between alternative fitting models for the same populations. This result agrees with the expectation from our exploration of simulated AGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While some of these graphs can be rejected since their topologies appear highly unlikely because of non-genetic or unrelated genetic evidence, for all of the publications except one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>), there are alternative equally-well-or-better-fitting graphs we identified and examined manually that differ in qualitatively important ways with regard to the implications about history, are temporally plausible (for instance, very ancient populations do not receive gene flows from sources closely related to much less ancient groups), and not obviously wrong based on other lines of evidence. These findings and the results on simulated AGs suggest that complex AG models, even with a very good fit to the data, often differ in important ways from true population histories.</p><p>The previous statements are valid if the original parsimony constraints are applied, that is, if the graph complexity (the number of admixture events) is not altered. Below in selected case studies (Shinde et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>.) we also explore the effect of relaxing the parsimony constraint. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> summarize these results for one or a few graphs from each publication, while <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> contains the full results for all studied graphs and setups. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> summarizes our assessment of inferences in the original publications that were supported by the published graphs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Log-likelihood (LL) scores of published graphs (those shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and automatically inferred graphs.</title><p>Each dot represents the LL score of a best-fitting graph from one <italic>findGraphs</italic> iteration (low values of the score indicate a better fit); only topologically distinct graphs are shown.

the number of admixture events being fit to the data, and we selected the best-fitting graph in each iteration, that is, a graph with the lowest LL score. Each iteration was initiated from a random graph. The algorithm is non-deterministic so that in each iteration it takes a different trajectory through graph space, possibly terminating in a different final best graph. The number of admixture events in the initial random graphs and in the output graphs was always kept equal to that of the published graph. For each example, we counted how many distinct topologies were found with significantly or non-significantly better or worse LL scores than that of the published graph (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To obtain a formally correct comparison of model fit, the published graph and each alternative model were fitted to resampled replicates of the dataset and the resulting LL score distributions were compared (see Appendix 1, Sections 1.B.3 and 2.E). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, for four of the eight publications we re-analyzed, the LL score of the published graph run on the full data is better than almost all the bootstrap replicates on the same data (it falls below the fifth percentile), which is a sign of overfitting, and underscores the importance of applying bootstrap to assess the robustness of fitted models and conclusions drawn from them.</p><p>The fraction of graphs with scores better than the score of the published graph should not be overinterpreted, as it is influenced by the <italic>findGraphs</italic> algorithm, which does not guarantee ergodic sampling from the space of well-fitting AGs. In particular, it is possible that despite <italic>findGraph’</italic>s strategies for efficiently identifying classes of well-fitting AGs (see Appendix 1, Sections 1.B.1 and 2.C), it has a bias toward missing particular classes of graph topologies. However, even one alternative graph which is not significantly worse-fitting than the published graph suggests that we are not able to identify a single best-fitting model. Many of these alternatives, despite providing a good fit to the data, appear unlikely, for example, because they suggest that Paleolithic-era humans are mixed between different lineages closely related to present-day humans. We were mainly interested in alternative models which are also plausible, and so we constrained the space of allowed topologies in <italic>findGraphs</italic> to those we considered plausible a priori, in cases where this was necessary for reducing the search space size. Constraints were either integrated into the topology search itself, or were applied to outcomes of unconstrained searches, as detailed below.</p><p>Below we summarize our key findings and the methodological implications from our re-analysis of the eight published datasets. For more detailed discussions see Appendix 2.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>1. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref></title><p>The AG for ancient and present-day dogs in Figure 1e of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref> includes an outgroup, six other groups and three admixture events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). A best-fitting newly found graph fits the data nominally better than the published one (two-tailed empirical p-value = 0.332), and it bears a closer resemblance to the human population history (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). In this new seven-population model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), both American and Siberian dog lineages represent a mixture between groups related to the Asian and East European dog lineages, and robust genetic results suggest that in the time horizon investigated in the original publication (after ca. 10,900 years ago) nearly all Siberian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sikora et al., 2019</xref>) and all American (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raghavan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Raghavan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreno-Mayar et al., 2018</xref>) human populations were admixed between groups most closely related to Europeans and East Asians. According to this model, East Mediterranean dogs are modeled as a mixture of a basal branch (splitting deeper than the divergence of the Asian and European dogs) and West European dogs, again in agreement with current models of genetic history of West Asian human populations who are modeled as a mixture of ‘basal Eurasians’ and West European hunter–gatherers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lazaridis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lipson et al., 2017</xref>). Although greater congruence with human history increases the plausibility of <italic>findGraph</italic>’s newly identified model relative to the published model, to make unbiased comparisons between the history of the two species, model selection should be done strictly independently for each species, and so the genetic data alone does not favor one model more than another.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Published graphs and selected alternative models from three studies for which we explored alternative admixture graph (AG) fits.</title><p>In all cases, we selected a temporally plausible alternative model that fits nominally or significantly better than the published model and has important qualitative differences compared to the published model with respect to the interpretation about population relationships. In all but one case, the model has the same complexity as the published model shown on the left with respect to the number of admixture events; the exception is the re-analysis of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref> horse dataset since the published model with three admixture events is a poor fit (worst <italic>Z</italic>-score comparing the observed and expected <italic>f</italic>-statistics has an absolute value of 23.9 even when changing the composition of the population groups to increase their homogeneity and improve the fit relative to the composition used in the published study). For this case, we show an alternative model with 8 admixture events that fits well and has important qualitative differences from the point of view of population history interpretation. The existence of well-fitting AG models does not mean that the alternative models are the correct models; however, their identification is important because they prove that alternative reasonable scenarios exist that are qualitatively different from published models.

In contrast to the published graph, in this graph with eight mixture events (the minimum necessary to obtain an acceptable statistical fit to the data), a lineage maximized in horses associated with Yamnaya steppe pastoralists or their Sintashta descendants (C-PONT, TURG, or DOM2) contributes a substantial proportion of ancestry to the horses from the Corded Ware Complex (CWC). Thus, in this model both CWC humans and horses are mixtures of Yamnaya and European farmer-associated lineages. This is qualitatively different from the suggestion that there was no Yamnaya-associated contribution to CWC horses which was a possibility raised in the paper. The AG with eight admixture events is also different from the published model in that it shows a fitting model where the Tarpan horse does not have the history claimed in the study (as an admixture of the CWC and DOM2 horses).

In this model, all the lineages shared between Bacho Kiro IUP and East Asians contributed a large fraction of the ancestry of later European hunter–gatherers as well, and thus this graph does not imply distinctive shared ancestry between the earliest modern humans in Europe and later people in East Asia, and instead could be explained by a quite different and also archaeologically plausible scenario of a primary modern human expansion out of West Asia contributing serially to the major lineages leading to Bacho Kiro, then later East Asians, then Ust’-Ishim, then the primary ancestry in later European hunter–gatherers.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig3sdata1"><label>Figure 3—source data 1.</label><caption><title>The published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref>) and alternative admixture graphs for dogs found with <italic>findGraphs</italic>.</title><p>Model parameters (graph edges) that were inferred to be unidentifiable are plotted in red.

This case study also illustrates that even in a relatively low complexity context (seven groups and three admixture events) applying manual approaches for finding optimal models is risky. When any new group such as an Early Neolithic dog from Germany is added to the model, it may introduce crucial new constraints into the system, and re-exploring the whole graph space in an automated way is necessary to avoid missing the true model. In contrast, mapping a newly added group on a simple skeleton graph (even when that skeleton is a uniquely best-fitting model like in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref>) may yield a topology that is at odds with the true history.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>2. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref></title><p>The graph in Figure 3 (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref>) suggested that present-day Europeans are derived from at least three populations that are very much differentiated genetically: West European hunter–gatherers (WHG), early European farmers (EEF), and Siberian hunter–gatherers from the same lineage as that of the Mal’ta boy who lived about 24,000 years ago (MA1). For seven-population graphs with four admixture events, we found 40 out of 306 distinct graphs with a score better than that of the published graph (10 of those graphs are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). The best-fitting newly found model and two other models fit the data significantly better than the published model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), but their topology is qualitatively very similar to that of the published graph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). In the best-fitting newly found model, French and Karitiana share some drift to the exclusion of MA1, while in the published model the source of MA1-related ancestry in French is closer to MA1 than to Karitiana.</p><p>It is important to point out that not all of the 40 alternative graphs that fit nominally or significantly better than the published one are consistent with the conclusion that modern European populations are admixed between three different ancestral populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). According to the fifth alternative graph in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref> that fits nominally better than the published model (p-value = 0.464), the present-day European population was formed by admixture of an MA1-related lineage and a European Neolithic-related lineage, with no WHG contribution. Of course, other lines of evidence make it clear that LBK Stuttgart is a mixture of Anatolian farmer- and WHG Loschbour-related ancestry (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lazaridis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lipson et al., 2017</xref>), thus providing external information in favor of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref> model. The use of such ancillary information in concert with graph exploration is important in order to obtain more confident inferences about population history taking advantage of AGs. We also note that a large group of newly found models (247 graphs) fits not significantly worse than the published one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and those are topologically diverse. Thus, strictly speaking, the AG method on the given dataset cannot be used to prove that the published model is the only one fitting the data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-3"><title>3. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref></title><p>The skeleton AG in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>) was constructed manually, and subsequently all possible branching orders (105) within the five-population Iranian farmer/herder-related clade were tested. The published model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in that study) included nine groups and three admixture events, but one group (Belt Cave Mesolithic) had a very high missing data rate. Following the approach of the published paper, we repeated <italic>findGraphs</italic> analysis both with and without the Belt Cave individual. Thus, we initially explored the following topology classes: 9 groups with 3 admixture events on ca. 19,000 polymorphic sites and 8 groups with 3 admixture events on ca. 470,000 sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata4">Figure 3—source data 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The finding that the predominant ancestry component of the Indus Periphery group was the most basal branch in the Iranian farmer clade was a prominent claim of the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>). This finding if correct is important, since it implies that the Iranian-related ancestry in the Indus Valley Civilization genetic grouping (which is the same group as Indus Periphery or IP) split from the Iranian-related ancestry in the first Iranian plateau farmers before the date of the Hajji Firuz farmers, who at ~8000 years ago are among the earliest people living on the Iranian plateau known to have grown West Asian crops. The ancient DNA record combined with radiocarbon dating evidence suggests that beginning around the time of the Hajji Firuz farmers, both West Asian domesticated plants such as wheat and barley, and Anatolian farmer-related admixture, began spreading eastward across the Iranian plateau. If the Iranian-related ancestry in IP was spread eastward into the Indus Valley across the Iranian plateau as part of the same agriculturally associated expansion—perhaps brought by people speaking Indo-European languages as well as introducing West Asian crops—then we would expect to see at least some of the Iranian-related ancestry in IP being a clade with that in Hajji Firuz relative to Ganj Dareh.</p><p>The following groups were admixed by default in the graph models compared in the original study: Hajji Firuz Neolithic (labeled ‘Chalcolithic’ in that study but the dates are Neolithic) and Tepe Hissar Chalcolithic were considered as mixtures of an Anatolian farmer-related lineage and an Iranian farmer-related lineage. Indus Periphery was assumed to be a mixture of an Andamanese-related lineage representing ancient South Indians (ASI) and an Iranian farmer-related lineage. The original study differed from ours since these constraints were introduced manually, but we wanted our topology search to be automatic and to explore a wider range of parameter space.</p><p>To provide power to detect negative <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics useful for constraining the model search, we introduced several modifications to the original group composition (described in Appendix 2) and a new algorithm that makes it possible to compute negative <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics on pseudo-haploid data, but at a cost of removing sites with only one chromosome genotyped in any non-singleton population (see Appendix 1, Section 1.A). We repeated topology search with this set of <italic>f</italic>-statistics providing additional constraints, performing 4,000 runs of the <italic>findGraphs</italic> algorithm. The Mota ancient African individual was set as an outgroup and three admixture events were allowed in the eight-population graph. Among 4,000 resulting graphs (one from each <italic>findGraphs</italic> run), 144 were distinct topologically, and the published model was recovered in 13 runs of 4,000 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Only four distinct topologies fitting nominally better than the published one were found, and those had LL scores almost identical to that of the published AG. These four alternative models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5b</xref>) shared all topologically important features of the published model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5</xref>). Five other topologies differed in important ways from the published one and emerged as fitting the data worse, but not significantly worse, than the published one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5c</xref>).</p><p>But in fact, the AG analysis reported above may not be an adequate exploration of the problem. Although absolute fits of the best models found are good (WR = 2.5 SE), the parsimony constraint allowing only three admixture events precluded correct modeling of basal Eurasian ancestry shared by all West Asian groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lazaridis et al., 2016</xref>) or of the Indus Periphery group itself, for which a more complex 3-component admixture model was proposed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>). Concerned that this oversimplification could be causing our search to miss important classes of models, we explored <italic>qpAdm</italic> models for the Indus Periphery group, following the protocol by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref> (see the dataset composition in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Our <italic>qpAdm</italic> results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5 supp6">Supplementary files 5 and 6</xref>, Appendix 2) show that the parsimony assumption that was made when constructing the AG analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref> is contradicted by <italic>f</italic>-statistic evidence since the simplest fitting <italic>qpAdm</italic> model for the IP group includes four ancestry sources, not two (Indus Periphery = Ganj Dareh Neolithic + Onge (ASI) + WSHG + Anatolia Neolithic), and indeed Narasimhan et al. themselves showed this when they presented a <italic>qpAdm</italic> model that was more complex (Ganj Dareh Neolithic + Onge (ASI) + WSHG) than the one used for constraining the AG model comparison (Ganj Dareh Neolithic + Onge (ASI)).</p><p>To explore how the parsimony constraint influences results, we allowed four admixture events in the eight-population graph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Among 4,000 resulting graphs (one from each <italic>findGraphs</italic> run), 443 were distinct topologically, and 270 had WRs between 2 and 3 SE, that is, fitted the data well. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source data 6b</xref>, we show four graphs with four admixture events that model the Indus Periphery group as a mixture of three or four sources, with a significant fraction of its ancestry derived from the Hajji Firuz Neolithic or Tepe Hissar Chalcolithic lineages including both Iranian and Anatolian ancestries. The fits of these models are just slightly different (e.g., LL = 11.7 vs 9.3, both WRs = 2.4 SE) from that of the best-fitting model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source data 6a</xref>), and are similar to that of the simpler published graph. Besides these four illustrative graphs, dozens of topologies with very different models for the Indus Periphery group fit the data approximately equally well, suggesting that there is no useful signal in this type of AG analysis when the parsimony constraint is relaxed (this finding is similar to that in our re-analysis of the dog AG in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref>, where relaxation of the parsimony constraint identified equally well-fitting AGs that were very different with regard to their inferences about population history). These results show that at least with regard to the AG analysis, a key historical conclusion of the study (that the predominant genetic component in the Indus Periphery lineage diverged from the Iranian clade prior to the date of the Ganj Dareh Neolithic group at ca. 10 kya and thus prior to the arrival of West Asian crops and Anatolian genetics in Iran) depends on the parsimony assumption, but the preference for three admixture events instead of four is hard to justify based on archaeological or other arguments.</p><p>Why did the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref> AG analysis find support for the IP Iranian-related lineage being the first to split, while our <italic>findGraphs</italic> analysis did not? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref> study sought to carry out a systematic exploration of the AG space in the same spirit as <italic>findGraphs—</italic>one of only a few papers in the literature where there has been an attempt to do so—and thus this qualitative difference in findings is notable. We hypothesize that the inconsistency reflects the fact that the deeply diverging WSHG-related ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>) present in the IP genetic grouping at a level of ca. 10% was not taken into account explicitly neither in the AG analysis nor in the admixture-corrected <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-symmetry tests also reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>. The difference in qualitative conclusions may also reflect the fact that the Shinde et al. study was distinguishing between fitting models relying on an LL difference threshold of 4 units (based on the AIC). As discussed in Appendix 1, AIC is not applicable to AGs where the number of independent model parameters is topology-dependent even if the numbers of groups and admixture events are fixed, and models compared with AIC should have the same number of parameters. Thus, we believe that the analysis by Shinde et al. was over-optimistic (as compared to the bootstrap model comparison method we use) about being able to reject models that were in fact plausible using its AG fitting setup.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-4"><title>4.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref></title><p>In contrast to the other studies revisited in our work, the AG published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref> was inferred automatically using <italic>OrientAGraph</italic>. Models with three (Figure 3b in that study) and zero to five (Ext. Data Figure 5a–d in that study) admixture events were shown. The dataset included 10 populations (9 horse populations and donkey as an outgroup) and was based on 7.4 million polymorphic transversion sites with no missing data at the group level. Unlike all the other AGs we re-evaluate in this study whose fits to the data were evaluated in the published studies using <italic>qpGraph</italic>, the topologies published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref> were not evaluated for statistical goodness-of-fit, and in fact fit the <italic>f</italic>-statistic data so poorly that even simple statistics show they cannot be correct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7a, c, e,</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In this case, the approach of using <italic>findGraphs</italic> to identify alternative topologies with the same number of admixture events that fit the data better is meaningless, as both the published models and the alternative models do not have enough degrees of freedom to accommodate the complexity present in the real data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7</xref>). In particular, we found that WR of the published model with three admixture events is 23.9 SE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7a</xref>).</p><p>For this reason, we moved to topology searches in more complex model spaces incorporating six to nine admixture events. Temporally plausible models with even a modest fit (WR between 3 and 4 SE) were encountered only among models with eight and nine admixture events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j–r</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref> discussed five inferences relying fully or partially on their published AGs reported in that study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The simplest temporally plausible and best-fitting (WR = 3.4 SE) model we found (eight admixture events, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and the first model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j</xref>) supports inferences 2 and 4, and is incompatible with inferences 1, 3, and 5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We consider this model to be plausible also from the geographical perspective (see Appendix 2 for an interpretation of this topology). We are not arguing here that this AG represents the true history; in fact, it is highly unlikely to be the truth, given how large the space of all possible admixture events is and how much admixture evidently occurred relating all these groups (which makes finding the true model extremely unlikely, see the results on simulated data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). However, our set of 16 temporally plausible and fitting (WR &lt; 4 SE) models with eight or nine admixture events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j–r</xref>) is consistent with some features of the published graph being stable: the features (2) that DOM2 and C-PONT are sister groups, and (4) that there was a gene flow from a deep-branching ghost group to NEO-ANA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Equally important is our finding that there are plausible models that are inconsistent with other inferences in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). For example, 13 of these 16 models are inconsistent with the suggestion that there was no gene flow connecting the CWC group and the cluster maximized in the Western steppe (DOM2, C-PONT, and TURG) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j–r</xref>). In the eight-admixture-event best-fitting AG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, the first model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j</xref>), CWC actually derives appreciable ancestry from the early domestic horse lineage (DOM2) associated with the Sintashta culture to the exclusion of the more distant Yamnaya-associated TURG and C_PONT horses. This scenario presents a parallel to the one observed in humans, with individuals associated with the CWC receiving admixture from Steppe pastoralists albeit in different proportions: ~75% for humans, versus ~20% in horses. These models specifying a substantial Steppe horse contribution to CWC horses are inconsistent with the inference in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>. that ‘Our results reject the commonly held association between horseback riding and the massive expansion of Yamnaya steppe pastoralists into Europe around 3000 BC’. We are not aware of other lines of evidence in the paper (apart from the fitted AG) that support the claim of no Yamnaya horse impact on CWC horses.</p><p>Another example of a feature of the published graph that turned out to be unstable is the model for the Tarpan horse. Only 8 of 16 temporally plausible and fitting models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j–r</xref>) support the conclusion by Librado et al. that the Tarpan is a mixture of a DOM2-related and a CWC-related lineage. The other eight models suggest that Tarpan is a mixture of a deep lineage and a DOM2-related lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, the first model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j</xref>), echoing a hypothesis that Tarpan may be a hybrid with Przewalski-related horses not represented in the AG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>). Again, we are not arguing here that our alternative model is right—indeed we are nearly certain it is wrong in important aspects—but we are merely pointing out that the complexity of the AG space means that qualitatively quite different conclusions are compatible with the statistics fitted in the published paper.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-5"><title>5. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajdinjak et al., 2021</xref></title><p>The AG inferred by Hajdinjak et al. was constructed manually and incorporated 11 groups and 8 admixture events (Figure 2d in the original study).

The statistics described above and the fact that LL scores on all sites lie outside of the LL distribution on resampled datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggest that models in this complexity class are overfitted, but the published topology emerged as fitting relatively poorly.

The graph grew one group at a time, and each newly added group was mapped on to the pre-existing skeleton graph as unadmixed or as a two-way mixture. Another requirement was that all intermediate graphs have good absolute fits (WR below 3 or 4 SE). When the model-building process is constrained in a particular path and fits of all intermediates are required to be good, unnecessary admixture events are often added along the way, and the resulting graph belongs to a complexity class in which models are overfitted.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajdinjak et al., 2021</xref>’s published graph had three notable features that were interpreted by the authors and used to support some conclusions of the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), with the following feature considered the most important: there are gene flows from the lineage found in the ~45,000- to 43,000-year-old Bacho Kiro Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP) individuals to the Ust’-Ishim, Tianyuan, and GoyetQ116-1 lineages. We identified 1,421 topologies fitting nominally or significantly better than the published model and moved on to inspect 50 best-fitting topologies for temporal plausibility (all of them fitting significantly better than the published model). All non-African individuals included in the model are Upper Paleolithic and their dates are not drastically different in relative terms, from ca. 45 to 30 kya (1,000 years before present). Nevertheless, we considered most gene flows from later- to earlier-attested lineages as temporally implausible (for instance, GoyetQ116-1 (~35 kya) → Ust’-Ishim (~44 kya), Sunghir III (34.5 kya) → Tianyuan (40 kya), etc.) since they imply great antiquity of the later-attested lineages and of all lineages derived from them at least partially.</p><p>Of the 50 topologies inspected, 32 were considered temporally plausible. Of those topologies, none supported the finding of gene flows from the Bacho Kiro IUP lineage specifically into all three of the Ust’-Ishim, Tianyuan, and GoyetQ116-1 lineages. A total of 17 topologies supported features 2 and 3 but were inconsistent with feature 1; and 14 topologies supported feature 3 only (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Best-fitting representatives of each of these topology classes are shown along with the published model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata8">Figure 3—source data 8</xref>. Considering topological diversity among models that are temporally plausible, conform to current knowledge about relationships between modern and archaic humans, and fit significantly better than the published model, we conclude that feature 3 is probably robust but other details of the fitted AG in Hajdinjak et al.—for example, gene flows to the Ust’-Ishim, Tianyuan, and Goyet Q116-1 lineages from sources sharing drift exclusively with the Upper Paleolithic Bacho Kiro lineage—should not be interpreted as providing meaningful inferences about population history of Upper Paleolithic modern humans.</p><p>A central finding of Hajdinjak et al. is that the Bacho Kiro IUP group shares more alleles with present-day East Asians than with Upper Paleolithic Holocene Europeans despite coming from Europe. Specifically, the study documents significantly positive statistics of the form <italic>D</italic>(an Asian group, Kostenki14; Bacho Kiro IUP, Mbuti). Hajdinjak et al.’s interpretation of this observation is that ‘there was at least some continuity between the earliest modern humans in Europe [Bacho Kiro IUP] and later people in Eurasia [East Asians]’. However, a significant <italic>D</italic>- or <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistic can have multiple explanations. The statistic <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub> (Tianyuan, Kostenki14; Bacho Kiro IUP, Mbuti) is fitted equally well by the published 12-population AG (<italic>Z</italic>-score for the difference between the observed and fitted statistics = 0.64) and by, for example, the AG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> (<italic>Z</italic>-score = 0.94). Under the latter model that fits the data significantly better than the published model (p-value = 0.02), the Bacho Kiro IUP and Tianyuan branches are not connected by a gene flow and do not receive gene flows from a third common source, but the common ancestor of Ust’-Ishim and all European Paleolithic lineages receives an 8% gene flow from a divergent modern human lineage splitting deeper than Bacho Kiro IUP and Tianyuan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata8">Figure 3—source data 8c</xref>). This scenario or some version of it seems archaeologically and geographically plausible and is not disproven by any other line of genetic or non-genetic evidence of which we are aware. It could correspond to a scenario where a primary modern human expansion out of West Asia contributed serially to the major lineages leading to Bacho Kiro, then later East Asians, then Ust’-Ishim, and finally the primary ancestry in later European hunter–gatherers.

There are some graphs where defining two distinct ancestral lineages maximized in West Africans and in Mbuti and Biaka (features 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) is essentially impossible since all or nearly all Africans are modeled as a mixture of at least two deep lineages (see alternative graph no. 4 shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1d</xref>, the second model).

We applied several constraints on the graph space exploration process all of which were shared with the Wang et al. graphs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). An important feature of the published graphs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref> that was remarked upon in the study is admixture from a source related to Andamanese hunter–gatherers that is almost universal in East Asians (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). For example, the abstract states ‘Hunter-gatherers from Japan, the Amur River Basin, and people of Neolithic and Iron Age Taiwan and the Tibetan Plateau are linked by a deeply splitting lineage that probably reflects a coastal migration during the Late Pleistocene epoch.’ We performed 2,000 <italic>findGraphs</italic> iterations and obtained 1,778 distinct topologies satisfying all the constraints, nearly all of them (1,724) fitting nominally better than the published model, and 12.6% fitting significantly better (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The models were ranked by LL scores, and 56 highest-ranking topologies, all of them fitting significantly better than the published one, were assessed for temporal plausibility, and 20 topologies were considered temporally plausible (all of them are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). According to these topologies, 0–2 East Asian groups had a fraction of their ancestry derived from a source specifically related to Onge, and 19 topologies included gene flows from the European (Loschbour)-related branch to all 8 East Asian groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). The inferred topological relationships among East Asians are variable in this group of AGs, and we decided to apply further constraints that guided model ranking and elimination by Wang et al., based on considerations from archaeological evidence, Y chromosome haplogroup divergence patterns, and population split time estimation (see Appendix 2 for details). Applying these three additional constraints, we identified two models (among the 56 subjected to manual inspection) that satisfied all of them. The highestranking of those models is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2c</xref> (the second model), and it includes a 13% (deeply) European-related gene flow to the common ancestor of all East Asians, and gene flows from the Onge-related branch to just two East Asian groups: Nepal Chokhopani and China WLR LN. This model fits the data significantly better than the published model (p-value = 0.028). We do not claim that this is the correct model (indeed we are almost certain that it is not given the high topological diversity of fitting models), but it is not obviously wrong and differs in qualitatively important ways from the published one.</p><p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref> AG provides an illuminating example that helps us to understand the value added by AG construction. The AG construction process in Wang et al. followed a philosophy of not relying entirely on the allele frequency correlation data (not treating the genetic data as independent to explore how much new insight could come from genetic data alone). Instead, the study integrated other lines of genetic evidence as well as linguistic and archaeological insights explicitly into the AG construction process, with the goal of identifying models consistent with multiple lines of evidence. The fact that after this procedure a fitting graph was obtained is not of great interest, as it is essentially always possible to obtain a fit to allele frequency correlation data when enough admixture events are added. The important question is whether any of the emergent features of the graph that were not applied as constraints in the construction process—for example the evidence of ubiquitous Andamanese-related gene flow throughout East Asia suggesting a coastal route expansion that admixed with an interior route expansion proxied by Tianyuan—were stably inferred. Our analysis does not come to this finding consistently among well-fitting and plausible AGs. We conclude that this important feature of the published graph is not supported by <italic>f</italic>-statistic analysis alone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), and indeed we are not aware of a single feature of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref> AG that is stably inferred beyond the constraints applied to build it.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-8"><title>8. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sikora et al., 2019</xref></title><p>Two AGs inferred by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sikora et al., 2019</xref> were constructed manually based on an SNP set derived from whole-genome shotgun data and incorporated 12 or 13 groups and 10 admixture events (Extended Data Figure 3f in the original study). One graph was focused on West Eurasians, and the other one on East Eurasians, and both included a Neanderthal, a Denisovan, and an African group (Dinka). Although the chimpanzee outgroup was not included in the original graphs, we added it as it drastically constrains the topology search space. In contrast to most other published graphs discussed above, gene flows in the graphs inferred by Sikora et al. do not have equal standing: four low-level gene flows (0–1%) connect the Neanderthal lineage to Upper Paleolithic lineages. We repeated each topology search under two alternative settings: either keeping the number of admixture events at 10 to match the published graphs, or at 6 to match simplified versions of the published graphs lacking these low-level Neanderthal gene flows. We performed that modification to simplify the search space and to alleviate the overfitting problem which becomes severe if 10 gene flows across the graph are allowed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>In the case of the &quot;Western&quot; graphs with 6 admixture events, 1,000 topology search iterations were performed, 894 distinct topologies were found, 4 models fit significantly better, and 151 models fit nominally better than the published one (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We inspected those 155 topologies and identified 29 topologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>) that are temporally plausible. Sikora et al. came to the following striking conclusion relying on the &quot;Western&quot; AG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>): the Mal’ta (MA1_ANE) lineage received a gene flow from the Caucasus hunter–gatherer (CHG) lineage. However, in our <italic>findGraphs</italic> exploration this direction of gene flow (CHG → Mal’ta) was supported by two of the 29 topologies, and the opposite gene flow direction (from the Mal’ta and East European hunter–gatherer lineages to CHG) was supported by the remaining 27 plausible topologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>). The highest-ranking plausible topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) has a fit that is not significantly different from that of the simplified published model with six admixture events (p-value = 0.392). We note that the gene flow direction contradicting the graph by Sikora et al. was supported by published <italic>qpAdm</italic> analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lazaridis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>), and <italic>qpAdm</italic> is not affected by the same model degeneracy issues that are the focus of this study. Considering the topological diversity among models that are temporally plausible, conform to robust findings about relationships between modern and archaic humans, and fit nominally better than the published model, we conclude that the direction of the Mal’ta-CHG gene flow cannot be resolved by AG analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Some important conclusions based on the &quot;Eastern&quot; graph also do not replicate across all plausible AGs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In the case of the &quot;Eastern&quot; graphs with 6 admixture events, 4,446 topology search iterations were performed, and 2,785 distinct topologies were found. Only 3 topologies fit significantly and 13 nominally better than the published one, and 9.8% of topologies fit not significantly worse than the published one (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Of the AGs belonging to these groups, we inspected 116 best-fitting ones and identified 97 AGs that are temporally plausible. The Sikora et al. &quot;Eastern&quot; AG had three distinctive features that were used to support some conclusions of the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Only feature 2 was universally supported by all the 97 plausible alternative models fitting significantly better, nominally better, or not significantly worse than the simplified published model, while feature 3 was supported by 83 of 97 plausible models, and feature 1 was supported by 28 of 97 plausible models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We plotted 14 plausible graphs as examples of topologies supporting all three features, two features, or one feature of the published graph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>). We note that all the &quot;Eastern&quot; graphs discussed here, both the published and alternative ones, have relatively poor absolute fits with WR above 4 or 5 SE.

An ideal outcome of an AG model exploration exercise would be the identification of a model or a group of topologically very similar models which fit the data well and significantly better than all alternative models with the same number of admixture events; however, this is almost never achieved for graphs with more than eight populations and three admixture events in our experience (Appendix 2), and even this approach can lead to potentially unstable results as relaxing the assumption of parsimony (that fewer admixture events is more likely) can lead to qualitatively quite different equally well-fitting topologies as in our re-analysis of the Bergström et al. and Shinde et al. datasets. Most of the examples of AGs in eight recently published studies we revisited do not fit this ideal pattern, as we were able to identify many topologically different alternative models that could not easily be rejected based on temporal plausibility or other constraints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata4">Figure 3—source data 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source data 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata8">Figure 3—source data 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>). In particular, for all studies except <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref> (under a strict parsimony assumption however), we identified AGs that were not significantly worse fitting than the published ones, and with topological features that were different in qualitatively important ways. There were also some more encouraging findings of the exercise we performed to re-evaluate published models. For example, at least one of the key inferences about population history relying on AG modeling were stable for all analyzed models for the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>., Hajdinjak et al., Shinde et al. (under the parsimony assumption), and Sikora et al. (simplified &quot;Eastern&quot; graph) studies (Appendix 2). The existence of some stable features in these graphs helps to point the way toward a protocol that we believe should be applied in all future studies that use AG fitting exercises to support claims about population history.</p><p>We propose the following tentative protocol to identify features of fitting AGs that are stable enough to be used to make inferences about population history.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>For a given combination of populations, carry out an initial scan using <italic>findGraphs</italic> to identify reasonable parameter values for the number of allowed admixture events (graph complexity class).

Methods that take advantage of information from the site frequency spectra (<italic>momi2</italic>, <italic>fastsimcoal</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamm et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Excoffier et al., 2013</xref>) or derived site patterns, a special case of site frequency spectra (Legofit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rogers, 2019</xref>), can supply alternative information not captured by <italic>f</italic>-statistics (further information can come from methods that fit haplotype divergence patterns such as <italic>MSMC</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schiffels and Durbin, 2014</xref> and <italic>SMC++</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Terhorst et al., 2017</xref>, or inferences based on fitted gene trees such as <italic>RELATE</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Speidel et al., 2019</xref>, and <italic>ARGweaver</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubisz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hubisz and Siepel, 2020</xref>). These tools are too computationally intensive to explore a large number of models, but the advantages of the different approaches can be combined by first identifying a set of candidate models using <italic>findGraphs</italic>, and then testing these candidate models with other methods. This approach is also expected to help address overfitting since different data types almost always include different variable site sets.</p></list-item></list><p>We believe that researchers should only begin to make strong claims about population history with AGs once a protocol such as we propose is applied.</p><p>We see the guidelines above as analogous in spirit to the protocols that were introduced in medical genetics at a time of the reproducibility crisis in the field of candidate gene association studies. Many studies looking for risk factors for common, complex diseases resulted in publications with marginally significant p-values without correcting for multiple hypothesis testing that was implicitly performed due to many candidate genes being tested and only those with significant findings being published. Unsurprisingly, most of these claims failed to replicate in follow-up studies in independent sets of samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ioannidis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Border et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan et al., 2019</xref>). The human medical genetic community addressed this challenge by coming together to support a rigorous set of commonly accepted standards for declaring genome-wide statistical significance, such as the requirement that p-values be corrected for the effective number of independent common variants in the genome and requiring correction for the known confounders of population structure and undocumented relatedness among individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Sampling AG space is a useful method for modeling population histories, but finding robust and accurate models can be challenging. As we demonstrated by revisiting a handful of published AGs and re-analyzing the datasets used to fit them, <italic>f</italic>-statistics are usually insufficient for identifying uniquely fitting AG models, making it necessary to incorporate other sources of evidence. This provides a challenge to previous approaches for automated model building. We investigated several published AG models and, in nearly all cases, found many alternative models, some of which are historically and geographically plausible but contradict conclusions that were derived from the published models. To conduct these analyses, we developed a method for automated AG topology optimization that can incorporate external sources of information as topological constraints. This method is developed in the <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> framework, which aside from AG modeling, implements many other methods for population history inference based on <italic>f</italic>-statistics.</p><p>It is important to recognize that the key concern we have highlighted in this study—the fact that there can often be thousands of different topologies that are equally good fits to the allele frequency correlation patterns relating a set of populations—does not invalidate the use of allele frequency correlation testing in many other contexts in which it has been applied to make inferences about population history. For example, negative <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics (‘admixture’ <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics) continue to provide unambiguous evidence for a history of mixture in tested populations, and <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-and <italic>D</italic>-symmetry statistics remain powerful ways to evaluate whether a tested pair of populations is consistent with descending from a common ancestral population since separation from the ancestors of two groups used for comparison. The <italic>qpWave</italic> methodology remains a fully valid generalization of <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics, making it possible to test whether a set of populations is consistent with descending from a specified number of ancestral populations (which separated at earlier times from a comparison set of populations). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haak et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harney et al., 2021</xref> the <italic>qpAdm</italic> extension of <italic>qpWave—</italic>which allows for estimating proportions of mixtures for the tested population under the assumption that we have data from the source populations for the mixture—remains a valid approach, unaffected by the concerns identified here. Instead of relying on a specific model of deep population relationships, <italic>qpAdm</italic> relies on an empirically measured covariance matrix of <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics for the analyzed populations, which is highly constraining with respect to estimation of mixture proportions but can be consistent with a wide range of deep history models. All these methods are implemented in <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic>.</p><p>Finally, approaches that use AGs to adjust for the covariance structure relating a set of populations without insisting that the particular AG model that is proposed is true with can be useful, for example for the purpose of analyzing shared genetic drift patterns of a group of populations that derive from similar mixtures. One example was a study that attempted to test for different source populations for Neolithic migrations into the Balkans after controlling for different proportions of hunter–gatherer admixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mathieson et al., 2018</xref>). Another example was a study that attempted to study shared ancestry between different East African forager populations after controlling for different proportions of deeply divergent source populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lipson et al., 2022</xref>). However, with respect to the inferences about deep history produced by AGs themselves, our results highlight the importance of caution in proposing specific models of population history that relate a set of groups.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Published graphs in the context of automatically found graphs.</title><p>We compared 22 different graphs from 8 publications to alternative graphs inferred on the same or very similar data; these <italic>findGraphs</italic> runs are highlighted in blue in the ‘Iterations’ column.

<italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic>. A new software package and set of algorithmic ideas for fitting allele frequency correlation statistics to genetic data relating populations</title><p>We present a new implementation of the popular <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> software (called ‘Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic>’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haak et al., 2015</xref>). Our implementation (<italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic>) enhances performance by greatly reducing runtime and memory requirements across a wide range of different methods, relative to Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1a</xref>). Some of these improvements have now been implemented in version 7.0.2 of <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools/">https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools/</ext-link>). The present study focuses not on the performance differences between Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> and <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic>, but on the description of new ideas implemented in one or both of these tools.</p><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s7-1"><title>1.A. Computation and use of <italic>f</italic>-statistics</title><p>A key idea that facilitates the performance increases shared by <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> and <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> v. 7.0.2 is that any <italic>f</italic>-statistic (which form the basis of almost all <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> programs as well as other toolkits for studying population history such as <italic>popstats</italic>) can be computed from a small number of <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>-statistics. For most <italic>f</italic>-statistic-based analyses (for example <italic>qpWave</italic>, <italic>qpAdm</italic>, and <italic>qpGraph</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1c</xref>), the time required to compute <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub><italic>-</italic> and <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub><italic>-</italic>statistics algebraically from <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>-</italic>statistics is trivial compared to the time required to load genotype data and compute <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>-statistics. These <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>-statistics can be stored and re-used to compute <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>- and <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics, thus reducing the size of the input data, runtime, and memory requirements by orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1a, d</xref>).</p><p>Using precomputed <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>-statistics is not always the best solution. In datasets with large amounts of missing data, computing <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>- and <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics from precomputed <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>-</italic>statistics may introduce bias. In this case, it is necessary to compute <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>- and <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics directly, using different SNPs for each <italic>f</italic>-statistic (all available SNPs in each population triplet or quadruplet). However, even without the use of precomputed <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>-statistics, <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> often achieves large performance gains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1a</xref>).</p><p>The program <italic>qpfstats</italic> in Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> implements an idea which strikes a balance between these two extremes. It increases the accuracy of estimation of <italic>f</italic>-statistics by using a regression approach to jointly estimate the values of all <italic>f<sub>2</sub>-, f</italic><sub>3</sub>-, and <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics relating a set of populations. Specifically, <italic>qpfstats</italic> searches for values of these statistics that are not only consistent with information from the SNPs that have data in the groups used to compute each particular <italic>f</italic>-statistic, but also satisfy the algebraic relationships expected with other <italic>f</italic>-statistics (thus incorporating information from data at many additional SNPs). See further details on this algorithm at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools/blob/master/qpfs.pdf">https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools/blob/master/qpfs.pdf</ext-link>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>). This feature is available in <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> through the <italic>qpfstats</italic> option in the <italic>extract_f2</italic> function.</p><p>Another improvement introduced in <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> relates to accurate evaluation of the match between observed and expected <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics when fitting AGs where at least one population is represented by a single individual with genotypes derived by randomly selecting one sequencing read at each variable position (‘pseudo-haploid’ data). <italic>f</italic>-Statistic computations need to be modified when analyzing pseudo-haploid data, because heterozygosity cannot be computed using comparisons of sequences within the same individual; however, computation of heterozygosity is essential to calculate ‘admixture’ <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>(target; A, B), where negative values provide proof of the mixed nature of the target population. When a target population is represented by multiple individuals, unbiased estimation of admixture <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics can be carried out even for pseudo-haploid data by analyzing positions covered by sequences from at least two individuals and only computing variation rates across individuals. This approach is implemented in Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> with the ‘inbreed: YES’ option. However, no admixture <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistic can be computed with this algorithm if the target population is represented by a single individual (as no variation across individuals within a population can be detected in this case). Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> deals with this case by failing to run if any population in an analysis is represented by a single individual and the ‘inbreed: YES’ option is turned on. Because the datasets from all the AGs revisited here included at least one population represented by a single individual (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the ‘inbreed: YES’ option could not be used in the original studies (the program failed with this option, by design). Thus, AG fitting in those studies relied on the incorrect algorithm for calculating <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics (except for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>, which used <italic>TreeMix</italic> instead of <italic>qpGraph</italic>) and, as a result, some <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics that are negative and could provide important constraints for AG fitting were evaluated as positive. These concerns are relevant for the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref> studies we revisit below (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a list of datasets where negative <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics were encountered). To be able to detect negative <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics and thus take advantage of their power for constraining the space of possibly fitting historical models, in <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> we introduced a similar algorithm which makes it possible to compute negative <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics on pseudo-haploid data, at a cost of removing sites with only one chromosome genotyped in any population that is represented by at least two individuals (so that it is possible in theory to compute heterozygosity in these populations). Admixture <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics continue to be incorrectly computed using <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> for targets that are singleton populations represented by pseudo-haploid data, as there is no avoiding this particular problem.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Performance comparison of f-statistic computation and AG fitting in Classic ADMIXTOOLS and ADMIXTOOLS 2 and an overview of the major ADMIXTOOLS programs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Performance comparison of <italic>f</italic>-statistic computation and AG fitting.

In addition, <italic>TreeMix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pickrell and Pritchard, 2012</xref>), as well as <italic>OrientAGraph</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Molloy et al., 2021</xref>), an improved version of <italic>TreeMix</italic>, can miss AG topologies that exist on parts of the non-convex likelihood surface that are bypassed by these algorithms for exploring AGs (e.g., topology M7 in Figure 4 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Molloy et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>MixMapper</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lipson et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>miqoGraph</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yan et al., 2021</xref> have a different limitation: exploring topologies with more than one admixture event in the history of any group is not possible. Due to these limitations, many published findings are based on manual proposal of topologies and evaluation of fit, and the great majority of studies using this manual approach (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skoglund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McColl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreno-Mayar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tambets et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van de Loosdrecht et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flegontov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sikora et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajdinjak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergström et al., 2022</xref>) rely on the software <italic>qpGraph</italic>. We introduce an approach for finding well-fitting AGs automatically that can integrate external information, and that recovers graph topologies more accurately than <italic>TreeMix</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). External information can be integrated by specifying a set of constraints that AGs must satisfy. This not only ensures that resulting models are temporally plausible, but also cleanly separates prior assumptions from the independent constraints provided by genetic data. Our strategy implemented in the function ‘<italic>findGraphs</italic>’, differs from <italic>TreeMix/OrientAGraph</italic> in several deep ways, most notably in that it optimizes graphs directly, rather than optimizing trees first and adding admixture events later. This makes it less prone to getting stuck in local optima: our simulation results show that <italic>findGraphs</italic> is more accurate for random graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>), and that it can recover specific topologies that pose problems for <italic>TreeMix</italic> and <italic>OrientAGraph</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s7-2-2"><title>1.B.2. Estimating confidence intervals for AG parameters</title><p>Since our new implementation of <italic>qpGraph</italic> can evaluate models much more rapidly, it becomes feasible to evaluate the same model multiple times on different SNP sets. This allows us to derive bootstrap confidence intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boos, 2003</xref>) for all parameters estimated by <italic>qpGraph</italic>, including drift lengths, admixture weights, LL scores, and <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistic residuals. It should also be noted that the estimated confidence intervals do not take into account uncertainty about the graph topology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s7-2-3"><title>1.B.3. Comparing the fits of different AGs</title><p>Using the bootstrap method for evaluating a graph multiple times on different SNP sets not only allows us to obtain confidence intervals for single graphs, but also allows us to test whether the fit of one graph is significantly better than the fit of another graph, by obtaining confidence intervals for the LL score difference or difference in the largest <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistic residuals (worst residuals, WR) of two graphs. When we apply this approach to a range of datasets, we find that models with modest LL differences are often not distinguishable after accounting for the variability across SNPs, even if one might expect them to be distinguishable based on the magnitude of the likelihood difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3a, b</xref>). Thus, previous methods relying on AIC or BIC (such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flegontov et al., 2019</xref>) that used specified likelihood difference thresholds to reject some models over others, were over-aggressive. These methods are problematic since they generally assume that the models compared have the same effective number of degrees of freedom, but the number of independent parameters estimated in an AG is not simply determined by the number of groups, drift edges, or admixture events, as it also depends on the graph topology in a complex way. A second challenge in comparing different AG models arises when comparing models of different complexity (i.e., with a different number of admixture events). Established methods such as AIC and BIC can also account for different model complexity, but if the number of independent parameters in a model is known.</p><p>We implement a method to compare AG models of different complexity by using a new scoring function, which uses different blocks of SNPs for deriving fitted and estimated <italic>f</italic>-statistics. This ensures that our model comparison test does not favor more complex models by allowing them to overfit the data. This cross-validation approach can also be used to rank alternative models of the same complexity and deal with overfitting. We note that the calculation of cross-validated LL scores is not turned on in <italic>findGraphs</italic> by default, and to make our results more comparable to those of the published studies we revisited, we relied on standard LL scores in this study.</p><p>To test if our method is well calibrated, we simulated 100,000 SNPs under the same graph in 1,000 replicates. We then created two new topologies by removing one out of two symmetric edges from the first graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3c</xref>). These new incorrect models are symmetrically related to the first graph and can be used to test whether the true difference in LL scores of these two graphs is zero. The uniform distribution of p-values confirms that our method is well calibrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3d</xref>). A caveat is that only one symmetric topology was explored in this way.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s7-2-4"><title>1.B.4. Determining identifiability of AG parameters</title><p>Fitting AGs results in an estimate of the overall model fit, as well as in estimates of branch lengths and admixture weights. However, even with infinite data some of these parameters cannot be estimated, as they are not identifiable from the system of equations that corresponds to the AG. Issues like this have been well described for simple topological features of a graph. For example, the lengths of the two branches connected to the root node cannot be estimated independently. Furthermore, in a graph with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> populations and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> admixture events, at least one parameter will not be identifiable unless the inequality <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtable rowspacing="4pt" columnspacing="1em"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&gt;=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is satisfied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipson, 2020a</xref>). However, even in graphs that meet this criterion, some parameters are not identifiable, and until the development of <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic>, there was no method for testing whether any given parameter in an AG is identifiable. We introduce a method for testing which parameters in an AG are identifiable, and which are not, based on the Jacobi matrix of the graph’s system of <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> equations.

Drawing conclusions from a large number of fitted models</title><p>As discussed in the Results section, when we apply our methods for finding optimal graphs and comparing AGs to a number of previously published models, we find that there often exists a much larger number of fitting models than has previously been appreciated. In these cases, we are unable to prioritize a single model, or even a small number of models, based on the evidence we have. However, we are still able to reject the vast majority of all tested models. This suggests that insight can be gained by identifying common features among the well-fitting models. We therefore introduce methods for summarizing collections of well-fitting AGs to determine which features they share. In practice, we find that these methods can aid manual inspection of <italic>findGraphs</italic> results, but the high diversity of well-fitting topologies we see in most case studies and the importance of fitted parameters (especially admixture proportions) for historical interpretation of topologies makes it difficult to reliably automatize the process of interpreting fitted AG models.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8"><title>2.

It means that no missing data are allowed (at the level of populations) in the specified set of populations for which pairwise <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>-statistics are calculated. For the values of the ‘<italic>blgsize</italic>’, ‘<italic>adjust_pseudohaploid</italic>’, and ‘<italic>minac2</italic>’ arguments we use in our analyses, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The ‘<italic>blgsize</italic>’ argument sets the SNP block size in Morgans, and we used either the default value of 0.05 (5 cM), or 4,000,000 bp when a genetic map was not available. Genotypes of pseudo-haploid samples are usually coded as 0 or 2 (i.e., they are, strictly speaking, pseudo-diploid), even though only one allele is observed. The ‘<italic>adjust_pseudohaploid</italic>’ argument ensures that the observed allele count increases only by 1 for each pseudo-haploid sample. If ‘<italic>TRUE</italic>’ (default), samples that do not have any genotypes coded as 1 among the first 1,000 SNPs are automatically identified as pseudo-haploid. This leads to slightly more accurate estimates of <italic>f</italic>-statistics. Setting this parameter to ‘<italic>FALSE</italic>’ treats all samples as diploid.</p><p>Another important argument (‘<italic>minac2=2</italic>’) of the ‘<italic>extract_f2</italic>’ function removes sites with only one chromosome genotyped in any non-singleton population and is needed for unbiased estimation of negative <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics in non-singleton pseudo-haploid populations. In the absence of negative <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics or pseudo-haploid populations, this argument has no influence on AG LL scores. This algorithm for calculation of <italic>f</italic>-statistics triggered by the ‘<italic>minac2=2</italic>’ argument is described below.</p><p>For <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>(<italic>A; B, C</italic>), we compute the uncorrected numerator for each SNP, (<italic>a – b</italic>) × (<italic>a – c</italic>). We then subtract a bias correction factor at each SNP, <italic>p</italic>(1 <italic>– p</italic>)/(<italic>ac –</italic> 1), which we only need for population <italic>a</italic> (because the other factors cancel out); <italic>p</italic> is the allele frequency, and <italic>ac</italic> is the observed allele count. In pseudo-haploid samples, (<italic>ac –</italic> 1) would be zero and produce an error in any sites with only one observed allele. With the ‘<italic>inbreed: NO</italic>’ setting in Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic>, the smallest non-zero value for <italic>ac</italic> is 2, so the division by 0 problem is avoided, but the correction factor is slightly smaller than it should be. <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> adds only an allele count of 1 for each site in a pseudo-haploid sample (with the default option ‘<italic>adjust_pseudohaploid = TRUE</italic>’), so there can be cases where <italic>ac = 1</italic>. To imitate what the setting ‘<italic>inbreed: NO</italic>’ in Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> is doing, <italic>ac</italic> is set to 2 at those sites (or the denominator is set to 1). There is still a small difference between Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> and <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> at other sites because each observed site adds two alleles in <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> with the default setting ‘<italic>inbreed: NO</italic>’, but only 1 allele in <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> with the default setting ‘<italic>adjust_pseudohaploid = TRUE</italic>’, but for AG fitting that does not matter. One solution to avoid biased correction factors is to only consider sites with <italic>ac</italic> of at least two, which is what the ‘<italic>inbreed: YES</italic>’ setting in Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> does. The problem with this is that we cannot use populations with a single pseudo-haploid sample, which is often useful, and would only give misleading results if that population is admixed. The new option ‘<italic>minac2=2</italic>’ in <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> is different from the ‘<italic>inbreed: YES</italic>’ setting in Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> since it makes an exception for populations consisting of a single pseudo-haploid sample in that it sets <italic>ac</italic> to 2 at each site (denominator is set to 1) when computing the correction factor for those populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2"><title>2.B. Fitting AGs</title><p>An AG is a directed acyclic graph specifying the topology of the ancestral relationships among a set of populations. Each node in this graph represents a (present-day or ancient) population. Terminal nodes (also called leaf nodes) represent observed populations, while internal nodes represent unobserved ancestral populations. Modeling all observed populations as leaf nodes confers some robustness to drift specific to single populations and to genotyping errors. The edges connecting the populations are weighted and correspond either to the magnitude of genetic drift that has occurred along that branch (drift edges), or to the admixture proportions (admixture edges, where two edges point to the same node).</p><p>The goal of <italic>qpGraph</italic> is to test how well a given graph topology fits the observed <italic>f</italic>-statistics.

These <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics can then be used to fit the graph and to compute the likelihood.

The inner optimization finds the drift weights which maximize the likelihood score while fixing the admixture weights. The outer optimization finds the admixture weights which maximize the likelihood score, while optimizing the drift weights for each set of admixture weights. The inner optimization uses a quadratic programming solver to find the optimal drift weights, while the outer optimization uses a general purpose optimization algorithm to find the optimal admixture weights.</p><p>While the gradient function in the outer optimization adjusts the admixture weights, the objective function iterates over the following steps:</p><p>1.

Calculation of the graph likelihood using observed and fitted <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics</p><p>These steps are repeated until convergence is reached and the likelihood score can no longer be improved by adjusting the admixture weights.</p><p>Step 1 optimizes the drift edge weights, while holding the admixture weights constant. All drift edge weights are required to be non-negative, which makes this a constrained quadratic programming problem (hence <italic>qp</italic>Graph). Additional upper and lower bounds can be specified for individual graph edges.</p><p>Step 2 turns the edge weights into fitted <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics. To see how edge weights in an AG translate to <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics, it helps to first consider how they translate into <italic>f<sub>2</sub></italic>-statistics for a pair of populations.

Automated AG inference</title><p>To find graph topologies that could conceivably have given rise to the observed <italic>f</italic>-statistics, we start with a randomly generated graph with a fixed number of admixture events, apply a number of modifications to this graph, and evaluate each of the resulting graphs. We then pick the best-fitting graph and repeat this procedure until graph modifications no longer lead to improved scores. We use a number of random graph modifications, as well as targeted modifications which are informed by parameters obtained during the fitting of the current graph.</p><p>For the targeted modifications, we change the optimization of a single graph from a constrained optimization problem, in which drift edges are constrained to be positive and admixture weights are constrained to be between zero and one, to an unconstrained optimization problem in which both types of parameters can take any real values. Rearranging the nodes adjacent to edges which were estimated to be negative results in an improved fit at a much higher rate than random graph adjustments.</p><p>The random modifications include (1) pruning and randomly re-grafting leaf nodes, (2) pruning and randomly re-grafting a set of connected nodes in the graph, (3) swapping the orientation of admixture edges, (4) shifting admixture edges, (5) re-rooting the graph, and (6) combinations of two or more of any of these modifications.</p><p>The number of admixture events is not affected by the graph modifications described so far. A significant score improvement can often be achieved by adding a single admixture edge to several random positions in a graph. This is unsurprising since it increases the degrees of freedom of the original graph. However, picking the best fitting graph with one admixture edge added, and testing all graphs that result from removing a single admixture edge from that graph, often results in a graph with the same number of admixture events and a better fit than the original graph. We employ this strategy whenever the regular graph modifications described above do not lead to any further improvements.</p><p>We keep track of the search tree of all previously evaluated graphs and their scores in order to not evaluate any graph more than once, and so that backtracking in the search space is possible in cases where no more local improvements can be identified. Nevertheless, multiple iterations with different random starting graphs are usually necessary to find graphs with good fits. The number of iterations needed to approach a global optimum depends on the size of the search space, but the optimal number of iterations is hard to estimate in practice.</p><p>For revisiting published studies, we used the following settings of the <italic>findGraphs</italic> algorithm:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>mutfuns = namedList(spr_leaves, spr_all, swap_leaves, move_admixedge_once, flipadmix_random, place_root_random, mutate_n</italic>), a list of functions used to modify graphs.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>numgraphs = 10</italic>, number of alternative graphs produced by randomly applying the mutation functions at the start of each generation.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>stop_gen = 10,000</italic>, total number of generations after which to stop.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>stop_gen2=30</italic>, number of generations without LL score improvement after which to stop.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>plusminus_generations = 10</italic>.

We applied <italic>TreeMix</italic> to the same simulated data for comparison. We simulated between 8 and 16 populations per graph, and between 0 and 10 admixture events. For each parameter combination, we simulated 20 different AGs generated by the <italic>random_admixturegraph</italic> function. We counted both the fraction of random simulated graphs where the best inferred graph was identical to the simulated graph, as well as the fraction of random simulated graphs where the best inferred graph was either identical to the simulated graph or had a better score than the simulated graph. For models with a large number of admixture events the number of possible models is so large that it becomes increasingly likely that there will be some alternative models which fit the data better than the model under which the data were simulated.</p><p>We used <italic>msprime v.0.7.4</italic> and the <italic>msprime_sim</italic> wrapper function in <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> to simulate data for 100,000 unlinked SNPs and 100 diploid samples per population for each AG. The simulation parameters we chose were aimed at facilitating fast simulations of large numbers of informative SNPs rather than at being as realistic as possible. We therefore expect that the simulation results allow us to make comparisons across groups, but not that they are informative about the rate at which ‘true’ models can be recovered in empirical data. We simulated under a constant mutation rate of 0.001 per site per generation, a constant haploid effective population size of 1,000, with neighboring nodes in the graph separated by 1,000 or more generations, and all admixture events occurring in discrete pulses of 50%/50% proportions.</p><p>To allow for a fair comparison between <italic>findGraphs</italic> and <italic>TreeMix</italic>, we made sure that small differences in the way AGs are modeled in <italic>findGraphs</italic> and in <italic>TreeMix</italic> were accounted for before testing graphs for identical topology.

We simulated three chromosomes (each 100 Mbp long) in a diploid genome by specifying a flat recombination rate (2 × 10<sup>−8</sup> per bp per generation) along the chromosome and a much higher rate at the chromosome boundaries (log<sub>e</sub>2 or ~0.693 per bp per generation, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs/stable/ancestry.html#multiple-chromosomes">https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs/stable/ancestry.html#multiple-chromosomes</ext-link>). A flat mutation rate, 1.25 × 10<sup>−8</sup> per bp per generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scally and Durbin, 2012</xref>), and the binary mutation model were used. To maintain the correct correlation between chromosomes, the discrete time Wright–Fischer model was used for 25 generations into the past, and deeper in the past the standard coalescent simulation algorithm was used (as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nelson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We simulated AGs of four complexity classes: eight or nine groups sampled at leaves, four or five pulse-like admixture events. All group sizes were identical: 10 diploid individuals with no missing data. Demographic events were separated by date intervals ranging randomly between 1,500 and 8,000 generations, with an upper bound on the tree time depth at 40,000 generations. Effective population sizes were constant along each edge, and were picked randomly from the range of 2,000–40,000 diploid individuals. Admixture proportions for all admixture events varied randomly between 10% and 40%. For subsequent analyses we selected only simulations where pairwise <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> for groups were in the range characteristic for anatomically modern and archaic humans (there was at least one <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> value below 0.15). In this way, 20 random topologies were simulated per graph complexity class, each including also a distant outgroup that facilitates exploration of the topology space.

Comparing the fits of different AGs</title><p>We are interested in determining whether one AG fits the data significantly better than another AG, or whether an observed score difference Δ = <italic>S<sub>1</sub> – S<sub>2</sub></italic> can be attributed to variability across independent SNPs. We first consider two AGs with the same number of admixture events, where we can ignore the problem of comparing two models with different complexity. As in other bootstrap standard error calculations, we divide the genome into <italic>n</italic> blocks indexed by <italic>i</italic>, and we draw <italic>b</italic> sets of <italic>n</italic> blocks with replacement, indexed by <italic>j</italic>. We fit both graphs <italic>b</italic> times—once for each bootstrap set of SNP blocks. This results in a set of <italic>b</italic> score differences Δ<italic><sub>j</sub></italic>. The bootstrap confidence interval for the difference in scores is given by the quantiles of the distribution of Δ<italic><sub>j</sub></italic>. We also compute an empirical bootstrap p-value, testing the null hypothesis that two different graphs fit the data equally well. It is computed as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boos, 2003</xref>), where <italic>δ</italic> is either the fraction of Δ<italic><sub>j</sub></italic> &gt; 0<italic><sub>,</sub></italic> or the fraction of Δ<italic><sub>j</sub></italic> &lt; 0, whichever is smaller. The reason for applying bootstrap resampling, as opposed to jackknife resampling in this case, is that the distribution of score differences tends to have a high kurtosis, which can make jackknife estimates inaccurate. Simulating data under the null hypothesis is not straightforward in this case, because it involves finding two non-identical graphs which in expectation fit the data equally well. We decided to simulate under one graph and compare two graphs which are symmetrically related to the simulated graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). This confirmed that the p-value follows a uniform distribution under the null hypothesis.</p><p>Next, we consider comparisons of two graphs of different complexity.

We then determine the rank of the Jacobi matrix, along with the rank of all matrices that result from dropping a single column (a parameter corresponding to a graph edge).

The only six-population graph with a worst residual (WR) below 3 standard errors (SE) was then chosen as a scaffold onto which the Early Neolithic dog genome from Germany was mapped, allowing for one more admixture event, and a seven-population graph with the lowest LL score was shown as the final model in the paper. Alternative six-population scaffolds were not explored in the original publication, although two six-population graphs with fits very similar to the best one were found.

When we used <italic>findGraphs</italic> to infer seven-population graphs with three admixture events (again fixing Andean fox as the outgroup), we identified five graphs with LL score nominally better than that of the published graph and one with a score that is slightly lower than that of the published graph but actually significantly better according to our model comparison methodology (this model is very similar to the published graph, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). In the newly found seven-population graph with the best LL score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), the Siberian (Baikal), American, and East Mediterranean dogs are admixed, and the West European, East European (Karelia), and dogs of Southeast Asian origin (New Guinea singing dog) are unadmixed, while the opposite pattern is found in the published graph (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The best-fitting graph does <underline>not</underline> fit the data significantly better than the published graph (two-tailed empirical p-value = 0.332), but it bears a closer resemblance to the human population history (see the third-best graph found by <italic>findGraphs</italic> on human data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>) than the published seven-population graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>In this new seven-population model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), both American and Siberian dog lineages represent a mixture between groups related to the Asian and East European dog lineages, and robust genetic results suggest that in the time horizon investigated in the original publication (after ca. 10,900 years ago) nearly all Siberian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sikora et al., 2019</xref>) and all American (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raghavan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Raghavan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreno-Mayar et al., 2018</xref>) human populations were admixed between groups most closely related to Europeans and Asians. According to this model, East Mediterranean dogs are modeled as a mixture of a basal branch (splitting deeper than the divergence of the Asian and European dogs) and West European dogs, again in agreement with current models of genetic history of West Asian human populations who are modeled as a mixture of ‘basal Eurasians’ and WHG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lazaridis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lipson et al., 2017</xref>). Although greater congruence with human history increases the plausibility of <italic>findGraph</italic>’s newly identified model relative to the published model, to make unbiased comparisons between the history of the two species, model selection should be done strictly independently for each species, and so the genetic data alone does not favor one model more than another. Our results provide a specific alternative hypothesis that differs in qualitatively important ways from the published model and can be tested against new genetic data as it becomes available as well as other lines of genetic analysis of existing data.</p><p>To explain why the original paper on the population history of dogs missed the model that <italic>findGraphs</italic> identified that is plausibly a closer match to the true history, we observe that the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref> AG search was exhaustive under the parsimony constraint (no more than twp admixture events for six populations), and thus missed the potentially true topology including three admixture events for these six populations. This case study also illustrates that even in a relatively low complexity context (seven groups and three admixture events) applying manual approaches for finding optimal models is risky. When any new group such as an Early Neolithic dog from Germany is added to the model, it may introduce crucial information into the system, and re-exploring the whole graph space in an automated way is advisable. In contrast, mapping a newly added group on a simple skeleton graph (even when that skeleton is a uniquely best-fitting model) may yield a topology that is at odds with the true history. As the original Bergström et al. paper noted (Figure 3C of that study), no congruent six-population graph models were found for humans and dogs under the parsimony assumption: the three most congruent graphs for dogs resulted in poorly fitting models for the corresponding human populations (WR above 10 SE), and the three most congruent graphs for humans resulted in poorly fitting models for the corresponding dog populations (WR between 5 and 10 SE). We added a WHG group to the set of human groups from the original publication and using <italic>findGraphs</italic> on the original set of 77 K transversion SNPs we found that the third best-fitting model for humans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>) (which is not significantly different in fit from the first one) is nearly identical topologically to the newly found dog graph.</p><p>Even though <italic>findGraphs</italic> identified an AG topology that fits the data as well as the seven-population graph in Bergström et al. and is qualitatively quite different with respect to which populations were admixed, the new topology continues to support another of the key inferences of that study: that many of the early divergences among domesticated dog lineages occurred prior to the date of the Karelian dog (~10,900 ya). Thus, both graphs concur in providing strong evidence that the radiation of domesticated dog lineages occurred by the early Holocene, prior to the domestication of other animals. We further emphasize that the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref> graph is the best-case scenario (along with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref> discussed below) for published AGs. Most published graphs are far less stable even than this.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>2. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref></title><p>The graph in Figure 3 (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref>) was inferred in the following manner. First, a phylogenetic tree without admixture was constructed which was the best fit for all <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics among the populations ‘Mbuti’, ‘WHG Loschbour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref>), ‘LBK Stuttgart’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref>), ‘Onge’, and ‘Karitiana’, with ‘Mbuti’ fixed as an outgroup. Next, all possible AGs were considered that result from adding a single admixture edge to this tree. After it was found that each of them had a WR &gt; 3 SE, several graphs with two admixture events were considered, and some of them had WR &lt; 3 SE. The ‘MA1’ genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raghavan et al., 2014</xref>) was added to these graphs in several different ways, and only one of these configurations was found to have WR &lt; 3 SE. This was then used as a skeleton graph onto which a European population (represented by different present-day groups) was added. No fitting graph was found in which present-day Europeans could be modeled as a two-way mixture (adding one admixture event to the graph). After inspecting the non-fitting <italic>f</italic>-statistics of one of these graphs, it was found that modeling modern Europeans as a three-way mixture (adding two admixture events to the graph) is consistent with all <italic>f</italic>-statistics. Six <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics were negative when all sites available for each population triplet were used (the ‘useallsnps: YES’ option, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), but the upgraded algorithm for calculating <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics on pseudo-haploid data had no effect since the only pseudo-haploid group in the dataset (MA1) was a singleton population, and the algorithm removes sites with only one chromosome genotyped in any <underline>non</underline>-singleton population. Thus, below we show results generated using the standard algorithm for calculating <italic>f</italic>-statistics.</p><p>First, we considered the published skeleton graph onto which a European population was later added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref>). As in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref> example, the best six-population graph with two admixture events found by <italic>findGraphs</italic> is identical to the published six-population graph, which has an LL score of 3.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The second-best graph found has an LL score of 31.8. When computing the bootstrap p-value for the difference between these two graphs, we find that in 1.6% of all SNP resamplings the second-best graph has a better score than the published graph, resulting in a two-tailed empirical p-value of 0.032 for a difference in fits between these two graphs. All 14 alternative graphs found by our algorithm fit significantly worse than the published graph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>When we add the European population (French) and consider seven-population graphs with four admixture events, we find 40 out of 306 distinct graphs with a score better than that of the published graph (10 of those graphs are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). The best-fitting newly found model and two other models fit the data significantly better than the published model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), but their topology is qualitatively very similar to that of the published graph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). In the best-fitting newly found model, French and Karitiana share some drift to the exclusion of MA1, while in the published model the source of MA1-related ancestry in French is closer to MA1 than to Karitiana.</p><p>It is important to point out that not all of the 40 alternative graphs that fit nominally or significantly better than the published one are consistent with the conclusion that modern European populations are admixed between three different ancestral populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). For example, the fifth alternative graph in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref> that is fitting nominally better than the published model (p-value = 0.464) includes no basal Eurasian ancestry in EEF (LBK Stuttgart), and instead models Onge as having ~50% West Eurasian-related ancestry and MA1 as having ~25% Asian ancestry. According to that graph, the present-day European population was formed by admixture of an MA1-related lineage and a European Neolithic-related lineage, with no West European hunter–gatherer (WHG) contribution. Of course, other lines of evidence make it clear that LBK Stuttgart is a mixture of Anatolian farmer-related ancestry and WHG Loschbour-related ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lazaridis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lipson et al., 2017</xref>), thus providing external information in favor of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazaridis et al., 2014</xref> model, and the use of such ancillary information in concert with graph exploration is important in order to obtain more confident inferences about population history taking advantage of AGs.</p><p>The second alternative graph in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref> that fits just negligibly worse than the highest-ranking model has another distinctive feature: LBK Stuttgart is modeled as a mixture of a WHG-related and a basal Eurasian lineage, but modern Europeans receive a gene flow not from the LBK-related lineage, but from its basal Eurasian source. Although temporally plausible, this model is much less plausible from the archaeological point of view than the published model, and thus in this case too we can reject it as unlikely based on non-genetic evidence. We note, however, that a large group of newly found models (247 graphs) fits not significantly worse than the published one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and those are topologically diverse. Thus, strictly speaking, the AG method on the given dataset cannot be used to prove that the published model is the only one fitting the data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11"><title>3. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref></title><p>The skeleton AG in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>) was constructed manually on the basis of an SNP set derived from the 1240K enrichment panel, and subsequently all possible branching orders (105) within the five-population Iranian farmer-related clade were tested. The published model (Figure 3 in that study) included 9 groups and 3 admixture events, but one group (Belt Cave Mesolithic) had a very high missing data rate, and as a result model fitting relied not just on the merged dataset which included 19,000 polymorphic sites without missing data across groups, but also on a dataset with approximately 470,000 sites that excluded the Belt Cave individual. The topological inferences were consistent for both analyses (Table S3 of that study). Following the approach of the published paper, we repeated <italic>findGraphs</italic> analysis both with and without the Belt Cave individual. Thus, we initially explored the following topology classes: 9 groups with 3 admixture events on ca. 19,000 polymorphic sites and 8 groups with 3 admixture events on ca. 470,000 sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The sample composition of the groups and the SNP dataset matched that in the original study. We summarize results across 4,000 independent iterations of the <italic>findGraphs</italic> algorithm for each topology class.</p><p>For the nine-population graph we found 89 models with LL nominally better than that of the published model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For the eight-population graph, we found 61 nominally and 4 significantly better fitting models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and their topological diversity was high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata4">Figure 3—source data 4</xref>). We note that the following groups were admixed by default in the graph models compared in the original study: Hajji Firuz Neolithic (labeled ‘Chalcolithic’ in that study but the dates are Neolithic) and Tepe Hissar Chalcolithic were considered as mixtures of an Anatolian farmer-related lineage and an Iranian farmer-related lineage; Indus Periphery was considered as a mixture of an Andamanese-related lineage representing ancient South Indians (ASI) and an Iranian farmer-related lineage. However, calculation of negative ‘admixture’ <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics for these target groups is impossible using the original dataset and the original model fitting algorithm for several reasons. First, the Indus Periphery group was represented by a single pseudo-haploid individual (I8726) from the ‘Indus Valley cline’ for whom the best-quality data were available. But direct calculation of ‘admixture’ <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics for such a group as a target is impossible since its heterozygosity cannot be estimated. Second, as discussed above, in Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> it is impossible to apply a correction intended for accurate calculation of <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics on pseudo-haploid data (the ‘inbreed: YES’ option) if there is at least one population composed of one individual only (a singleton population). Third, the original Hajji Firuz Neolithic group composed of five individuals included a family of three second- or third-degree relatives, and that artificially inflated the drift on the Hajji Firuz branch and made detecting a negative statistic <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>(Hajji Firuz Neolithic; X, Y), even if present, highly unlikely. Indeed, no <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistic turned out to be nominally negative for the groups on the eight-population graph when statistics were calculated according to the original settings (we used settings equivalent to ‘useallsnps: NO’ and ‘inbreed: NO’ in classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic>, 470,389 polymorphic sites were available). Considering this fact, it is not surprising that our automated topology space search is not well constrained. The original study differed from ours since the constraints were introduced manually, but we wanted our topology search to be automatic and to explore a wider range of the parameter space.</p><p>In order to provide power to detect negative <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics useful for constraining the model search, we (1) removed two members of the family from the Hajji Firuz Neolithic group, (2) extended the number of individuals and sites available for the Indus Periphery group by generating new shotgun-sequencing data for a previously published library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>) derived from individual I8726 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and by adding published data for three other individuals from the Indus Valley cline (from Gonur in Turkmenistan and Shahr-i-Sokhta in Iran; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>), (3) removed from other groups two individuals based on second to third degree relatedness, and (4) removed two individuals from other groups based on evidence of contamination with modern human DNA. All the changes to the dataset are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. In addition to these dataset adjustments, the new algorithm for calculating <italic>f</italic>-statistics makes it possible to compute negative <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics on pseudo-haploid data, but at a cost of removing sites with only one chromosome genotyped in any non-singleton population (see Appendix 1). We eventually detected significantly negative ‘admixture’ <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>(Tepe Hissar Chalcolithic; Ganj Dareh Neolithic, Anatolia Neolithic), <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>(Indus Periphery; Ganj Dareh Neolithic, Onge), and other similar statistics for the same target groups. We also observed a nominally negative (<italic>Z</italic>-score = −0.6) statistic <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>(Hajji Firuz Neolithic; Ganj Dareh Neolithic, Anatolia Neolithic), which is suggestive but does not by itself prove admixture in the recent history of the Hajji Firuz Neolithic group. For this updated analysis, 249,009 variable sites without missing data at the group level were available for the eight populations.</p><p>We repeated topology search with this set of <italic>f</italic>-statistics providing additional constraints, performing 4,000 runs of the <italic>findGraphs</italic> algorithm. The Mota ancient African individual was set as an outgroup and three admixture events were allowed in the eight-population graph. Among 4,000 resulting graphs (one from each <italic>findGraphs</italic> run), 144 were distinct topologically, and the published model was recovered in 13 runs of 4,000 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Only four distinct topologies fitting nominally better than the published one were found, and those had LL scores almost identical to that of the published eight-population model (16.97 and 17.66 vs. 17.85). These four alternative models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5b</xref>) shared all topologically important features of the published model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5a</xref>). Five other topologies differed in important ways from the published one and emerged as fitting the data worse, but not significantly worse, than the published one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5c</xref>): two-tailed empirical p-values reported by our bootstrap model comparison method ranged between 0.060 and 0.112. Three of these topologies included a trifurcation of Iranian farmer-related lineages leading to the Indus Periphery, Hajji Firuz Neolithic, and Ganj Dareh Neolithic groups. The other two topologies included Hajji Firuz Neolithic as an unadmixed Anatolian-related lineage. In both cases, the Indus Periphery group was modeled as receiving a gene flow from either the Onge lineage (a proxy for ASI) or a deep Asian lineage.</p><p>The finding that the predominant ancestry component of the Indus Periphery group was the most basal branch in the Iranian farmer clade was a prominent claim of the original study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>; for example, the abstract stated: ‘The Iranian-related ancestry in the IVC derives from a lineage leading to early Iranian farmers, herders, and hunter gatherers before their ancestors separated.’ Our finding that the Hajji Firuz Neolithic lineage may be as deep within the Iranian clade as the Indus Periphery lineage or may even diverge from the Anatolian branch shows that this statement cannot be confidently made based on AG analysis alone.</p><p>However, the findings we have described up to this point do not invalidate the broader conclusion that the AG modeling in Shinde et al. was used to support; namely (using the phrasing from the abstract) that the genetic data ‘contradict… the hypothesis that the shared ancestry between early Iranians and South Asians reflects a large-scale spread of western Iranian farmers east.’ This finding if correct is important, since it implies that the Iranian-related ancestry in the IVC (Indus Valley Civilization genetic grouping, which is the same group as IP), split from the Iranian-related ancestry in the first Iranian plateau farmers before the date of the Hajji Firuz farmers, who at ~8000 years ago are among the earliest people living on the Iranian plateau known to have grown West Asian crops. The ancient DNA record combined with radiocarbon dating evidence suggests that beginning around the time of the Hajji Firuz farmers, both West Asian domesticated plants such as wheat and barley, and Anatolian farmer-related admixture, began spreading eastward across the Iranian plateau. If the Iranian-related ancestry in IP was spread eastward into the Indus Valley across the Iranian plateau as part of the same agriculturally associated expansion—perhaps brought by people speaking Indo-European languages as well as introducing West Asian crops—then we would expect to see at least some of the Iranian-related ancestry in IP being a clade with that in Hajji Firuz relative to Ganj Dareh. The fact that we do not find any models compatible with this scenario is thus a potentially important finding. In summary, there are two reasons the genetic analyses we have reported up to this point continue to support the finding that the Iranian-related ancestry in IP is <underline>not</underline> a clade with the Iranian-related ancestry in Hajji Firuz (and Tepe Hissar) and thus is unlikely to reflect the same eastward movement of agriculturalists. First, in <italic>findGraphs</italic> analysis, all models specifying IP and Tepe Hissar and/or Hajji Firuz as a clade relative to Ganj Dareh were significantly worse-fitting that the published one. Instead, either the Iranian-related ancestry in IP definitively splits off first (the topology from Shinde et al.), or the branching order of the IP, Ganj Dareh, and the Hajji Firuz/Tepe Hissar lineages cannot be determined, or IP, Ganj Dareh, and Tepe Hissar are a clade relative to Hajji Firuz. In all these fitting topologies, the ~10,000-year-old radiocarbon date of the Ganj Dareh individuals sets a lower bound on the split time between IP and Hajji Firuz/Tepe Hissar, which is pre-agriculturalist. This suggests that the Iranian-related ancestry in IP is not due to an eastward agriculturalist expansion.</p><p>But in fact, the AG analysis reported above is not an adequate exploration of the problem. Although absolute fits of the best models found are good (WR = 2.5 SE), the parsimony constraint allowing only three admixture events precluded correct modeling of basal Eurasian ancestry shared by all West Asian groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lazaridis et al., 2016</xref>) or of the Indus Periphery group itself, for which a more complex 3-component admixture model was proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>). Concerned that this oversimplification could be causing our search to miss important classes of models, we explored <italic>qpAdm</italic> models for the Indus Periphery group further, following the ‘distal’ protocol with ‘rotating’ outgroups outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref> and using the dataset and outgroups (‘right’ populations) from that study. All sites available for analyses were used, following Narasimhan et al. (the ‘useallsnps: YES’ option). The combined Indus Periphery group we analyzed included seven individuals from Shahr-i-Sokhta and three individuals from Gonur (three individuals were removed from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref> dataset due to potential contamination with modern human DNA and low coverage). We removed one individual from the Ganj Dareh Neolithic group as potentially contaminated, and one second- or third-degree relative was removed from the Anatolia Neolithic group, see the dataset composition in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. We note that no ‘distal’ <italic>qpAdm</italic> models were tested for the combined Indus Periphery group by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>, and individuals from this group were modeled one by one (Table S82 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>), which potentially reduced the sensitivity of the method.</p><p>A model ‘Indus Periphery = Ganj Dareh Neolithic + Onge (ASI)’ was strongly rejected for the Indus Periphery group of 10 individuals with a p-value = 2 × 10<sup>−15</sup>, and a model that was shown to be fitting for all Indus Periphery individuals modeled one by one by Narasimhan et al. (Ganj Dareh Neolithic + Onge (ASI) + West Siberian hunter–gatherers (WSHG)) was rejected for the grouped individuals with a p-value = 0.0044. In contrast, a model ‘Indus Periphery = Ganj Dareh Neolithic + Onge (ASI) + WSHG + Anatolia Neolithic’ was not rejected based on the p &gt; 0.01 threshold used in Narasimhan et al. (the p-value was marginal but passing at 0.03) and produced plausible admixture proportions for all four sources that are confidently above zero: 53.2 ± 5.3%, 28.7 ± 2.1%, 10.5 ± 1.3%, and 7.7 ± 2.9%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

The model ‘Ganj Dareh Neolithic + Onge (ASI)’ was not rejected only for individuals with fewer than 141,000 sites genotyped, suggesting that this result is attributed not to population heterogeneity, but to lack of power.</p><p>These <italic>qpAdm</italic> results show that the parsimony assumption that was made when constructing the AG analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref> is contradicted by <italic>f</italic>-statistic evidence, and indeed Narasimhan et al. themselves showed this when they presented a distal <italic>qpAdm</italic> model that was more complex (Ganj Dareh Neolithic + Onge (ASI) + WSHG) than the one used for constraining the AG model comparison (Ganj Dareh Neolithic + Onge (ASI)). Another line of evidence used to support the principal historical conclusion by Shinde et al. was a series of <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistic cladality tests following correction of allele frequencies using an admixture model ‘target group = Iranian farmer + Anatolia Neolithic + Onge (ASI)’, with a great majority of tests supporting the deepest position of the Iranian farmer ancestry component in the Indus Periphery group within the Iranian farmer clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>). However, the model used for allele frequency correction (Ganj Dareh Neolithic + Onge (ASI) + Anatolia Neolithic) was simpler than the 4-component model we found and different from the 3-component model for the Indus Periphery group suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>, which is a weakness of that analysis. A valuable direction for future work would be to repeat this analysis with a 4-component allele frequency correction model (Ganj Dareh Neolithic + Onge (ASI) + WSHG + Anatolia Neolithic), although that is beyond the scope of the present study, which simply aims to revisit the reported analyses and test if they fully support their inferences by ruling out alternative explanations.</p><p>To explore how the parsimony constraint influences results, we allowed four admixture events in the eight-population graph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Among 4,000 resulting graphs (one from each <italic>findGraphs</italic> run), 443 were distinct topologically, and 270 had WRs between 2 and 3 SE, that is, fitted the data well. We explored 35 topologies with LL scores in a narrow range between 9.3 (the best value) and 13.3. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source data 6</xref>, we show four graphs with four admixture events that model the Indus Periphery group as a mixture of three or four sources, with a significant fraction of its ancestry derived from the Hajji Firuz Neolithic or Tepe Hissar Chalcolithic lineages including both Iranian and Anatolian ancestries. The fits of these models are just slightly different (e.g., LL = 11.7 vs 9.3, both WRs = 2.4 SE) from that of the best-fitting model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source data 6</xref>), and similar to that of the published graph. Besides these four illustrative graphs, dozens of topologies with very different models for the Indus Periphery group fit the data approximately equally well, suggesting that there is no useful signal in this type of AG analysis when the parsimony constraint is relaxed (this finding is similar to that in our re-analysis of the dog AG in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref>, where relaxation of the parsimony constraint identified equally well-fitting AGs that were very different with regard to their inferences about population history). These results show that at least with regard to the AG analysis, a key historical conclusion of the study (that the predominant genetic component in the Indus Periphery lineage diverged from the Iranian clade prior to the date of the Ganj Dareh Neolithic group at ca. 10 kya and thus prior to the arrival of West Asian crops and Anatolian genetics in Iran) depends on the parsimony assumption, but the preference for three admixture events instead of four is hard to justify based on archaeological or other arguments.</p><p>Why did the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref> AG analysis find support for the IP Iranian-related lineage being the first to split, while our <italic>findGraphs</italic> analysis did not? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref> study sought to carry out a systematic exploration of the AG space in the same spirit as <italic>findGraphs—</italic>one of only a few papers in the literature where there has been an attempt to do so—and thus this qualitative difference in findings is notable. We hypothesize that the inconsistency reflects the fact that the deeply diverging WSHG-related ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>) present in the IVC (Indus Valley Civilization genetic grouping, which is the same group as Indus Periphery) at a level of ca. 10% was not taken into account explicitly neither in the AG analysis nor in the admixture-corrected <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-symmetry tests also reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shinde et al., 2019</xref>. The difference in qualitative conclusions may also reflect the fact that the Shinde et al. study was distinguishing between fitting models relying on a LL difference threshold of 4 units (based on the AIC). As discussed in Appendix 1, AIC is not applicable to AGs where the number of independent model parameters is topology dependent even if the numbers of groups and admixture events are fixed, and models compared with AIC should have the same number of parameters. Thus, the analysis by Shinde et al. was over-optimistic about being able to reject models that were in fact plausible using its AG fitting setup.</p><p>The archaeological and linguistic implications of the Shinde et al. study are important, and there are several avenues available for further attempting to distinguish historical scenarios using <italic>f</italic>-statistics that are outside the scope of a methodological study like this one. Some of our observations that are most challenging for the conclusions of Shinde et al. are those related to the graphs with four admixture events in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source data 6b</xref> that fit the Iranian farmer-related ancestry in the Indus Periphery group as deriving partially from the Hajji Firuz Neolithic or Tepe Hissar Chalcolithic-related lineages. The <italic>qpAdm</italic> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haak et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harney et al., 2021</xref>) is able to use information from distal outgroups (such as WSHG) not included in the AG modeling exercise revisited here. Leveraging this information might be able to obtain constraints that would further test the key historical conclusions from Shinde et al. Non-<italic>f</italic>-statistic-based methods could also be informative. Finally, we emphasize that the <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistic cladality tests correcting for the Anatolian farmer- and Onge-related admixture in the Indus Periphery grouping do continue to provide support for the historical conclusion of Shinde et al. (these analyses reject models where the Tepe Hissar or Hajji Firuz groups share genetic drift with the Indus Periphery individuals), with the caveat that they do not correct for the WSHG admixture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12"><title>4.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref></title><p>In contrast to the other studies revisited in our work, the AG published by Librado et al., 2021was inferred automatically using <italic>OrientAGraph</italic>. Models with three (Figure 3b in that study) and zero to five (Ext. Data Fig. 5a-d in that study) admixture events were shown. The dataset included 10 populations (nine horse populations and donkey as an outgroup) and was based on 7.4 million polymorphic transversion sites with no missing data at the group level. We observed that some groups used for the <italic>OrientAGraph</italic> and <italic>qpAdm</italic> analyses were very broad geographically and temporally (see Table S1 in the original study), and thus we tested two alternative group compositions: the original one and a streamlined one. In the latter case we included individuals from one archaeological site and one archaeological period per group: the Botai, C-PONT, DOM2, ELEN, and NEO-ANA groups were modified in this way, and the CWC, LP-SFR, Tarpan, and TURG groups were left with the composition used in the original paper (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). In addition, seven individuals with missing data proportion exceeding 80% were removed from the analysis, affecting the donkey outgroup, DOM2, and NEO-ANA groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Since among all possible <italic>f</italic><sub><underline>3</underline></sub>-statistics for the 10 populations three were negative (using all sites available for each population triplet, ‘useallsnps: YES’), we applied the upgraded algorithm for calculating <italic>f</italic>-statistics, which removed sites with only one chromosome genotyped in any non-singleton population, resulting in the following site counts for the original and modified population compositions: 11,092 and 1,767,419 sites, respectively. The very low number of sites available in the former case is due to the fact that all individuals are pseudo-haploid, and that two groups (the donkey outgroup and NEO_ANA) are composed of two individuals, a high-coverage one and a low-coverage one. Thus, just sites genotyped in both donkey individuals and in both NEO_ANA individuals were kept. Considering this problem, we focused on the modified group composition only. We tested a range of model complexities (from 3 to 9 gene flows) and performed 1,000 <italic>findGraphs</italic> topology search runs per model complexity class.</p><p>Unlike all the other AGs we re-evaluate in this study whose fits to the data were evaluated in the published studies using <italic>qpGraph</italic>, the topologies published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref> (with three to five admixture events) were not evaluated for statistical goodness-of-fit, and in fact fit the <italic>f</italic>-statistic data so poorly that even simple statistics show they cannot be correct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7a, c, e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In this case, the approach of using <italic>findGraphs</italic> to identify alternative topologies with the same number of admixture events that fit the data better is meaningless, as both the published models and the alternative models do not have enough degrees of freedom to accommodate the complexity present in the real data; all models are guaranteed to be wrong. In particular, we found that WR of the published model with three admixture events is 23.9 SE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7a</xref>). In this complexity class <italic>findGraphs</italic> found 22 topologically diverse models that fit significantly better than the published one (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), but nevertheless have extremely poor absolute fits (from 16.2 to 21.3 SE, see a temporally plausible example in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7b</xref>). In the complexity class with four admixture events, no model fitting better than the published one was found; however, five alternative models fitting not significantly worse than the published one had lower WR (10 or 12 SE vs. 14.1 SE, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7d</xref>). The WR of the published model with five admixture events was 6.9 SE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7e</xref>); just two models fitting nominally better and 223 models fitting non-significantly worse than the published model and having similar or higher WR were found (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These results suggest that while <italic>OrientAGraph</italic> was often (but not always) able to find the same tentative global likelihood optimum as <italic>findGraphs</italic>, neither three nor five admixture events are enough to explain the data since nearly all the groups are probably admixed.</p><p>For this reason, we moved to topology searches in more complex model spaces incorporating six to nine admixture events. Temporally plausible models with even a modest fit (WR between 3 and 4 SE) were encountered only among models with eight and nine admixture events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j-r</xref>). In the complexity class with eight admixture events, five such temporally plausible fitting models were found, with WRs ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 SE (all these models are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j-l</xref>). In the complexity class with 9 admixture events, 11 such models were found, with WRs ranging from 3.4 to 4.0 SE (all these models are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7m-r</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref> discussed the following inferences relying fully or partially on their published AGs reported in that study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>): (1) NEO-ANA-related admixture is absent in DOM2; (2) DOM2 and C-PONT are sister groups (they form a clade); (3) there is no gene flow connecting the CWC group and the cluster associated with Yamnaya horses and horses of the later Sintashta culture whose ancestry is maximized in the Western Steppe (DOM2, C-PONT, TURG); (4) there was gene flow from a deep-branching ghost group to NEO-ANA; and (5) Tarpan is a mixture of a CWC-related and a DOM2-related lineage.</p><p>The simplest temporally plausible and best-fitting (WR = 3.4 SE) model we found (modified group composition, eight admixture events; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and the second model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j</xref>) supports inferences 2 and 4, and is incompatible with inferences 1, 3, and 5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This newly found model can be interpreted as follows. There is a trifurcation of three deep lineages: a lineage maximized in Western and Central Europe (up to 100% of ancestry in a Late Paleolithic group from France, LP_SFR), a Western-Steppe-specific lineage (up to 55% in TURG), and a Tarpan-specific lineage (22% in Tarpan). Western and Central European horses, represented by LP-SFR, by the majority ancestry in horses found in the Corded Ware culture context (CWC), and by the majority ancestry in wild Neolithic Anatolian horses (NEO_ANA), contributed about half of the ancestry in the Western Steppe groups TURG, C-PONT, and DOM2. The other half of ancestry in the Western Steppe groups is represented by the Western Steppe-specific lineage. That lineage also contributed about 50% of ancestry in wild horses from the Yana Upper Paleolithic site (ELEN), and the other half of ELEN’s ancestry is derived from an even deeper lineage. The Botai group is modeled as a mixture of European horses (69%) and Siberian horses (31% ELEN-related ancestry). In contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>, Tarpan is modeled as a mixture of its specific lineage (22%) and a DOM2-related group (78%), and CWC also received ancestry (21%) from a DOM2-related group. All the populations included in the model except for LP_SFR are admixed, and there is evidence of substantial genetic influence from a lineage that was eventually maximized in the Western Steppe (although it did not necessarily originate there) in the ELEN and Botai groups. We consider this model to be plausible from both temporal and geographical perspectives.</p><p>We are not arguing here that our eight-admixture-event model represents the true history; in fact, it is highly unlikely to be entirely true, given how large the space of all possible admixture events is and how much admixture evidently occurred relating all these groups (which makes finding the unique truly fitting model extremely unlikely based on <italic>f</italic>-statistic fitting, see the results on simulated data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2b</xref>). We have also not attempted in any way to replicate the AG exploration procedure performed in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>. study; the graph fitting procedure was quite different from ours, based on <italic>OrientAGraph</italic> optimization rather than <italic>findGraphs</italic> optimization, and a Block Jackknife procedure with a different genome block size for determining standard errors (4 Mbp in our protocol and ca. 500 kbp in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>. study). Regardless of how the graph was obtained, it is valuable for providing readers with guidance about which topological features of the graphs are meaningful and stable, and which are less certain, especially—as in the case of the AG presented in the paper—when some features of the presented model do not fit the data by a wide margin, as evident by the WR of 6.9 in the published model for five admixture events. Our set of 16 temporally plausible and fitting (WR &lt; 4 SE) models with eight or nine admixture events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j–r</xref>) is consistent with some features of the published graph being stable: the features (2) that DOM2 and C-PONT are sister groups, and (4) that there was a gene flow from a deep-branching ghost group to NEO-ANA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Equally important, however, is our finding that there are plausible models that are inconsistent with other inferences in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). For example, 13 of these 16 models are inconsistent with the suggestion that there was no gene flow connecting the CWC group and the cluster maximized in the Western steppe (DOM2, C-PONT, and TURG) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j–r</xref>). In the eight-admixture-event best-fitting plausible model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and the second model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j</xref>), CWC actually derives appreciable ancestry from the early domestic horse lineage (DOM2) associated with the Sintashta culture to the exclusion of the more distant Yamnaya-associated TURG and C_PONT horses. This scenario presents a parallel to the one observed in humans, with individuals associated with the CWC receiving admixture from Steppe pastoralists albeit in different proportions: ~75% for humans, versus ~20% in horses. These models specifying a substantial Steppe horse contribution to CWC horses would weaken support for the inference in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>. that ‘Our results reject the commonly held association between horseback riding and the massive expansion of Yamnaya steppe pastoralists into Europe around 3000 BC.’ We are not aware of other lines of evidence in the paper (apart from the fitted AG) that support the claim of no Yamnaya horse impact on CWC horses.</p><p>Another example of a feature of the published graph that turned out to be unstable is the model for the Tarpan horse. Only 8 of 16 temporally plausible and fitting models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j–r</xref>) support the conclusion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>. that the Tarpan is a mixture of a DOM2-related and a CWC-related lineage. The other 8 models suggest that Tarpan is a mixture of a deep lineage and a DOM2-related lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and the second model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7j</xref>), echoing a hypothesis that Tarpan may be a hybrid with the Przewalski horse lineage not represented in the AG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Again, we are not arguing here that our fitting alternative model is right—indeed we are nearly certain it is wrong in important aspects—but we are merely pointing out that the complexity of the AG space means that qualitatively quite different conclusions are compatible with the genetic data. Other aspects of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>. study, most notably the dramatic geographic expansion of the DOM2 modern domestic horse lineage after 4000 years ago in association with the Sintashta culture which is the most extraordinary finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Librado et al., 2021</xref>., are in no way challenged by our results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s13"><title>5. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajdinjak et al., 2021</xref></title><p>The AG inferred by Hajdinjak et al. was constructed manually on the basis of an SNP set derived from in-solution enrichment of two SNP panels (1240K and a further million of transversion polymorphisms discovered as polymorphic within one or two sub-Saharan African individuals or among archaic humans) and incorporated 11 groups and 8 admixture events (Figure 2d in the original study). The published graph has no clear outgroup since the deepest branch (Denisovan) is admixed. This property of the graph makes automated graph space exploration difficult. We explored two topology classes: (1) 11 groups with 8 admixture events, the original SNP set, Denisovan assigned as an outgroup only at the stage of generating random starting graphs (gene flows to/from the Denisovan branch were allowed at the topology optimization step); and (2) 12 groups with 8 admixture events, chimpanzee added and the original SNP set changed due to the zero missing rate condition, and chimpanzee assigned as an outgroup at both algorithm stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For both graph complexity classes, two topology search settings were tested: (1) either no additional constraints were applied beyond the outgroup constraints described above, or (2) the Vindija Neanderthal and Mbuti were allowed to have no admixture events in their history, and the Denisovan lineage was allowed to have up to one admixture event in its history (these constraints were in line with the model in the original study and with literature on the genetic history of archaic humans, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prüfer et al., 2014</xref>). The composition of the groups matched that in the original study, as did the parameter settings for <italic>qpGraph</italic>, with the exception of ‘least squares mode’, which was used in the original study, but not in our analysis. ‘Least squares mode’ computes LL scores without taking into account the <italic>f</italic>-statistic covariance matrix, and we confirmed that changing this parameter does not qualitatively change our results. Since no <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics were negative when all sites available for each population triplet were used (the ‘useallsnps: YES’ option), we did not use the upgraded algorithm for calculating <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics on pseudo-haploid data.

The graph grew one group at a time, and each newly added group was mapped on to the pre-existing skeleton graph as unadmixed or as a two-way mixture. This imposed constraints on the model-building process. Another constraint imposed was the requirement that all intermediate graphs have good absolute fits (WR below 3 or 4 SE). When the model-building process is constrained in a particular path and fits of all intermediates are required to be good, unnecessary admixture events are often added along the way, and the resulting graph belongs to a complexity class in which models are overfitted and many alternative models fit equally well. There is no single obviously correct order of adding branches to a growing graph. For example, the Kostenki and Sunghir lineages were included into the initial graph (Fig. S6.1 in the original study) as unadmixed lineages, and their admixture status was not revisited at subsequent steps (unlike that of Tianyuan and Ust’-Ishim), except for adding the archaic gene flow common for non-Africans. For that reason, the published graph differs from many alternative better-fitting and temporally plausible graphs where the Kostenki and Sunghir lineages are modeled as more complex mixtures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata8">Figure 3—source data 8</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajdinjak et al., 2021</xref>’s published graph had the following notable features that were interpreted by the authors and used to support some conclusions of the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>): (1) there are gene flows from the lineage found in the ~45,000- to 43,000-year-old Bacho Kiro Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP) individuals to the Ust’-Ishim, Tianyuan, and GoyetQ116-1 lineages; (2) the ~35,000-year-old Bacho Kiro Cave individual BK1653 belonged to a population that was related, but not identical, to that of the GoyetQ116-1 individual; and (3) the Vestonice16 lineage is a mixture of a Sunghir-related and a BK1653-related lineage. To assess if these features are supported by our re-analysis, we focused on our most constrained <italic>findGraphs</italic> run: with chimpanzee set as an outgroup and with the topology constraints applied at the topology search step. We identified 1,421 topologies fitting nominally or significantly better than the published model and satisfying the constraints and moved on to inspect 50 best-fitting topologies for temporal plausibility (all of them fitting significantly better than the published model). All non-African individuals included in the model are Upper Paleolithic and their dates are not drastically different in relative terms: from ca. 45 kya (thousand years before present) for some Bacho Kiro IUP individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajdinjak et al., 2021</xref>) to ca. 30 kya for the Vestonice16 individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, we considered most gene flows from later- to earlier-attested lineages as temporally implausible (for instance, GoyetQ116-1 (~35 kya) → Ust’-Ishim (~44 kya), GoyetQ116-1 (35 kya) → Bacho Kiro IUP (45–43 kya), Kostenki14 (38 kya) → Ust’-Ishim (44 kya), Sunghir III (34.5 kya) → Tianyuan (40 kya), Vestonice16 (30 kya) → Tianyuan (40 kya)) since they imply great antiquity of the later-attested lineages, for example, &gt;40 kya for the Vestonice16 lineage, and even greater antiquity for the related lineages such as Sunghir III and Kostenki14.</p><p>Of the 50 topologies inspected, 32 were considered temporally plausible. Of those topologies, none supported feature 1 of the published AG (there is no replication of the finding of gene flows from the Bacho Kiro IUP lineage specifically to all three of the Ust’-Ishim, Tianyuan, and GoyetQ116-1 lineages). One topology supported features 2 and 3, and partially supported feature 1 (there was Bacho Kiro → GoyetQ116-1 gene flow, but no Bacho Kiro → Tianyuan and Bacho Kiro → Ust’-Ishim gene flows). A total of 17 topologies supported features 2 and 3 but were inconsistent with feature 1; and 14 topologies supported feature 3 only (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Best-fitting representatives of each of these topology classes are shown along with the published model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata8">Figure 3—source data 8</xref>. Considering topological diversity among models that are temporally plausible, conform to current knowledge about relationships between modern and archaic humans, and fit significantly better than the published model, we conclude that feature 3 is probably robust but other details of the fitted AG in Hajdinjak et al. (Figure 2d of that study)—for example, gene flows to the Ust’-Ishim, Tianyuan and Goyet Q116-1 lineages from sources sharing drift exclusively with the Upper Paleolithic Bacho Kiro lineage—should not be interpreted as providing meaningful inferences about population history of Upper Paleolithic modern humans. For example, the upper right-hand alternative model plotted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata8">Figure 3—source data 8c</xref> supports features 2 and 3 but includes no gene flows from the Bacho Kiro IUP lineage.</p><p>A central finding of Hajdinjak et al. is that the Bacho Kiro IUP group shares more alleles with present-day East Asians than with Upper Paleolithic Holocene Europeans despite coming from Europe. Specifically, the study documents significantly positive statistics of the form <italic>D</italic>(an Asian group, Kostenki14; Bacho Kiro IUP, Mbuti) (Figure 2b and Extended Data Figure 5 in the original study). For example, <italic>D</italic>(Tianyuan, Kostenki14; Bacho Kiro IUP, Mbuti) is significantly positive (<italic>D</italic> = 0.0032, SE = 0.0010, <italic>Z</italic> = 3.2) on the dataset used for testing the 12-population graphs (263,698 sites without missing data across all 12 groups). The same statistic is also significantly positive (<italic>D</italic> = 0.0029, SE = 0.0006, <italic>Z</italic> = 4.4) when all 1,312,292 non-missing sites in the population quadruplet are analyzed. Hajdinjak et al.’s interpretation of this observation, using the language from the abstract, is that ‘there was at least some continuity between the earliest modern humans in Europe [Bacho Kiro IUP] and later people in Eurasia [East Asians]’.</p><p>However, a significant <italic>D</italic>-statistic can have multiple explanations. The statistic <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>(Tianyuan, Kostenki14; Bacho Kiro IUP, Mbuti) is fitted equally well by the published 12-population AG (Z-score for the difference between the observed and fitted statistics = 0.64) and by, for example, the lower left-hand graph in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata8">Figure 3—source data 8c</xref> (<italic>Z</italic>-score = 0.94) reproduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>. Under the latter model that fits the data significantly better than the published model (p-value = 0.02), the Bacho Kiro IUP and Tianyuan branches are not connected by a gene flow and do not receive gene flows from a third common source, but the common ancestor of Ust’-Ishim and all European Paleolithic lineages receives an 8% gene flow from a divergent modern human lineage splitting deeper than Bacho Kiro IUP and Tianyuan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata8">Figure 3—source data 8c</xref>). This scenario or some version of it seems archaeologically and geographically plausible and is not disproven by any other line of genetic or non-genetic evidence of which we are aware. It could correspond to a scenario where a primary modern human expansion out of West Asia contributed serially to the major lineages leading to Bacho Kiro, then later East Asians, then Ust’-Ishim, and finally the primary ancestry in later European hunter–gatherers. This has a very different interpretation from the scenario of distinctive shared ancestry between the earliest modern humans in Europe such as Bacho Kiro IUP and later people in East Asia—to the exclusion of later European hunter–gatherers—that is suggested by the Hajdinjak et al. published graph.</p><p>We are not claiming that this specific alternative model is correct—indeed, it is almost certainly not the correct one given the topological complexity of the set of all AGs consistent with the data—but the existence of it and many other models that fit the data makes it clear that we do not yet have a unique historical explanation for the excess sharing of alleles that has been documented between some Upper Paleolithic European groups (Bacho Kiro IUP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajdinjak et al., 2021</xref> GoyetQ116-1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajdinjak et al., 2021</xref>) and all East Asians.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s14"><title>6. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref></title><p>The AG in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref>) was constructed manually based on an SNP set derived from the 1240K enrichment panel, and the final model was alternatively tested on the combined Human Origins subpanels 4 and 5 (each ascertained on one African individual) or on sites ascertained as polymorphic in archaic humans. The final published model (Extended Data Figure 4 in that study) is very complex (12 groups and 12 admixture events): it exists in a space of ~10<sup>44</sup> topologies of this complexity. We note that one admixture event was added by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref> to account for potential modern DNA contamination in ancient Shum Laka individuals, and removing it caused a negligible difference in the fit of the published model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, to decrease the complexity of the graph search space, we considered graphs with 12 groups and 11 admixture events. Twenty-two <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics for these 12 groups turned out to be negative (when the ‘useallsnps: YES’ setting was used), and thus for exploring this graph complexity class we had to remove sites with only one chromosome genotyped in any non-singleton population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The following constraints were applied during the topology search: chimpanzee was assigned as an outgroup at both stages of the process (while generating random starting graphs and while searching the topology space); Altai Neanderthal was required to be unadmixed; and non-Africans (French) were required to have at least one admixture event in their history. The composition of the groups we analyzed matched that in the original study. We summarize results across 2,000 independent iterations of the <italic>findGraphs</italic> algorithm.</p><p>All newly found models turned out to be distinct (2,000), and 11.9% fit nominally (but not significantly) better than the published model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Absolute fits of 36.7% of novel models are good (WR &lt; 3 SE). Fits of the highest-ranking model and the published model are not significantly different according to the bootstrap model comparison method (p-value = 0.176). These metrics, along with the fact that LL scores on all sites lie outside of the LL distribution on resampled datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggest that models in this complexity class, including the published model, are overfitted. Of the AGs we re-evaluate in this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref> shares with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajdinjak et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sikora et al., 2019</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref> evidence of being overfitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>We also wanted to check if overfitting would be found in the graph complexity classes corresponding to two simpler intermediate graphs from the original study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>): 7 groups and 4 admixture events (Figure S3.24 in that study) and 10 groups and 8 admixture events (Figure S3.25 in that study). The population composition of the dataset we used for this analysis was slightly different from the dataset used by Lipson et al.: the ancient South African hunter–gatherer group was replaced by a related group (present-day Juǀʼhoan North), and instead of the Shum Laka ancient group, only one high-coverage individual from the same group (I10871) was used. We summarize results across 2,000 or 10,000 independent <italic>findGraphs</italic> runs for each SNP set, for the small and large graphs, respectively. For 7 groups, we found 201 novel topologies fitting better than the published one, and for 10 groups we found nearly 9,000 such topologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In the latter case, 6.8% of newly found topologies fit significantly better than the published topology. For the more complex graph class with 10 groups and 8 admixture events we also found evidence of overfitting: the LL score of the published graph run on the full data is better than almost all the bootstrap replicates on the same data (it falls below the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile).</p><p>Below we discuss selected prominent features of the AG published in the original study (that were interpreted by the authors and used to support some conclusions of the study) and the extent to which these features consistently replicate across the large number of fitting 12-population graphs with 11 admixture events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>): (1) A lineage maximized in present-day West African groups (Lemande, Mende, and Yoruba) also contributed some ancestry to the ancient Shum Laka individual and to present-day Biaka and Mbuti; (2) another ancestry component in Shum Laka is a deep-branching lineage maximized in the rainforest hunter–gatherers Biaka and Mbuti; (3) ‘super-archaic’ ancestry (i.e., diverging at the modern human/Neanderthal split point or deeper) contributed to Biaka, Mbuti, Shum Laka, Lemande, Mende, and Yoruba; and (4) a ghost modern human lineage (or lineages) contributed to Agaw, Mota, Biaka, Mbuti, Shum Laka, Lemande, Mende, and Yoruba. We identified 232 12-population topologies that fit nominally better than the published one, 34 best-fitting topologies (of 232) were manually assessed for temporal plausibility, and we focus on 30 topologies identified as temporally plausible and including a low-level Neanderthal contribution (≤10%) in non-Africans (French). These 30 topologies are shown along with the published model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>.</p><p>In this set of alternative models, high topological diversity is observed (see an example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and further topologies in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). We classified the topologies as follows. If an ancestral lineage defined above (for example, a deep-branching lineage maximized in rainforest hunter–gatherers Biaka and Mbuti) exists in the graph, we compared the sets of populations where it is found in the published model and in the model examined. If there was no more than one population where the ancestry is expected according to the published model but not present, or present but not expected, we considered this feature of the published graph supported by the alternative graph. If no ancestral lineage meets the definition above, the feature of the published graph was considered not supported. In all other cases, partial support for the feature was declared (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Considering extreme cases, two alternative graphs completely lacked support for three features of the published graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1c</xref>), and one graph supported all four features of the published graph fully (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1q</xref>, the second model). There are some graphs where defining two distinct ancestral lineages maximized in West Africans and in Mbuti and Biaka (features 1 and 2) is essentially impossible since all or nearly all Africans are modeled as a mixture of at least two deep lineages (see the second model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1d</xref>). In some graphs, there is no single lineage specific to rainforest hunter–gatherers (Biaka, Mbuti, and Shum Laka) since the primary ancestries in these groups form independent deep branches in the African graph (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and the second model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1j</xref>). The ghost modern and super-archaic gene flows to Africans also had no universal support in the set of alternative graphs we examined (see, e.g, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1c</xref>).</p><p>Considering the high degree of topological diversity among models that are temporally plausible, conform to known findings about relationships between modern and archaic humans, and fit nominally better than the published model, we conclude that all the four AG features from the original study are not supported by our re-analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). As in the case study above, the published manually constructed model is a representative of a large class of models that are equally well fitting to the limits of our resolution. This situation may be attributed to (1) overfitting and/or to (2) the lack of information in the dataset (in the combination of groups and SNP sites) and/or to (3) inherent limitations of <italic>f</italic>-statistics, when distinct topologies predict identical <italic>f</italic>-statistics.</p><p>In reconsidering the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref> it is important to keep in mind that analysis of allele frequency correlation statistics is not the only type of information that can be used to make inferences about population relationships in deep time. Other methodologies have provided important insights into deep African population history, and the model building in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref> was guided in an informal way by these other lines of evidence. For example, unknown archaic lineages admixing into some African populations were hypothesized through identification of deeply splitting haplotypes that are too long to have been freely mixing with other haplotypes in present-day populations for all of their history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lachance et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Speidel et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, analysis of haplotype divergence times of pairs of populations has been used to provide evidence of an early radiation of modern human lineages maximized today in southern African hunter–gatherers, Mbuti rainforest hunter–gatherers, and the great majority of other present-day populations; and a later split of lineages related to East African hunter–gatherers, West African agriculturalists, and non-Africans, which is a feature of the Lipson et al. model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell and Tishkoff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mallick et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, some alternative models we found do not contradict the above-mentioned results and are profoundly different from the published model at the same time (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). These constraints are not enough, however, to provide evidence for all the topological details of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref> AG highlighted in this section, or for other features of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref> AG that were not invoked in the previous literature and newly proposed in that study, such as the ‘ghost modern’ lineage splitting around the same time as the lineages leading to southern African hunter–gatherers and central African rainforest hunter–gatherers and mixing in highest proportion to Ethiopian hunter–gatherers and to a lesser proportion to West Africans, and the ‘basal West African’ lineage that contributes uniquely to Shum Laka. Many of the models that emerged as good fits in our AG-building exercise as the published one did not share some of these features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>The high diversity of well-fitting AG models that satisfy known constraints relating diverse African populations highlights the need for further research based on multiple lines of genetic analysis (in addition to allele frequency correlation patterns) to obtain further insights into deep African history. Our results particularly highlight the mystery around the highly distinctive genetic ancestry of the Shum Laka individuals themselves, who represent the newly reported data in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipson et al., 2020b</xref> study and a highly important set of genetic datapoints that was not available prior to the study. The ancestral relationships of these four individuals to both rainforest hunter–gatherers, and to the primary lineage in present-day West Africans, remains an open question, one whose resolution promises meaningful new insights into human population history.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s15"><title>7. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref></title><p>The AG inferred by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref> was constructed manually on the basis of an SNP set derived from the 1240K enrichment panel. We focused our analysis on the final graph (Extended Data Figure 6 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref>, 12 groups and 8 admixture events) and on two simpler intermediates in the model-building process (Figures SI3-9 and SI3-10a in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). To simplify the latter two models further, we removed a low-level gene flow (1%) from a WHG-related lineage (Loschbour) to the Mongolia Neolithic group, which resulted in negligible LL differences (0.5 and 2.4 log-units, respectively). Thus, using <italic>findGraphs</italic> we explored the following topology classes: 9 groups with 4 admixture events, 10 groups with 5 admixture events, and 12 groups with 8 admixture events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The composition of the groups matched that in the original study. We summarized results across 2,000 independent iterations of the <italic>findGraphs</italic> algorithm for each topology class. In the case of the most extensive population set (12 groups), three <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics turned out to be negative (when the ‘useallsnps: YES’ setting was used), and thus for exploring this graph complexity class we had to remove sites with only one chromosome genotyped in any non-singleton population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For this complexity class, we also applied several constraints on the graph space exploration process all of which were shared with the Wang et al. graphs: the Denisovan genome was assigned as an outgroup in the random starting graphs, but not at the topology search stage; up to one admixture event was allowed in the history of the Denisovan group; no admixture events were allowed in the history of Mbuti, Loschbour, and Onge; and the (Denisovan, (Mbuti, (Loschbour, Onge))) branching order was required.</p><p>For each topology class we found hundreds to thousands of topologically unique graphs fitting nominally better than the published models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For both simple topology classes, no model fitting significantly better than the published one was found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, the final published model fits the data significantly worse than 12.6% of newly found models of the same complexity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The fact that many topologically diverse models had good absolute fits (65%, 55%, and 15% of distinct newly found graphs with 9, 10, and 12 groups, respectively, had WR &lt; 3 SE) suggests that AG models in these complexity classes are overfitted. Further evidence of overfitting comes from the poor fits of the published model on bootstrap-resampled datasets as compared to their fits on all sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>An important feature of the published graphs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref> that was remarked upon in the study is admixture from a source related to Andamanese hunter–gatherers that is almost universal in East Asians, occurring in the Jomon, Tibetan, Upper Yellow River Late Neolithic, West Liao River Late Neolithic, Taiwan Iron Age, and China Island Early Neolithic (Liangdao) groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). For example, the abstract states ‘Hunter-gatherers from Japan, the Amur River Basin, and people of Neolithic and Iron Age Taiwan and the Tibetan Plateau are linked by a deeply splitting lineage that probably reflects a coastal migration during the Late Pleistocene epoch.’ We performed 2,000 <italic>findGraphs</italic> iterations and obtained 1,778 distinct topologies satisfying all the constraints, nearly all of them (1,724) fitting nominally better than the published model, and 12.6% fitting significantly better (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The models were ranked by LL, and 56 highest-ranking topologies, all of them fitting significantly better than the published one, were assessed for temporal plausibility (models with gene flows from a later group to Tianyuan dated to 40 kya were removed), and 20 topologies were considered temporally plausible (all of them are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). According to these topologies, 0–2 East Asian groups had a fraction of their ancestry derived from a source specifically related to Onge, and 19 topologies included gene flows from the European (Loschbour)-related branch to all 8 East Asian groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). The inferred topological relationships among East Asians are variable in this group of 20 models, and we decided to apply further constraints that guided model ranking and elimination by Wang et al., based on considerations from archaeological evidence, Y chromosome haplogroup divergence patterns, and population split time estimation.</p><p>The constraints that are not based on correlation of allele frequencies across populations that Wang et al. applied and that we applied in our re-examination are as follows. First, combined evidence from archaeology, linguistics, and genetics (a closely shared Y chromosome haplogroup) suggests that the present-day Tibetan Plateau population harbors a substantial proportion of ancestry from a large-scale migration from the Neolithic farming groups from the Upper and Middle Yellow River (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). These arguments and radiocarbon dates favor the following branching order of predominant ancestry components: (Mongolia East N, (China Upper YR LN, Nepal Chokhopani)). Second, evidence from archaeology, linguistics and genetics suggests that the expansion of Austronesian speakers and the peopling of Taiwan was from southeast coastal China to Taiwan and Southeast Asia, but not from Taiwan to mainland China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellwood, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray and Jordan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ko et al., 2014</xref>). These arguments make a China Island EN → Taiwan IA gene flow direction plausible and make the opposite direction of flow less likely. Third, in the original study MSMC cross-coalescence rates were computed for a few pairs of present-day proxies for the ancient groups, and it was argued that they impose constraints on the graph topology. The inferred coalescence date for the Tibetan and Ulchi groups was slightly younger than the Tibetan-Ami and Tibetan-Atayal dates (see Fig. SI3-1 in the original study), suggesting that the Nepal Chokhopani and Mongolia East N group may share ancestral source populations more recently than these two groups and Taiwan IA. We note that it was not clear in the original paper if the difference in coalescence dates is statistically significant, the finding was clearer in MSMC than in MSMC2 analysis, and there was no attempt to calculate expected cross-coalescence profiles using these methods for models incorporating many gene flows. Nevertheless, we applied this constraint as well in an attempt to understand whether, if we used a constraint system similar to that in Wang et al., we would obtain results that agreed with respect to the finding of Onge-related admixture ubiquitous among East Asian groups.</p><p>Applying these three additional constraints, we identified two models (among the 56 ones subjected to manual inspection) that satisfied all of them. The highest-ranking of those models is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2c</xref> (the second model), and it includes a 13% (deeply) European-related gene flow to the common ancestor of all East Asians, and gene flows from the Onge-related branch to just two East Asian groups: Nepal Chokhopani and China WLR LN. This model fits the data significantly better than the published model (p-value = 0.028). We do not claim that this is the correct model (indeed we are almost certain that it is not given the high topological diversity of fitting models), but it is not obviously wrong and differs in qualitatively important ways from the published one.</p><p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref> AG provides an illuminating example that helps us to understand the value added by AG construction. The AG construction process in Wang et al. followed a philosophy of not relying entirely on the allele frequency correlation data (not treating the genetic data as independent to explore how much new insight could come from genetic data alone). Instead, the study integrated other lines of genetic evidence as well as linguistic and archaeological insights explicitly into the AG construction process, with the goal of identifying models consistent with multiple lines of evidence. The fact that after this procedure a fitting graph was obtained is not of great interest, as it is essentially always possible to obtain a fit to allele frequency correlation data when enough admixture events are added. The important question is whether any of the emergent features of the graph that were not applied as constraints in the construction process—for example the evidence of ubiquitous Andamanese-related gene flow throughout East Asia suggesting a coastal route expansion that admixed with an interior route expansion proxied by Tianyuan—were stably inferred. Our analysis does not come to this finding consistently among well-fitting and plausible AGs. We conclude that an important feature of the published graph, that is variable levels of Andamanese-related ancestry found in all East Asians except for Siberians (Mongolia Neolithic) and the Upper Paleolithic Tianyuan (Figure 2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), is not supported by <italic>f</italic>-statistic analysis alone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), and indeed we are not aware of a single feature of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2021</xref> AG that is stably inferred beyond the constraints applied to build it.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s16"><title>8. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sikora et al., 2019</xref></title><p>Two AGs inferred by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sikora et al., 2019</xref> were constructed manually based on an SNP set derived from whole-genome shotgun data and incorporated 12 or 13 groups and 10 admixture events (Extended Data Figure 3f in the original study). One graph was focused on West Eurasians, and the other one on East Eurasians, and both included a Neanderthal, a Denisovan, and an African group (Dinka). Although the chimpanzee outgroup was not included in the original graphs, we added it as it drastically constrains the topology search space. The following additional constraints were applied at the <italic>findGraphs</italic> model optimization stage: the Neanderthal and African groups were unadmixed and the Denisovan group had no more than one admixture event in its history. These three constraints match the features of the published graph. We also repeated topology searches without constraining the admixture status of the Neanderthal, Denisovan, and Dinka. Since no <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics were negative when all sites available for each population triplet were used (the ‘useallsnps: YES’ option), we did not apply the algorithm that allows unbiased calculation of <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics on pseudo-haploid data at the expense of loss of analyzed SNPs.</p><p>In contrast to most other published graphs discussed above, gene flows in the graphs inferred by Sikora et al. do not have equal standing: four low-level gene flows (0–1%) connect the Neanderthal lineage to Upper Paleolithic lineages (Kostenki, Sunghir, Yana, Ust’-Ishim in the &quot;Western&quot; graph and Sunghir, Yana, Mal’ta, Ust’-Ishim in the &quot;Eastern&quot; graph). We repeated each topology search under two alternative settings: either keeping the number of admixture events at 10 to match the published graphs, or at 6 to match simplified versions of the published graphs lacking these low-level Neanderthal gene flows. We performed that modification to simplify the search space and to alleviate the overfitting problem which becomes severe if 10 gene flows across the graph are allowed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Here, we compare LL and WR for the original published models and their simplified versions: the &quot;Western&quot; graph including chimpanzee (LL = 65.7, WR = 3.32 SE) vs. its simplified version (LL = 76.5, WR = 3.78 SE) and the &quot;Eastern&quot; graph including chimpanzee (LL = 85.3, WR = 3.11 SE) vs. its simplified version (LL = 102.4, WR = 4.16 SE). In both cases, we found no statistically significant differences in model fits (relying on the bootstrap model comparison method). In summary, topology search was repeated under 8 settings: for the &quot;Western&quot; or &quot;Eastern&quot; graphs, with no constrains on the admixture status or with the constraints specified above, and with 10 or 6 gene flows (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Below we focus on results for constrained models with 6 admixture events. In contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> show results for constrained &quot;Western&quot; graphs with 10 admixture events.</p><p>In the case of the constrained &quot;Western&quot; graphs with 6 admixture events, 1,000 <italic>findGraphs</italic> runs were performed, 894 distinct topologies were found, 4 models fit significantly better, and 151 models fit nominally better than the published one (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We inspected those 155 topologies and identified 29 topologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>) that are temporally plausible and include no non-canonical gene flows from archaic groups such as Denisovan or a ghost archaic group to non-Africans. Sikora et al. came to the following striking conclusion relying on the &quot;Western&quot; AG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>): the Mal’ta (MA1_ANE) lineage received a gene flow from the Caucasus hunter–gatherer (CaucasusHG_LP or CHG) lineage. However, in our <italic>findGraphs</italic> exploration this direction of gene flow (CHG → Mal’ta) was supported by two of the 29 topologies, and the opposite gene flow direction (from the Mal’ta and East European hunter–gatherer lineages to CHG) was supported by the remaining 27 plausible topologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>). The highest-ranking plausible topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) has a fit that is not significantly different from that of the simplified published model (p-value = 0.392). We note that the gene flow direction contradicting the graph by Sikora et al. was supported by a published <italic>qpAdm</italic> analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lazaridis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>), and <italic>qpAdm</italic> is not affected by the same model degeneracy issues that are the focus of this study. Considering the topological diversity among models that are temporally plausible, conform to robust findings about relationships between modern and archaic humans, and fit nominally better than the published model, we conclude that the direction of the Mal’ta-CHG gene flow cannot be resolved by AG analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Some important conclusions based on the &quot;Eastern&quot; graph also do not replicate across all plausible AGs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In the case of the constrained &quot;Eastern&quot; graphs with 6 admixture events, 4,446 topology search iterations were performed, and 2,785 distinct topologies were found. Only 3 topologies fit significantly and 13 nominally better than the published one (p-value for the highest-ranking newly found model vs. the simplified published model = 0.112), and 9.8% of topologies fit not significantly worse than the published one (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Of the topologies belonging to these groups, we inspected 116 best-fitting ones and identified 97 topologies that are temporally plausible and include no gene flows from archaic groups such as Denisovan or ghost archaic to non-Africans that are qualitatively different from the gene flows that are currently widely accepted. The Sikora et al. &quot;Eastern&quot; AG had the following distinctive features that were used to support some conclusions of the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>): (1) the Mal’ta (MA1_ANE) and Yana (Yana_UP) lineages receive a gene flow from a common East Asian-associated source diverging before the ones contributing to the Devil’s Cave (DevilsCave_N), Kolyma (Kolyma_M), USR1 (Alaska_LP), and Clovis (Clovis_LP) lineages; (2) European-related ancestry in the Kolyma, USR1, and Clovis lineages is closer to Mal’ta than to Yana; (3) the Devil’s Cave lineage received no European-related gene flows, and Kolyma has less European-related ancestry than ancient Americans (USR1 and Clovis). Only feature 2 was universally supported by all the 97 plausible alternative models fitting significantly better, nominally better, or not significantly worse than the simplified published model, while feature 3 was supported by 83 of 97 plausible models, and feature 1 was supported by 28 of 97 plausible models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We plotted 14 plausible graphs as examples of topologies supporting all three features, two features, or one feature of the published graph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>). We note that all the &quot;Eastern&quot; graphs discussed here, both the published and alternative ones, have relatively poor absolute fits with WR above 4 or 5 SE. Increasing the number of gene flows to 10 allowed us to reach much better absolute fits (with WR as low as 2.42 SE), but that resulted in high topological diversity (on a par with some other case studies discussed above). In the case of the constrained &quot;Eastern&quot; graphs with 10 admixture events, 1,000 <italic>findGraphs</italic> runs were performed, and 1000 distinct topologies were found. Of these topologies, 13.2% fit significantly better, 30% nominally better, and 17.6% non-significantly worse than the published model (p-value for the highest-ranking newly found model vs. the published model &lt;0.002) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85492.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nordborg</surname><given-names>Magnus</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Gregor Mendel Institute</institution><country>Austria</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This is a rigorous and critical analysis of the performance of a popular suite of methods for inferring population history, accompanied by improvements.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;On the limits of fitting complex models of population history to genetic data&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Magnus Nordborg as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Carsten Wiuf (Reviewer #2); David Balding (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with editors and reviewers, we have decided that this work cannot be published in <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form. We all agree that the work is excellent, and the writing is good in a local sense, but the manuscript is also overly long and its current presentation makes not very accessible even to those who are genuinely interested in this area (see also individual comments below). While the manuscript contains interesting and important points about population genomics inference and human history, these are buried in what is best described as a mixture between a lab blog and a user manual for ADMIXTURETOOLS. It is thus unclear what the target audience is.</p><p>If you were willing to substantially streamline the presentation, so that it is more in the form of a conventional (computational) biology paper, we would be willing to reconsider a new submission for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Research on human population history has long used models of population splitting with subsequent admixture to make sense of polymorphism data (mostly from humans, but also from commensal species). In this paper, Maier et al use introduce algorithmic improvements that allow them to search the space of such &quot;admixture graphs&quot; more exhaustively and use them to re-evaluate a large number of published results in order to investigate whether the corresponding studies really found the &quot;best&quot; models. They find that they generally did not, and conclude that greater caution is in order when interpreting these kinds of data.</p><p>The work is encyclopedic (the single-spaced manuscript is over 50 pages - a monograph, really) and well written. The conclusions are well supported and illustrated by many examples.</p><p>The main problem I have with the paper is that reading it feels a bit like entering a cladistics meeting where people debate things like the significance of a particular scale on the middle toe of the Lesser Two-headed Tree Wrangler. While the overall point is clear, the details (and there are many) will be obscure unless you are intimately familiar with the specific examples. This means that the majority of the contents of the paper will/must be skipped by those not directly working on human population history. Which is a pity, as the overall conclusions are generally relevant.</p><p>Furthermore, just as would have been the case at a cladistics meeting, this paper is narrowly focused on a particular analysis framework. Technical terms like &quot;f-statistic&quot; are thrown around without introduction. In the few remaining corners of population genetics that do not work on human genetics, there are those who do not think in terms of discrete populations, and who hold heretical notions about isolation-by-distance. The question of whether *any* admixture graph is a good model for the data is not asked here - and it arguably should be given the generality of the title. As the paper makes very clear, there are indeed limits to what we can infer about history from genetic data. However, beyond a vague &quot;here be monsters&quot;, the paper offers a general audience little guidance about which of the large numbers of claims in illustrious journals are actually likely to be true.</p><p>I think this is an excellent and important paper written for a narrow audience. If you want to reach a larger audience, a very different paper is in order.</p><p>I also think you do not address the very broad question in the title – this would again be a different paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors aim to correct inference problems with existing software by changing and implementing new features of Admixtools. The conclusions are supported by the results. The program will likely be much used.</p><p>The authors deserve credit for acknowledging that there might be many admixture graphs fitting a given data set equally well and that this fact has not been acknowledged in any/many previous study(ies), incl the authors own :-</p><p>Also they deserve credit for a quite substantial re-analysis of already published data.</p><p>The novelty and selling point seem to be a new version of Admixturetools (together with re-analysis). However, several of the &quot;new ideas&quot; implemented are already in Admixturetools 7.0.2, so the novelty is quite limited. While I acknowledge computational speed-ups, clever data manipulations, proper testing and so forth are important and important to publish, it does not seem to have the novelty-level required for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors briefly describe improvements to the popular ADMIXTOOLS software, now released as ADMIXTOOLS2. These include computational speedups that allow computationally-intensive resampling-based methods such as bootstrap to help assess model fit, even for large datasets, as well as a more extensive automated search over model space (exhaustive search is still infeasible, so constraints based on judgments of plausibility are still required).</p><p>Using these improved tools, the authors extensively re-analyse 8 published datasets (human, dog and horse), and find many conclusions of the original authors about demographic history to be not well supported. This is because there exist other plausible models, often many of them, that fit the data better, sometimes significantly so, that does not support the original authors' conclusions based on their preferred model. Often there are also even more alternative models that fit the data worse than the published model, but not significantly worse and so they cannot be excluded.</p><p>I'm a statistical methods person not closely familiar with any of the studies re-analysed here, so I don't have deep insights about the revised analyses proposed here. However, the authors seem to me to have conducted a careful and well-justified model fitting exercise with important conclusions and implications for future analyses.</p><p>The authors conclude with recommendations for future analyses of genetic data to make inferences about population history. They hope to change the field in a similar way to the step change in standards for statistical significance in association studies that occurred around 2008. The guidelines proposed are no doubt open to improvement over time, but I agree that this study is likely to have a big impact on the field of demographic history inference leading to better-justified conclusions from future analyses. The problem addressed is much more complex than genetic association, and conclusions based on limited exploration of a vast model space will always open to further improvement.</p><p>It's a very good paper, I don't have much to say at a general level except that it is very long and perhaps trying to do too much. The introduction of ADMIXTOOLS2 and the general discussion about principles of model fitting both seem inadequate. In contrast, the discussion of the re-analyses of datasets is very thorough. Perhaps two papers would have been better?</p><p>In a generally well-written paper I found the first sentence of the abstract confusing &quot;… the only information needed to capture the patterns of allele frequency correlation among populations&quot;. Why is &quot;capturing.… correlation&quot; your primary focus? I would restate with an objective that is comprehensible to a general reader.</p><p>Abstract L17: &quot;Our results suggest that strong claims.…. be made when all well-fitting and temporally plausible models share common topological features&quot; This doesn't follow from the results, you are asserting it as a principle.

The merits of resampling based versus likelihood based model comparison is an extremely important topic, it's beyond the scope of the present paper to discuss fully here but you should be able to cite some authorities to support this claim.</p><p>L342 &quot;to test the null hypothesis that the true difference in log-likelihood.… is zero&quot; The log-likelihood is a function of the data so is not appropriate in a null hypothesis, which should be a statement about models/parameters and not data.</p><p>L375 &quot;… without either fixing one of them or forcing the lengths to be evenly distributed.&quot; not strictly true and there must be a better way to say what you mean: we can only estimate 1 parameter, not both.</p><p>L514 &quot;Lower scores of the fits obtained.… indicate overfitting to the full data set.&quot; This is one of the first of many references to overfitting that I found unsatisfactory as I did not notice a discussion of its implications for your analyses. Overfitting is a broad and ubiquitous phenomenon, why is it important here? I feel you should remove these (not needed to justify your main conclusions) or explain better. Are you diagnosing a mechanism that has led other authors astray? Also the specific wording &quot;overfitting to the full data set&quot; seems odd, is there any other kind of overfitting?</p><p>L614 &quot;Near East&quot; Near to what? East of what? Please use standard terminology that is meaningful to a general reader, not this outdated colonial-era relic. Similarly for &quot;Middle East&quot; (L687): that term is widely used but not appropriate in a science paper, use &quot;West Asia&quot; or &quot;Eastern Mediterranean&quot; something more specific. Also &quot;Levantine&quot; – is that a standard term in the dog world? It seems not from a quick search. Replace with some more meaningful to a general reader.</p><p>L662 &quot;pseudo-diploid&quot; has not been explained. I looked it up and the meaning I found doesn't make sense here.</p><p>L1119 &quot;cannot be right&quot; is not an appropriate way to summarise statistical evidence.</p><p>L1505 explain(or replace) &quot;high degeneracy&quot;.</p><p>L1677 &quot;time and population size as the two sources of genetic drift&quot; they are factors affecting rather than sources.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4: (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overview:</p><p>The article is composed of a review of the existing method for the admixture graph estimation and the update of the ADMIXTURETOOLS, and the application of the package to real-life examples.

In other words, the AG method was used in the original studies to support new conclusions about population history, and not simply to show that there is a model that exists that does not contradict results of other genetic analyses, an approach that is a valid use of AGs and has been taken in some studies (e.g., Seguin-Orlando et al. 2014, Narasimhan et al. 2019, Wang et al. 2019). There are many published studies that could have been included in our re-evaluation exercise as they meet our key criterion (e.g., Yang et al. 2017, McColl et al. 2018, Posth et al. 2018, Flegontov et al. 2019, Calhoff et al. 2021, Kutanan et al. 2021, Bergström et al. 2022, Lipson et al. 2022, and Vallini et al. 2022).

The graph grew one group at a time, and each newly added group was mapped on to the pre-existing skeleton graph as unadmixed or as a 2-way mixture. Another requirement was that all intermediate graphs have good absolute fits (WR below 3 or 4 SE). When the model-building process is constrained in a particular path and fits of all intermediates are required to be good, unnecessary admixture events are often added along the way, and the resulting graph belongs to a complexity class in which models are overfitted.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L614 &quot;Near East&quot; Near to what?

In this case it is 0.078.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. No basic explanation for unprepared readers, what are f2/f3/f4, and what is the practical difference between them.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a definition of f-statistics in the Introduction (lines 49-57):</p><p>“AGs are fitted to f-statistics (Reich et al. 2009, Patterson et al. 2012, Peter 2016, Soraggi and Wiuf 2019). For convenience, below we use a concise definition of f-statistics by Lipson (2020): “The most general definition is that of the <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistic <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub><italic>(A, B; C, D)</italic>, which measures the average correlation in allele frequency differences between (a) populations <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> and (b) populations <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic> i.e., <italic>(p</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> <italic>– p</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>) × (p</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub> <italic>– p</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub><italic>)</italic>, for allele frequencies <italic>p</italic>, typically averaged over many biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms. This <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistic is the same as the <italic>D</italic>-statistic up to a normalization factor.” The other <italic>f</italic>-statistics (<italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>) can be defined as special cases of <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics: <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>(A, B) = f</italic><sub>4</sub><italic>(A, B; A, B)</italic> and <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub><italic>(A; B, C)</italic> = f<sub>4</sub><italic>(A, B; A, C)</italic>. <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics can be written as linear combinations of <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>- or <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>-statistics, and <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics can be written as linear combinations of <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>- and <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>-statistics.”</p><p>We also refer to the easily understandable topological interpretation of these statistics in terms of drift edges as featured in Patterson et al. 2012 and in our paper in Figure A1b:</p><p>“<italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>-</italic>, <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub><italic>-</italic>, and <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics have straightforward interpretations in terms of drift edges along the tree, see Figure 2 in Patterson et al. (2012) and Figure A1b”.</p><p>Practical usage of various <italic>f</italic>-statistics is summarized in Figure A1c.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The article contains many references to features from the ADMIXTURETOOLS by names, without explanation. Authors should provide the text to a broad audience of eLife, but not for the users of ADMIXTURETOOLS.</p></disp-quote><p>In the updated manuscript, <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> option names and similar details are no longer mentioned in the main text, only in Appendices. We believe that these names of settings in Classic <italic>ADMIXTOOLS</italic> or <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> are convenient pointers referring to algorithms that would otherwise be referred to by long names, and therefore we chose to keep these them in the Appendices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestions:</p><p>1. I strongly recommend revising the manuscript stricture. For example, the result section is a blend of &quot;literature revie,&quot;&amp;&quot;draft result&quot;&amp;&quot;methods&quot;&amp;&quot;program manual&quot;.</p><p>2. The text should be significantly reduced, especially when it is hard to read and seems to be in its draft version.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon a consultation with the editors, we streamlined the presentation as follows. We moved all methodological details on <italic>findGraphs</italic> and <italic>ADMIXTOOLS 2</italic> to Appendix 1 (including Figures 1 to 3), and shortened descriptions of case studies substantially, moving a large fraction of that text to Appendix 2. As a result of these changes, the length of the main text (Introduction – Methods, including figure and table legends) was reduced by about a half, from 27,452 to 14,410 words.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Type of the article should be defined more clearer: whether it is a research article? New method? Or a review manuscript of the existing methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the new structure of the manuscript makes it more transparent that we used our newly developed methodology (now presented in Appendix 1, with the support of the editors) to present a critical re-assessment of published findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Be more accurate with figures. In the current version, figures are not properly arranged and resemble draft versions.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have moved former Figures 1 to 3 to Appendix 1. The remaining main-text figures 1 and 2 are effectively presented, in our view. Presenting graphs in Figure 3 in the form of small panels would compromise their readability greatly, and we kept them as they are. Following reviewer feedback, we replotted the graphs in Figure 3 in the “classic” Graphviz style to make them more readable, and all graphs in the supplementary figures were replotted in the same style.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
