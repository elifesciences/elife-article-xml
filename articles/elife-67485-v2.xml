convergently in the South African Cape plant genus <italic>Leucadendron</italic>. Such sexual dimorphism in leaf size is expected largely to be due to differential gene expression between the sexes. We compared patterns of gene expression in leaves among 10 <italic>Leucadendron</italic> species across the genus. Surprisingly, we found no positive association between sexual dimorphism in morphology and the number or the percentage of sex-biased genes (SBGs). Sex bias in most SBGs evolved recently and was species specific. We compared rates of evolutionary change in expression for genes that were sex biased in one species but unbiased in others and found that SBGs evolved faster in expression than unbiased genes. This greater rate of expression evolution of SBGs, also documented in animals, might suggest the possible role of sexual selection in the evolution of gene expression. However, our comparative analysis clearly indicates that the more rapid rate of expression evolution of SBGs predated the origin of bias, and shifts towards bias were depleted in signatures of adaptation. Our results are thus more consistent with the view that sex bias is simply freer to evolve in genes less subject to constraints in expression level.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sex-biased gene expression</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd><kwd>Leucadendron</kwd><kwd>proteaceae</kwd><kwd>plant</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_185196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pannell</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the dioecious plant genus <italic>Leucadendron</italic>, shifts to sex-biased gene expression occurred predominantly in genes with ancestrally high rates of expression evolution, and were not correlated with morphology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexual dimorphism is common in dioecious plants, affecting a broad range of physiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Juvany and Munné-Bosch, 2015</xref>), morphological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett and Hough, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dawson and Geber, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tonnabel et al., 2017</xref>), life history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delph, 1999</xref>), and defence traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cornelissen and Stiling, 2005</xref>), yet sexual dimorphism in plants tends to be less marked than it is in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett and Hough, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lloyd and Webb, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moore and Pannell, 2011</xref>). The South African genus <italic>Leucadendron</italic> stands out as an exception to this pattern, with several of its approximately 80 dioecious species showing strong sexual dimorphism for leaves and plant architectural traits as well as inflorescences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bond and Midgley, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Midgley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rebelo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tonnabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Williams, 1972</xref>). Dimorphism in different traits is highly correlated across species of <italic>Leucadendron</italic>, and reaches extremes in species such as <italic>L. rubrum</italic>, whose females grow leaves that are on average 13 times larger (in surface area) than male leaves, and in which males produce 75 times more inflorescences per stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bond and Midgley, 1988</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Strong morphological sex differences of the leaves evolved repeatedly in the genus <italic>Leucadendron</italic>, yet sex-biased expression affects only few genes, and the transcriptomes of males are not similar between species, nor are transcriptomes of females similar between species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Typical male (left) and female (right) shoot tips of <italic>L. rubrum</italic>, a wind-pollinated species with strong sexual dimorphism in leaves, stems, and inflorescence.

The difference in leaf size and morphology between males and females of <italic>Leucadendron</italic> is thought to be the result of both sexual selection and differential costs of reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett and Hough, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Geber et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harris and Pannell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moore and Pannell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Obeso, 2002</xref>). First, competition for siring success among males should favour the evolution of large floral displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harder and Barrett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moore and Pannell, 2011</xref>). In <italic>Leucadendron</italic>, large flower displays are achieved via the production of finer external branches, which support allometrically smaller leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bond and Midgley, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bond and Maze, 1999</xref> showed that males of <italic>L. xanthoconus</italic> with larger floral displays both attracted more pollinators and suffered greater mortality. These observations are consistent with the selection of large floral displays, and correspondingly smaller leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bond and Midgley, 1988</xref>), due to sexual selection, ultimately opposed by viability selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bond and Maze, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Second, males and females of dioecious plants are subject to different costs and constraints imposed by their different reproductive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bond and Midgley, 1988</xref>). In <italic>Leucadendron</italic>, seeds are produced in inflorescences that develop into woody infructescences (‘cones’) that are costly in terms of photosynthates. Presumably because thicker branches are required for the mechanical support of large cones, they can also support larger leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bond and Midgley, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris and Pannell, 2010</xref> found that sexual dimorphism was more pronounced in those <italic>Leucadendron</italic> species in which females maintained their seeds for longer periods (often several years) in live cones, suggesting that the additional maternal costs of reproduction, attributable to increased transpiration and thus water use, further contributed divergence in leaf traits between the sexes. It thus seems clear that leaf morphology in <italic>Leucadendron</italic>, although fundamentally a vegetative trait, is intimately linked to both male and female reproductive strategies and success. Interestingly, in certain species of <italic>Leucadendron</italic> with specialized pollinators, male and female inflorescences, and their surrounding leaves differ in attractive cues and provide the same pollinator with different rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hemborg and Bond, 2005</xref>), pointing to a further link between reproductive structures and vegetative morphology.</p><p>The morphological and physiological differences between males and females of sexually dimorphic species are likely to depend on differences in gene expression, either because of divergence in gene content at loci linked to sex (on sex chromosomes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachtrog et al., 2014</xref>) or due to differences in gene expression (sex-biased gene expression, SBGE), at autosomal loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellegren and Parsch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zemp et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is also possible that sexual dimorphism develops without SBGE, as a consequence of sex-associated variation in genetic architectures, which could be widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">van der Bijl and Mank, 2021</xref>). Either way, and to the extent that morphological sexual dimorphism is related to SBGE, we might expect species (and tissues) that show particularly striking differences between males and females in morphology also to be characterized by high levels of SBGE. To our knowledge, this prediction has only been tested at a phylogenetic scale in birds. Based on a sample of six galloanserine species, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harrison et al., 2015</xref> reported greater levels of SBGE in species with more exaggerated male traits. Given the well-established role played by sexual selection in bringing about sexual dimorphism, it would seem natural that the evolution of SBGE in cases such as that documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harrison et al., 2015</xref> might also often be driven by sexual selection. Whether such associations apply more generally is not yet known.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harrison et al., 2015</xref> specifically tested for a correlation in birds between a proxy for the outcome of sexual selection (male trait exaggeration) and gene expression in reproductive tissues. Many further studies of SBGE have likewise focussed on reproductive tissues, or samples that include them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellegren and Parsch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grath and Parsch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Parsch and Ellegren, 2013</xref>). Reproductive tissues include the gametes and are necessarily sexually dimorphic in morphology and gene expression, and they directly mediate fertilization and mating success (e.g., through sperm or pollen traits). Many of the genes transcribed in reproductive tissues will have had sex-specific functions for a very long time. Thus, one may expect that sexual selection, as well as sexual dimorphism and SBGE, are generally strongest in reproductive and less pronounced in non-reproductive tissues and traits. But sexual dimorphism in morphology and gene expression may also occur in non-reproductive tissues and traits. Such ‘secondary’ sex characters may reflect distinct reproductive strategies in terms of physiology and ecology that are associated with the ancient, primary differences of male and female gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lloyd and Webb, 1977</xref>).</p><p>Sexual dimorphism in gene expression is thought to evolve via sex-differential selection, similar to morphological traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett and Hough, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geber, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lande, 1980</xref>), but could also result from non-adaptive causes such as genetic drift in genes with similar fitness effects in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellegren and Parsch, 2007</xref>). The male-biased genes in reproductive tissues of many animals, but sometimes also female-biased genes, may show elevated rates of amino acid substitution and elevated rates of gene expression divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellegren and Parsch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khaitovich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Naqvi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ranz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Voolstra et al., 2007</xref>). This is probably due to frequent adaptive sweeps in cases such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grath and Parsch, 2016</xref>). In many other species, however, non-adaptive causes for the accelerated evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes (SBGs) seem more plausible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellegren and Parsch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grath and Parsch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>). In comparison to unbiased genes, SBGs may evolve under relaxed selective constraint and lower pleiotropy, while recieving the same mutational input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mank and Ellegren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meisel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dapper and Wade, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gershoni and Pietrokovski, 2017</xref>). In contrast with studies on animals, studies on plants have thus far either not found elevated substitution rates for SBGs or found reduced rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grath and Parsch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muyle, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, it remains generally unclear whether the higher rates found for SBGs existed already before sex-biased expression, or else, whether they changed coincidentally or after the evolution of sex bias (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Orr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Papakostas et al., 2014</xref>). To conclude, the relative importance of adaptive versus non-adaptive processes in gene expression divergence between the sexes remains an open question.</p><p>Here, we sequenced and analysed male and female transcriptomes in fully developed leaves of 10 <italic>Leucadendron</italic> species sampled from across the genus. Although leaves are non-reproductive tissue, they may, as outlined before, still be submitted to sex-specific selection in <italic>Leucadendron</italic>. We then address two principle questions. First, we asked whether among-species variation in morphological sexual dimorphism correlates with variation between the sexes in levels of gene expression. Second, we inferred the history of recruitment, evolution, and rate of turnover of genes with sex-biased expression across the genus to ask whether SBGs acquired their characteristic rates of evolution before or after they became dimorphic in expression levels. Our study represents the first phylogenetic analysis of the evolution of SBG expression for plants, and our results urge caution in invoking adaptive evolution as the sole reason for high rates of expression evolution observed for SBGs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>We based our analysis on transcriptomes sequenced from species sampled from all major clades of the genus <italic>Leucadendron</italic>, recapturing variation generated over several tens of millions of years of evolution during the genus’ radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sauquet et al., 2009</xref>), which is reflected in up to 3.7% sequence differences at synonymous sites between species. We specifically paired closely related species that differed strongly in their level of sexual dimorphism. We also included in our sample one individual of the hermaphroditic species <italic>Leucospermum reflexum</italic> as an outgroup (sequence difference to <italic>Leucadendron</italic> spp. approximately 5.3%).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Levels of SBGE in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> leaves span the entire range reported from other dioecious plants</title><p>De novo assembly of transcriptomes resulted in 73,307–570,280 contigs per species, of which 34,901–92,840 (13%–48%) were identified as plant-derived (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – Table S1). The abundant and diverse non-plant transcripts mainly belonged to fungi and bacteria, which is to be expected for samples taken from wild, openly growing plants. After filtering of the plant-derived transcripts, we inferred a set of 16,194 ‘orthogroups’ and quantified their expression across the 11 plant transcriptomes. In what follows, we refer to these orthogroups as ‘genes’, although they are best understood as gene families rather than single genes. We tested for differential gene expression between six male and five or six female transcriptomes per species using edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) following convention, we defined genes as sex biased on the basis of a 5% false discovery rate and a minimum twofold difference in expression between the sexes (see Methods). In total, we identified 650 genes that showed SBGE in at least one species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – Table S2). We report further analyses in terms of these genes, although we note that exploration of more stringent (yielding fewer SBGs) and more permissive thresholds (yielding more SBGs) led to qualitatively similar conclusions (Appendix 1). The extent of SBGE was markedly different between species, ranging from a minimum of seven male-biased and three female-biased genes in <italic>L. ericifolium</italic> (0.1% of expressed genes) to 138 male-biased and 141 female-biased genes in <italic>L. dubium</italic> (2.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar patterns were revealed when SBGs were counted, or when the magnitude of bias (fold-change) was cumulated over the genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – Table S3).</p><p>Although <italic>Leucadendron</italic> includes species with some of the strongest manifestations of morphological sexual dimorphism recorded in flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett and Hough, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris and Pannell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Midgley, 2010</xref>), our results indicate that the genus is not exceptional in terms of SBGE in leaves, even in the most morphologically dimorphic species. For instance, our results compare with the low number of SBGE in leaves of <italic>Populus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>Salix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darolti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sanderson et al., 2019</xref>), in which &lt;0.1% of genes were sex biased, as well as the somewhat higher estimates reported for leaves of <italic>Silene latifolia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zemp et al., 2016</xref>) and vegetative tissues of <italic>Mercurialis annua</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cossard et al., 2019</xref>), which had about 2% of SBGs. The fraction of SBGs in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> is also similar to that found for exclusively non-reproductive tissues in certain animals (e.g., only one gene was found to be sex biased in the spleen of birds; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>), but non-reproductive tissues of other animals may express much higher fractions of genes with sex bias (e.g., hundreds or thousands of SBGs were recorded across mammal species, albeit on the basis of lower stringency; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Naqvi et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SBGE is not positively correlated with sexual dimorphism in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> leaves</title><p>Next, we sought evidence for a positive correspondence between variation in SBGE and levels of sexual dimorphism in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> leaves as found for a number of traits related to the inferred intensity of sexual selection in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, we asked whether convergent evolution of sexual dimorphism in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> for leaf morphology is associated with convergence of SBGE. Our data clearly reject this hypothesis: morphological sexual dimorphism, measured either as the ratio of female/male leaf area, or specific leaf area (leaf mass per area), were never positively correlated with the number, the proportion, or the cumulative fold-changes of SBGs (phylogenetic least-squares regressions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For instance, <italic>L. ericifolium</italic> shows very strong leaf size dimorphism but had only seven male-biased and three female-biased genes (0.1% of expressed genes), whereas <italic>L. dubium</italic> shows very little evidence for morphological dimorphism but had 138 male-biased and 141 female-biased genes (2.5%). We also failed to find any genes that were consistently sex biased in species with either low or high morphological dimorphism; instead, the identity of SBGs was largely unique in each species.

About half of these (31 genes) acquired sex bias of the same direction in distinct species. While convergent sex bias was limited to two species in most genes, one component of the respiratory chain (OG0010406, corresponding to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> gene ATMG00513) evolved female bias in three species, and another gene, putatively involved in phosphate homeostasis, evolved female bias in four species (OG0000761, SPX3, AT2G45130). The functional significance, if any, of these patterns is uncertain, but we note that phosphorous metabolism is sexually dimorphic in other dioecious plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the remaining 28 genes with apparent convergence in SBGE actually showed reversed sex bias, that is, they evolved male bias in some species but female bias in others. While most of these genes had sex-reversed expression in only one pair of species, six genes were sex biased in opposite directions in three species (i.e., twice female biased and once male biased). Four of these genes are involved in flavonoid biosynthesis (OG0009936, OG0001220, OG0001123, and OG0004450; corresponding to AT4G22880, AT5G42800, AT1G08250, and AT1G61720), and thus have putative functions attributable to leaf pigmentation, which is often sexually dimorphic in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rebelo, 2001</xref>). The other two genes with reversed sex bias in three species are putatively involved in cytokinin biosynthesis (OG0001906 and AT4G35190), and a vacuolar sucrose invertase (OG0000569 and AT1G62660). The extent of interspecific overlap in similarly sex-biased and reversed sex-biased expression in terms of gene number was greater than expected by chance; correspondingly, the number of uniquely SBGs was lower than expected (permutation tests, all p &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

For each species, we aligned RNA-seq reads of six males and six females, as well as two outgroup samples, to their specific transcriptome assemblies. Variants in coding regions were annotated as synonymous or non-synonymous, and polarized as derived versus ancestral.

In both of the two species, the SBGs of <italic>L. dubium</italic> contained hundreds of derived, non-synonymous polymorphisms.

Male-biased genes in <italic>L. dubium</italic> showed essentially the same DFE, except for a notable absence of adaptive polymorphisms.

Together, these results suggest that SBGE might lead to a relaxation of ancestral selective constraint, perhaps because the shift to predominantly female expression obscures these genes from selection in males. We can offer no explanation for the different DFEs of male- and female-biased genes, but if the SBGs of leaves are also expressed in gametophytes, more intense haploid selection in male- compared to female gametophytes might maintain such a selective constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaudry et al., 2020</xref>).

We thus compared rates of expression evolution between unbiased genes and SBGs. Importantly, we here inferred the rates for SBGs only among species in which these genes were actually unbiased, an analysis made possible by the largely species-specific nature of sex bias in <italic>Leucadendron</italic>. Phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garland, 1992</xref>) revealed that rates of expression evolution in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> tend to be higher for genes that have evolved sex bias in at least one species than for genes that were never sex biased in our sampled species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, the interspecific expression distance of SBGs was generally greater, and increased more steeply with interspecific sequence divergence (i.e., with evolutionary time; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Because these rates of expression evolution for SBGs were inferred only from expression values in species not showing sex bias, it is clear that the elevated rates preceded these genes’ acquisition of sex bias, and are independent of it.</p><p>Rates of expression evolution inferred from differences among species might appear to be higher for those genes that showed greater within-species variation in expression; indeed, intragroup variation in expression level generally correlated positively with intergroup differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Uebbing et al., 2016</xref>).

We therefore tested whether the slope of interspecific expression distance against sequence divergence in SBGs was greater than the slopes of random subsets of unbiased genes that were matched to the SBGs in their degree of intrasex expression variation. We found that all slopes of 1000 of such random but noise-matched gene subsets were lower than the slopes of the actual SBGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This pattern implies that the observed faster rate of expression evolution in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> is a real distinguishing feature of its SBGs and not merely an artefact of their expression noise. Moreover, permutations verified that there were more SBGs (in most species; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) than expected by chance alone (i.e., males and females were not exchangeable). Overall, we are thus confident that the inferred higher ancestral rates of expression evolution for SBGs are real and not an artefact of analysis or of sampling genes with especially large expression variation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>SBGs in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> are ancestrally expressed in fewer tissues and stages than unbiased genes</title><p>SBGs in animals are frequently associated with higher expression specificity across a range of tissues and developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Orr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Papakostas et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that their higher evolutionary rates may be due to reduced pleiotropic constraint and reduced phenotypic exposure to selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mank and Ellegren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Naqvi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Parsch and Ellegren, 2013</xref>).

Accordingly, we compared shifts in expression that led to sex-biased expression (sex-biased shifts) with those that did not (unbiased shifts). We defined an evolutionary shift in expression as a difference of at least 50% between the mean expression values of sister species. (Note that sex bias is here narrowly defined for the species under scrutiny, that is, a given gene could be classed as undergoing a sex-biased shift for one species but unbiased shifts for the nine others, or not undergoing any shift at all.) We calculated for each expression shift the delta-<italic>x</italic> statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hsieh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moghadam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rifkin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zemp et al., 2016</xref>) to indicate whether it might have been driven by natural selection.

However, the incidence of signatures consistent with adaptation in expression levels was significantly higher among shifts not leading to sex bias (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This result is robust to the choice of threshold for classing expression differences between species as shifts, the choice of threshold for classing shifts as adaptive, and occurs in both increases and decreases in expression (Appendix 2). We thus reject the hypothesis that sex-biased expression in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> is generally a result of adaptive evolution. Instead, it would appear that while adaptations that establish sex-biased expression did occur, shifts towards sex-biased expression were less frequently adaptive than expression shifts unrelated to gender or sexual dimorphism.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Counts and chi-squared tests for shifts in gene expression in 10 <italic>Leucadendron</italic> spp. as classified by an index of selection and by sex bias.</title><p>Shifts are defined as differences of 1.5-fold or greater in mean expression between sister species.

In common with the findings of previous studies of one or two species, our results confirm that SBGE in non-reproductive tissues is not as pronounced as it is in some animals. We failed to find positive correlations between SBGE in leaves and morphological dimorphism, suggesting that mature leaf transcriptomes are relatively independent from leaf morphology in function and evolution, unlike the gonad transcriptomes and morphological dimorphism of birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Montgomery and Mank, 2016</xref>). This is perhaps because the small and large leaves of <italic>Leucadendron</italic> males and females, respectively, mostly differ in cell number, due to timing and location of cell divisions during leaf development, but not in cell type composition and cell physiology, and because they are not under similar sex-specific selection (or they do not respond to it in a similar way). We also failed to find evidence for faster sequence evolution of SBGs compared with unbiased genes over both deep and more recent timescales, in contrast with observations for SBGs in animals. Nevertheless, standing population genetic variation in one species in our sample hints at the possibility that the gain of female-biased expression is associated with a relaxation of purifying selection. By taking a phylogenetic perspective however, we have been able to consider shifts in gene expression over evolutionary time in independent lineages with common ancestors, leading to several novel insights.</p><p>Our study has revealed an almost complete lack of convergent evolution of sex bias of individual genes, despite striking convergence in aspects of morphological dimorphism across the genus, as well as that SBGs were evidently recruited from a class of genes with intrinsically faster rates of expression evolution.</p><p>Most significantly, it is clear that the rapid rates of expression evolution for SBGs in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> generally predate their recent acquisition of sex bias itself, suggesting that sex bias may evolve more easily in genes that are intrinsically less constrained in relative expression level. The hypothesis of ancestrally low constraint, which is also consistent with the greater expression specificity of SBGs (in terms of tissues and developmental stages) than unbiased genes, suggests that much of the SBGE observed in plants (and perhaps animals too) may in fact have only limited functional importance. On the other hand, ratios of gene expression divergence over polymorphism suggest that at least some of the expression shifts to sex bias were nonetheless adaptive in one or both sexes. Thus, while drift in expression likely contributes to variation in gene expression and could explain much of the striking patterns of turnover among SBGs in <italic>Leucadendron</italic>, the potentially random walks in expression space of these genes have not been entirely invisible to the eye of sex-specific selection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plant material and RNA-seq</title><p>Based on a phylogenetic tree and analyses of trait evolution in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tonnabel et al., 2014</xref>), we selected five phylogenetic pairs of species displaying low and high leaf size dimorphism. <italic>Leucadendron</italic> plants were sampled from wild populations in South Africa, and <italic>L. reflexum</italic> (outgroup) was sampled in the Botanical Garden of Zurich. We removed mature leaves just below the most recent inflorescences, cut them into pieces of &lt;5 mm length, and immediately submerged the material in 8 ml tubes (Sarstedt 60.542.007) in ice-cold RNA-later (Ambion) or a homemade nucleic acid preservation buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camacho-Sanchez et al., 2013</xref>). We used a manual vacuum pump to enhance infiltration of the leaves by the buffer. The samples from one species were all collected over a period of approximately 2 hrs, with males and females sampled in an alternating fashion along transects. Sample tubes were kept at 0°C for up to 6 days and then frozen at −80°C until further use. Total RNA was extracted from the pickled frozen leaves by grinding to a fine powder under liquid N<sub>2</sub> and purified with the Maxwell 16 LEV Plant RNA Kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) using a KingFisher Duo Prime robot (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The RNA extracts showed generally high integrity (Bioanalyzer profiles). Sequencing libraries were constructed using the KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) with Illumina-compatible indexed Pentadapters (PentaBase ApS, Odense, Denmark). A total of 120 libraries were multiplexed in 6 pools of 20 each, such that each pool contained 1 male and 1 female from each species, to avoid batch effects. Each pool was sequenced in a separate lane for 150 bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 at the FGCZ.

To this end, contigs were filtered for those classified as of Viridiplantae origin, and contig redundancy was reduced by selecting the longest isoform of each gene. On these, open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted using TransDecoder v5.5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haas et al., 2013</xref>), considering all ORFs &gt;100 bp long, and shorter ORFs if they were supported by a homology search against plant proteins in SwissProt or ARAPORT11 (blastp, <italic>e</italic>-value cut-off 10<sup>−5</sup>). The set of predicted protein sequences from each of the 11 species was then supplied to OrthoFinder, which was run with default settings, and produced 26,553 raw orthogroups. We note that the number of Viridiplantae transcripts assembled by Trinity varied about threefold between species. This is likely mainly due to technical effects and differences in expression state of genes rather than differences in the gene content of the species’ genomes, because <italic>Leucadendron</italic> (2<italic>n</italic> = 26, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; as well as <italic>Leucospermum</italic>, 2<italic>n</italic> = 24, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rourke, 1970</xref>) are generally diploid.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Quantification of gene expression levels</title><p>Gene expression was quantified using pseudo-alignment with Salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Patro et al., 2017</xref>), and with the specific Trinity assembly for each species as a reference. The salmon option for metagenomic datasets (‘--meta’) was used, because the references contained all contaminant contigs and (partially) redundant homologous sequences. This strategy allows for maximum mapping success and avoids mis-alignment of contaminant reads to plant contigs. Using the R package tximport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Soneson et al., 2015</xref>), we converted Salmon abundance estimates to read counts (‘scaledTPM’), and summarized to gene level, that is the OrthoFinder orthogroups plus the two additional categories ‘non-coding plant transcript’ and ‘contaminant’. Our strategy to use all sequences and then summarize the read counts with tximport does not distinguish among orthologues, paralogs, isoforms, splice variants, or any other form of homology. Thus, the expression value of a gene in this study is a weighted summary of the expression over all contigs belonging to an orthogroup. Another consequence of the tximport summarization within orthogroups is that eventual strong differences in only some of the homologs within an orthogroup are ‘diluted’ in the summarized count. This would constitute a conservative bias for inference of differences in expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Differential expression tests</title><p>Sex bias was tested for each species separately by differential gene expression analysis in edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>), with <italic>n</italic> = 6 per sex for <italic>L. rubrum</italic>, <italic>L. spissifolium</italic>, <italic>L. olens</italic>, <italic>L. brunioides</italic>, <italic>L. linifolium</italic>, <italic>L. muirii</italic>, <italic>L. dubium</italic>, and <italic>L. xanthoconus</italic>, and six males versus five females in <italic>L. platyspermum</italic> and <italic>L. ericifolium</italic>.

Thus, dN/dS was estimated for each sequence per orthogroup and species, and the average dN/dS was calculated. This estimate of omega for an orthogroup in a focal species describes how the sequences of that orthogroup, on average, evolved from the last common ancestor with the most similar sequences in different species, that is, any evolution leading towards a focal species. We then conducted a paired test for genes that were sex biased in at least one <italic>Leucadendron</italic> species but unbiased in at least one other <italic>Leucadendron</italic> species in our sample. Thus, we calculated for each gene the difference between omega under the unbiased condition and omega under the male-biased condition, or under the female-biased condition. We tested whether the average difference between sex-biased and unbiased conditions was smaller or greater than zero on the basis of 10,000 permutations as above.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Rates of coding sequence evolution: DFEs</title><p>We analysed the DFEs between sex-biased and unbiased genes for <italic>L. dubium</italic>, the species in our sample with the highest number of SBGs (138 male-biased genes, 141 female-biased genes, 10,846 unbiased genes). For comparison, we also analysed DFEs in <italic>L. ericifolium</italic>, chosen because it is a distant relative of <italic>L. dubium</italic> and because most of <italic>L. dubium</italic>’s SBGs were also expressed in <italic>L. ericifolium</italic>, but none were also sex biased. We aligned RNA-seq reads of six males and six females of <italic>L. dubium</italic>, as well as one male <italic>L. rubrum</italic> and one male <italic>L. ericifolium</italic>, to the <italic>L. dubium</italic> transcriptome assembly, using bwa mem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li, 2013</xref>). Likewise, we aligned RNA-seq reads of six males and six females of <italic>L. ericifolium</italic>, and as outgroups one male <italic>L. platyspermum</italic> and one male <italic>L. rubrum</italic>, to the <italic>L. ericifolium</italic> transcriptome assembly. Read alignments were filtered for primary alignments and properly paired alignments, and against supplementary alignments using samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Invariant sites and variants (excluding indels) were called with bcftools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2009</xref>), using at most 250 reads per site and individual. The genotypes were filtered with VCFtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>) to include only biallelic SNPs and invariant sites at a minimum read depth of 3, and without missing data. Only coding regions in Viridiplantae contigs were retained (as defined by the Transdecoder structural annotation, and the taxonomy annotation, see above). Variants were annotated as synonymous or non-synonymous by SNPeff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cingolani et al., 2012</xref>). We polarized alleles as derived versus ancestral using a maximum-likelihood method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keightley and Jackson, 2018</xref>), with <italic>L. rubrum</italic> and <italic>L. ericifolium</italic> serving as outgroups for <italic>L. dubium</italic>, and <italic>L. platyspermum</italic> and <italic>L. rubrum</italic> serving as outgroups for <italic>L. ericifolium</italic>. A custom script was used to count the unfolded (derived) SFS of synonymous (neutral) and non-synonymous (selected) sites, as well as the divergence against the outgroups (derived alleles fixed in the sample of the focal species). In <italic>L. dubium</italic>, we counted three different SFS pairs for (1) unbiased genes of <italic>L. dubium</italic>, (2) for male-biased genes of <italic>L. dubium</italic>, and (3) for female-biased genes of <italic>L. dubium</italic>. In <italic>L. ericifolium</italic>, we counted pairs of SFSs for (1) unbiased genes of <italic>L. ericifolium</italic>, (2) for male-biased genes of <italic>L. dubium</italic>, and (3) for female-biased genes of <italic>L. dubium</italic>. The total numbers of sequenced synonymous and non-synonymous sites, that is including variant and invariant sites, were estimated with the ‘mutational opportunity method’ of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nei and Gojobori, 1986</xref>. In both <italic>L. dubium</italic> and <italic>L. ericifolium</italic> populations, the male- and female-biased genes of <italic>L. dubium</italic> contained hundreds of derived, non-synonymous polymorphisms, and a few dozen fixed derived non-synonymous alleles (substitutions).</p><p>These data were used to fit DFEs with polyDFE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tataru et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tataru and Bataillon, 2019</xref>). We chose the default model family (‘C’), which models DFEs as a mixture of gamma and exponential distributions. We fitted these four different models: (1) a full DFE with adaptive alleles, and with ancestral allele inference error; (2) a full DFE with adaptive alleles, and no ancestral allele inference error; (3) a deleterious-only DFE, and with ancestral allele inference error; and (4) a deleterious-only DFE, and no ancestral allele inference error. All models included nuisance parameters to mitigate distortions of the allele frequency spectrum by factors such as demographic history. Divergence data were included. The fitting procedure itself was run with the basin-hopping algorithm with up to 10 iterations to avoid local maxima. Using the provided postprocessing R code, the models were ranked by the Akaike-information criterion (AIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akaike, 1973</xref>), and parameter estimates were calculated as the AIC-weighted average over all four models. We evaluated uncertainty of the parameter estimates by 200 bootstrap replicates sampled at the site level of the SFSs, to which the four different models were fitted in proportion to their AIC weight. Discretized versions of the point estimates of DFEs, together with 95% confidence intervals from the bootstrap replicates (i.e., 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles), were plotted using ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wickham et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We restricted our DFE analyses to the about 140 male- or female-biased genes of <italic>L. dubium</italic>, because all other species contained far fewer SBGs, at most around 50 male- or female-biased genes. The CIs for bins of the discretized DFE for the SBGs of <italic>L. dubium</italic> were already large and spanned on average 30%, and up to 77%, of the potential parameter space. In contrast, CIs from the large sets of unbiased genes in <italic>L. dubium</italic> and <italic>L. ericifolium</italic> spanned only 5%–10% of the potential parameter space.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Rates of gene expression evolution: PICs</title><p>The mean of the absolute standardized PICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felsenstein, 1985</xref>) per gene was employed as a measure of the rate of expression evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garland, 1992</xref>). For each gene, PICs were calculated based on the species tree and the mean log<sub>2</sub>(TMM − TPM + 1) expression values per species, using the pic function in APE. Sex-biased expressions themselves were excluded when calculating PICs, so that the PICs only measure gene expression variation without sex bias. Significance of the mean difference between SBGs and unbiased genes in the mean absolute PICs was assessed on the basis of 10,000 permutations, using the function permTS in the R package perm v1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fay and Shaw, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-15"><title>Rates of gene expression evolution: expression distances as a function of sequence divergence</title><p>Gene expression distances between pairs of species were calculated as 1 − Pearson’s correlation coefficient, using the mean log<sub>2</sub>(TMM − TPM + 1) expression levels per species and sex. This was done for three different categories, namely for unbiased genes with the average expression levels over both sexes, for SBGs with the male expression levels, and for SBGs with the female expression levels. Note that for SBGs, this includes only expression levels and species in which these genes were not sex biased; hence sex-biased expression itself did not contribute to the gene expression distance for SBGs. For visualization of correlation trends, linear models were fitted for expression distances as a function of sequence divergence using ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wickham et al., 2020</xref>), or the lm function in R. Significance of the correlations between pairwise distance matrices was evaluated by Mantel tests in vegan v2.5-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oksanen et al., 2019</xref>) with 100,000 permutations.</p><p>We conducted a number of tests to verify that the higher expression evolutionary rates observed for SBGs were not spurious artefacts. First, we investigated correlations between intergroup and intragroup variation in gene expression, using simulated expression levels and real expression data. Second, we compared the mean coefficient of variation of expression counts between SBGs and unbiased genes within each species and sex using the function permTS in the R package perm, on the basis of 10,000 permutations. Third, we tested whether greater expression noise alone could explain the differences between sex-biased and unbiased genes in the linear model coefficients for gene expression distance between species as a function of sequence divergence between species. Hence, we compared the observed linear model intercept and slope estimates with artificial estimates from 1000 datasets in which the actual SBGs were replaced by an equal number of randomly chosen unbiased genes that matched the expression noise level of the true SBGs (i.e., in each artificial dataset, for each SBG, one unbiased gene was sampled that matched the SBG within 95%–105% of its coefficient of variation in expression over all species and sexes). Fourth, the empirical false-positive rate for SBGs was determined by conducting the differential gene expression analyses between the sexes (as described above) 1000 times, with datasets in which the sex was randomized (re-sampling males and females without replacement).</p></sec><sec id="s3-16"><title>Putative adaptive shifts in expression level</title><p>As an indicator of directional selection on gene expression level, we used the delta-<italic>x</italic> statistic, various definitions or descriptions of which were introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hsieh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khaitovich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moghadam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ometto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rifkin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zemp et al., 2016</xref>. Here, we define delta-<italic>x</italic> as the ratio of the absolute difference in mean expression between two groups (divergence) over the standard deviation of expression within a focal group (diversity/polymorphism). The rationale is analogous to indicators of selection on DNA sequence variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McDonald and Kreitman, 1991</xref>), that is, directional selection on a trait (expression level) should both increase between-group divergence and decrease within-group variation, whereas traits evolving mainly under drift should show variation similar or greater than divergence. Delta-<italic>x</italic> was calculated on the basis of log<sub>2</sub>(TMM − TPM + 1) expression levels, separately for each gene, each <italic>Leucadendron</italic> species, and for males and females. Divergence was estimated as the difference between the mean expression levels in the sister species (as defined on the species tree), and diversity as the standard deviation over the six (or five) replicates of the focal species and sex. We classified divergences as quantitative evolutionary shifts if the interspecific fold-change of the means was at least 1.5. Shifts in expression showing a delta-<italic>x</italic> greater than 5.0 were classified as ‘high delta-<italic>x</italic>’, that is, a category more consistent with adaptive evolution. Counts of sex-biased shifts and unbiased shifts in the two categories ‘high delta-<italic>x</italic>’ and ‘low delta-<italic>x</italic>’ were compared using a 2 × 2 chi-squared test with Yates’s continuity correction in R.</p></sec><sec id="s3-17"><title>Expression specificity</title><p>The gene expression atlas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Klepikova et al., 2016</xref> provides information on the expression specificity of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genes, based on 24 different groups of tissues and developmental stages.

2</title><sec id="s8" sec-type="appendix"><title>Robustness of inference of the proportion of adaptive shifts in gene expression (delta-<italic>x</italic>)</title><p>We explored the effect of threshold choices on the analysis of signatures of adaptation in expression levels, as measured by the statistic delta-<italic>x</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zemp et al., 2016</xref>). This descriptive statistic is a ratio of expression divergence over diversity (polymorphism) and applies to evolutionary shifts in expression between sister species. In the main text, we present results in which expression shifts are defined as at least 1.5-fold expression difference between sister species, and shifts with delta-<italic>x</italic> of 5.0 and greater were classified as ‘high’, that is more consistent with adaptation. Here, we report additional choices of thresholds for the delta-<italic>x</italic> analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, it is possible that we falsely infer adaptive expression shifts (i.e. high delta-x) for genes that have nearly or completely lost expression under completely relaxed (neutral) evolution, because such genes would have very low expression polymorphism and consequently high delta-<italic>x</italic> values. To investigate this hypothetical bias, we partitioned our data by increases and decreases in expression, asking whether the pattern of depletion of high-delta-<italic>x</italic> among expression shifts towards sex bias is observed in both directions of shift. The direction of expression changes as well as the delta-x statistic were calculated separately for each sex. We found that the depletion of high-delta-x associated with sex bias is generally more pronounced among expression decreases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>), as expected under the bias hypotheses. However, expression increases in males associated with sex bias are also significantly depleted in high-delta-x values. In females, the expression increases associated with sex-bias show a trend of the same direction, although this is not statistically significant. It is thus clear that the trend towards depletion of high-delta-x among shifts to sex biased expression was consistent among both increases and decreases in expression, and consistent in both cases of using either males or females to classify genes as increased or decreased in expression. Therefore, we did not distinguish decreases and increases in the delta-x analyses presented in the main text.</p><table-wrap id="app2table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 2—table 1.</label><caption><title>Conclusions for the proportion of adaptive shifts in gene expression (delta-<italic>x</italic>) in shifts to sex bias and unbiased shifts under varying thresholds.</title><p>Results that are not completely consistent with the main text choice of threshold are shaded in grey.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers appreciated a competent piece of work and an important contribution. Yet there was also a consensus that several points need to be addressed and clarified. Below is a summary of the essential revisions that are required before we can recommend inclusion in <italic>eLife</italic>, which are detailed in the individual reviews appended.</p><p>1) The study focuses on vegetative tissues (leaves), while sexual selection is expected to be strongest for reproductive tissues (e.g. inflorescences). It is essential that the differences in sexual dimorphism and predictions in terms of sex-biased gene expression between the two types of tissues be made clearer, especially since the distinction between somatic and gonadic tissues was already critical in the Harrison et al. (2015) paper. This lack of distinction is currently quite confusing to the readers and should be clarified.</p><p>2) The threshold to define sex-biased gene expression is arbitrary. The extent to which the results presented are robust to the choice of this threshold needs to be explored.</p><p>3) In addition to the patterns of nucleotide divergence between the ten species (omega), an analysis of sequence polymorphism could be performed with the data available to evaluate the rate of adaptive evolution of genes with sex-biased expression.</p><p>4) All reviewers have also provided suggestions to improve clarity of the presentation of this tight manuscript, either by bringing back methodological details from the supplementary into the main text or pointing aspects that require more explanation. These should be carefully considered.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The wording “extreme” sexual dimorphism seems too strong. There is some sexual dimorphism in leaf phenotypes, but they are still recognizably homologous structure. I would stick to the more neutral “strong” sexual dimorphism.</p><p>– The presentation is somewhat obscured by leaving most methodological details to a supplementary material. This applies to most analyses, whose presentation in the Materials and methods section could be fleshed out substantially more in the main text, such as e.g. the arbitrary thresholds used to define sex-biased genes, how exactly morphological sexual dimorphism was measured, how rates of sequence evolution were measured, how functional annotation was transferred from Leucadendron transcriptomes to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genes.</p><p>– Some wordings are awkward, such as p278 : “sex-biased genes in Leucadendron are pleiotropically less constrained in their expression levels”.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Abstract: Line 17 &quot;Such sexual dimorphism must largely be due to differential gene expression between the sexes&quot;. This statement seems a little strong. Why must it be? What are the alternatives?</p><p>Line 39. The authors detail sexual dimorphism in Leucadendron flowers, but this is not the tissue sampled. What degree of dimorphism is observed in leaves and how does this relate to dimorphism observed in inflorescences? Some of this is shown in Figure 1, but it would help if there was some sort of comparison presented early, along with expectations.</p><p>Line 112. I think it is quite important to clarify what tissues these comparative studies used? Were they all based on leaves?</p><p>Line 124. There is a major difference between the phenotypic measures from Harrison et al. (2015) and those used here. Specifically, Harrison et al. focused on measures associated with different types of sexual selection, the idea being that many genes in the gonad underlying gamete production were subject to sexual selection. The authors here focus on sexual dimorphism, which is related but still quite different than sexual selection. This difference needs to be explained, and it would help a great deal if the authors could clarify their expectations for how leaf dimorphism is related to sexual selection in plants. How would this be expected to result in similar or different levels of sex-biased expression or rates of evolution?</p><p>Line 226. In contrast, Darotli et al. (2018) found that sex-biased genes in catkins evolved slower than unbiased genes, likely due to haploid selection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would suggest focusing the manuscript on the finding that most SBGE is neutral (i.e. driven by drift) and making this clearer in the title and abstract. In particular, I found the second half of the abstract very hard to understand and I only understood what the authors meant after reading the entire manuscript. I think the authors need to state in the abstract that most SBG have a recent evolution and are found on the tips of the phylogeny. This makes it possible to measure expression evolutionary rates in species in which the orthologs of SBGs are not sex-biased. SBGs have ancestral high rates of expression evolution already before becoming sex-biased, which suggests drift is the main driver of SBGE evolution. In the abstract line 19-20 &quot;Surprisingly, we found no association between sex-biased gene expression and sexual dimorphism in morphology&quot; should rather say &quot;number nor percentage of SBG&quot;.</p><p>In the introduction, line 38-40, it would be good to explain in more details for non specialists why a divergence in flower morphology between males and females might be counter-selected in species pollinated by specialized pollinators (the pollinator might visit only one sex…). Which should prevent the evolution of extreme sexual dimorphism in these species, contrary to wind-pollinated plants.</p><p>In the Introduction, I struggled at first to have a clear understanding of the various expectations regarding the evolution of SBGE under drift versus selection. Maybe a summary of the expectations could be presented in a table for the two hypotheses (selection and drift): expression evolutionary rates, sequence evolutionary rates, pleiotropy, % of genes undergoing adaptation (omega and delta x), convergence among species and the link with morphological dimorphism.</p><p>It is possible that the switches to SBGE are so recent that the effect on omega is not detectable. How about using methods relying on population data to infer positive selection (Eyre-Walker and Keightley, 2009; Tataru and Bataillon, 2020; Tataru, Mollion, Glémin, and Bataillon, 2017)? The authors have the data to do it (8 individuals per species). I think such an approach would yield interesting results because the authors were able to detect positive selection for some genes on expression levels with the delta-x analysis.</p><p>– Eyre-Walker, A., and Keightley, P.

It has been shown that sex chromosomes are enriched in SBG. Therefore, if some species have a larger non-recombining region, more SBG are expected in these species. The authors do not talk about sex determinism in the genus and whether sex chromosomes are present. I suggest they include at least a discussion on this point.</p><p>How about SBGE in flowers of Leucadendron? Has it ever been studied? Does it correlate to leaf SBGE? And to flower morphological dimorphism? Maybe the authors could discuss it or suggest it as a follow-up to this study.</p><p>Maybe there were very few inferred SBGE in leaves because the timing and place of expression within leaves are more sexually dimorphic than the expression averaged over an entire leaf? For example, to make a bigger leaf, the genes driving active cell divisions might need to be expressed for a longer time at the tip of the leaf, but when the expression of these genes is averaged across the entire sampled leaf for RNA-seq, then we can't see much difference between males and females? It might be interesting to include some discussion on that point.</p><p>The manuscript is very dense and it is hard to grab a global take-home.

Your revised article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The revised manuscript has been reviewed by the same two reviewers and the Reviewing Editor. While the manuscript was changed quite substantially, several important aspects still need to be improved. At this stage we thus cannot recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but would be happy to consider a fully revised version convincingly addressing the following points:</p><p>– The link between sexual dimorphism, sex-biased gene expression and sexual selection still remains confusing throughout the manuscript. Reviewer #2 offered several helpful suggestions to clarify the presentation. It is essential to improve this aspect substantially, as the presentation of the results from previous studies is misleading at several places (e.g. regarding whether the number of sex-biased genes is indeed &quot;surprising&quot; when compared to comparable experimental strategies, e.g. whether the finding that samples cluster by species rather than by sex actually differs from previous findings, e.g. whether elevated rates of amino-acid substitutions are commonly found in animals, e.g. whether the relationship whether sexual dimorphism and gene expression differences is as univocal as implied in the text).</p><p>– A particularly confusing aspect is that the authors seem determined to point out how their results conflict with the Harrison et al. analysis, even when they do not at all. This appears to be unnecessarily confrontational, and a fairer comparison of the results with those of this study is crucially needed, in particular with regard to the important distinction between somatic vs gonadic tissues. Again, Reviewer #2 offered helpful suggestions.</p><p>– The DFE analysis that was suggested by reviewer #3 is interesting, but it remains too superficial. (1) its presentation in the text is presented in a descriptive manner that is hard to follow and the results from this analysis were somewhat excluded from the overall message of the manuscript – this should be improved. Also, the link between the different DFE between males and females and haploid selection should be made more explicit. (2) I could not understand why the analysis was performed in one species only. I understand that the number of sex-biased genes is low in most species, but this will simply decrease power of the analysis and could still be worth reporting. Alternatively, the threshold for what a &quot;suitably high number of sex-biased genes&quot; is should be reported (note that lines 308-313 mention that the analysis was performed &quot;in the genus at large&quot; but no results are reported, so it is confusing whether that was done or not) (3) More importantly, even in the case where the analysis remains focused one species only, I do not understand why the DFE analysis was not performed on the genes that are currently NOT sex-biased in the focal species but sex-biased in the other species (just like was done to show that sex biased genes in one species were already evolving quickly in the others).</p><p>– The Delta-X analysis is also interesting, but Reviewer #2 pointed out that it is essential to distinguish increases from decreases of expression, and to account for the bias introduced by comparing genes with high- vs low-expression. Also, the sentence on line 408 seems to have the reverse meaning of what it is intended to say.</p><p>– The presentation of the hypotheses in Table 1 was suggested by reviewer #3, but in its current form it is confusing. I suggest to remove and stick to the presentation of the hypotheses in the text.</p><p>– Line 367 : the idea that tissue/stage specificity is a direct measure of pleiotropy is misleading – it is very indirect. Rather say something more direct like &quot;sex-biased genes are expressed in less tissues/stages than unbiased genes&quot;, which is closer to the actual observation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I can see the authors have changed and added quite a bit to the manuscript in the revision, but unfortunately I do not find it much improved.</p><p>1. I still find the discussion of sexual dimorphism in leaf, sexual selection and SBGE very confusing. If the authors wish to invoke sexual selection in this study, they need to offer a plausible explanation for how leaf structure is subject to sexual selection. The authors are correct that the measures of sexual selection that Harrison et al. (2015) used were also cases of dimorphism, but they were chosen from the other forms of phenotypic dimorphism in birds (of which there are many) because they are well documented to result from sexual selection. To illustrate, Harrison et al. could have used such measures as nostril size, neuronal morphology or intestinal length, all of which are dimorphic, but none of which have any known association with sexual selection. Therefore, verbiage offered by the authors in their response letter and in the introduction falls short of what is needed to explain why the measures of leaf dimorphism are related to sexual selection. The simplest solution would be for them to remove mention of sexual selection from the paper, and focus in dimorphism. If this is not agreeable, then a more appropriate explanation of how leaves are sexually selected is required.</p><p>2. From Line 60. &quot;In Leucadendron (and more generally), morphological and physiological differences between the sexes of sexually dimorphic species must ultimately trace back to differences in gene expression (sex-biased gene expression, SBGE), which enable dimorphism in spite of the largely shared genome.&quot;</p><p>I brought this up previously but perhaps wasn't direct enough. The link between SBGE and dimorphism is by no means definitive, and to my knowledge, there has been no study that demonstrated a direct relationship by which all dimorphisms are caused by either SBGE or y- or w-linked genes. In fact, van der Bijl and Mank (2021, Evolution Letters) shows that concordant changes in gene expression in males and females can result in discordant phenotypic effects, suggesting that SBGE is not necessary for dimorphism. I would therefore revise this and other similar statements to read: &quot;In Leucadendron (and more generally), morphological and physiological differences between the sexes of sexually dimorphic species may trace back to differences in gene expression (sex-biased gene expression, SBGE), which enable dimorphism in spite of the largely shared genome.&quot;</p><p>3. Line 100 &quot;Under the hypotheses that sex-related adaptation drives SBGE, we expect that sex-biased genes show elevated rates of amino acid substitution and faster rates of expression divergence between species (Grath and Parsch, 2016; Hollis et al., 2014; Immonen et al., 2014; Pointer et al., 2013; Simmons et al., 2020). Tests of such predictions have provided evidence consistent with this idea in many animals (Ellegren and Parsch, 2007; Grath and Parsch, 2016; Harrison et al., 2015).&quot;</p><p>No, this is not true. Rapid rates of evolution for sex-biased genes has been recently shown in many animals to result from non-adaptive processes. For example, Harrison et al. (2015) concluded high dN/dS is due to relaxed constraint, and was more consistent with non-adaptive change. Moreover, Gershoni and Pietrokovski 2014, Nature Communications showed that many non-synonymous changes in male-biased genes in humans are mildly deleterious. Overall, where adaptive and non-adaptive scenarios have been tested separately in sex-biased genes in animals, the majority of examples are consistent with sex-bias causing a shift in the mutation-selection equilibrium (Dapper and Wade 2016 Evolution). In essence, genes that are effectively sex-limited in expression experience the mutational input from both sexes, but are only selected in one sex. This can give a false signal of positive selection for studies using more standard assumptions.</p><p>4. Line 135. How is the number of SBGs in leaf surprising? What are the numbers from other studies? Reading Darolti et al. (2018, Molecular Ecology), they used lower fold-change thresholds and only identified seven sex-biased genes in willow leaf. Are there other studies in plants that make the number observed in this paper surprisingly low? Numbers from animal somatic tissues are in this range as well – for example, Harrison et al. found just one female-biased gene using similar fold-change thresholds in the spleen, and no male-biased genes. Based on this, I would suggest the title for this section is somewhat misleading, as perhaps there are someone more SBGs than expected based on studies in comparable tissues.</p><p>5. Line 216. This bit illustrates how the comparison to Harrison et al. (2015) seems unnecessarily contradictory. Yes, it is true that in Harrison et al. gonad samples clustered first by sex, then by species, but they also reported that when they clustered expression of spleen data, it clustered by species, then sex, just like the study in review here. This underlines the fact that the leaf tissue in question here is comparable to animal somatic tissue, not gonad. The authors need to be very careful and not over-emphasize differences that are in fact entirely concordant.</p><p>6. Delta-X comparison. It is important to differentiate increases from decreases in expression in delta- comparisons, because the loss (or very low expression and functional loss) of expression for a gene is expected under completely relaxed selection, and this would give a signature of positive selection under Delta-X (large change, little variation).</p><p>Moreover, the way the authors have set up their Delta-X measure (similar to the Ometto et al. 2011 formula) will result in a conflation between highly-expressed genes and high Delta-X. This is a problem in the formulation used in the Ometto et al. (2011) analysis, and why Moghadam et al. (2012) used a somewhat more complicated formula which corrects for expression level. If the authors would like to use this formula for gene expression evolution, they should make sure that there is no relationship between expression level and Delta-X value.</p><p>7. Table 1. I am unsure how the authors reached some of these predictions. For example, I do not understand why adaptive evolution would result in greater sequence and expression evolution than non-adaptive scenarios. One could hypothesize that very few codon changes would be adaptive, leading to lower dN/dS than relaxed constraint. Similarly, if gene expression is under selection, small changes might be expected under adaptive scenarios while relaxed constraint could lead to large changes with no effect. Similarly, dN/dS would be expected to be very high in genes under relaxed constraint, and likely higher than adaptive selection. The delta-X prediction would only be true for genes experiencing increased expression, the opposite is true to decreased expression – see my comment about Delta-X above.</p><p>8. Why was the sequence polymorphism analysis not done on all species? This bit should also be discussed more thoroughly in the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have satisfyingly answered my previous queries.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67485.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers appreciated a competent piece of work and an important contribution. Yet there was also a consensus that several points need to be addressed and clarified. Below is a summary of the essential revisions that are required before we can recommend inclusion in eLife, which are detailed in the individual reviews appended.</p><p>1) The study focuses on vegetative tissues (leaves), while sexual selection is expected to be strongest for reproductive tissues (e.g. inflorescences). It is essential that the differences in sexual dimorphism and predictions in terms of sex-biased gene expression between the two types of tissues be made clearer, especially since the distinction between somatic and gonadic tissues was already critical in the Harrison et al. (2015) paper. This lack of distinction is currently quite confusing to the readers and should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a full paragraph to the Introduction that lays out the expected differences between reproductive and non-reproductive tissues (traits) in the intensity of sex-specific (or sexual) selection, sexual dimorphism and sex-biased gene expression. We have also taken care to state the reproductive or non-reproductive tissues in cited references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The threshold to define sex-biased gene expression is arbitrary. The extent to which the results presented are robust to the choice of this threshold needs to be explored.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the new Appendix 1, which presents key results under very permissive (no minimum fold-change, uncorrected p-value &lt;= 0.05) and very stringent thresholds (minimum 3-fold change, FDR &lt;= 0.001) for the definition of sex-bias. The patterns and conclusions of our study generally are robust to the choice of threshold to define sex-biased expression. Although the threshold of 2-fold change and 5% FDR are arbitrary, we chose these because they are practically a standard and convention in the field of differential gene expression, and allow our results to be directly compared to other studies on sex-biased gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In addition to the patterns of nucleotide divergence between the ten species (omega), an analysis of sequence polymorphism could be performed with the data available to evaluate the rate of adaptive evolution of genes with sex-biased expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted these additional analyses as requested, and report the new results in an additional paragraph, a new Table and a new Figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All reviewers have also provided suggestions to improve clarity of the presentation of this tight manuscript, either by bringing back methodological details from the supplementary into the main text or pointing aspects that require more explanation.

The authors detail sexual dimorphism in Leucadendron flowers, but this is not the tissue sampled. What degree of dimorphism is observed in leaves and how does this relate to dimorphism observed in inflorescences? Some of this is shown in Figure 1, but it would help if there was some sort of comparison presented early, along with expectations.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Introduction, we present a brief overview of known sexually dimorphic traits in <italic>Leucadendro</italic>n, including both vegetative and reproductive organs. Leaf dimorphism, the focus of our study, is mentioned first (two sentences before), and (now explicitly) later again at the end of the paragraph. We added some examples of degrees of dimorphism in leaves and inflorescences; these traits are very strongly correlated in Leucadendron (as per the data of Bond and Midgley, 1988) We have also introduced a new paragraph detailing the differences that we expect between studies of reproductive traits (tissues) and non-reproductive traits (tissues).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 112. I think it is quite important to clarify what tissues these comparative studies used? Were they all based on leaves?</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected: We now refer to &quot;leaves and plant architecture&quot;, and we removed the cited study Bond and Maze (1999) here because it investigated dimorphism of flower traits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 124. There is a major difference between the phenotypic measures from Harrison et al. (2015) and those used here. Specifically, Harrison et al. focused on measures associated with different types of sexual selection, the idea being that many genes in the gonad underlying gamete production were subject to sexual selection. The authors here focus on sexual dimorphism, which is related but still quite different than sexual selection. This difference needs to be explained, and it would help a great deal if the authors could clarify their expectations for how leaf dimorphism is related to sexual selection in plants. How would this be expected to result in similar or different levels of sex-biased expression or rates of evolution?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a new paragraph in the Introduction to clarify the key differences between Harrison et al.s' (2015) reasoning and ours, and the expectations how leaf sexual dimorphism could be related to sexual selection and sex-biased gene expression. We argue that sexual selection is but one of several components of sex-specific selection promoting sexual dimorphism in vegetative organs of plants. The phenotypic measures in Harrison et al. (2015) are &quot;sexual ornamentation (dichromatism, elongated feathers, wattles, caruncles, etc.; SI Methods) as a proxy for precopulatory sexual selection&quot;. As sexual selection is well established as a driver of sexual ornamentation in birds, and it is positively correlated to sex-biased gene expression, it appears that sex-biased gene expression is also driven by sexual selection. Harrison et al.’s measures are clearly measures of sexual dimorphism (in non-reproductive organs) rather than direct measures of sexual selection. Our study, too, uses sexual dimorphism measured in non-reproductive organs (in leaf area, and leaf mass per leaf area), which should be directly comparable. However, we acknowledge that sexual dimorphism in birds and in plants cannot come about by the exact same processes, but we maintain that the specific processes and expectations are generally comparable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 226. In contrast, Darotli et al. (2018) found that sex-biased genes in catkins evolved slower than unbiased genes, likely due to haploid selection.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present this relevant aspect in the first paragraph of the section &quot;Origin and evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes in <italic>Leucadendron&quot;</italic>, and later cite the reference again when presenting our newly added result that the distribution of fitness effects in male biased genes of L. dubium is deleterious-only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would suggest focusing the manuscript on the finding that most SBGE is neutral (i.e. driven by drift) and making this clearer in the title and abstract. In particular, I found the second half of the abstract very hard to understand and I only understood what the authors meant after reading the entire manuscript. I think the authors need to state in the abstract that most SBG have a recent evolution and are found on the tips of the phylogeny. This makes it possible to measure expression evolutionary rates in species in which the orthologs of SBGs are not sex-biased. SBGs have ancestral high rates of expression evolution already before becoming sex-biased, which suggests drift is the main driver of SBGE evolution. In the abstract line 19-20 &quot;Surprisingly, we found no association between sex-biased gene expression and sexual dimorphism in morphology&quot; should rather say &quot;number nor percentage of SBG&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed this helpful advice and have altered the abstract accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the introduction, line 38-40, it would be good to explain in more details for non specialists why a divergence in flower morphology between males and females might be counter-selected in species pollinated by specialized pollinators (the pollinator might visit only one sex…). Which should prevent the evolution of extreme sexual dimorphism in these species, contrary to wind-pollinated plants.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not follow this suggestion, because we think there is not enough space in this already long manuscript to justify the discussion of this particular hypothesis just for the sake of completeness. The role of this paragraph is to present examples and hypothetical factors behind strong sexual dimorphism in the genus. Although the question for limitations to sexual dimorphism is logically closely related to that topic, we believe their discussion would not help the understanding of our particular study here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Introduction, I struggled at first to have a clear understanding of the various expectations regarding the evolution of SBGE under drift versus selection. Maybe a summary of the expectations could be presented in a table for the two hypotheses (selection and drift): expression evolutionary rates, sequence evolutionary rates, pleiotropy, % of genes undergoing adaptation (omega and delta x), convergence among species and the link with morphological dimorphism.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a table in the Introduction to summarise the expectations under different scenarios for the evolution of sex-biased genes under drift or directional selection (adaptation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is possible that the switches to SBGE are so recent that the effect on omega is not detectable. How about using methods relying on population data to infer positive selection (Eyre-Walker and Keightley, 2009; Tataru and Bataillon, 2020; Tataru, Mollion, Glémin, and Bataillon, 2017)?

Because most species had only few SBGs, we used only <italic>L. dubium</italic> for this, and indeed we found that in this population (species), SBGs showed different rates of adaptive evolution than unbiased genes. These new results have been added to the study in the form of a new paragraph, a new Table, and a new Figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Because this is restricted to one species, these new results can, however, not change the larger picture that elevated rates of sequence evolution of SBGs are not apparent in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I wonder if differences in numbers of SBGs among species could be due to differences in their sex-linked regions? It has been shown that sex chromosomes are enriched in SBG. Therefore, if some species have a larger non-recombining region, more SBG are expected in these species. The authors do not talk about sex determinism in the genus and whether sex chromosomes are present.

However, this mishap can not confound our comparison of average dN/dS in sex-biased and unbiased genes, because the incidence of this mishap should be similar in our samples of sex-biased and unbiased genes. In any case, we apply a widely used orthology inference method, and furthermore select sequences for the estimation of dN/dS strictly from different species. As described in the now extended Methods section, we calculate dN/dS after selecting a subset of sequences from an orthogroup, namely a focal sequence and the three most similar from three further species. We certainly never use two sequences from the same species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think Figure S3 should be in the main text because it is very interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We brought back Figure S3 as the new Figure 2 to the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure S4: how about making a paired test comparing for each gene the omega in sex-biased external (tip) branches to the omega in unbiased external (tip) branch?

We collected for each sex-biased gene the omega under male-bias, female-bias and unbiased conditions. This implies that the omega estimates under the different conditions are from different species.

It turns out that the mean over all genes of the differences between omega under unbiased and male-biased conditions per gene is not different from zero. The same result is obtained for the female-biased condition. Thus, the pairwise test per gene is consistent with the original result based on comparisons between different sets of genes. There is no trend in the rates of sequence evolution between sex-biased and unbiased conditions.

While the manuscript was changed quite substantially, several important aspects still need to be improved. At this stage we thus cannot recommend publication in eLife, but would be happy to consider a fully revised version convincingly addressing the following points:</p><p>– The link between sexual dimorphism, sex-biased gene expression and sexual selection still remains confusing throughout the manuscript. Reviewer #2 offered several helpful suggestions to clarify the presentation. It is essential to improve this aspect substantially, as the presentation of the results from previous studies is misleading at several places (e.g. regarding whether the number of sex-biased genes is indeed &quot;surprising&quot; when compared to comparable experimental strategies, e.g. whether the finding that samples cluster by species rather than by sex actually differs from previous findings, e.g. whether elevated rates of amino-acid substitutions are commonly found in animals, e.g. whether the relationship whether sexual dimorphism and gene expression differences is as univocal as implied in the text).</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-written and amended the section of the Introduction that presents hypotheses and evidence for the evolution of sexually dimorphic vegetative traits in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> by sex-specific selection. Furthermore, we made substantial revisions to correctly present previous studies. This concerns especially the causes of elevated evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes in animals, following the important suggestions of R#2. The statement about &quot;surprisingly&quot; low proportions of SBGs has been replaced by a more appropriate statement that reflects previous studies in a more balanced way. On the matter of transcriptomes clustering by species or rather by sex, we have removed the confusing sentence and instead now state that our observation is similar to reports from animal non-reproductive tissue. We now more carefully express our expectation that sexual dimorphism <italic>may</italic> be based on sex-biased gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A particularly confusing aspect is that the authors seem determined to point out how their results conflict with the Harrison et al. analysis, even when they do not at all. This appears to be unnecessarily confrontational, and a fairer comparison of the results with those of this study is crucially needed, in particular with regard to the important distinction between somatic vs gonadic tissues. Again, Reviewer #2 offered helpful suggestions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised multiple statements in our manuscript in this regard, taking care to not mis-represent previous studies, and to avoid statements of conflict between Harrison et al. (2015) and our study. There is no conflict between the studies; our findings are similar in many aspects, except for the lack of a positive correlation between SBGE and sexual dimorphism in our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The DFE analysis that was suggested by reviewer #3 is interesting, but it remains too superficial. (1) its presentation in the text is presented in a descriptive manner that is hard to follow and the results from this analysis were somewhat excluded from the overall message of the manuscript – this should be improved. Also, the link between the different DFE between males and females and haploid selection should be made more explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>In the course of the revisions, we have completely re-done the DFE analyses, to present the uncertainty of the estimates, and to improve their integration in this study as a whole. We have also shifted the focus of the presentation away from the single parameter α (fraction of adaptive amnio acid substitutions) to the full distribution of fitness effects, and dedicated a new section to the DFE analyses (&quot;Distribution of fitness effects in sex-biased genes&quot;). This re-make of the analysis has led to somewhat different DFEs, due to better data filtering and incorporation of model uncertainty (we previously presented point estimates under the best model only). We now also compare DFEs for the same genes with and without sex-biased expression, in the same spirit as other analyses in our study. The discussion of possible involvement of haploid selection was made more explicit, and a statement about the DFE analyses / population genetic polymorphism has been added to the Concluding Remarks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I could not understand why the analysis was performed in one species only. I understand that the number of sex-biased genes is low in most species, but this will simply decrease power of the analysis and could still be worth reporting. Alternatively, the threshold for what a &quot;suitably high number of sex-biased genes&quot; is should be reported (note that lines 308-313 mention that the analysis was performed &quot;in the genus at large&quot; but no results are reported, so it is confusing whether that was done or not).</p></disp-quote><p>We explain in the reply to a similar comment by R#2 the problematic lack of statistical power for small datasets in polyDFE in detail. The newly provided bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) for bins of the discretized DFE revealed great uncertainty already with the about 140 male- or female-biased genes of the species with most SBGs in our sample. The CIs for unbiased genes (about 6 Mb of data) spanned about 5-10% of the potential parameter space, whereas the CIs for the same parameters for SBGs spanned on average 30%, and up to 77%, of the potential parameter space (see the new DFE Figure, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We decided that analyses based on even smaller datasets, with at most about 50 male- or female-biased genes, would yield estimates that are too uncertain to be worth reporting. We explain this briefly in the Results and Discussion, and in greater detail in the Methods section.</p><p>The formulation of &quot;suitably high number of genes&quot; was removed, and now the threshold numbers of around 140 (deemed just enough), and about 50 (deemed too few) are clearly reported in the Methods section.</p><p>The confusing statement in former lines 308-313 has also been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More importantly, even in the case where the analysis remains focused one species only, I do not understand why the DFE analysis was not performed on the genes that are currently NOT sex-biased in the focal species but sex-biased in the other species (just like was done to show that sex biased genes in one species were already evolving quickly in the others).</p></disp-quote><p>We followed this good idea, which provided additional insights that have been added to the text. However, we reasoned that it would be a stronger result to have estimates of the DFEs for the same genes under both sex-biased and unbiased expression. Hence, we fitted DFEs to <italic>L. dubium's</italic> SBGs in a distantly related species (<italic>L. ericifolium</italic>), where these genes showed unbiased expression. Please see the new section &quot;Distribution of fitness effects in sex-biased genes&quot; for the new results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The Delta-X analysis is also interesting, but Reviewer #2 pointed out that it is essential to distinguish increases from decreases of expression, and to account for the bias introduced by comparing genes with high- vs low-expression. Also, the sentence on line 408 seems to have the reverse meaning of what it is intended to say.</p></disp-quote><p>We have explored these hypothetical biases pointed out by Reviewer #2, and address them below. The results for delta-x with increases and decreases considered separately are presented in a new section of Appendix 2. We corrected the confusing sentence on former line 408.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The presentation of the hypotheses in Table 1 was suggested by reviewer #3, but in its current form it is confusing. I suggest to remove and stick to the presentation of the hypotheses in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed Table 1 and instead present hypotheses of molecular evolution in the text, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 367 : the idea that tissue/stage specificity is a direct measure of pleiotropy is misleading – it is very indirect. Rather say something more direct like &quot;sex-biased genes are expressed in less tissues/stages than unbiased genes&quot;, which is closer to the actual observation.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I can see the authors have changed and added quite a bit to the manuscript in the revision, but unfortunately I do not find it much improved.</p><p>1. I still find the discussion of sexual dimorphism in leaf, sexual selection and SBGE very confusing. If the authors wish to invoke sexual selection in this study, they need to offer a plausible explanation for how leaf structure is subject to sexual selection. The authors are correct that the measures of sexual selection that Harrison et al. (2015) used were also cases of dimorphism, but they were chosen from the other forms of phenotypic dimorphism in birds (of which there are many) because they are well documented to result from sexual selection. To illustrate, Harrison et al. could have used such measures as nostril size, neuronal morphology or intestinal length, all of which are dimorphic, but none of which have any known association with sexual selection. Therefore, verbiage offered by the authors in their response letter and in the introduction falls short of what is needed to explain why the measures of leaf dimorphism are related to sexual selection. The simplest solution would be for them to remove mention of sexual selection from the paper, and focus in dimorphism. If this is not agreeable, then a more appropriate explanation of how leaves are sexually selected is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We have completely re-written and amended the second paragraph of the Introduction on hypotheses of how sexual selection indirectly acts on leaf morphology (and other non-reproductive traits). It should now be clear that we do not claim that leaves directly affect mating success, but rather indirectly. For <italic>Leucadendron</italic>, hypotheses of how sexual selection indirectly acts on leaf morphology (and other non-reproductive traits) fall into two broad classes, which we now describe explicitly and in greater detail. Although evidence for any of these hypotheses is to some extent circumstantial, we believe that they are plausible. Testing these hypotheses is beyond the scope of our study.</p><p>The possibility of sexual selection occurring in plants has long been controversial, and in our case it may be even more controversial as we are investigating non-reproductive organs. In the first paragraph of our article, we refer the reader to an assay on the topic of sexual selection in plants (Moore and Pannell, 2011 Current Biology). We adopt that relatively loose definition of sexual selection here (&quot;a process that acts to increase mating success&quot;).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. From Line 60. &quot;In Leucadendron (and more generally), morphological and physiological differences between the sexes of sexually dimorphic species must ultimately trace back to differences in gene expression (sex-biased gene expression, SBGE), which enable dimorphism in spite of the largely shared genome.&quot;</p><p>I brought this up previously but perhaps wasn't direct enough. The link between SBGE and dimorphism is by no means definitive, and to my knowledge, there has been no study that demonstrated a direct relationship by which all dimorphisms are caused by either SBGE or y- or w-linked genes. In fact, van der Bijl and Mank (2021, Evolution Letters) shows that concordant changes in gene expression in males and females can result in discordant phenotypic effects, suggesting that SBGE is not necessary for dimorphism. I would therefore revise this and other similar statements to read: &quot;In Leucadendron (and more generally), morphological and physiological differences between the sexes of sexually dimorphic species may trace back to differences in gene expression (sex-biased gene expression, SBGE), which enable dimorphism in spite of the largely shared genome.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We revised this statement to express our expectation more cautiously; it now reads: &quot;The morphological and physiological differences between males and females of sexually dimorphic species are likely to depend on differences in gene expression […]&quot;. Nevertheless, we would follow the explanation offered by van der Bijl and Mank (2021) that discordant phenotypic effects (sexual dimorphism) of concordant (unbiased) changes in gene expression are due to sex-specific genetic architectures, which could be (citing them) &quot;the result of interactions with sex-biased genes in the same regulatory network, or of a sex bias in the size of the cell populations expressing the gene&quot; (van der Bijl and Mank, 2021). This statement suggests that sexual dimorphism can result from unbiased expression changes if sex-biased expression or sexual dimorphism already exist in the background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 100 &quot;Under the hypotheses that sex-related adaptation drives SBGE, we expect that sex-biased genes show elevated rates of amino acid substitution and faster rates of expression divergence between species (Grath and Parsch, 2016; Hollis et al., 2014; Immonen et al., 2014; Pointer et al., 2013; Simmons et al., 2020). Tests of such predictions have provided evidence consistent with this idea in many animals (Ellegren and Parsch, 2007; Grath and Parsch, 2016; Harrison et al., 2015).&quot;</p><p>No, this is not true. Rapid rates of evolution for sex-biased genes has been recently shown in many animals to result from non-adaptive processes. For example, Harrison et al. (2015) concluded high dN/dS is due to relaxed constraint, and was more consistent with non-adaptive change. Moreover, Gershoni and Pietrokovski 2014, Nature Communications showed that many non-synonymous changes in male-biased genes in humans are mildly deleterious. Overall, where adaptive and non-adaptive scenarios have been tested separately in sex-biased genes in animals, the majority of examples are consistent with sex-bias causing a shift in the mutation-selection equilibrium (Dapper and Wade 2016 Evolution). In essence, genes that are effectively sex-limited in expression experience the mutational input from both sexes, but are only selected in one sex. This can give a false signal of positive selection for studies using more standard assumptions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insight; we certainly do not wish to mis-represent previous studies. This paragraph was re-written with particular emphasis on the common conclusion that non-adaptive processes are, in many cases, more consistent with patterns of molecular evolution in sex-biased genes. We incorporated the references suggested by the reviewer, replacing Gershoni and Pietrokovski (2014) with a more comprehensive analysis by the same authors from 2017. Similar statements in our manuscript were also revised to avoid any misleading statements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Line 135. How is the number of SBGs in leaf surprising? What are the numbers from other studies? Reading Darolti et al. (2018, Molecular Ecology), they used lower fold-change thresholds and only identified seven sex-biased genes in willow leaf. Are there other studies in plants that make the number observed in this paper surprisingly low? Numbers from animal somatic tissues are in this range as well – for example, Harrison et al. found just one female-biased gene using similar fold-change thresholds in the spleen, and no male-biased genes. Based on this, I would suggest the title for this section is somewhat misleading, as perhaps there are someone more SBGs than expected based on studies in comparable tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the title of this section to &quot;Levels of SBGE in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> leaves span the entire range observed in other dioecious plants&quot;. We also now refer to the single sex-biased gene in bird spleen, and explain that the contrast between animals and plants is that the former sometimes, but not always, may show much higher SBGE in non-reproductive tissue, depending on the tissue (Naqvi et al. 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 216. This bit illustrates how the comparison to Harrison et al. (2015) seems unnecessarily contradictory. Yes, it is true that in Harrison et al. gonad samples clustered first by sex, then by species, but they also reported that when they clustered expression of spleen data, it clustered by species, then sex, just like the study in review here. This underlines the fact that the leaf tissue in question here is comparable to animal somatic tissue, not gonad. The authors need to be very careful and not over-emphasize differences that are in fact entirely concordant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased this section for clarity, and we have attempted throughout the manuscript to avoid claims and statements of contradiction between our paper and Harrison et al.'s study. Yes, leaf tissue is more comparable to animal somatic tissue than to animal gonads – but we do not think that this fact invalidates a comparison between the two studies. We expect that transcriptomes of any tissue, be they reproductive or non-reproductive, could in principle respond to sex-specific selection in a way similar to morphology (i.e., both may evolve sexual dimorphism). Of course, it is more plausible that gonads or inflorescences are affected by sex-specific selection than non-reproductive tissues (wattles, feathers, leaves, etc), but they are not expected to be the exclusive targets. In our understanding, the central point of Harrison et al's argument is that SBGE in gonads reflects the intensity of sexual selection because it correlates positively with known phenotypic indicators of sexual selection. We hypothesised that SBGE in leaf transcriptomes could correlate positively with leaf sexual dimorphism. Unfortunately, the link between vegetative sexual dimorphism and sex-specific selection in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> (and in plants in general) is not as well investigated and accepted as the link between sexual dimorphism and sexual selection in birds, but sex-specific selection remains the most plausible explanation for differences in leaf size. We found that there is no such correlation as in the birds, and this means, as we point out in the Conclusion, that in <italic>Leucadendron</italic> leaves, gene expression and morphology are not driven by the same selection pressures, or they do not respond to it similarly. We believe that the amended Introduction clarifies the role that sexual selection (or simply different selection on males and females) has probably played in the evolution of the strikingly different leaf morphology between the sexes in <italic>Leucadendron</italic>.</p><p>We agree that our result, that samples of plant leaf gene expression cluster by species before sex, is concordant with Harrison et al.'s result for spleen, and other reports from animal somatic tissues. In the previous version of the manuscript, we simply wished to point out that there is a notable difference in this clustering analysis between animal gonads and animal somatic tissue, but have now removed that confusing sentence as it is not essential here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Delta-X comparison. It is important to differentiate increases from decreases in expression in delta- comparisons, because the loss (or very low expression and functional loss) of expression for a gene is expected under completely relaxed selection, and this would give a signature of positive selection under Delta-X (large change, little variation).</p></disp-quote><p>We report that expression changes (shifts) towards sex-bias are depleted in signatures of adaptation (high delta-x) relative to unbiased changes. The reviewer suggests that we may falsely infer adaptive expression shifts (i.e., high delta-x) for genes that have nearly or completely lost expression, because such genes would have high delta-x values, even if the loss of expression was due to completely relaxed selection. It is not clear how this bias would impact our finding, because in principle it should affect both sex-biased and unbiased changes similarly.</p><p>To investigate this further, we partitioned the increases and decreases, asking whether the pattern of depletion of high-delta-x among changes towards sex-bias is observed in both directions of change. These results are presented in detail as a new section of Appendix 2: &quot;Robustness of inference of the proportion of adaptive shifts in gene expression (delta-x)&quot;. We found that the depletion of high-delta-x is more pronounced among expression decreases, but the trend is consistent among both increases and decreases in expression. Therefore, we believe it is justified not to distinguish decreases and increases in this case, and we have not changed the main text results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the way the authors have set up their Delta-X measure (similar to the Ometto et al. 2011 formula) will result in a conflation between highly-expressed genes and high Delta-X. This is a problem in the formulation used in the Ometto et al. (2011) analysis, and why Moghadam et al. (2012) used a somewhat more complicated formula which corrects for expression level. If the authors would like to use this formula for gene expression evolution, they should make sure that there is no relationship between expression level and Delta-X value.</p></disp-quote><p>We investigated whether this could be a problem in our data with absolute delta-X values (i.e., not distinguishing expression decreases and increases). Indeed, we find a slight positive correlation (Spearman's rho ~0.12) between mean expression level and our version of delta-x, and this is nearly the same with Moghadam's version of delta-x if applied to our data. However, if using Ometto's version, we find a much stronger correlation (rho = 0.62), as implied by the reviewer. Below are all three formulas, simplified to omit the sample size correction factors used by Moghadam et al. and Ometto et al:</p><p>Zemp / this study:<disp-formula id="sa2equ1"><mml:math

(2012) divide both the numerator (divergence) as well as the denominator (diversity) by the mean expression level. As these terms cancel out, our formula and that of Moghadam are the same except that our diversity measure (denominator) is the standard deviation (SD) and not the sample range. Sample range as well as sample standard deviation are generally strongly positively correlated to sample mean. Therefore, we think that neither our formula nor that of Moghadam conflates high expression and high delta-X, but Ometto's formula clearly does. The key difference between our formula and that of Ometto is that for their denominator, Ometto chose the sample standard deviation divided by the sample mean (the coefficient of variation, or relative standard deviation). We and Moghadam use just the simple standard deviation or the range, respectively, which preserve the scale, allowing to &quot;correct&quot; for the scale (i.e., the mean expression level). We hope to have shown convincingly that our formula and that of Moghadam for delta-x are equivalent in regard to correction for the scale (mean expression), and we have made no changes to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Table 1. I am unsure how the authors reached some of these predictions. For example, I do not understand why adaptive evolution would result in greater sequence and expression evolution than non-adaptive scenarios. One could hypothesize that very few codon changes would be adaptive, leading to lower dN/dS than relaxed constraint. Similarly, if gene expression is under selection, small changes might be expected under adaptive scenarios while relaxed constraint could lead to large changes with no effect. Similarly, dN/dS would be expected to be very high in genes under relaxed constraint, and likely higher than adaptive selection. The delta-X prediction would only be true for genes experiencing increased expression, the opposite is true to decreased expression – see my comment about Delta-X above.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed this table, as suggested by the editor, and explain our now better informed hypotheses in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Why was the sequence polymorphism analysis not done on all species? This bit should also be discussed more thoroughly in the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>The power of the polyDFE method is dependent on the size of the site frequency spectra used as input. The smallest dataset considered by Tataru et al. (2019, <italic>Bioinformatics</italic>) had 0.89 Mbp, and already yielded substantially greater variation in the estimated parameters than their typical datasets with &gt;&gt; 1 Mbp. Among our sample of species, <italic>L. dubium</italic> contained the highest number of SBGs (about 140 of male- respectively female-biased genes), and these SBGs yielded site frequency spectra (SFS) with sizes between 32-73 kb, while the site frequency spectrum of unbiased genes was about 6 Mb long. Confidence Intervals (CIs) for unbiased genes (about 6 Mbp of data) spanned about 5-10% of the potential parameter space, whereas the CIs for the same parameters for SBGs spanned on average 30%, and up to 77%, of the potential parameter space (see the new DFE Figure, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We thus report these results with a note of caution. Given this suboptimal analysis for the species with the greatest number of SBGs (largest SFS datasets), we refrained from repeating it in other species, which contained far fewer SBGs (about 100 at most). However, for comparison we have added an estimation of the DFE of the roughly 280 <italic>L. dubium</italic> SBGs in a second species, <italic>L. ericifolium</italic>. This provided new insights, although caution is again advised due to the great uncertainties.</p><p>We have added the following sentence to our Conclusion: &quot;Standing population genetic variation in one species in our sample hints at the possibility that the gain of female-biased expression is associated with a relaxation of purifying selection.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
