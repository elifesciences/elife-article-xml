Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents 15–20% of all breast cancer cases and exhibits a more aggressive phenotype (with a poorer prognosis) than non-TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foulkes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malorni et al., 2012</xref>). Due to the absence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), or progesterone receptor (PR) expression, TNBC lacks effective targeted therapies and treatment regimens. Patients with mTNBC have fewer available treatment options and exhibit worse survival than early-stage TNBC patients. Furthermore, TNBC is a highly heterogeneous disease, resulting in substantial differences in the tumorigenesis, treatment response, and disease progression among patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perou, 2011</xref>), which undoubtedly poses significant challenges in prognostic prediction of the mTNBC and efficacy assessment for already limited treatment options. Unfortunately, reliable and tailored biomarkers to predict the prognosis and monitor the treatment response of patients with TNBC are yet to be established.</p><p>It has been a long-standing clinical management model to predict the prognosis of patients with mTNBC and guide treatment decision-making through imaging examination and mutational features obtained by tumor biopsy. Radiological examination usually only provides the external characterization of the tumor but can not reveal the tumor internal molecular characteristics. Given the heterogeneity of TNBC, it is impossible to obtain an accurate and comprehensive picture of the mutational landscape using tissue biopsies unless repeated multiple biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diaz and Bardelli, 2014</xref>), and most patients are refractory to repetitive punctures.</p><p>Compared with tissue biopsies, ‘liquid biopsies’ collect and analyze tumor-derived substances, such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and exosomes (e.g. from the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine) of cancer patients in a minimally invasive fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alix-Panabières and Pantel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Palmirotta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poulet et al., 2019</xref>). It can be used for early diagnosis of tumor patients, predicting tumor recurrence and metastasis, and evaluating the characteristics and clonal evolution of tumor genomes. ctDNA is a specific fraction of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) present in the plasma of apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swarup and Rajeswari, 2007</xref>). Owing to particular biological origin and the potential for multiple repeat sampling, ctDNA is independent of tumor spatial and temporal heterogeneity, conveys more valuable information than a conventional tumor biopsy, and enables the dynamic monitoring of tumor burden and treatment response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campos-Carrillo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chae and Oh, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dawson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerratana et al., 2021</xref>). The value of ctDNA in accurately predicting drug resistance and clinical outcomes has also been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asante et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murtaza et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated the prognostic and predictive value of ctDNA for non-mTNBC during or after (neo)adjuvant therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavallone et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ortolan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Riva et al., 2017</xref>). Previously, researchers have also been relatively circumscribed, concentrated on evaluating specific copy number variants (CNVs) or ctDNA-based single mutation or clonal evolution or the ctDNA level to predict the prognosis of mTNBC patients and the efficacy of particular treatment regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barroso-Sousa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chopra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stover et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wongchenko et al., 2020</xref>). Even a study showed that the ctDNA level had no prognostic impact on the survival of patients with mTNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Madic et al., 2015</xref>). A more comprehensive study of the mutational information and related markers embodied in ctDNA as well as a consensus on the predictive role of ctDNA in mTNBC are needed to apply ctDNA in clinical practice.</p><p>Hence, in this study, we investigated the mutational characteristics of ctDNA and ctDNA-related markers in mTNBC using targeted, capture-based, next-generation sequencing (NGS), which offers rapid identification and high coverage from a small blood sample. We aimed to dynamically and more comprehensively evaluate the value of ctDNA in predicting the prognosis and monitoring the treatment response of patients with mTNBC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a prospective, single-center, observational study.

Efficacy was evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. The endpoint observed in this study was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time interval between patient enrollment and confirmation of disease progression using CT/MRI scans or death from any cause. After enrollment, baseline characteristics of patients and chemotherapy-based treatment options jointly determined by the clinician and patient were recorded. Peripheral blood samples, hematological data of tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), and cancer antigen 153 (CA153), as well as the number and size of measurable lesions on CT/MRI were collected at the time of patient enrollment and each radiological examination for efficacy evaluation until the patients reached the endpoint of the study. During the investigation, we liaised with the patients and patients' physicians when patients revisited the hospital every time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sample collection and preparation</title><p>A 10 mL sample of peripheral blood was collected into an EDTA anticoagulant tube (STRECK Cell-Free DNA BCT) from patients at different time points (i.e. before treatment, during treatment [treatment cycle 3, day 1], and at progression). Within 2 hr of collection, blood samples were centrifuged at 1600×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C to obtain plasma, followed by secondary centrifugation at 16,000×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C to obtain peripheral blood cells. Plasma and peripheral blood cells were stored at −80°C until ctDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) were extracted. Paraffin-embedded primary or metastatic tumor tissues were collected before treatment and stored at room temperature for later use.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DNA extraction and targeted capture-based NGS</title><p>ctDNA was extracted from peripheral blood using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Germany), while tumor DNA (tDNA) was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tumor tissues using the AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit (50) (Qiagen, Germany). Standard control gDNA was extracted from white blood cells using the DNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequencing library was prepared from the ctDNA and tDNA samples using the KAPA DNA Library Preparation Kit (KAPA Biosystems, USA), while the gDNA sequencing library was constructed using the Illumina TruSeq DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA). Library concentration was determined using real-time quantitative PCR and the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems, USA). The library fragments were then size-selected using agarose gel electrophoresis. A targeted NGS panel of 457 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), known to be frequently mutated in tumors, was designed to capture the target DNA fragments. All of the individuals were sequenced at a depth of at least 20,000 X. Sequencing libraries were loaded onto a NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, USA) with a 150 bp read length in paired-end mode.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sequencing data analysis</title><p>Quality control of the raw sequencing data involved using FASTP to trim adapters and remove low-quality sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). The clean reads were aligned against the Ensemble GRCh37/hg19 reference genome using BWA software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). PCR duplications were processed using the Gencore tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), and generated uniquely mapped reads. The SAMtools suite was used to detect single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions, and deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2009</xref>). CNVs were called using CONTRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2012</xref>), with copy number ˃ 3 as the threshold of copy number gain and &lt;1 as the threshold of copy number loss. The maximal tumor somatic variant allelic frequency (max-VAF) describes the highest mutated frequency of ctDNA detected in the cfDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maron et al., 2019</xref>). The ctDNA fraction (ctDNA%) was calculated based on the autosomal somatic allele fractions. The mutant allele fraction (MAF) and ctDNA% are related as follows: MAF = (ctDNA ×1)/([(1 – ctDNA)×2] + [ctDNA ×1]); thus, ctDNA = 2/(1/MAF +1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vandekerkhove et al., 2017</xref>). The mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) score was calculated as the percentage ratio of the width (median absolute deviation [MAD] scaled by a constant factor so that the expected MAD of a sample from a normal distribution equals the standard deviation) to the center of the distribution of MAFs among the tumor-specific mutated loci; thus, MATH = 100 × MAD/median (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mroz and Rocco, 2013</xref>). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was defined as the number of non-synonymous somatic mutations per megabase of genome examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chalmers et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The longest diameter (mm) of the tumor was measured by examining the radiological images.

The Kaplan–Meier method was used for the survival analyses; the comparison of the median PFS was performed using the log-rank test and hazard ratios (HRs) from the Cox proportional hazards model. The optimal cut-off values for ctDNA%, MATH score, and TMB were determined by the R package ‘survminer’. Univariate Cox regression was carried out to analyze the mutations related to PFS; only genes mutated in &gt;5% of the patients were included in the analysis. The correlation between variables was analyzed using the Spearman correlation test, and group comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

Fifty-six patients were excluded, comprising 21 patients who had previously been treated with more than two lines of chemotherapy, 16 patients who were treated with combination local therapy (e.g. chemotherapy with radiotherapy), 11 patients who were lost to follow-up, and 8 patients who failed to be evaluated for efficacy. Finally, 139 plasma samples (baseline samples from 70 patients and dynamic samples from 38/70 patients) from 70 patients and paired tumor tissues from 13 patients were collected and sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Some patients did not have surgery, or were operated on in other hospitals, or had no lesion suitable for biopsy, or the tumor tissue was too small, resulting in 57 patients not obtaining tumor tissue for sequencing. The blood samples during treatment were not collected on time, or the quality control of samples was unqualified or did not reach the endpoint of the study, resulting in 32 patients only having baseline blood samples. The patient baseline characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. The median age of all patients was 46 (26–75) years.

Meanwhile, patients with a higher MATH score (≥6.316) had significantly shorter mPFS than patients with a lower MATH score (&lt;6.316) (5.67 months <italic>vs</italic>.11.27 months, p=0.007; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, the higher ctDNA% (≥0.05) patient group had a significantly shorter mPFS than the lower ctDNA% (&lt;0.05) group (5.45 months <italic>vs.</italic> 12.17 months, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Patients with mTNBC were categorized into the PD, SD, PR, and CR groups according to their response to treatment. Further comparative analysis of baseline ctDNA parameters in different treatment response groups revealed that TMB was progressively lower across the four groups, showing a decreasing trend from the PD group to the CR group. Compared with other treatment response groups, the PD group had a larger TMB (p=0.032), greater MATH score (p=0.003), and higher ctDNA% (p=0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The baseline-ctDNA-derived TMB, MATH score, and ctDNA% were associated with the clinical outcomes of patients with mTNBC.</title><p>Higher TMB (≥2.63) (<bold>A</bold>), MATH score (≥6.316) (<bold>B</bold>), and ctDNA% (≥0.05) (<bold>C</bold>) were linked to a shorter PFS.

CA125 levels varied in line with treatment response and disease progression, but no similar fluctuations were observed in CA153 and CEA. Compared with these traditional tumor markers used in clinical for a long time, dynamic changes in ctDNA mutations seemed to mirror treatment-induced changes in tumor size better. Therefore, we analyzed the correlation between the levels of serum tumor markers and tumor size on CT/MRI scans during treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We found that tumor size positively correlated with the MATH score (<italic>R</italic>=0.24, p=0.014) and ctDNA% (<italic>R</italic>=0.3, p=0.002) but not CEA, CA125, or CA153 levels.

In recent years, ctDNA has become the focus of extensive research as a predictive biomarker of tumor progression and treatment response. Several studies have explored the promising applications of ctDNA in breast cancer. For example, some researchers have investigated the longitudinal dynamics of ctDNA in the treatment monitoring of metastatic breast cancer, while others have studied the prognostic and predictive value of ctDNA during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavallone et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerratana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ortolan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Riva et al., 2017</xref>). However, the application of ctDNA in monitoring mTNBC is rare in clinical practice.</p><p>In the current study, we performed targeted, capture-based NGS (with a 457-gene panel) on 139 plasma samples obtained by liquid biopsy from 70 patients with mTNBC. Thirteen paired tumor tissues were also analyzed to verify if ctDNA could be a feasible alternative to tumor-tissue-derived tDNA. This study demonstrated how a ctDNA-based platform could reliably reveal mutational profiles, stably predict the prognosis, and consistently monitor the treatment response of patients with mTNBC. This study also resolved the uncertainty of some current studies regarding the value of ctDNA and provided clear ctDNA-related predictive markers for mTNBC patients. By evaluating the mutational landscape of mTNBC in the Chinese population using ctDNA analysis, we showed that the most frequently mutated genes were <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>ARID1A</italic>, and <italic>KMT2C</italic>, and the most frequent CNV was detected in <italic>HLA-C</italic>, <italic>HLA-A</italic>, <italic>HLA-B</italic>, and <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These genes play significant roles in breast cancer tumorigenesis, progression, invasion, and metastasis. In the homogeneous population, the most common mutations detected in tumor tissue were <italic>TP53</italic>, followed by <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>KMT2C</italic>, and <italic>PTEN</italic>; however, the top-ranking CNVs were found in different genes to those identified in a previous report: <italic>E2F3</italic>, <italic>IRS2</italic>, <italic>CCNE1</italic>, <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>NFIB</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, and <italic>MYB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). This difference may be due to the fact that the plasma-derived ctDNA contains smaller fragments than those that are typically found in tissue-derived tDNA. Meanwhile, compared with the results of other ctDNA identification studies, the distribution of frequent variants in the TNBC cohort was overall consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). In the study by Chae et al., the concordance between all ctDNA- and tDNA-derived genes was also similar to that in our study (91.0%–94.2% <italic>vs</italic>. 98.75%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chae et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The authors reported that the ctDNA-based assay had a high specificity, with a diagnostic accuracy of up to 80%. Although the mutation frequency of tDNA was higher than that of ctDNA in our study, the number of mutations detected in both types of DNA was similar. In addition, we detected 37 specific mutations in each of the ctDNA and tDNA groups, demonstrating the complementarity of blood-derived ctDNA and tissue-derived tDNA. Moreover, compared with tumor tissue analysis, ctDNA assays only require a small blood sample, can capture a variety of mutations (including SNVs and CNVs), and provide information on spatial tumor heterogeneity.</p><p>Using NGS, we identified 12 prognosis-relevant mutated genes associated with the shorter PFS of patients with mTNBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Most of the 12 genes have been linked to breast cancer by previous studies. For instance, the aberrant expression of <italic>KMT2C</italic> (low expression) and <italic>ARID4B</italic> (high expression) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with ER-positive breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sato and Akimoto, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). However, previous studies have shown that the upregulated expression of <italic>BTG2</italic> and <italic>CD22</italic> were associated with improved survival, which is not in agreement with our current findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mascia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>); this may be due to the low number of patients included in this study. <italic>TGFB1</italic>, <italic>SGK1</italic>, <italic>RSPO2,</italic> and <italic>MCL1</italic> are implicated in the invasion, migration, growth, autophagy, and progression of TNBC, while <italic>RSPO2</italic> and <italic>MCL1</italic> overexpression is associated with shorter survival rates in patients with TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coussy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>As a common driver of breast cancer, <italic>MYC</italic> amplification plays a role in emerging or acquired chemotherapy resistance during neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC. It can also synergize with <italic>MCL1</italic> amplification to maintain chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>HLA-B</italic>, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule, is involved in immunosurveillance against tumors, and its expression is correlated with the invasiveness and prognosis of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Concha et al., 1991</xref>). To date, there have been no reports of an association between <italic>H3F3A</italic> or <italic>KYAT3</italic> and breast cancer. Previously, <italic>H3F3A</italic> was identified as a driver gene in glioma, and its overexpression is linked to shorter survival rates and disease progression in lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Felker and Broniscer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, although the associations between some of the 12 mutated genes identified in our study and cancer are known, their roles in the prognosis of mTNBC need to be further defined.</p><p>We also explored the value of ctDNA status as a biomarker for predicting the prognosis and monitoring the treatment response of patients with mTNBC. We found that a ctDNA +status was associated with a worse treatment response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In addition, we showed that the ctDNA status at baseline could potentially discriminate between mTNBC patients with a high or low lesion load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, ctDNA, as an independent prognostic factor, directly predicted the prognosis of patients without being influenced by other clinical factors of the patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). This indicates that the ctDNA status, associated with the presence of the 12 prognosis-relevant mutated genes, maybe a good guide to the prediction of clinical outcomes and the clinical management of TNBC. We further explored the optimal cut-off values for the ctDNA-based TMB, MATH score, and ctDNA% parameters at baseline using Kaplan–Meier analysis. A high MATH score (≥6.316) and high ctDNA% (≥0.05) were associated with a significantly shorter PFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>) and may therefore be related to the tumor burden of mTNBC. A study reported that most ctDNA fragments originate from metastases and not early-stage cancer, suggesting that ctDNA-based NGS may be more suitable for analyzing metastatic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vandekerkhove et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike ctDNA%, the MATH score represents tumor heterogeneity. A previous study found that TNBC was associated with a higher MATH score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, patients with higher MATH scores tend to have more diverse tumor cell clones and may be more prone to drug resistance and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McDonald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mroz and Rocco, 2013</xref>). Thus, the MATH score could also potentially be used as a biomarker for mTNBC prognosis.</p><p>Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous and dynamic disease; therefore, longitudinal monitoring and management are necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garcia-Murillas et al., 2015</xref>). The predictive value of ctDNA has prompted further exploration of its feasibility in the dynamic monitoring of the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer and in predicting the occurrence of distal metastasis and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavallone et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darrigues et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we monitored ctDNA to track the dynamic changes in the 12 identified prognosis-related genes during the treatment of patients with mTNBC. The results showed that the elimination of these mutations or the reduction in the mutation rate of these genes was often associated with a better treatment response. Conversely, the reappearance of these mutations at a later time or an increase in their mutation rate signaled disease progression. Thus, we showed that ctDNA was sensitive and accurately reflected the treatment response and disease status of patients with mTNBC promptly. Conventional tumor markers have been widely used in clinical cancer management for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anonymous, 1996</xref>). We found that the serum CEA and CA153 levels contradicted the treatment response of Patient 31 at the mid-treatment time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The elevation of conventional tumor markers could indicate tumor changes and be interpreted as an early warning of disease progression or pseudo-progression. However, this pseudo-progression or ‘tumor marker spike’ is caused by extensive neoplastic cell necrosis induced by anti-tumor therapy. This phenomenon is observed in up to 30% of patients who respond to treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seregni et al., 2004</xref>). NGS-mediated ctDNA detection identifies hundreds or thousands of mutations. Even if individual mutations were the result of a ‘ctDNA spike’ (similar to a ‘tumor marker spike’), other mutations could be relied upon to mirror treatment response accurately. Moreover, we observed positive correlations between treatment response, MATH score, and ctDNA%, but not the CEA, CA125, and CA153 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Hence, compared with conventional tumor markers, ctDNA dynamics may better reflect treatment response and progression in mTNBC.</p><p>Several limitations exist in our study. First, this was a single-center study with a small sample size. Second, the relatively short median follow-up duration was insufficient for capturing a clinically significant association between ctDNA mutations and overall survival. Third, several patients were lost to follow-up, which may have biased the results. Fourth, the potential influence of different treatment lines and regimens was not evaluated; nevertheless, no differences were found in survival based on these factors. Finally, compared with whole-exome sequencing or whole-genome sequencing, NGS with a panel of 457 selected genes, as used in our study, provided limited mutation data.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>ctDNA profiling is a good alternative to tumor tissue sequencing and provides valuable insights into the mutational landscape of mTNBC. Furthermore, our study addressed the value of ctDNA in predicting the prognosis and monitoring the treatment response of patients with mTNBC. The results revealed that higher ctDNA%, MATH score, TMB, ctDNA + status, and mutation rate were associated with a poor prognosis and a worse treatment response in mTNBC. Moreover, the longitudinal monitoring of genetic biomarkers in ctDNA was more sensitive and accurate for discerning treatment response or progression than traditional tumor markers such as CEA, CA125, and CA153. Taken together, these findings will contribute to a better understanding of ctDNA in mTNBC and may facilitate the development of a more accurate and non-invasive clinical strategy for managing patients with this condition. However, larger clinical trials are necessary to validate our results.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Affiliated with Berry Oncology Corporation.

As we stated in results and conclusions, ctDNA profiling is a good alternative to tumor tissue sequencing and provides valuable insights into the mutational landscape of mTNBC in clinical settings. Furthermore, our study addressed the value of ctDNA in predicting the prognosis and monitoring the treatment response of patients with mTNBC. The results revealed that higher ctDNA%, MATH score, TMB, ctDNA<sup>+</sup> status, and mutation rate were associated with a poor prognosis and a worse treatment response in mTNBC. Moreover, the longitudinal monitoring of genetic biomarkers in ctDNA was more sensitive and accurate for discerning treatment response or progression than traditional tumor markers such as CEA, CA125, and CA153.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please elaborate the post-treatment follow-up modality.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion.

The detection of ctDNA in the absence of metastasis or recurrent disease indicates molecular evidence of cancer, and have been defined as molecular residual disease (MRD). Several previous studies have reported that plasma ctDNA was detected ahead of clinical or radiologic relapse with a lead time of months or even years in breast cancer patients<sup>1-3</sup>. On the one hand, the PFS of mTNBC tend to be short, and on the other hand, intensive and regular longitudinal ctDNA analyses after treatment were not carried out in this study (only before treatment, during treatment [treatment cycle 3, day 1], and at progression), so it is not possible to determine the specific time of ctDNA before overt recurrence. But our findings suggest that ctDNA<sup>+</sup> patients at baseline tend to have larger tumor sizes and poorer outcomes compared to ctDNA- patients. Moreover, the correlation analysis between dynamic ctDNA and tumor size on radiological scans found that ctDNA-related markers were also positively correlated with larger tumor size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Constructing a model based on ctDNA-related markers and dynamic ctDNA levels, and using test sets to predict prognosis and treatment response would be an interesting idea to further support the clinical utility of ctDNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We gratefully appreciate your comment. In our analysis, we also tried to establish a prognostic and therapeutic prediction model for ctDNA-related markers, unfortunately, the model was not established due to the small sample size. Therefore, in the future, we intend to include more patients with mTNBC to explore the possibility of ctDNA-based prediction model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Here we excluded the patients who were combined with local therapy (e.g., radiotherapy) for tumor. Immunotherapy is a systemic treatment modality and therefore not excluded.

The data was acquired from all the blood samples (n = 139) from 70 patients with different treatment responses (PD, SD, PR, or CR). The treatment response was the best observed during the follow-up. In other similar studies, patients who had ctDNA detected in blood were labeled ctDNA+.But in our study, ctDNA+/− status were redefined: A plasma ctDNA sample with at least one of the 12 prognosis-relevant mutated genes (<italic>HLA-B</italic>, <italic>BTG2</italic>, <italic>MCL1</italic>, <italic>H3F3A</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>KMT2C</italic>, <italic>KYAT3</italic>, <italic>ARID4B</italic>, <italic>CD22</italic>, <italic>TGFB1</italic>, <italic>SGK1</italic>, and <italic>RSPO2</italic>) which screened from 457 tumor-related genes was defined as ctDNA-positive (ctDNA+).

Disease recurrence means that the observational endpoint of the study was reached. The endpoint observed in this study was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time interval between patient enrollment and confirmation of disease progression using CT/MRI scans or death from any cause. It can be seen in Figure 3E, by the end of the study, 90.6% (29/32) of the patients who were ctDNA<sup>+</sup> at baseline relapsed, while 73.6% (28/38) of the ctDNA− patients relapsed. The vertical bars on the survival curve denote 4 ctDNA<sup>+</sup> patients and 10 ctDNA<sup>+</sup> patients, respectively, had not relapsed until the end of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

In Figure 5A-D, we only selected four patients as representatives of four different therapeutic groups, so that readers can intuitively and concretely see the dynamic changes of ctDNA. In order to sufficiently support that the dynamic changes in ctDNA mutation better mirror treatment-induced changes in tumor size than traditional tumor markers, we analyzed the correlation between the dynamic changes of ctDNA-related markers of all patients and the traditional tumor markers such as CEA and tumor size in Figure 5E. Furthermore, changes of ctDNA+/− status based 12 prognosis-relevant mutated genes and survival were analyzed for all patients in Figure 5F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Furthermore, is there any difference between the proportion of relapsed patients who detected all positive ctDNA during the dynamic monitoring with those that detected one positive or two positive?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We also analyzed the possibility you proposed in our analysis, but no statistically significant difference in survival was found. In Figure 5F, patients who remained ctDNA<sup>+</sup> during dynamic monitoring had a shorter PFS than those who did not (3.90 months vs. 6.10 months, <italic>P</italic> = 0.135). However, this difference did not achieve statistical significance, most likely due to the limited sample size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

As only the original cohort is used, an external and independent patient cohort is needed to further validate the predictive value of ctDNA in mTNBC.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Based on the findings of this study, we can use ctDNA-related markers to predict the prognosis and therapeutic efficacy of mTNBC patients, with a sensitivity superior to that of traditional tumor markers (CEA, CA125, and CA153). Subsequently, it can provide more clinically valuable prediction for the treatment effect and prognosis of tumor patients. It provides a more effective and sensitive evaluation method for the treatment effect and prognosis prediction of tumor patients. In order to ensure the success rate of patient specimen collection and facilitate follow-up, we only conducted this study in our hospital. To control for timeliness bias, we included only patients with mTNBC from 2018 to 2021. Unfortunately, there were few patients who met the inclusion criteria in this study within three years, and there was not enough sample size to add an external cohort for verification. We have also noticed this issue. Therefore, it is very necessary to further expand the sample size from multiple centers to verify the results of this study, which will be our next step in preparing for the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Several conclusions in the manuscript are not supported by the data and/or represent conceptual leaps, which must be addressed prior to publication.

The amount of ctDNA<sup>+</sup> was for the entire cohort, while the clinical effect is for a single patient. Therefore, we generally only focus on the relationship between ctDNA status (positive or not) and clinical effect, rather than the amount of ctDNA+. Further, as you assumed, the worse clinical effect, the higher the proportion of ctDNA<sup>+</sup> patients in group (Figure 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

As stated in the title, in this study, we focused on possibility of ctDNA for prediction of treatment efficacy and prognosis in patients with mTNBC receiving chemotherapy.

You and another reviewer gave the same valuable advice. We also attempted to combine ctDNA-related markers with clinical characteristics to establish a prognostic and therapeutic prediction model. Unfortunately, due to small sample sizes the models were not established.

In this study, 32 patients only collected baseline blood samples without collecting dynamic time point blood samples. The main reasons included: (1) Patients neglected to provide post-treatment blood samples on time; (2) The patient has not reached the end of the progression; (3) The blood samples collected were not qualified. Tissue samples were obtained from surgical specimens that trace the patient's primary lesion, which cannot be obtained since most of the patients did not undergo surgery in our hospital. In addition, some patients were first diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and have not undergone surgery, so no tumor tissue can be obtained. Moreover, some patients had no lesions suitable for biopsy, or the tumor tissues were too small for sequencing. In the end, we only obtained tumor tissue samples from 13 patients. We added the explanation in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In the manuscript, the proportion of ctDNA<sup>+</sup> at different time points is different. In Figure 5, how to define the dynamic changes in ctDNA status (i.e., mutations in 12 prognosis-relevant genes)? What is the tendency of dynamic changes in ctDNA status in CPD, SD, PR, and CR groups?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We presented the dynamic changes of 12 prognosis-relevant genes from 4 patients with different therapeutic effects in the graph on the right (Figure 5A-D). The lines with different colors represent detectable mutated genes, the vertical axis represents the copy number or mutation frequency of 12 prognosis-relevant genes, and the horizontal axis represents different time points. The dynamic changes of these 4 patients can respectively represent the characteristics of ctDNA dynamic changes in the PD, SD, PR, and CR groups, summarized as follows: the elimination of these mutations or the reduction in the mutation rate of these genes was often associated with a better treatment response. Conversely, reappearance of these mutations at a later time point or an increase in their mutation rate signaled disease progression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

As we noted in the manuscript, &quot;ctDNA is a specific fraction of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which is present in the plasma of apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells. Owing to special biological origin and the potential for multiple repeat sampling, ctDNA is independent of tumor spatial and temporal heterogeneity, convey more valuable information than a conventional tumor biopsy and enable the dynamic monitoring of tumor burden and treatment response&quot;, therefore, ctDNA reflects a real-time genetic signature of the whole-body tumor including primary or metastatic tumors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. They found that ctDNA<sup>+</sup> patients tended to have a shorter survival duration and less clinical benefit. For each patient, when the tumor progressed, did they find an increase of ctDNA positive rates?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Our study found that the elimination of 12 prognosis-relevant genes mutations or the reduction in the mutation rate of these genes was often associated with a better treatment response. Conversely, reappearance of these mutations at a later time point or an increase in their mutation rate signaled disease progression not ctDNA positive rates. ctDNA positive rates in this study indicates the proportion of ctDNA<sup>+</sup> patients among the whole cohort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. More details should be included in the Methods section. For example, they stated that &quot;Between 2018 and 2021, patients with mTNBC who had progressed after {less than or equal to} 2 lines of chemotherapy were prospectively enrolled.&quot;. Which center were these patients from? What are the inclusion and exclusion criteria?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. All patients were enrolled at Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute between 2018 and 2021.The inclusion and exclusion criteria have added in Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The title of this study is &quot;Dynamic Analysis of Circulating Tumor DNA to Predict the Prognosis and Monitor the Treatment Response of Patients with Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer: a prospective study&quot;. Therefore, all patients are stage IV. Why did they include &quot;Disease stage at initial diagnosis&quot; in Table 1?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Although all the patients included in this study were mTNBC patients, some patients were initially diagnosed as non-metastatic triple negative breast cancer, just had progressed to advanced stage when they were enrolled, while some patients are diagnosed with mTNBC at the first time. We considered the impact of disease-free interval (DFI) on prognosis in multi-factor analysis, so it is necessary to check the disease stage at initial diagnosis of patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. What is the correlation between &quot;ctDNA%&quot; and &quot;ctDNA+&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. The calculation of the ctDNA fraction (ctDNA%) was based on the autosomal somatic allele fractions and is defined as the proportion of ctDNA in cfDNA. ctDNA was collected and evaluated at different time points and a plasma ctDNA sample with at least one of the 12 prognosis-relevant mutated genes (<italic>HLA-B</italic>, <italic>BTG2</italic>, <italic>MCL1</italic>, <italic>H3F3A</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>KMT2C</italic>, <italic>KYAT3</italic>, <italic>ARID4B</italic>, <italic>CD22</italic>, <italic>TGFB1</italic>, <italic>SGK1</italic>, and <italic>RSPO2</italic>) which screened from 457 tumor-related genes was defined as ctDNA-positive (ctDNA+).Therefore, there is no direct relationship between ctDNA% and ctDNA+.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
