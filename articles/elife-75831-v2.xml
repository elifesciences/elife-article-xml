Here, we address the role of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) member DBL-1 in regulating signature host defense responses in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to human opportunistic Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Canonical DBL-1 signaling is required to suppress avoidance behavior in response to Gram-negative, but not Gram-positive bacteria. We propose that in the absence of DBL-1, animals perceive some bacteria as more harmful. Animals activate DBL-1 pathway activity in response to Gram-negative bacteria and strongly repress it in response to select Gram-positive bacteria, demonstrating bacteria-responsive regulation of DBL-1 signaling. DBL-1 signaling differentially regulates expression of target innate immunity genes depending on the bacterial exposure. These findings highlight a central role for TGF-β in tailoring a suite of bacteria-specific host defenses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>host response</kwd><kwd>dbl-1</kwd><kwd>TGF-β</kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Smad</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006955</institution-id><institution>Office of Extramural Research, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM097591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gumienny</surname><given-names>Tina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jane Nelson Institute for Women's Leadership</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>internal grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gumienny</surname><given-names>Tina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018510</institution-id><institution>Texas Woman's University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TWU Research Enhancement Program (faculty grant)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gumienny</surname><given-names>Tina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018510</institution-id><institution>Texas Woman's University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TWU Experiential Learning Scholar Award (student funding)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Madhu</surname><given-names>Bhoomi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> canonical DBL1/TGFβ signaling pathway is not only regulated in response to bacterial challenges, but also appropriately tailors behaviors and molecular immune responses to bacterial challenges, and animals lacking DBL1 respond to specific bacteria as more harmful.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organisms recognize and respond to potential environmental insults by coordinating protective defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Medzhitov and Janeway, 1998</xref>).

These pathways regulate an overlapping set of target defense genes, indicative of coordinated crosstalk between these signaling pathways. The roles of MAPK and insulin-like signaling pathways in immune responses to a wide variety of bacteria are well characterized. While the role of DBL-1 in defending nematodes from a few strongly pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria is reported, its role in protection against Gram-positive bacteria has not been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mallo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang and Zhang, 2012</xref>).

Using behavioral and molecular approaches, we identified DBL-1-dependent and -independent defense responses that are tailored to the specific bacterial exposure. In addition, we showed that DBL-1 signaling is induced in response to Gram-negative bacteria but is repressed in response to Gram-positive bacteria. We propose that animals lacking DBL-1 signaling respond with heightened avoidance behaviors and reduced feeding to selected bacterial environments because they perceive the environment as more hostile. Collectively, our findings highlight a central role for DBL-1 in regulating a suite of bacteria-specific host defenses and also demonstrate bacteria-responsive regulation of DBL-1 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of DBL-1 reduces lifespan of animals fed on specific bacteria</title><p>To study the role of DBL-1 in specific host responses to bacteria at behavioral, molecular, and physiological levels, we first established a panel of bacteria that would facilitate genetic and molecular studies over time: previous studies have been limited in range of challenge and used pathogens that killed animals in hours or a few days. The control bacteria chosen was Gram-negative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> OP50, a commonly used strain for laboratory culture of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The panel of test bacteria comprised Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria that are opportunistic pathogens in humans and are found in the natural habitat of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samuel et al., 2016</xref>). We selected three Gram-negative test strains, <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> (D1), <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> (ATCC 49141), and <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca</italic> (ATCC 49131), and three Gram-positive test strains, <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic> (ATCC 14581), <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (ATCC 51299), and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (ATCC 49134).</p><p>We first asked if these bacteria alter lifespan of wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic>. While pathogenic bacteria can reduce <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan, other microbial diets can extend lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stuhr and Curran, 2020</xref>). We noted an extended lifespan of wild-type animals on two Gram-negative bacteria (<italic>E. cloacae</italic> and <italic>K. oxytoca</italic>, by 4 d and 2 d, respectively). However, we found that wild-type animals on Gram-negative <italic>S. marcescens</italic> have lifespans comparable to <italic>E. coli</italic>-fed animals. Interestingly, we observed an extended lifespan of wild-type animals on all three Gram-positive bacteria (<italic>B. megaterium</italic>, <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Loss of DBL-1 has previously been shown to reduce lifespan of animals exposed to fungus <italic>Drechmeria coniospora</italic>, Gram-negative strains <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db11, and Gram-positive <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mallo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zugasti and Ewbank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tenor and Aballay, 2008</xref>). The reduced lifespan of animals lacking DBL-1 on <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 was not observed when animals were grown on 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR), which blocks DNA synthesis of both bacteria and the nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mallo et al., 2002</xref>). It has also been shown that DBL-1 is required for the probiotic <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. Lb21-mediated lifespan extension of <italic>C. elegans</italic> subjected to pathogenic methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mørch et al., 2021</xref>). To determine if DBL-1 is required in maintaining lifespan of animals subjected to our bacterial panel, we compared lifespans of <italic>dbl-1(-)</italic> and wild-type animals exposed to the control or test bacteria on plates containing FUdR. Loss of DBL-1 did not alter lifespan of animals fed on plates containing <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 and FUdR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mallo et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>dbl-1</italic> mutant animals did not have the lifespan extension seen in wild-type populations on <italic>E. cloacae</italic> or <italic>K. oxytoca</italic>: lifespans of <italic>dbl-1</italic> mutant populations were the same on these two Gram-negative bacteria as on <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, loss of DBL-1 resulted in a significantly shortened lifespan on <italic>S. marcescens</italic> compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> control bacteria, unlike the wild-type (by 6 d, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This reduced lifespan of <italic>dbl-1(-)</italic> animals was significantly lower than that of wild-type animals fed on <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, which is consistent with a previous report that used the more virulent <italic>S. marcescens</italic> strain Db11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mallo et al., 2002</xref>).

Understanding how hosts respond to different bacteria is important for developing therapeutic strategies to help fight infections and prevent diseases. Our work expands the current understanding of how the model organism <italic>C. elegans</italic> integrates an arsenal of responses—from the molecular to the organismal—to different bacteria, and identifies roles for the DBL-1/TGF-β pathway in robust host-specific responses to different types of bacteria. For this work, we established a panel of human opportunistic pathogens, including three Gram-negative and three Gram-positive strains, for the study of long-term protective responses in the roundworm <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The bacteria and conditions we used elicit unique host response patterns that allowed us to interrogate the role of the DBL-1 pathway in responding to different bacterial exposures. Our work indicates that the choice of test bacteria is crucial in determining involvement of signaling pathways in host defenses because different host responses are elicited by different bacteria. While DBL-1 has a known role in transcriptionally regulating innate immune gene expression, we show that the specific defense responses mediated by DBL-1 are not only molecular but are also behavioral.</p><p>Our results support a model that the DBL-1 signaling pathway influences the organisms’ perception of bacterial threat and helps keep the host defenses in check. Animals with reduced DBL-1 signaling—whether by downregulating signaling or by mutation—may perceive many environments (even standard lab conditions) as more threatening. Animals lacking DBL-1 also display a reduced lifespan in response to the Gram-negative bacteria that are sensed to be more harmful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These animals also mildly reduce intake of select Gram-negative bacteria, another way to reduce animals’ interaction with the potential threat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). DBL-1 pathway mutants display an outsized avoidance response to the Gram-negative bacteria in the test panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). There is also a correlation between the reduced feeding and extension of lifespan observed in animals exposed to select bacteria. Notably, loss of DBL-1 did not result in an avoidance response to Gram-positive bacteria in the panel. However, we suspect that because exposure to the Gram-positive bacteria reduced DBL-1 signaling activity, the avoidance response did not alter dramatically in animals lacking DBL-1. The intake of the Gram-positive bacteria was reduced in wild-type populations which was further reduced in <italic>dbl-1(-)</italic> populations. While the reduced feeding observed in wild-type animals fed Gram-positive bacteria correlated with their extended lifespan, it did not correlate completely with the lifespan of <italic>dbl-1(-)</italic> populations. Lifespan of <italic>dbl-1(-)</italic> populations on the tested Gram-positive bacteria was shorter than the wild-type populations. Neither damage to the intestine nor bacterial colonization was the underlying cause for the DBL-1-mediated lifespan alterations in response to the tested bacteria.</p><p>Determining how DBL-1 is involved in such behavioral modifications, especially avoidance behavior, in response to different bacteria warrants future investigation. It will be of interest to determine the bacterial cues that are responsible for eliciting DBL-1-mediated avoidance behavior. A previous study has reported that animals respond to and avoid a biosurfactant, serrawettin W2, produced by <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, using the AWB chemosensory neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pradel et al., 2007</xref>). It will also be of interest to determine the neuronal pathways involved in processing these sensory cues into organismal responses. DBL-1 is required for inhibiting avoidance behavior and for aversive learning, but the cells involved in both DBL-1 secretion and reception are different for these two behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang and Zhang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olofsson, 2014</xref>). ASH and ASI chemosensory neurons control innate immune responses and ASI promotes pathogen avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2017</xref>). DBL-1 secreted from the AVA interneurons activates DBL-1 signaling in the hypodermis to regulate aversive learning upon exposure to Gram-negative <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang and Zhang, 2012</xref>). The AWB, ASH, and ASI sensory neurons are connected to the AVA interneuron through other sensory neurons and interneurons, suggesting possible neuronal circuits that mediate DBL-1-dependent avoidance responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In addition, could the DBL-1 pathway be interacting with other molecular regulators to respond to bacterial cues? A genetic interaction was identified between the DBL-1 pathway and the DAF-7/TGF-β-like pathway in the context of dauering, a developmental response to reproductively adverse environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishna et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maduzia et al., 2005</xref>). DAF-7 also contributes to the perception of and avoidance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singh and Aballay, 2019</xref>). Future work will determine if DBL-1 affects avoidance behavior by repressing DAF-7 signaling. Another possibility is that DBL-1 signaling responds to physiological changes caused by bacteria; distension of the intestinal lumen by bacterial colonization has been shown to elicit avoidance behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singh and Aballay, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Filipowicz et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Another finding of this work is the requirement of the Smad machinery to mediate specific avoidance responses to our panel of bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Olofsson previously showed that loss of DBL-1, SMA-2, or SMA-4 increases avoidance of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olofsson, 2014</xref>). While some of our results with <italic>sma-4</italic> are similar to theirs, we did not observe a robust avoidance of <italic>E. coli</italic> upon loss of DBL-1 or SMA-2, which may be caused by differences in growth conditions. However, our work demonstrates that canonical DBL-1 signaling strongly suppresses avoidance to Gram-negative bacteria, but not to Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, mild DBL-1-independent induction of <italic>sma-4</italic> expression in response to Gram-positive bacterial conditions was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Lastly, the SMAD reporter expression is not completely lost in animals lacking DBL-1 upon exposure to test Gram-negative bacteria, which also provides evidence for Smad activation by a signaling pathway other than DBL-1. These results suggest that SMA-4 maybe recruited for molecular defenses by something other than DBL-1. Interestingly, ATF-7, a transcription factor activated by PMK-1/MAPK, is required for downregulation of <italic>sma-4</italic>—but not other DBL-1 pathway component genes—in wild-type animals exposed to Gram-negative <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PA14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fletcher et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, SMA-4 is predicted to genetically interact with PMK-1/MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhong and Sternberg, 2006</xref>). It will be of interest to determine if MAPK signaling or another innate immune pathway affects Smad signaling.</p><p>DBL-1 signaling is also important for coordinating molecular responses to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Additionally, we also discovered that DBL-1 signaling itself is altered in response to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Regulation of DBL-1 signaling is part of the host’s molecular response: the Gram-negative bacteria of our panel induced DBL-1 signaling while the Gram-positive bacteria repressed DBL-1 signaling. However, within these two bacterial groups, the host responses were tailored to the specific bacterial challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our results implicate DBL-1 signaling as an important part of the molecular antimicrobial ‘fingerprint’ proposed by the Schwartz lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alper et al., 2007</xref>). Our RNA-sequencing analyses indicate both common and unique transcriptome-wide alterations mediated by DBL-1 in adult animals after 2 d of exposure to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We find that DBL-1 signaling is involved in activating as well as repressing innate immunity genes to maintain a balance of host immune responses (to possibly avoid overactivation of host immune responses). Some genes identified in the RNA-seq analysis and used in the reporter studies have previously been shown to be targets of other innate immune response pathways, suggesting that these genes are regulated by multiple molecular signaling pathways, possibly in a context-dependent manner. Our reporter studies highlight DBL-1-responsive and DBL-1-independent target genes that are differentially regulated depending on the bacterial source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, DBL-1 signaling activity was induced in response to Gram-negative bacteria, and it further regulated expression of unique downstream known and putative antimicrobial genes. In contrast, even though the DBL-1 signaling activity was strikingly repressed in response to the tested Gram-positive bacteria, DBL-1 was still required to regulate expression of target immunity genes. While many gene classes differentially regulated by specific pathogens have been previously identified as important innate immune response genes, our work highlights the role that DBL-1 plays in tailoring the molecular responses <italic>C. elegans</italic> engages against a range of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gravato-Nobre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shapira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engelmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Troemel et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Overall, we propose that loss of DBL-1 signaling changes the animal’s perception of the environment as more hostile, and this results in more robust protective responses that depend on the specific bacterial challenge. In this model, neuronally secreted DBL-1 targets hypoderm, intestine, and pharynx to regulate host defense responses. SMA-4 plays a double role in innate immune responses, acting as part of the core DBL-1 signaling pathway but also acting in another additive way, suggesting crosstalk with other signaling pathways. Future work may identify crosstalk between the DBL-1 pathway and other molecular pathways in regulating organismal defense responses. In summary, these findings support a central role for DBL-1/TGF-β signaling not only in crafting tailored responses to unique bacterial challenges, from transcription of specific innate immunity genes to behavioral responses, but also being targeted in response to bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and maintenance</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains</title><p>All <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were maintained on EZ media plates at 20°C (0.55 g Tris-Cl, 0.24 g Tris base, 3.1 g BD Bacto Peptone, 8 mg cholesterol, 2 g sodium chloride, 20 g agar, in water to 1 ll) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madhu et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were maintained without contamination or starvation for at least five generations before every experiment. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> includes the list of all strains used in this study.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers at Review Commons, and the evaluation at <italic>eLife</italic> has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Based on the reviewers' comments, we are potentially interested in this work. However, the editors agree that the proposed revision plan is inadequate as presented. Moreover, the editors raised a few additional issues that will also need to be addressed with new data and/or experiments for reconsideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>1. (Issue also raised by Reviewer 1) Figure 3: While it is appreciated that the RT-PCR experimental design quantified by gene and not by bacteria, it is nevertheless important that a subset of these data be repeated by bacterial treatment.</p><p>2. Related to the above in terms of data organization and presentation: An important conclusion of the work is that SMA-4 acts independently of the canonical DBL-1 signaling pathway. Avoidance responses are compared in dbl-1(0) and sma mutants across time in Figures 2 and 3. However, given the variability of these assays it is difficult to compare across independent experiments. sma-4 and dbl-1 mutants should be tested in parallel in the same experiments and the data plotted in the same graph.</p><p>3. (Issue also raised by Reviewer 3) – given the importance of the sma-4 data, data using another independent sma-4 allele need to be presented in the main figures.</p><p>4. (Issues raised by all reviewers) – In order for the reviewers and editors to review the data, all RNASeq data need to be included in the manuscript for review. The data should also be appropriately analyzed and should include standard and complete information including gene names, read counts, and other statistics. In the absence of the actual data, the RNASeq analyses (including the sunburst plot) cannot be appropriately reviewed, and the justification for focusing on specific genes cannot be assessed.</p><p>5. (Issue also raised by Reviewer 1) – In several figures (including Figure 5 and Figure 6) – the statistics should include a correction for multiple comparisons.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75831.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>1. General statements:</p><p>Thank you for the three reviews. The reviewers’ comments showed that they grasped the goals of this work and its context in the field. Their comments were fair and helped us further improve our manuscript.</p><p>2. Point-by-point description of the revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>Major comment:</p><p>Overall, the key conclusions are convincing and reflect the presented results. However, one conclusion I find too strong given the lack of presented data:</p><p>According to the RAD-SMAD reporter DBL-1 signaling is presumably repressed when worms are exposed to Gram-positive bacteria. This observation is solely based on the data set with percentages presented in Table S4. The fact that there are no images (even with weak signals!) nor appropriate statistics presented as well as the high variability among the trials (e.g. WT on <italic>E. faecalis</italic> ranges from 21 to 95%) does not convince enough for such a strong statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We do present images of animals expressing the RAD-SMAD reporter on the panel of bacteria in Figure 6. In populations of animals expressing this reporter, 100% consistently express it in the control condition, so the range of animals fed on <italic>E. faecalis</italic> that still express this reporter, while variable (5–79% of the population), shows that this reporter is consistently repressed in the population on <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. However, because of the variability of animal responses on <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, we rephrased our statement to indicate that strong pathway repression is observed in response to some Gram-positive bacteria instead of pathway repression is seen across all Gram-positive bacteria tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please reconsider the emphasis on the conclusion for Gram-positive bacteria, e.g. &quot;Animals activate DBL-1 pathway activity in response to Gram-negative bacteria and repress it in response to Gram-positive bacteria, demonstrating bacteria-responsive regulation of DBL-1 signaling.&quot; (e.g. from the abstract).</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased this abstract sentence to:</p><p>&quot;Animals activate DBL-1 pathway activity in response to Gram-negative bacteria and strongly repress it in response to select Gram-positive bacteria, demonstrating bacteria-responsive regulation of DBL-1 signaling.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:Page 6: &quot;The reduced feeding in response to select bacteria correlates with lifespan extension observed in both wild-type and dbl-1(-) populations.&quot; If you look at the survival curves in Figure 1 the lifespan extension of dbl-1(-) on some bacterial strains is hard to detect. This statement would be easier to understand with a reference to Table S3.</p></disp-quote><p>We added an in-text citation for Table S3 (and Figure 2) to this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 8: &quot;We next asked if the different avoidance responses to Gram-negative and Gram- positive bacteria are associated with altered gene expression of the DBL-1 Smads.&quot;</p><p>If this is the question and the driver for testing gene expression, then it would be much easier for the reader to see the potential association with presenting the RT-PCR data bundled for bacterial treatment and not organized according to the tested gene. I assume that the presentation might be caused by the RT-PCR plate design and probably not possible to reorganize. Please see this as a comment for future data presentation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the insightful comment and will address future RT-PCR experiments with it in mind. They are correct in their assumption that we designed the RT-PCR plates a specific way and reorganizing is not possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would appreciate the gene expression lists of the RNAseq experiment to understand how the selection of immune genes for the reporter strains was made. Further, I could imagine that researchers might be interested in looking for their genes of interest in the dbl-1 mutant and/or bacterial infection context. Is the raw data uploaded to the standard sequencing data repositories?</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that our gene expression lists will be useful for our colleagues to data mine! Data will be uploaded to repositories when needed for this manuscript process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: Another trigger for the worms' avoidance response could be intestinal distention by bacterial accumulation as it was described in a recent paper for <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65935), and also associated with DAF-7/TGF-β signaling in the context of PA14 avoidance (doi: 10.7554/eLife.50033).</p></disp-quote><p>We have used these two references to expand on our discussion about possible mechanisms for how DBL-1 affects behavior, paragraph 3 (new/revised wording is bolded here and throughout this response):</p><p>DAF-7 also contributes to the perception of and avoidance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Meisel et al., 2014, Singh and Aballay, 2019). Future work will determine if DBL-1 affects avoidance behavior by repressing DAF-7 signaling. Another possibility is that DBL-1 signaling responds to physiological changes caused by bacteria; distension of the intestinal lumen by bacterial colonization has been shown to elicit avoidance behaviors (Singh and Aballay, 2019, Filipowicz et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 17: The formula for calculating CFU/worm does not take the number of worms into account.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Materials and methods, we changed the formula to include the five animals:</p><p>“Bacterial colony forming units (CFU) per worm was calculated using the formula: (colony number × dilution factor)/ (5 animals × 100 μl lysate plated).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2, Figure 5, Figure 6H, Figure 7: Whenever there is a repeated comparison to the OP50 control (and an unpaired t-test was performed) a correction for multiple testing is missing which might alter some of the significant values.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer’s comment allowed us to (1) better note the statistics we did use for Figures 2 and 7, which included ANOVA, and (2) apply ANOVA to the data presented in Figures 5 and 6H.

While FUdR can affect the lifespan of some mutant animals, previous work from Mallo et al.

We confirmed that in our work before testing other bacterial conditions (Figure 1). We addressed the possible effect of FUdR in the results. We grew animals on plates containing 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR). While FUdR extends lifespan of wild-type animals, we used it to prevent offspring production so we wouldn’t need to transfer animals to fresh plates each day, thereby minimizing possible damage (and possible early death) to the tested animals. Our test and control are on FUdR plates, therefore the comparisons are not affected by presence of this common variable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the mechanism of virulence known for the different bacteria?

Because of the evidence presented in this work that SMA-4/co-Smad is acting independently of the DBL-1 signaling pathway in some conditions, we plan to expand on this in future work. We have data of LW5556 <italic>sma-4(jj278)</italic> (another allele of <italic>sma-4</italic>) avoidance on OP50 that supports our avoidance results with <italic>sma-4(e729)</italic> (three biological replicates, A=0.87 at 48 hours).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the discussion, for &quot;DBL-1 is known to be secreted from the AVA interneurons and activates DBL-1 pathway signaling in the hypodermis to regulate aversive learning upon exposure to Gram-negative <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.

Related to the above in terms of data organization and presentation: An important conclusion of the work is that SMA-4 acts independently of the canonical DBL-1 signaling pathway. Avoidance responses are compared in dbl-1(0) and sma mutants across time in Figures 2 and 3.
