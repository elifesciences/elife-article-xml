The neural circuits underlying modulation of pain-related behaviors by CeA-PKCδ neurons, however, remain unknown. In this study, we identified a neural circuit that originates in CeA-PKCδ neurons and terminates in the ventral region of the zona incerta (ZI), a subthalamic structure previously linked to pain processing. Behavioral experiments show that chemogenetic inhibition of GABAergic ZI neurons induced bilateral hypersensitivity in uninjured mice and contralateral hypersensitivity after nerve injury. In contrast, chemogenetic activation of GABAergic ZI neurons reversed nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity. Optogenetic manipulations of CeA-PKCδ axonal terminals in the ZI further showed that inhibition of this pathway reduces nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity whereas activation of the pathway produces hypersensitivity in the uninjured paws. Altogether, our results identify a novel nociceptive inhibitory efferent pathway from CeA-PKCδ neurons to the ZI that bidirectionally modulates pain-related behaviors in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>central amygdala</kwd><kwd>zona incerta</kwd><kwd>pain pathways</kwd><kwd>amygdala circuit</kwd><kwd>protein kinase c delta</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008460</institution-id><institution>National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carrasquillo</surname><given-names>Yarimar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Penzo</surname><given-names>Mario A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition of the zona incerta by central amygdala neurons expressing PKCδ contributes to injury-induced peripheral hypersensitivity in a mouse model of neuropathic pain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Persistent pain resulting from lesions or diseases affecting the peripheral and central nervous systems can severely affect a person’s life over time if left untreated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dworkin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Treede et al., 2008</xref>). Understanding the neural circuits underlying pain processing and how they are recruited in a maladaptive manner following injury is crucial for the development of improved treatment options for persistent pain. Several neuroimaging, pharmacological and electrophysiological studies in humans and animals demonstrate that the amygdala is a key locus in persistent pain processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard and Besson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bushnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrasquillo and Gereau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neugebauer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zald, 2003</xref>). A recent study further demonstrated that the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) can both enhance and decrease pain-related behaviors in a cell-type-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). CeA neurons expressing protein kinase C-delta (CeA-PKCδ), for example, are sensitized by nerve injury and promote pain-related responses. In contrast, neurons expressing somatostatin are inhibited by nerve injury and promote decreases in pain-related behaviors. The circuit and cellular mechanisms responsible for bidirectional modulation of pain-related responses in the CeA, however, are still unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we began to address this question by characterizing the efferent projections from CeA-PKCδ neurons. Our cell-type-specific anatomical experiments identified the zona incerta (ZI) as one of the efferent targets of CeA-PKCδ neurons. The ZI is a subthalamic nucleus located ventrolateral to the medial lemniscus and dorsomedial to the substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ricardo, 1981</xref>). The ZI is comprised of heterogeneous groups of cells defined by the expression of molecular markers such as parvalbumin, tyrosine hydroxylase, somatostatin, calbindin, and glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mitrofanis, 2005</xref>). Previous studies using traditional anatomical tracing have shown that the ZI receives inputs from the CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reardon and Mitrofanis, 2000</xref>). A recent study further demonstrated that somatostatin-expressing CeA neurons project to parvalbumin-expressing ZI neurons and contribute to conditioned fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). The ZI has also been shown to modulate fear generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Venkataraman et al., 2019</xref>), binge eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang and van den Pol, 2017</xref>), defensive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chou et al., 2018</xref>) and predatory hunting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2019</xref> in rodents, highlighting the functional complexity of this subthalamic brain structure.</p><p>In rodent models of pain, changes in neural activity have been reported in the ZI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Masri et al., 2009</xref>) and behavioral studies further show that experimentally modulating the activity of ZI neurons alters behavioral hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Petronilho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Most of the literature suggests that the ZI is inhibited in the context of pain and that this inhibition drives behavioral hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Masri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moon and Park, 2017</xref>). Consistent with this model, a recent study in humans showed that deep brain stimulation of zona incerta reduced experimental heat pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). Previous studies in rodents, however, reports the opposite – the ZI is activated in the context of pain and these increases in neuronal activity drive hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these results suggest that modulation of pain in the ZI is complex and, most likely, cell-type and circuit-specific. Identifying the sources of excitation and inhibition of ZI neurons in the context of pain will be important to begin untangling the mechanisms underlying pain modulation in the ZI.</p><p>Based on our anatomical findings demonstrating projections from CeA-PKCδ neurons to the ZI, in combination with previous work showing that CeA-PKCδ neurons are GABAergic and display increases in activity following injury, we hypothesized that inhibitory inputs from CeA-PKCδ neurons are a source of pain-related inhibition in the ZI that results in increases in pain-related behaviors. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis using cell-type-specific anatomical tracing and optogenetically assisted circuit mapping along with chemogenetic or optogenetic manipulations coupled with behavioral assays to measure hypersensitivity in mice. Our combined results show that there is a functional inhibitory efferent pathway from CeA-PKCδ neurons to the ZI and that ZI-GABAergic neurons can bidirectionally modulate pain-related behaviors in mice. We further show that inhibitory inputs from CeA-PKCδ neurons to the ZI are necessary for ZI modulation of cuff-induced hypersensitivity and that activation of this pathway induced hypersensitivity in the absence of injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of CeA-PKCδ neuronal efferent targets</title><p>The neural pathways underlying modulation of pain-related behaviors by CeA-PKCδ neurons remains unknown.

fluorescently tagged opsin ChrimsonR-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We selected ChrimsonR-tdTomato because it has been previously shown to reach terminals efficiently and functionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Similar to the results obtained in the mCherry experiments described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), transduction of ChrimsonR-tdTomato was localized to CeA-PKCδ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, the anatomical distributions and terminal densities observed in mice injected with ChrimsonR-tdTomato were also comparable to those observed in mice injected with mCherry, showing that the identified regions are not dependent on the experimental approach used. In addition, mapping and quantification of transduced cells showed that transduction was selectively localized to the CeA, and that transduction efficiency was robust and comparable with both approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>).</p><p>Semi-quantitative analysis, performed by visual examination of high magnification images, further revealed that axonal terminals in the output regions of CeA-PKCδ neurons have different terminal densities and organization patterns. Most of the brain regions identified had either few or moderate numbers of terminals, with only three regions, including the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, extended amygdala, and parabrachial nucleus, containing high densities of labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, moderate to dense labeling was consistently seen in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, extended amygdala and CeA of all five brains analyzed. Dense labeling was also seen in the lateral parabrachial nucleus of three of the five brains analyzed, with sparse labeling observed in one brain and no labeling in the final brain. Sparse to moderate labeling was observed in the substantia innominata of all five brains; in the ZI, para-subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra and reticular formation in four of five brains; and in the subthalamic nucleus and ventral tegmental area in three of the five brains analyzed. Lastly, sparse labeling was observed in the globus pallidus, lateral preoptic area and lateral hypothalamus of all five brains: in the locus coeruleus in four of five brains and in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and periaqueductal grey in three of the five brains. Consistent with previous studies using traditional anterograde tracers in the CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reardon and Mitrofanis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shinonaga et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>), no terminal labeling was observed in cortical regions of any of the five brains evaluated.</p><p>Mapping of the injection sites in all five brains shows that all injections were mostly restricted to the CeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Brains ET987, ET903, and ET832, however, had a more complete rostral-caudal coverage of the CeA than brain ET835 and the brain used in experiment 265945645 of the Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas of the Allen Brain Institute, which mainly covered the posterior (but not anterior) portion of the CeA. Quantification of the number of transduced cells and analysis of the rostral-caudal distribution of labeling revealed that the number and distribution of neurons transduced with ChrimsonR-tdTomato and mCherry closely resembles the average number of tdTomato-positive cells quantified in sections from the PKCδcre mice crossed with the Ai9 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results demonstrate that most of the CeA PKCδ-expressing cells were transduced with ChrimsonR-tdTomato or mCherry, allowing for an accurate evaluation of the terminals in these brains. Variability in the spread of viral transduction within the CeA might explain the differences observed in efferent projections between brains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that projection-specific CeA-PKCδ neurons are topographically organized within the CeA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CeA-PKCδ neurons send inhibitory projections to the ZI</title><p>The ZI was among the brain regions identified as an efferent target of CeA-PKCδ neurons in our anatomical experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). These results were of interest because previous studies have shown that reduced activity in GABAergic ZI neurons correlates with pain-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Masri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moon and Park, 2017</xref>). Given that CeA-PKCδ neurons are GABAergic and are activated in the context of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>), we hypothesized that pain-related inhibition of the ZI is mediated by injury-induced activation of CeA-PKCδ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>The identification of the ZI as an efferent target of CeA-PKCδ neurons was somewhat surprising given that previous studies have reported that most of the ZI-projecting CeA neurons are somatostatin-positive, with only a small percentage of CeA-PKCδ neurons also projecting to the ZI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). To gain further insights into the anatomical projection from CeA-PKCδ neurons to the ZI, we qualitatively and quantitatively examined the anatomical distribution and densities of CeA-PKCδ axonal terminals within the ZI as a function of the rostral-caudal level. As illustrated in the representative images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, moderate CeA-PKCδ axonal terminal labeling was observed between rostral-caudal levels 1.46 mm and 2.70 mm posterior to bregma. Mapping of the distribution of CeA-PKCδ terminals within the ZI further showed that these axonal terminals were restricted to the middle and ventral sectors of the ZI in all brains analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Sparse terminal labeling was also seen throughout the whole ZI, independent of the mediolateral, dorsomedial, or rostral-caudal level. Lastly, quantification of terminal densities in areas with moderate terminal labeling showed a rostral-caudal gradient with greatest terminal densities observed at rostral-caudal level 1.46 posterior to bregma followed by decreasing densities up to rostral-caudal level 2.18 posterior to bregma, and a small increase in densities between rostral-caudal levels 2.46 and 2.70 posterior to bregma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Together, these results indicate that CeA-PKCδ terminals are restricted to specific anatomical subregions within the ZI.</p><p>To validate these putative projections from CeA-PKCδ neurons to the ZI, we stereotaxically injected the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B (CTB) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 into the ZI of PKCδ-cre::Ai9 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Evaluation of the anatomical distribution of CTB-positive CeA neurons showed that ZI-projecting CeA neurons are observed in all CeA subnuclei (capsular, lateral and medial) and are distributed along the rostral-caudal CeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Higher densities of CTB-labeled neurons were observed in the middle sections of the CeA, between rostral-caudal levels 1.06 mm and 1.70 posterior to bregma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, CTB-647 was detected in CeA-PKCδ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), validating the anatomical projection from CeA-PKCδ neurons to the ZI. Quantification of CeA neurons positive for both CTB-647 and PKCδ-tdTomato further revealed that approximately 19% of CTB-positive CeA neurons are also positive for PKCδ-tdTomato. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, neurons positive for both CTB-647 and PKCδ-tdTomato were limited to the capsular and lateral subdivisions of the CeA, with higher densities observed in the middle/posterior regions of the CeA, between rostral-caudal levels 1.34 and 1.70 posterior to bregma. Together, the results from our anatomical experiments show that CeA-PKCδ neurons in the capsular and lateral CeA send inputs with moderate densities of terminals to the middle and ventral sectors of the ZI.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CeA-PKCδ inhibitory projections to the ZI (<bold>A</bold>) Schematic drawing of retrograde tracing experimental approach (left panel).</title><p>Fluorescently tagged cholera toxin B (CTB-647) was injected into the ZI of a PKCδ-cre::Ai9 mouse brain.

The stable expression of ChR2-EYFP in the CeA is indicated by the presence of green, fluorescent signal in the peri-somatic region of VGAT-positive neurons in CeA. Consistent with our anatomical findings, tracing of the EYFP-labeled axonal terminals revealed moderate labeling of terminals in proximity of ZI neurons. Optogenetic stimulation of ChR2-expressing CeA terminals in the ZI with blue light further showed robust inhibitory post-synaptic currents in 60% of VGAT-positive cells (12 out of 20 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Optically evoked postsynaptic responses occurred in the presence of TTX and 4-AP, demonstrating that the inputs from the CeA to the ZI are monosynaptic. Of note, recordings in VGAT-negative ZI neurons revealed that 53% (8 out of 15 cells) of these ZI neurons also display inhibitory post-synaptic currents in response to optical stimulation of ChR2-expressing CeA terminals. Quantification of the responses to optical paired stimulation further showed that paired pulse ratio is indistinguishable between VGAT-positive and VGAT-negative ZI neurons, demonstrating that CeA-synaptic inputs are comparable in VGAT-positive and VGAT-negative ZI neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To validate the inhibitory connectivity between the CeA and ZI, we recorded optically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (oIPSC) of ZI neurons before and after bath application of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist bicuculline.

Parallel recordings at a holding potential of –70 mV (near reversal potential for chloride) further showed either no response to blue light stimulation or a small inward current in neurons that showed robust light-evoked outward currents at holding potential of 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Together, these findings confirm that the projection from the CeA to the ZI is inhibitory.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Inhibition of ZI-GABAergic neurons is sufficient to induce bilateral hypersensitivity</title><p>Previous studies have shown that ZI-GABAergic neurons are inhibited in the context of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Masri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moon and Park, 2017</xref>). To establish a causal link between reduced activity of ZI-GABAergic neurons and pain-related behaviors, we used a chemogenetic approach coupled with a battery of pain behavioral assays to measure tactile and thermal sensitivity in mice with the sciatic nerve cuff model of neuropathic pain or control mice that received a sham surgical procedure. To validate chemogenetic inhibition of ZI neurons, we performed whole-cell current-clamp recordings in acute ZI slices prepared from VGAT-cre mice stereotaxically injected into the ZI with an AAV encoding the cre-dependent inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) hM4Di (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, bath application of the DREADD ligand clozapine N-oxide (CNO; 10 µM) significantly inhibited firing responses in hM4Di-transduced neurons, with no measurable effect observed in response to bath application of the saline vehicle control. Histological verification of injection sites at the end of the experiments further demonstrated that transduction of hM4Di was restricted to the ZI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The numbers and rostral-caudal distribution of transduced cells within the ZI of mice stereotaxically injected with hM4Di was comparable to the numbers and rostral-caudal distribution of VGAT-positive cells in the ZI of VGAT-cre::Ai9 mice, demonstrating robust transduction efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of GABAergic ZI neurons is sufficient to induce bilateral tactile and pressure hypersensitivity in uninjured mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the experimental approach.

This was done both before and after i.p. injection of either saline or CNO in both cuff and sham mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As expected, following cuff implantation on the sciatic nerve, tactile and pressure sensitivity was significantly lower in the hindpaw ipsilateral to cuff implantation compared to the contralateral hindpaw or either hindpaw in sham treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>, chemogenetic inhibition of VGAT-positive ZI neurons resulted in robust bilateral hypersensitivity to tactile and pressure stimulation in sham mice as well as contralateral hypersensitivity in cuff-implanted mice.

Notably, following the chemogenetic inhibition of ZI VGAT-positive neurons, paw withdrawal thresholds in sham mice and the contralateral hindpaw of cuff-implanted mice were comparable to the withdrawal thresholds of the ipsilateral hindpaw of cuff-implanted mice. These results demonstrate that inhibition of ZI VGAT-positive neurons is sufficient to elicit hypersensitivity in the absence of injury that resembles the hypersensitivity observed following sciatic nerve cuff implantation. The effects of chemogenetic inhibition of VGAT-positive ZI neurons on tactile and pressure sensitivity were transient, as paw withdrawal thresholds in all treated animals returned to pre-injection values 1 day following CNO injections. Importantly, tactile and pressure sensitivity was unaltered in saline-injected mice, demonstrating that the CNO-induced effects were not due to handling or hM4Di expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that modulation of pain-related behaviors in the CeA, including by CeA-PKCδ neurons, is modality-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>).

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>, cuff implantation on the sciatic nerve resulted in hypersensitivity to both heat and cold stimulation in the hindpaw ipsilateral to cuff implantation compared to the contralateral hindpaw or the hindpaws of sham treated mice. Behavioral responses to cold and heat stimulation of the hindpaws, however, were unaltered by chemogenetic inhibition of VGAT-positive neurons in the ZI in all animals tested. Taken together, the results from these chemogenetic experiments demonstrate that inhibition of VGAT-positive neurons in the ZI is sufficient to induce hypersensitivity in the absence of injury in a modality-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Activation of ZI-GABAergic neurons reverses cuff-induced hypersensitivity to pinch but not thermal stimulation</title><p>The next set of experiments aimed to determine whether activation of GABAergic ZI neurons is sufficient to reverse cuff-induced hypersensitivity.

It is important to note that baseline responses in sham animals or the hindpaw contralateral to sciatic nerve treatment were unaltered by chemogenetic activation of ZI-VGAT neurons in the present study. This contrasts with previous reports, where optogenetic activation of ZI-VGAT neurons decreased baseline responses to tactile stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that modulation of behavioral output by optogenetic stimulation is dependent on the frequency and pattern of the stimulation used for the experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Padilla-Coreano et al., 2019</xref>). A recent study further demonstrated that deep brain stimulation of zona incerta in human subjects reduced experimental heat pain without affecting mechanical pain thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). It is therefore possible that the differences in the results from our chemogenetic study and the previous rodent optogenetic and human deep brain stimulation studies might stem from different levels of neuronal activation by these various techniques.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Potential cell-type-specificity in the ZI</title><p>In the present study, we evaluated the functional contribution of ZI-VGAT neurons to the modulation of pain-related behaviors. Our optogenetic-assisted circuit mapping experiments showed, however, that both VGAT-positive and VGAT-negative ZI neurons respond to optogenetic stimulation of CeA terminals in the ZI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). Consistent with these findings, previous studies have shown that CeA neurons, including somatostatin-positive cells, project to and inhibit parvalbumin-positive ZI neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Whether somatostatin-positive CeA neurons also project to ZI-VGAT neurons and whether CeA-PKCδ neurons target a genetically or anatomically distinct subpopulation of ZI neurons remains to be determined. Future experiments to examine potential cell-type-specific pain-related plasticity of intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission in this pathway will also be informative.</p><p>A recent study evaluated the function of parvalbumin-positive ZI neurons in the modulation of pain-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, this study demonstrated that parvalbumin-positive neurons in the ZI show an opposite electrophysiological phenotype and function in the modulation of pain-related behaviors than what we and others observe for the ZI-VGAT neurons. Thus, while the present and previous studies show that inhibition of ZI-VGAT neurons drives behavioral hypersensitivity, ablation or silencing of parvalbumin-positive ZI neurons was shown to be analgesic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, while we and others show that activation of ZI-VGAT neurons reverses injury-induced hypersensitivity, activation of parvalbumin-positive ZI neurons was shown to promote behavioral hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). These combined results are particularly interesting given that parvalbumin-positive ZI neurons receive inputs from somatostatin-expressing CeA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>), which have been previously shown to be inhibited in the context of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Based on these combined findings, we predict that injury-induced inhibition of somatostatin-expressing neurons in the CeA disinhibits parvalbumin-positive ZI neurons, while injury-induced activation of CeA-PKCδ neurons inhibits a subpopulation of VGAT-positive ZI neurons, both resulting in behavioral hypersensitivity. Whether injury-induced inhibition of ZI-VGAT neurons (by CeA-PKCδ neurons) occurs simultaneously and under the same conditions as disinhibition of parvalbumin-positive ZI neurons (by somatostatin-expressing neurons in the CeA) remains to be determined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>PKCδ</italic>-cre mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GENSAT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">founder line 011559-UCD</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ai9 mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock number 007909</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vesicular GABA transporter Cre mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock number 016962</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6NJ mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock number 005304</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene;

Following this stabilization, 10 additional recordings were acquired before bath application of either 10 µM CNO or vehicle in ACSF. Recordings of the same current injection were continued every 15 s for approximately 5 min, until the cell fired consistently and stably. Ten additional recordings were performed. The number of action potentials elicited during each depolarizing current injection were used to assess excitability. Values for before and after CNO or vehicle application were averaged across five traces and compared.</p><p>To validate the optogenetics effects, current- and voltage-clamp recordings were performed on CeA neurons transduced with ChR2 or NpHR of PKCδ-cre mice previously injected with ChR2-mCherry or NpHR-mCherry into the CeA. Non-transduced neurons within the CeA region containing transduced cells were used as controls. For ChR2 experiments, voltage and current responses of neurons in response to a 1 s blue LED (λ=470 nm, Mightex) stimulation of 10 Hz and 5ms duration were recorded. Neurons were held between –60 mV and –50 mV with a depolarizing current (20–90 pA) for current-clamp recordings and at –70 mV for voltage-clamp recordings. Light-evoked inward currents were used to assess responses in voltage-clamp experiments. The number of light-evoked action potentials within the 1 s stimulation in current-clamp experiments was used to assess spike fidelity in each neuron.</p><p>For NpHR experiments, neurons were held at –70 mV and prolonged (2 s) depolarizing current injections were used to elicit repetitive firing. The amplitude of the current injections (70–700 pA) was adjusted per neuron to elicit between 5 and 10 action potentials within the 400ms prior to light stimulation. A 400ms duration yellow light (λ=590 nm, Mightex) stimulation was used to assess NpHR-mediated inhibition. The number of action potentials elicited 400ms before and during the 400ms yellow light stimulation was quantified in each cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Optogenetically assisted circuit mapping</title><p>For the optogenetically assisted circuit mapping experiments, recordings were performed using a cesium gluconate-based internal solution containing (in mM): 120 cesium gluconate, 6 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 12 phosphocreatine, 5 EGTA, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 ATP, and 0.5 GTP, pH 7.4 adjusted with CsOH (~290 mOsm). Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained at 33 ± 1<sup>o</sup> C from visually identified tdTomato-expressing and non-expressing ZI neurons using differential interference contrast optics with infrared illumination and fluorescence microscopy. Optically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (oIPSCs) of VGAT + and VGAT- neurons were recorded at a holding potential of 0 mV in the presence of TTX (1 µM) and 4-AP (100 µM). Blue LED light (λ=470 nm, 10–12 mW, Mightex) paired pulses of 0.5–10ms duration with an interval of 200ms between pulses were delivered to drive paired synaptic responses. Paired pulse ratios (PPR) were determined by the ratio of the amplitude of the peak evoked by the second pulse divided by the amplitude of the peak evoked by the first pulse. Signals were acquired at 100 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz. The injection site in the CeA was verified in acute brain slices prior to recording and only mice that had virus injection restricted to the CeA and robust terminal labeling in the ZI were used for circuit mapping electrophysiological experiments.</p><p>To validate a functional inhibitory projection between the CeA and ZI, acute coronal slices were prepared from male C57BL/6 J mice (12–18 weeks) previously injected with AAV2-hsyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP using the slice preparation protocol mentioned above. Post-synaptic currents in response to blue light (λ=470 nm, 10–12 mW, Mightex) stimulation of 5ms duration were recorded at a holding potential of 0 mV or –70 mV in ACSF. Parallel recordings were obtained before and 3 min after bath exchange to ACSF containing 10 μM Bicuculline (Sigma). Peak amplitudes of light-evoked responses were averaged across 10 recording sweeps. A 10 mM stock solution of Bicuculline was made in water, stored at –20<sup>o</sup> C and dissolved in ACSF on the day of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>At the end of each experiment, mice were deeply anesthetized with 1.25% Avertin anesthesia (2,2,2-tribromoethanol and tert-amyl alcohol in 0.9% NaCl; 0.025 ml/g body weight) i.p., then perfused transcardially with 0.9% NaCl (37 °C), followed by 100 mL of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer solution (PFA/PB). The brain was dissected and post fixed in 4% PFA/PB overnight at 4 °C. After cryoprotection in 30% sucrose/PB for 48 hr, coronal sections (30–45 μm) were obtained using a freezing sliding microtome and stored in 0.1 M Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), pH 7.4 containing 0.01% sodium azide (Sigma) at 4 °C until immunostaining. Sections were rinsed in PBS, incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and blocked in 5% normal goat serum (NGS) (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated for 72 hr at 4 °C in mouse anti-PKCδ (1:1000, BD Biosciences, 610397), rabbit anti-Phospho-c-Fos (1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology, 5348) or rat anti-mCherry (1:500, Invitrogen, M11217) in 1.5% NGS blocking solution with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% BSA. Sections were then rinsed in PBS and incubated in Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:100, Invitrogen, A21235), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:250, Invitrogen, A21244), or goat anti-rat Cy3 (1:250, Invitrogen, A10522) secondary antibodies in 1.5% NGS blocking solution with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% BSA, protected from light, for 2 hr at room temperature. Sections were then rinsed in PBS, mounted on positively charged glass slides, air-dried and coverslips were placed using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech).</p><p>For the c-Fos experiments, VGAT-cre mice received CNO (5 mg/kg) or saline injections (i.p.) 2 weeks post virus injection into the ZI. Mice were housed in their home cages for 1 hr prior to transcardial perfusion, brain dissection and tissue processing. For mapping of axonal terminals from CeA-PKCδ neurons, PKCδ-cre mice injected with AAV9-Syn-Flex-ChrimsonR-tdTomato or AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry were transcardially perfused at least 4 weeks after the brain injections. For the mCherry-injected brains, 30 µm coronal sections from the entire brain were collected and immunostained for mCherry as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Imaging and analysis</title><p>For confocal studies, images were acquired using a Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal microscope. ×2 (for low magniﬁcation), ×20 (for high magniﬁcation) or ×40 (oil-immersion for higher magnification) objectives were used. The experimental conditions for image collection including laser intensity, gain, and pinhole size were identical for experiments. Multiple channels (GFP, RFP and CY5) were used for sequential image acquisition where Z stacks data collection was done at 0.9 mm. Following acquisition, images were consolidated using NIS Elements software with automatic stitching of subsequent images, and conversion of stacks into maximum intensity z-projections. Quantitative analysis of CeA and ZI imaging data was performed between bregma –0.82 and –1.94 and bregma –1.06 and –2.54, for CeA and ZI, respectively. Anatomical limits of each region were identiﬁed based on the mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paxinos et al., 2001</xref>). Number of positive cells were quantified manually for each channel using NIS Elements software using one section per rostral-caudal level for each mouse. Co-labeled cells were identiﬁed by NIS Elements software automatically and were further visually corroborated by an experimenter.</p><p>For mapping of axonal terminals from CeA-PKCδ neurons, coronal slices from the entire brain of PKCδ-cre mice injected with AAV9-Syn-Flex-ChrimsonR-tdTomato or AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry, collected and immunostained 120 µm apart from each other, were visually inspected for the presence of fluorescent axonal terminals using a 20 X objective in a Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal microscope. Only mice that had injections restricted to the CeA were used for anatomical experiments. Classic morphological criteria, defined as the presence of varicosities and the thickness and organization pattern of the signal, was used to distinguish labeled terminals (very thin fibers with numerous ramifications and varicosities) from fibers of passage (thicker fibers without ramifications and varicosities) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernard et al., 1993</xref>). Low and high magnification images of all the brain sections containing terminals were acquired and the anatomical localization of the terminals was then determined using a Mouse Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paxinos et al., 2001</xref>). Representative images of terminals were collected using a 40 X oil-immersion objective.</p><p>Semi-quantitative analysis of the areas containing axonal terminals was done based on the density of terminals observed and are reported as sparse (+), moderate (++) and dense (+++) in the defined area.</p><p>A similar analysis was also performed with the brain of experiment 265945645 of the Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas of the Allen Brain Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org/">http://connectivity.brain-map.org/</ext-link>). This brain was identified using the Source Search tool on the Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas website and filtering for the CeA as the brain region and <italic>PKCδ</italic>-GluCla-CFP-IRES-Cre as the mouse line of interest. The tracer injected is described as EGFP; the stereotaxic coordinates for the injection were AP –1.82 mm, ML –2.65 mm, DV –4.25 mm and the injection volume was 0.02 mm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>Quantitative analysis of axonal terminal densities was performed by measuring the percentage of area containing moderate immunofluorescent terminals within the ZI. Terminal labeling was automatically detected using the NIS Elements software and a pre-defined signal intensity threshold followed by visual corroboration by an experimenter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data and statistical analyses</title><p>The sample sizes used in each experiment were based on the standards set forth by the field. Five mice were used as biological replicates for anatomical tracing experiments. At least two mice were used as biological replicates for electrophysiology and histological experiments and at least 4 mice were used as biological replicates for behavioral experiments. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses was conducted using GraphPad Prism (v8.0). Unpaired/paired two-tailed t-test, Wilcoxon two-tailed matched pair signed rank test, one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test and two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test were used. The significance level was set at &lt;0.05.

This study employed anatomical tracing, electrophysiology, optogenetics, chemogenetics, and behavioral assays in various pain modalities to link the zona incerta to pain modulation by providing new evidence for a direct inhibitory connection from the central amygdala to the zona incerta that could explain neuropathic pain hypersensitivity. This study is detailed anatomically, electrophysiologically, and behaviorally, and the inclusion of optogenetic studies has enhanced the conclusions.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Volker Neugebauer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Following review, all 3 reviewers agree that there is potential interest in this manuscript and relevance for the field, but all were in agreement that some core data was missing to link the PKCδ neurons in the CeA projecting to the ZI as being the explicit circuit of interest. The electrophysiology experiments did not discriminate which CeA inputs were activated with optogenetics to modulate GABA release in ZI, and therefore there is not sufficient evidence to claim that PKCδ neurons in the CeA are explicitly driving changes in the ZI. More importantly, all of the behavioral studies were performed only via manipulation of GABA neurons in the ZI itself, with no experiments actually verifying that the PKCδ neuronal input from the CeA was involved in any of the changes in pain. It was felt that the primary novelty of this study related to the identification that PKCδ neurons in the CeA projecting to the ZI were relevant for the modulation of pain, and accordingly, it was unanimously agreed that for this paper to be considered acceptable for publication additional studies would have to be performed for the authors to substantiate and support the conclusions of this this paper.</p><p>To this extent, it was agreed that it was necessary for the authors to perform an additional behavioral study where they explicitly manipulate CeA-PKCδ neuronal inputs to the ZI using either opto- or chemo-genetic approaches. All of the reviewers agreed that these manipulations would have to be performed on CeA PKCδ neuron axon terminals in the ZI, so if it was an optogenetic approach the fiber would have to be placed over the ZI and if it was a chemogenetic approach the DREADD ligand would have to be locally infused directly into the ZI, to influence the inputs from CeA PKCδ neurons in the ZI following infection of CeA PKCδ neurons with the appropriate construct.

DIO-ChR2 virus could be injected into the CeA of PKCδ-cre mice and optically evoked IPSCs could be recorded from ZI neurons. The addition of these experiments was not viewed as being essential to be considered further, but as stated, if the authors choose to not add these experiments they have to substantially modify the conclusions of this paper to remove any direct reference suggesting they have demonstrated functional monosynaptic connections within this circuit.</p><p>In addition to these essential revisions raised by reviewers, there were also additional comments that required attention:</p><p>– The addition of comparable PPR recording from sciatic cuff animals or another injury would be useful.</p><p>– It would be interesting to compare IPSCs between sham control and neuropathic pain model to see if the (inhibitory) input from CeA-PKCδ neurons was increased in the pain model as hypothesized by the authors.</p><p>– It is not clear why a red-shifted channel rhodopsin (CrimsonR-tdTomato) was used as an anterograde tracer.

We agree that behavioral experiments to evaluate the function of CeA-PKCδ neuron projections to ZI is crucial to test our hypothesis. To address this concern, we performed in-vivo optogenetic manipulation of CeA-PKCδ terminals in ZI. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that optogenetic inhibition of CeA-PKCδ terminals in ZI reverses peripheral hyperalgesia in the injured paw. In contrast, optogenetic excitation of CeA-PKCδ terminals in ZI induces peripheral hypersensitivity in the uninjured hind paws in mice. We also performed ex-vivo slice electrophysiology experiments to validate optical inhibition and activation of CeA-PKCδ neurons transduced with NpHR or ChR2 by yellow or blue light, respectively. Together, these results demonstrate the function of the CeA-PKCδ to ZI pathway in the modulation of nociceptive behavior in mice. The results from these experiments are included in Figures 5-8, pages 15-18, and lines 340-411 of the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, it was also agreed upon that, since in its current form the authors do not demonstrate that it is CeA PKCδ cells that modulate ZI neurons, they have the choice to remove any such statement (functional monosynaptic connections from CeA PKCδ to ZI) or perform additional electrophysiology experiments to support this conclusion.

The addition of these experiments was not viewed as being essential to be considered further, but as stated, if the authors choose to not add these experiments they have to substantially modify the conclusions of this paper to remove any direct reference suggesting they have demonstrated functional monosynaptic connections within this circuit.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important issue and attempted to address it as outlined below. We recorded from 16 neurons of 5 PKCδ-cre mice injected with cre-dependent ChR2 into the CeA but observed no postsynaptic responses. High transduction ChR2 efficiency was seen in the CeA and ChR2-expressing terminals were visible in the ZI in slices from all 5 mice. Given that these recordings were performed using a Cs-gluconate-based internal solution and no synaptic blockers in the bath, we reasoned that using a high chloride internal solution (CsCl) in the presence of excitatory synaptic blockers (NBQX and AP5) in the bath would increase the likelihood of observing a response. Thus, we recorded from 14 additional neurons from 3 additional PKCδ-cre mice with cre-dependent ChR2 injections in the CeA but again observed no response. These 3 mice also had robust ChR2 transduction in the CeA and visible ChR2expressing terminals in the ZI. We concluded that the moderate terminal labeling from CeA-PKCδ neurons in the ZI decreases the probability of patching a neuron that receives CeA-PKCδ inputs, making these experiments challenging and the results inconclusive. Based on previous studies showing that ZI neurons branch widely along the length of the ZI</p><p>(https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00423.2006; https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3768-06.2007), it is also possible that the ZI neurons receiving input from CeA-PKCδ neurons are not the neurons immediately abutting the highest terminal density. Axodendritic inputs of this kind would again make it difficult to target the appropriate neurons given the size of the ZI. Our CTB results (Figure 2), however, clearly confirmed an anatomical connection between CeA-PKCδ neurons and the ZI.</p><p>The new optogenetic experiments showing behavioral effects after manipulating CeA-PKCδ terminals in the ZI further confirm the functionality of this pathway in mediating pain-related behaviors. Whether the behavioral effects observed are mediated monosynaptically or polysynaptically remains to be determined. Thus, we toned down our conclusions related to a monosynaptic connection throughout the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to these essential revisions raised by reviewers, there were also additional comments that required attention:</p><p>– The addition of comparable PPR recording from sciatic cuff animals or another injury would be useful.</p><p>– It would be interesting to compare IPSCs between sham control and neuropathic pain model to see if the (inhibitory) input from CeA-PKCδ neurons was increased in the pain model as hypothesized by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that both of these experiments would be interesting and informative. Unfortunately, the electrophysiologist who was trained to perform these experiments is no longer in the lab. Thus, we plan to follow up with these experiments in a future study. This future direction is now included in the revised Discussion (page 23, line 518-520).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is not clear why a red-shifted channel rhodopsin (CrimsonR-tdTomato) was used as an anterograde tracer. Since optogenetics was not used in these experiments, control AAV that expressed only tdTomato would be appropriate. The rationale is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>The anatomical experiments included in this manuscript were initially completed using a control AAV that expresses the red fluorophore mCherry. We noticed robust cytosolic expression in the CeA and terminal labeling throughout the brain with this approach but were concerned that the protein was not adequately reaching and labeling terminals. For this reason, we repeated the experiments using an AAV expressing ChrimsonR-tdTomato, which has been previously shown using electrophysiological approaches to efficiently (and functionally) reach terminals <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2836">(10.1038/nmeth.2836;</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28539-7">10.1038/s41467-022-28539-7)</ext-link>. Both of these AAV approaches are commonly used for neuroanatomical experiments in the field (10.1016/j.cub.2021.12.020<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.12.020">;</ext-link> 10.1523/jneurosci.1515<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1515-19.2019">-19.2019;</ext-link> 10.1016/j.neuron.2019.03.037) and yielded comparable results in our experiments (summarized in Table 1), increasing our confidence in our findings. This rationale is included in page 5-6, line 109-130 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is also difficult to appreciate CrimsonR-tdTomato transduced cells (high magnification images in Figure 1B).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We agree that the membrane expression of ChrimsonR-tdTomato makes it difficult to appreciate transduced cells in the original images (Sup Figure 1A-B in revised version). Given that transduction with mCherry is cytosolic and labels transduced cells, we have substituted the image in Figure 1 for an image of a brain transduced with mCherry. We preserved the ChrimsonR-tdTomato representative images in the Supplementary file for transparency purposes. As mentioned above (and summarized in Table 1 of the revised manuscript), the results of analyses of terminal expression using both ChrimsonRtdTomato and mCherry was similar. Moreover, as illustrated in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, transduction efficiency was robust and comparable with both approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;ChrimsonR&quot; should be changed to &quot;ChrimsonR-tdTomato&quot; throughout, because tdTomato is the fluorophore we see in the images.</p></disp-quote><p>&quot;ChrimsonR-tdTomato&quot; has been consistently used throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1- Supplemental figure 1(C) could benefit from higher magnification/resolution images of PKCδ terminals in the ZI.

We included higher resolution images of CeA-PKCδ terminals in the ZI at different rostral-caudal levels in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B. We also agree that a more detailed description of the terminal distribution and densities in the ZI is warranted. Thus, we performed additional experiments to thoroughly evaluate the anatomical distribution and densities of CeA-PKCδ terminals within the ZI of PKCδ-cre mice injected with AAV encoding ChrimsonR-tdTomato or mCherry in CeA. Consistent with our initial observations, our results show moderate to sparse labeling of CeA-PKCδ terminals that are dependent on the rostral-caudal level of the ZI. In the revised manuscript, we also demonstrate that these terminals are restricted to specific subregions within the ZI. Mapping of the ZI regions where we observed moderate terminal labeling in all injected brains are now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 2C. As requested by the reviewer, we quantified the densities of terminals in ZI regions as a function of the rostral-caudal level (Figure 1—figure supplement 2D). The results for these experiments are presented in page 8 and 9, line 178-194 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Controls are needed for electrophysiology experiments to show blockade of optogenetically evoked IPSCs with bicuculine and a negative control at -70mV.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.
