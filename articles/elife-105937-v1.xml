membrane (INM), a subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), sequesters hundreds of transmembrane proteins within the nucleus. We previously found that one INM protein, emerin, can evade the INM by secretory transport to the lysosome, where it is degraded (Buchwalter et al., 2019). In this work, we used targeted mutagenesis to identify intrinsic sequences that promote or inhibit emerin’s secretory trafficking. By manipulating these sequences across several tag and expression level combinations, we now find that emerin’s localization is sensitive to C-terminal GFP tagging. While emerin’s long, hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domain facilitates trafficking to the lysosome, extending its lumenal terminus with a GFP tag biases the protein toward this pathway. In contrast, we identify a conserved ER retention sequence that stabilizes N- and C-terminally tagged emerin by limiting its lysosomal flux. These findings underscore long-standing concerns about tagging artifacts and reveal novel determinants of tail-anchored INM protein targeting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inner nuclear membrane</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>secretory trafficking</kwd><kwd>protein tagging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014989</institution-id><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buchwalter</surname><given-names>Abigail</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000850</institution-id><institution>National Heart and Lung Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31HL170757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mella</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The inner nuclear membrane protein emerin readily traffics through the secretory pathway via its hydrophobic transmembrane domain when tagged with C-terminal GFP.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tail-anchored proteins of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) are a unique class of transmembrane proteins with poorly understood biosynthesis, targeting, and degradation. The INM is a specialized extension of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, the major site of membrane protein synthesis. Shortly after translation, tail-anchored proteins are embedded by their C-terminal transmembrane domains (TMDs) into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rapaport and Herrmann, 2023</xref>). Unlike cytoplasmic tail-anchored proteins, which rapidly traffic out of the ER toward their target membranes, INM proteins must remain in the ER long enough to diffuse through the nuclear pore complex and be retained by binding to nuclear structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>). This process repeats each time the nuclear envelope reforms at the end of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellenberg et al., 1997</xref>). INM proteins thus spend considerable time in the ER, but how they interact with the ER’s secretory or proteostatic functions remains unclear.</p><p>Our previous work identified emerin (EMD) as a short-lived INM protein in C2C12 mouse myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchwalter et al., 2019</xref>). While investigating how emerin is degraded, we found that C-terminally GFP-tagged emerin travels by vesicular transport to the Golgi, plasma membrane (PM), and then lysosome during ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchwalter et al., 2019</xref>) – an itinerary that closely tracks with the path taken by cargoes of the rapid ER stress-induced export pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Satpute-Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>). This unexpected secretory trafficking was prevented by the removal of EMD-GFP’s N-terminal LEM domain, suggesting that this domain played a role in stress-induced lysosomal degradation. We hypothesized that the INM might dynamically respond to ER stress by shunting emerin through the secretory pathway to the lysosome. However, we now find that N-terminally GFP-tagged emerin traffics at a lower rate than C-terminally tagged emerin and find no conclusive evidence that untagged emerin traffics to the lysosome. We also show that the secretory trafficking of tagged emerin depends on its unusually hydrophobic TMD. In isolation, the TMDs of both emerin and the related tail-anchored protein LAP2β readily traffic to the PM, but trafficking of the full-length tagged proteins is limited by a conserved RXR-type ER retention motif. Our experiments indicate that emerin’s trafficking is artifactually expedited by C-terminal GFP tagging. However, these studies identify sequence elements that target emerin to the contiguous nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum (NE/ER) network and highlight the interdependence between protein biogenesis, topology, and localization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>After our initial discovery, we aimed to understand the mechanism of emerin’s secretory trafficking and its conservation across species, cell types, and expression levels. As our earlier experiments used C2C12 mouse myoblasts, we first tested whether EMD-GFP trafficking is conserved in human cells. We stably expressed tet-inducible mouse and human GFP fusions in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells. When treated with the lysosome blocking agent bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), we found that U2OS cells, unlike C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchwalter et al., 2019</xref>), do not rely on ER stress to initiate secretory trafficking of EMD-GFP. Instead, BafA1 alone caused EMD-GFP to accumulate in lysosomal puncta. We used this high secretory flux to differentiate between emerin constructs that could and could not traffic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with our C2C12 findings, we verified that WT EMD-GFP could traffic to the lysosome of U2OS cells, while a construct lacking the N-terminal LEM domain (ΔLEM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) could not. Our constructs were tagged with a C-terminal/lumenal GFP, which allowed us to quantify the proportion of EMD-GFP in the secretory pathway using cell surface antibody labeling and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). We calculated the trafficking level of each construct by dividing the surface anti-GFP antibody signal by the total EMD-GFP fluorescence. In line with our microscopy experiments, the anti-GFP antibody did not detect any ΔLEM construct at the PM of U2OS cells, while the WT EMD-GFP PM signal was always above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EMD ΔLEM does not traffic in U2OS cells, while the transmembrane domain (TMD) alone does.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) U2OS cells expressing mouse EMD-GFP and ΔLEM-GFP were induced with 1 µg/mL doxycycline for 24 hr, treated with 100 nM lysosome blocking agent bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) overnight, and fixed and stained for lysosome marker Lamp1.

Emerin contains three major domains: an N-terminal LEM domain that interacts with the chromatin cross-linker BANF1/BAF, an intrinsically disordered region that binds the nuclear lamina, and a C-terminal TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We tested each domain’s ability to traffic through the secretory pathway with a series of domain truncation experiments. Having established that removing the LEM domain abolished emerin’s ability to traffic, we next deleted the disordered region between the LEM domain and the TMD. This construct (termed LEM-TMD) accumulated at the PM 10-fold more than the WT protein, indicating that the TMD, LEM domain, or both together are sufficient for trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested whether emerin’s TMD alone can travel to the PM. We removed all but the TMD alpha helix and its surrounding 26 residues (mEMD 212–259), which we found to be required for membrane insertion of the truncated construct (not shown), and appended this TMD-only construct to either the C- or N-terminus of eGFP. Both TMD-GFP and GFP-TMD localized prominently to the ER and PM, and both were evident in the lysosome after BafA1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). These experiments reveal that emerin’s TMD alone can traffic to the lysosome, regardless of GFP tag orientation.</p><p>We wondered what properties of emerin’s TMD mediate its secretion. Tail-anchored proteins can sort via their TMDs along the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ronchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borgese, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bulbarelli et al., 2002</xref>); long and hydrophobic sequences partition to the thicker, more hydrophobic membranes of the late secretory organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sharpe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), while tail-anchored proteins with shorter, less hydrophobic TMDs preferentially remain in the ER. We noticed that emerin’s TMD is particularly hydrophobic among other NE/ER TMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), which led us to predict that emerin’s TMD is required for its exit from the ER. To test this, we replaced emerin’s TMD with that of cytochrome B5, a model ER protein with a modestly hydrophobic TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pedrazzini et al., 2000</xref>). This substitution ablated trafficking through the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), indicating that emerin’s TMD is indeed necessary for trafficking. We tested whether this depended on the hydrophobic content of the alpha helix by sequentially mutating its aromatic residues to alanine. We divided the TMD into N- and C-terminal halves, mutating three aromatic amino acids in each half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The N-terminal TMD mutant was slightly less hydrophobic and had a greater effect on secretory trafficking than the C-terminal mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Combining the N- and C-terminal mutations additively reduced the surface ratio of EMD-GFP. While these mutations decreased the overall protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), they did not affect the protein’s topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), confirming that the observed loss of surface exposure was due to diminished secretory trafficking and not to defects in membrane insertion. These experiments indicate that manipulating the hydrophobicity and/or aromaticity of the TMD influences EMD-GFP’s transit to the cell surface.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Emerin’s trafficking depends on its transmembrane domain (TMD), not on the LEM domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface anti-GFP antibody:GFP histogram of human WT EMD, ΔLEM, and EMD with mouse cytochrome B5 TMD (EMD<sup>Cyb5 TMD</sup>) chimera.

Because EMD ΔLEM-GFP cannot traffic despite containing the TMD, we wondered whether a sequence within the ΔLEM construct inhibits trafficking. We noted that removing the LEM domain exposed a highly charged and conserved motTif (QRRR) on the N-terminus of the construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Poly-arginine (RXR) motifs are known negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi transit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Michelsen et al., 2005</xref>) we therefore tested whether this unprotected RXR could explain the ER-restricted localization of ΔLEM-GFP. Indeed, further truncating the ΔLEM construct by deleting the QRRR (ΔLEMΔQRRR) freed the protein from the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the RXR motif limits the trafficking of full-length EMD-GFP, we mutated the QRRR to AAAA (designated RA) and detected more flux to the PM compared to WT EMD-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Both ΔLEMΔQRRR-GFP and EMD RA-GFP were less abundant at steady state and were more rapidly degraded after removal of doxycycline from the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>), suggesting increased flux to the lysosome. These data indicate that the RXR motif constitutes an ER retention sequence in EMD-GFP that is strengthened by the removal of the LEM domain. We infer that the presence of the LEM domain modulates the accessibility of the RRR motif, while the LEM domain itself is in fact dispensable for trafficking, its removal constitutively exposes the RRR motif, enhancing emerin’s ER localization.</p><p>We next investigated the interplay between emerin’s pro-trafficking TMD and its anti-trafficking RXR motif by cloning the RA mutation into our TMD mutant constructs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). The RA mutation generally increased the surface expression of the TMD mutants except for the construct with the lowest hydrophobicity score (TMD<sup>m</sup>), which was not significantly altered by the RA mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). We infer from this that the TMD acts upstream of the RXR motif in emerin’s secretory trafficking, fitting with the hypothesis that low TMD hydrophobicity suffices to stably retain proteins in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ronchi et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>RXR motif limits transmembrane domain (TMD)-dependent trafficking of emerin and LAP2β without influencing COPI binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface anti-GFP:GFP histogram and (<bold>B</bold>) quantification of indicated RA+ TMD mutant combinations. ** indicates p=0.0021.

Another such protein is LAP2β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lomize et al., 2017</xref>), which shares several sequence features with emerin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We identified three RXR motifs within the LAP2β N-terminal domain, one of which (designated RXR1) is just downstream of the LEM-like fold – a striking similarity to emerin’s RXR motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To test whether the same localization mechanisms govern LAP2β, we tagged its C-terminus with GFP and expressed it in U2OS cells. LAP2β-GFP was detected at the cell surface, albeit at much lower levels than EMD-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Interestingly, replacing most of the LAP2β N-terminal domain with the soybean ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) enzyme caused a 20-fold increase in PM expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that the LAP2β TMD has a similar proclivity for secretory trafficking. Finally, mutating the LAP2β RXR1 to AAA led to a 70% increase in PM accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), mirroring the effect of the EMD RA mutation. Together, these data indicate that the emerin and LAP2β TMDs are insufficient for NE/ER targeting and that both proteins contain retention sequences which counteract TMD-dependent secretion.</p><p>RXR motifs are thought to bind COPI subunits to return escaped proteins to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Michelsen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Michelsen et al., 2007</xref>), though this mechanism is not understood. To test whether the increased trafficking of the RA mutant results from reduced COPI interaction, we immunoprecipitated N-terminally FLAG-tagged mouse emerin constructs from U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Mass spectrometry revealed a robust interaction between emerin and the COPI coat, with several COPI subunits ranking among the top hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Surprisingly, however, this interaction was not weakened by the RXR mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We noted that the mouse EMD bait also co-immunoprecipitated endogenous human EMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), opening the possibility that COPI might indirectly interact with both FLAG constructs via endogenous emerin. Alternatively, the RXR motif’s function could depend on protein topology. Importantly, while we were able to detect FLAG-EMD in the lysosome by immunofluorescence (IF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), FLAG-RA construct was not poorly expressed relative to FLAG-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) in contrast to RA-GFP compared to WT-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). We also noted that the lysosomal accumulation of N-terminally FLAG-tagged emerin was more subtle than the C-terminally GFP-tagged version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>), indicating that epitope tagging and/or tag orientation influences the extent of emerin protein turnover.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>C-terminal tagging destabilizes emerin via secretory trafficking</title><p>To determine whether tagging and/or overexpression increase the extent of emerin trafficking, we needed a system to better control emerin expression.

The steady-state abundance reflected these trafficking patterns. The GFP fluorescence of the TMD mutant accumulated to higher levels, indicating that it was stabilized by its inability to traffic. In contrast, the RA mutant fluorescence was slightly lower, indicating that it was modestly less stable than the WT protein, although this difference is not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>).

However, after discovering ways to limit lysosomal flux (via the TMD) or accelerate it (via the RXR motif), we reasoned that the trafficking patterns of tail-anchored mutants could be inferred from their steady-state abundance when expressed from the DICE landing pad. To test whether the GFP tag orientation affects protein expression, we compared the steady-state fluorescence of N- and C-terminally tagged mutants. Surprisingly, the N-terminally tagged (tail-anchored) GFP fusions were four to five times more abundant than the C-terminally tagged (single pass) fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). C-terminal fusions were also more completely relocalized to the lysosome after BafA1 than N-terminal fusions, where NE/ER EMD signal was still apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Unlike the C-terminal fusions, the N-terminally tagged TMD mutant did not accumulate more than the N-terminally tagged WT protein, suggesting that N-terminally tagged emerin is not destabilized by trafficking. We interpret this finding with caution, as we observed a slight decrease in the level of the N-terminally tagged TMD mutant compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Since the insertion of tail-anchored proteins relies on TMD hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rapaport and Herrmann, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shao and Hegde, 2011</xref>), improper targeting to the ER membrane due to TMD mutation would confound our conclusion that N-terminally tagged constructs undergo similarly low levels of trafficking. Interestingly, upon treatment with BafA1, the N-terminally tagged WT and RA constructs formed GFP+ lysosomal puncta, while the N-terminally tagged TMD mutant did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This suggests that N-terminally tagged emerin does undergo some level of TMD-dependent trafficking. Further, the N-terminal RA fusion was slightly less fluorescent at steady state than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), indicating that the RXR motif also stabilizes tail-anchored GFP-EMD.</p><p>Because of the profound differences in the distribution of N- and C-terminally tagged constructs, we investigated how lumenal GFP affects emerin’s early secretory trafficking by analyzing its enrichment in ER exit sites (ERES). ER cargoes that are actively packaged into ERES can be distinguished from bulk flow secretory cargoes by incubating cells at 10°C, where ERES form and cargoes accumulate but cannot progress toward the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mezzacasa and Helenius, 2002</xref>). We compared the co-localization of endogenous untagged emerin, WT-GFP, and TMD<sup>m</sup>-GFP with the ERES marker SEC31 at 37°C and 10°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). We found that GFP-tagged emerin co-localized with SEC31 at steady state, while this was not the case for endogenous emerin or the tagged TMD mutant. ERES co-localization was not increased at 10°C for any of the emerin variants analyzed, indicating that emerin does not contain specific ER exit signals.</p><p>Collectively, these data indicate that N- and C-terminally tagged emerin constructs travel to the lysosome via their hydrophobic TMDs, although C-terminal tags accelerate this trafficking by encouraging bulk flow ER exit.</p><p>Finally, we integrated untagged WT, RA, and TMD mutant constructs into EMD KO landing pad cells, then fixed and stained cells for confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. We saw no apparent differences in the localization or intensity of any of the emerin mutants, though the data were considerably noisier than the steady-state GFP measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We were also unable to detect untagged emerin in the lysosome after BafA1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting it does not traffic through the secretory pathway. However, the sensitivity of these assays may be limited by fixation, permeabilization, and antibody staining; therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that small differences do exist between untagged emerin variants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we dissected how exogenous epitope tags and intrinsic sequence elements influence the secretory trafficking of the INM-resident protein emerin. We discovered that the aromatic amino acids in emerin’s 23-residue TMD facilitate its travel to the lysosome. In the absence of other signals, TMD length and hydrophobicity are sufficient to partition tail-anchored proteins along the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ronchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borgese, 2016</xref>). The biophysical properties of the emerin and LAP2β TMDs resemble PM, rather than ER, resident TMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sharpe et al., 2010</xref>). However, this notable hydrophobicity is likely important for the proteins’ biogenesis. Tail-anchored proteins with very hydrophobic TMDs are posttranslationally targeted by the TRC40/GET complex, which captures C-terminal alpha helices after they emerge from the ribosome and delivers them to the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rapaport and Herrmann, 2023</xref>). Emerin and Lap2β are established TRC40 client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coy-Vergara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pfaff et al., 2016</xref>), so their hydrophobic TMDs are likely required for TRC40 recognition. However, adding a C-terminal GFP converts a tail-anchored protein to a single-pass transmembrane protein, which will instead be co-translationally targeted to the ER by the SRP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shao and Hegde, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Walter et al., 1981</xref>). Our results indicate that this change in topology displaces emerin, making C-terminally tagged emerin less stable and more prone to lysosomal trafficking than its N-terminally tagged counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistently, we found that only lumenally tagged emerin sampled ERES, and that this was reduced by manipulating the TMD hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). This suggests that hydrophobic TMDs are less energetically favored within the ER membrane when attached to a lumenal domain, or that different biogenesis pathways bias cargoes toward ER exit.</p><p>We hypothesize that active ER retention plays a role in INM protein targeting. In interphase, emerin is not entirely sequestered at the INM by the nuclear lamina; a pool of emerin protein remains in the peripheral ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nastały et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Salpingidou et al., 2007</xref>). The intrinsic ability of emerin’s TMD to traffic from the ER implies that a limiting mechanism must exist to bias the protein toward diffusion to the INM. Emerin could stably reside in the ER in part by binding to other ER-resident proteins. Interestingly, emerin was reported to interact with the ER tethering protein MOSPD3 via its YEESY (95-99) motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabukusta et al., 2020</xref>), which we previously found to limit trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchwalter et al., 2019</xref>). While both TMDs traffic to the PM, full-length LAP2β-GFP is more retained in the NE/ER than EMD-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), indicating that the N-terminal domains limit trafficking to different extents.</p><p>We identified the RXR motif as a shared negative regulator of TMD-dependent trafficking, prompting us to revise our original model: the exposure of this motif, not the absence of the LEM domain, prevents ER exit of EMD-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). This suggests that the sequences around the RXR motif influence its activity by steric occlusion or other mechanisms. RXR motifs prevent the ER exit of some PM-resident proteins until they are masked by oligomerization, thus coupling ER exit to folding and/or assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Michelsen et al., 2005</xref>). Like the canonical ER retrieval motif KKXX, RXR motifs are thought to engage COPI subunits to return escaped ER membrane proteins from the early Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Michelsen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Marcello et al., 2010</xref>). Yeast-2-hybrid experiments predicted RXR signals to interact with the beta and delta subunits of the COPI coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Michelsen et al., 2007</xref>), though the molecular details are still unclear. Contrary to KKXX motifs, found only on C-termini, RXR motifs may be on N-termini or within a polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Michelsen et al., 2005</xref>). Truncated, lumenally tagged variants of Sun2, another tail-anchored INM protein, require a poly-arginine motif to prevent mislocalization to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Turgay et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Turgay et al., 2010</xref>, observed purified Sun2 RXR mutants losing interaction with COPI subunits in GST pull-down assays. In contrast, we did not observe loss of COPI binding in our RXR mutant immunoprecipitations. This discrepancy may be explained by differences in methods (purified recombinant protein binding assays vs native IP) or by oligomerization of tagged emerin with endogenous emerin to indirectly bind COPI in lysate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>). Emerin’s interaction with the COPI coat was recently detected by proximity biotinylation in mouse P19 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, emerin was the only non-Golgi-resident protein identified in the gamma-COP subunit interactome, indicating that endogenous emerin might be a COPI cargo. While we predict this interaction occurs via emerin’s RXR motif, we cannot exclude the possibility of other COPI-interacting mechanisms.</p><p>Our previous work identified EMD as an unstable protein subject to significant lysosomal flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchwalter et al., 2019</xref>). However, we have now discovered that emerin’s trafficking is markedly promoted by C-terminal GFP tagging, likely influencing many of our initial observations. While we used C-terminal tags to avoid disrupting emerin’s N-terminal interactions with chromatin and lamins, this approach inadvertently altered its localization. We did detect trafficking of N-terminally tagged emerin but found that it occurs at a much lower rate. We conclude that hydrophobic tail-anchored TMDs are readily dislocated by C-terminal tags and echo the warnings raised by generations of cell biologists regarding tag-induced localization artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stadler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Montecinos-Franjola et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Margolin, 2012</xref>). We did not detect trafficking of the untagged emerin constructs. Nonetheless, because trafficking is detectable at or below endogenous levels with different tags and orientations, we cannot rule out the possibility that emerin traffics under specific conditions. We note poor correlation of emerin transcript and protein across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which suggests protein-level regulation that may dynamically regulate emerin levels. While we still do not know whether emerin’s ability to travel beyond the NE/ER influences its function, our experiments reveal an unanticipated connection between the topology and localization of INM proteins and raise new questions about the balance between secretion and retention of INM-destined proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and cell line generation</title><p>U2OS cells were obtained from and verified by the UCSF Cell and Genome Engineering Core.

Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, lifted for 3–5 min with accutase, then quenched with cold complete media. Cells were transferred to microfuge tubes and placed on ice for the duration of staining and washing. Cells were pelleted 800×<italic>g</italic> for 3 min at 4°C, then washed once in 2% FBS/PBS. Cells were stained in 80 µL anti-GFP 647 (1:20 in 2% FBS/PBS) or anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody (1:200 in 2% FBS/PBS) as a negative control. The cells used for the anti-IgG controls were WT EMD-GFP (for all EMD comparisons) or WT LAP2β-GFP (for LAP2β comparisons). After staining for 30 min, cells were diluted with 200 µL 2% FBS/PBS, pelleted and washed twice with 400 µL 2% FBS/PBS, and then optionally fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA/PBS) for 10 min at room temperature.

After washing twice in PBS, cells were permeabilized in IF buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% SDS, 10 mg/mL BSA in PBS) for 30 min before incubating in primary antibody solution for 1–2 hr at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in IF buffer, incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies for 1 hr, and then washed three more times before being strained into FACS tubes.</p><p>Cells were analyzed on a BD FACSVerse or a Thermo Fisher Attune NxT. At least 50,000 cells were analyzed per sample. Flow cytometry data were analyzed in FlowJo. Surface antibody:GFP ratio was obtained using the ‘derive parameters’ function and applied to the GFP+ populations. Histograms are normalized to the mode of each sample for visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Cells were seeded in Ibidi culture chambers (Matrigel-coated for hiPSCs) prior to an IF experiment. For lysosome co-localization analysis, cells were treated with 100 nM bafilomycin A1 for 16–18 hr. Cells were washed in PBS, then fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. For LAMP1 staining, cells were permeabilized in 0.1% digitonin/PBS at 4°C for 10 min, then blocked in 2% FBS/PBS. LAMP1 antibody was diluted 1:200 in 2% FBS/PBS. For emerin and FLAG immunostaining, fixed cells were permeabilized in IF buffer for 30 min, then incubated in primary antibodies (diluted 1:250 and 1:1000 in IF buffer, respectively) for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33342 (both 1:1000) for 30 min at room temperature. Emerin/FLAG staining is incompatible with LAMP1 staining because of differential permeabilization requirements. In these cases, we had to rely on the formation of EMD+ puncta after bafilomycin treatment to infer lysosome localization.</p><p>Selective permeabilization and ERES co-localization temperature blocks were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vander Heyden et al., 2011</xref>). For selective permeabilization topology analysis, U2OS cells were induced with doxycycline for 24 hr, washed with cold PBS, and incubated with cold 0.0025% digitonin/PBS or PBS only for 5 min at 4°C. Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA for 5 min at room temperature. To permeabilize all endomembranes, cells were incubated with IF buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% SDS, 10 mg/mL) BSA in PBS for 30 min, then stained with anti-EMD and anti-GFP antibodies diluted in 2% FBS/PBS.</p><p>For ERES co-localization, EMD-GFP U2OS cells were induced with doxycycline for 4 hr or left uninduced to analyze newly synthesized or endogenous emerin, respectively.

Lysates were probe-sonicated in six rounds of 10 s pulses at 20% power, then spun 17,000×<italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 25 min. The supernatant was added to 40 µL FLAG M2 magnetic beads which had been calibrated in 500 µL lysis buffer and separated on a magnetic stand. Samples were incubated end over end at room temperature for 1 hr, then magnetically separated and washed three times with 1 mL wash buffer (100 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, protease inhibitors). After the final wash, the supernatant was discarded, and the beads were resuspended in 200 µL elution buffer (100 µg/mL 3× FLAG peptide in wash buffer) and eluted for 1 hr at room temperature. Eluates were precipitated with four volumes of ice-cold acetone overnight at –20°C, spun at maximum speed for 5 min, then air-dried.

In that prior publication, we showed that emerin-GFP arrives at the lysosome by secretion and exposure at the PM, followed by internalization. While we state these previous findings in this manuscript, we did not explicitly restate here how we came to that conclusion. In the 2019 study, we (i) engineered in a glycosylation site, which demonstrated that emerin-GFP receives complex, Endo H-resistant N-glycans, indicating passage through the Golgi; (ii) performed cell surface labeling, which confirmed that emerin accesses the PM; and interfered with (iii) the early secretory pathway using brefeldin A and with (iv) lysosomal function using bafilomycin A1. Further, we ruled out autophagy as a major contributor to emerin trafficking by treating cells with the PI3K inhibitor KU55933, which had no effect on emerin’s lysosomal delivery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful if the topology of constructs could be directly demonstrated by pulse-labelling and protease protection. It's possible that there are mixed pools of both topologies that might complicate interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We demonstrate that emerin’s TMD inserts in a tail-anchored orientation (C terminus in ER lumen) by appending a GFP tag to either the N or C terminus, followed by anti-GFP antibody labeling of unpermeabilized cells (Fig. 1G). This shows the preferred topology of emerin’s wild type TMD.</p><p>As the reviewer points out, it is possible that our manipulations of the TMD sequence (Fig. 2D-E) alter its preferred topology of membrane insertion. We addressed this question by performing anti-GFP and anti-emerin antibody labeling of the less hydrophobic TMD mutant (EMD-TMDm-GFP) after selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane (Figure 2 supplement, panel F). If emerin biogenesis is normal, the GFP tag should face the ER lumen while the emerin antibody epitope should be cytosolic. If the fidelity of emerin’s membrane insertion is impaired, the GFP tag could be exposed to the cytosol (flipped orientation), which would be detected by anti-GFP labeling upon plasma membrane permeabilization. We find that the C-terminal GFP tag is completely inaccessible to antibody when the PM is selectively permeabilized with digitonin, but is readily detected when all intracellular membranes are permeabilized with Triton-X-100. These data confirm that mutating emerin’s TMD does not disrupt the protein’s membrane topology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, Mella et al. investigate the effect of GFP tagging on the localization and stability of the nuclear-localized tail-anchored (TA) protein Emerin. A previous study from this group showed that C-terminally GFP-tagged Emerin protein traffics to the plasma membrane and reaches lysosomes for degradation. It is suggested that the C-terminal tagging of tail-anchored proteins shifts their insertion from the post-translational TRC/GET pathway to the co-translational SRP-mediated pathway. The authors of this paper found that C-terminal GFP tagging causes Emerin to localize to the plasma membrane and eventually reach lysosomes. They investigated the mechanism by which Emerin-GFP moves to the secretory pathway. By manipulating the cytosolic domain and the hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain (TMD), the authors identify that an ER retention sequence and strong TMD hydrophobicity contribute to Emerin trafficking to the secretory pathway. Overall, the data are solid, and the knowledge will be useful to the field. However, the authors do not fully answer the question of why C-terminally GFP-tagged Emerin moves to the secretory pathway. Importantly, the authors did not consider the possible roles of GFP in the ER lumen influencing Emerin trafficking to the secretory pathway.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>(1) The authors suggest that an ER retention sequence and high hydrophobicity of Emerin TMD contribute to its trafficking to the secretory pathway. However, these two features are also present in WT Emerin, which correctly localizes to the inner nuclear membrane. Additionally, the authors show that the ER retention sequence is normally obscured by the LEM domain. The key difference between WT Emerin and Emerin-GFP is the presence of GFP in the ER lumen. The authors missed investigating the role of GFP in the ER lumen in influencing Emerin trafficking to the secretory pathway. It is likely that COPII carrier vesicles capture GFP protein in the lumen as part of the bulk flow mechanism for transport to the Golgi compartment. The authors could easily test this by appending a KDEL sequence to the C-terminus of GFP; this should now redirect the protein to the nucleus.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point that the presence of lumenal GFP somehow promotes secretion of emerin from the ER, likely at the stage of enhancing its packaging into COPII vesicles. We struggle to think about how to interpret the KDEL tagging experiment that the reviewer proposes, as the KDEL receptor predominantly recycles soluble proteins from the Golgi to the ER, while emerin is a membrane protein; and we have shown that emerin already contains a putative COPI-interacting RRR recycling motif in its cytosolic domain.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that it is worthwhile to test the possibility that addition of GFP to emerin’s C-terminus promotes capture by COPII vesicles. We have evaluated this question by performing temperature block experiments to cause cargo accumulation within stalled COPII-coated ER exit sites, then comparing the propensity of various untagged and tagged emerin variants to enrich in ER exit sites as judged by colocalization with the COPII subunit Sec31a. These data now appear in Figure 4 supplement 1. These experiments indicate that emerin-GFP samples ER exit sites significantly more than does untagged emerin. Further, the ER exit site enrichment of emerin-GFP is dampened by shortening emerin’s TMD. We do not see further enrichment of any emerin variant in ER exit sites when COPII vesicle budding is stalled by low temperature incubation, implying that emerin lacks any positive sorting signals that direct its selective enrichment in COPII vesicles. Altogether, these data indicate that both emerin’s long and hydrophobic TMD and the addition of a lumenal GFP tag increase emerin’s propensity to sample ER exit sites and undergo non-selective, “bulk flow” ER export.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors nicely demonstrate that the hydrophobicity of Emerin TMD plays a role in its secretory trafficking. I wonder if this feature may be beneficial for cells to degrade newly synthesized Emerin via the lysosomal pathway during mitosis, as the nuclear envelope breakdown may prevent the correct localization of newly synthesized Emerin. The authors could test Emerin localization during mitosis. Such findings could add to the physiological significance of their findings. At the minimum, they should discuss this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. It is attractive to speculate that secretory trafficking might enable lysosomal degradation of emerin during mitosis, when its lamin anchor has been depolymerized. However, we think it is unlikely that mitotic trafficking contributes significantly to the turnover flux of untagged emerin; if it did, we would expect to see higher steady state levels and/or slowed turnover of emerin mutants that cannot traffic to the lysosome. We did not observe this outcome. Instead, mutations that enhance (RA) or impair (TMDm) emerin trafficking had no effect on the untagged protein’s steady-state levels (Fig. 4G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>(1) On page 7, the authors note that &quot;FLAG-RA construct was not poorly expressed relative to WR, in contrast with RA-GFP (Figures S3C, 2I).&quot; The expression levels of these proteins cannot be compared across two different blots.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion; we were implying two distinct comparisons to internal controls present on each blot. We have adjusted the text to read “FLAG-RA construct was not poorly expressed relative to FLAG-WT (Fig. S3C) in contrast to RA-GFP compared to WT-GFP (Fig. 2I).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the first paragraph of the discussion, the authors suggest that aromatic amino acids facilitate trafficking to lysosomes. However, they only replaced aromatic amino acids with alanine residues. If they want to make this claim, they should test other amino acids, particularly hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer may be inferring more import from our statement than we intended. We focused on these aromatic residues within the TMD because they contribute strongly to its overall hydrophobicity. Experimentally, we determined that nonconservative alanine substitutions of these aromatic residues inhibited trafficking. We do not state and do not intend to imply that the aromatic character of these residues specifically influences trafficking propensity, and we agree with the reviewer that to test such a question would require additional substitutions with non-aromatic hydrophobic amino acids.</p><p>We realize that our phrasing may have been misleading by opening with discussion of the aromatic amino acids; in the revised discussion paragraph, we instead lead with discussion of TMD hydrophobicity, and then state how the specific substitutions we made affect trafficking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewing Editor comments:</p><p>While reviewer 1 did not provide any recommendations to the authors, I agree with this reviewer that the authors should validate the topology of their tagged proteins (at least for the one used to draw key conclusions). Given that Emerin is a tail-anchored protein, having a big GFP tag at the C-terminus could mess up ER insertion, causing the protein to take a wrong topology or even be mislocalized in the cytosol, particularly under overexpression conditions. In either case, it can be subject to quality control-dependent clearance via either autophagy, ERphagy, or ER-to-lysosome trafficking. I think that the authors should try a few straightforward experiments such as brefeldin A treatment or dominant negative Sar1 expression to test whether blocking conventional ER-to-Golgi trafficking affects lysosomal delivery of Emerin. I also think that the authors should discuss their findings in the context of the RESET pathway reported previously (PMID: 25083867). The ER stress-dependent trafficking of tagged Emerin to the PM and lysosomes appears to follow a similar trafficking pattern as RESET, although the authors did not demonstrate that Emerin traffic to lysosomes via the PM. In this regard, they should tone down their conclusion and discuss their findings in the context of the RESET pathway, which could serve as a model for their substrate.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that validating the topology of TMD mutants is important, and now include these experiments in the revised manuscript (please see our response to Reviewer 1 above).</p><p>Please see our response to Reviewer 1’s public review; we previously determined that emerin-GFP undergoes ER-to-Golgi trafficking (see our 2019 study).</p><p>We recognize the major parallels between our findings and the RESET pathway. In our 2019 study, we found that similarly to other RESET cargoes, emerin-GFP travels through the secretory pathway, is exposed at the PM, and is then internalized and delivered to lysosomes. We discussed these strong parallels to RESET in our 2019 study. In this revised manuscript, we now also point out the parallels between emerin trafficking and RESET and cite the 2014 study by Satpute-Krishnan and colleagues (PMID 25083867)</p></body></sub-article></article>
