Disruptions to these cause a significant number of human birth defects, including ocular coloboma. We provide robust spatial-temporal staging and unique anatomical detail of optic fissure closure (OFC) in the embryonic chick, including evidence for roles of apoptosis and epithelial remodelling. We performed complementary transcriptomic profiling and show that <italic>Netrin</italic>-1 (<italic>NTN1</italic>) is precisely expressed in the chick fissure margin during fusion but is immediately downregulated after fusion. We further provide a combination of protein localisation and phenotypic evidence in chick, humans, mice and zebrafish that Netrin-1 has an evolutionarily conserved and essential requirement for OFC, and is likely to have an important role in palate fusion. Our data suggest that <italic>NTN1</italic> is a strong candidate locus for human coloboma and other multi-system developmental fusion defects, and show that chick OFC is a powerful model for epithelial fusion research.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43877.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our bodies are made of many different groups of cells, which are arranged into tissues that perform specific roles. As tissues form in the embryo they must adopt precise three-dimensional structures, depending on their position in the body. In many cases this involves two edges of tissue fusing together to prevent gaps being present in the final structure.</p><p>In individuals with a condition called ocular coloboma some of the tissues in the eyes fail to merge together correctly, leading to wide gaps that can severely affect vision. There are currently no treatments available for ocular coloboma and in over 70% of patients the cause of the defect is not known. Identifying new genes that control how tissues fuse may help researchers to find what causes this condition and multiple other tissue fusion defects, and establish whether these may be preventable in the future.</p><p>Much of what is currently known about how tissues fuse has come from studying mice and zebrafish embryos. Although the extensive genetic tools available in these âmodelsâ have proved very useful, both offer only a limited time window for observing tissues as they fuse, and the regions involved are very small. Chick embryos, on the other hand, are much larger than mouse or zebrafish embryos and are easier to access from within their eggs. This led Hardy et al. to investigate whether the developing chick eye could be a more useful model for studying the precise details of how tissues merge.</p><p>Examining chick embryos revealed that tissues in the base of their eyes fuse between five and eight days after the egg had been fertilised, a comparatively long time compared to existing models. Also, many of the genes that Hardy et al. found switched on in chick eyes as the tissues merged had previously been identified as being essential for tissue fusion in humans. However, several new genes were also shown to be involved in the fusing process. For example, Netrin-1 was important for tissues to fuse in the eyes as well as in other regions of the developing embryo.</p><p>These findings demonstrate that the chick eye is an excellent new model system to study how tissues fuse in animals. Furthermore, the genes identified by Hardy et al. may help researchers to identify the genetic causes of ocular coloboma and other tissue fusion defects in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fusion of epithelia is an essential process during normal human development and its dysregulation can result in birth defects affecting the eye, heart, palate, neural tube, and multiple other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ray and Niswander, 2012</xref>). These can be highly disabling and are among the most common human birth defects, with prevalence as high as 1 in 500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ray and Niswander, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morrison et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nikolopoulou et al., 2017</xref>). Fusion in multiple embryonic contexts displays both confounding differences and significant common mechanistic overlaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ray and Niswander, 2012</xref>). Most causative mutations have been identified in genes encoding transcription factors or signalling molecules that regulate the early events that guide initial patterning and outgrowth of epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ray and Niswander, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nikolopoulou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patel and Sowden, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kohli and Kohli, 2012</xref>). However, the true developmental basis of these disorders is more complex and a major challenge remains to fully understand the behaviours of epithelial cells directly involved in the fusion process.</p><p>Ocular coloboma (OC) is a structural eye defect that presents as missing tissue or a gap in the iris, ciliary body, choroid, retina and/or optic nerve. It arises from a failure of fusion at the optic fissure (OF; also referred to as the <italic>choroid fissure</italic>) in the ventral region of the embryonic eye cup early in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patel and Sowden, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Onwochei et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gregory-Evans et al., 2004</xref>). OC is the most common human congenital eye malformation and is a leading cause of childhood blindness that persists throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morrison et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williamson and FitzPatrick, 2014</xref>). No treatments or preventative measures for coloboma are currently available.</p><p>The process of opticÂ fissureÂ closure (OFC) requires the coordinated contributions of various cell types in the fusion environment along the proximal-distalÂ (PD)Â axis of the ventral eye cup (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patel and Sowden, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Onwochei et al., 2000</xref>). In all vertebrates studied so far, these include epithelial cells of both the neural retina (NR)Â and retinal pigmented epitheliumÂ (RPE), and periocular mesenchymal (POM) cells of neural crest origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patel and Sowden, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">OâRahilly, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hero, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hero, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gestri et al., 2018</xref>). As the eye cup grows, the fissure margins come into apposition along the PDÂ axis and POM cells are gradually excluded. Through unknown mechanisms, the basal lamina that surround each opposing margin are either breached or dissolved and epithelial cells from each side intercalate and then subsequently reorganise to form a continuum of NR and RPE, complete with a continuous basal lamina. The function, requirement and behaviour of these epithelial cells in the fusing tissue, and their fates after fusion, are not well understood.</p><p>Some limited epidemiological evidence suggests environmental factors may contribute to coloboma incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gregory-Evans et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hornby et al., 2003</xref>). However, the disease is largely of genetic origin, with as many 39 monogenic OC-linked loci so far identified in humans and the existence of further candidates is strongly supported by evidence in gene-specific animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patel and Sowden, 2019</xref>). Most known mutations cause syndromal coloboma, where the eye defect is associated with multiple systemic defects. A common form of syndromal coloboma is CHARGE syndrome (MIM 214800) for which coloboma, choanal atresia, vestibular (inner-ear) and heart fusion defects are defining phenotypic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Verloes, 2005</xref>). Palate fusion defects and orofacial-clefting are common additional features of CHARGE (~20% of cases) and in other monogenic syndromal colobomas (e.g. from deleterious mutations in <italic>YAP1</italic>, <italic>MAB21L1</italic>, and <italic>TFAP2A</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rainger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Williamson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 1992</xref>]), suggestive of common genetic mechanisms and aetiologies, and pleiotropic gene function.</p><p>Isolated (i.e. non-syndromal) OC may be associated with microphthalmia (small eye), and the majority of these cases are caused by mutations in a limited number of transcription-factor encoding genes that regulate early eye development (e.g. <italic>PAX6</italic>, <italic>VSX2</italic> and <italic>MAF</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patel and Sowden, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williamson and FitzPatrick, 2014</xref>]), implying that abnormal growth of the eye prevents correct OF margin apposition and that fusion defects are a secondary or an indirect phenotype. Indeed, none of these genes have yet been implicated with direct functional roles in epithelial fusion. However, many isolated coloboma cases also exist without microphthalmia, suggesting that in these patients, eye growth occurs normally but the fusion process itself is defective. These OCs are highly genetically heterogeneous and known loci are not recurrent among non-related patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rainger et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, despite large-scale sequencing projects, over 70% of all cases remain without a genetic cause identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rainger et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The most effective and informative models for studying OFC so far have been mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>). Both have significant experimental advantages, including powerful genetics and robust genomic data. In particular, live-cell imaging with fluorescent zebrafish embryos has proven to be useful in revealing some intricate cell behaviours at the fissure margin during fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gestri et al., 2018</xref>). However, both models are restrictive for in-depth molecular investigations due to their limited temporal windows of fusion progression and the number of cells actively mediating fusion and subsequent epithelial remodelling.</p><p>Here, we present accurate staging and anatomical detail of the process of chick OFC. We show the expansive developmental window of fusion, and the sizable fusion seam available for experimentation and analysis. We take advantage of this to perform transcriptional profiling at key discrete stages during fusion and show significant enrichment for known human OFC genes, and reveal multiple genes not previously associated with OFC. Our analyses also identified specific cellular behaviours at the fusion plate and found that apoptosis was a prominent feature during chick OFC. Furthermore, we reveal Netrin-1 as a mediator of OFC that is essential for normal eye development in evolutionarily diverse vertebrates, and that has a specific requirement during fusion in multiple developmental contexts. This study presents the chick as a powerful model system for further OFC research, provides strong evidence for a novel candidate gene for ocular coloboma, and directly links epithelial fusion processes in the eye with those in broader embryonic tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OFC in the chick occurred within a wide spatial and temporal window</title><p>The eye is the foremost observable feature in the chick embryo and grows exponentially through development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The optic fissure margin (OFM) was first identifiable as a non-pigmented region at the ventral aspect of the eye that narrowed markedly in a temporal sequence as the eye increased in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To gain a clearer overview of gross fissure closure dynamics we first analysed a complete series of resected flat-mounted ventral eye tissue from accurately staged embryos at Hamburger Hamilton stages (HH.St) 25 through to HH.St34 (<italic>n</italic>Â &gt;Â 10 per stage; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The OFM was positioned along the proximal-distal (P-D) axis of the eye, from the pupillary (or collar) region of the iris to the optic nerve. Progressive narrowing of the OFM was observed between HH.St27 to HH.St31, characterised by the appearance of fused OFM in the midline that separated the non-pigmented iris from the posterior OFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Both these latter regions remained unpigmented throughout development and we found they were associated, respectively, with the development of the optic nerve and the pecten oculi - a homeostasis-mediating structure that extends out into the vitreous from the optic nerve head and is embedded in the proximal OFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wisely et al., 2017</xref>). The distal region of the pecten was attached to blood vessels that invade the eye globe through the open region of the iris OFM. This iris region remained open throughout development and well after hatching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). A recent study reported that the proximalÂ chick OFM closes via the intercalation of incoming astrocytes and the outgoing optic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 2018</xref>), in a process that does not reflect the epithelial fusion seen during human OFC (e.g. mediated by epithelial cells of the RPE and neural retina) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">OâRahilly, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 2018</xref>).

We then combined these data with fusion seam length measurements taken from flat mounted fissures to provide a robust quantitative framework of fusion progression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

Fusion was first initiated between HH.St27-28 as confirmed by the definitive appearance of joined epithelial margins at a single fusion point (FP). By HH.St29, the fused area had expanded to generate a fused seam of 0.56 mm (SD:Â Â±Â 0.12 mm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1dâe</xref>) with two fusion plates, FP1 and FP2 at the distal and proximal limits, respectively.

Pseudoalignment to the Ensembl chicken transcriptome identified 30,265 expressed transcripts across all tissue types.

The transient and specific <italic>NTN1</italic> expression at the fusion plate, and the subsequent reduction/loss in fused OFM, suggests NTN1 has a direct role in the fusion process. Indeed, Netrin1-deficient mouse eyes displayed highly penetrant colobomas but their fissure margins were normally apposed during fusion initiation, arguing against a broad failure of early eye development. In further support for a direct role in epithelial fusion was previously published work showing fusion failure during development of the vestibular system of both chick and mice where <italic>NTN1</italic>-expression was manipulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salminen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishitani et al., 2017</xref>). In this developmental context, otic epithelia must fuse normally for the correct formation of the semicircular canal structures. Although we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richardson et al., 2019</xref>) found coloboma in zebrafish knockdown experiments of <italic>ntn1a</italic>, we observed coloboma with microphthalmia in the context of complete knockout of <italic>ntn1a</italic>. This more severe phenotype in the complete absence of ntn1a implies there could be a more general requirement for Netrin-1 during early eye development, or could reflect teleost-specific eye developmental processes not shared among higher vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martinez-Morales et al., 2017</xref>). Further work is required to elucidate the precise role of Netrin-1 during OFC and broader eye development among different species.</p><p>Taken in combination, these findings strongly implicate NTN1 as a multipotent factor required for tissue fusion in multiple distinct developmental contexts. In humans, variants near <italic>NTN1</italic> have been associated with cleft lip in human genome wide association studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leslie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leslie et al., 2015</xref>). While these are not monogenic disease mutations, this observation adds additional further relevance for future genetic studies of patients with coloboma. It is also consistent with our observations in <italic>Netrin-1</italic> knock-out animals having a high penetrance of both coloboma and cleft palate phenotypes. Therefore, we propose that <italic>NTN1</italic> should be included as a candidate gene in diagnostic sequencing of patients with human ocular coloboma, and should also be carefully considered for those with other congenital malformations involving defective fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NTN1 may have a role in CHARGE syndrome</title><p>Coloboma in association with additional fusion defects of the inner ear are two of the key clinical classifications for a diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Verloes, 2005</xref>). Further phenotypes commonly associated with the syndrome are septal heart defects and orofacial clefting, both with aetiologies likely to involve fusion defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ray and Niswander, 2012</xref>). CHARGE syndrome cases are predominantly caused by heterozygous loss-of-function pathogenic variants in the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (<italic>CHD7</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vissers et al., 2004</xref>).

In addition, ChIP-seq analyses have shown direct binding of Chd7 to the promoter region of <italic>Ntn1</italic> in mouse neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engelen et al., 2011</xref>). Given the amount of tissue available in the chick model, it would be possible and intriguing to confirm whether CHD7 directly regulates <italic>NTN1</italic> expression <italic>in ovo</italic> in the chick optic fissure. There is also emerging evidence that CHD7 and the vitamin A derivative retinoic acid (RA) indirectly interact at the genetic level during inner ear development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). Defective RA signalling also leads to significant reduction of <italic>Ntn1</italic> expression in the zebrafish OFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lupo et al., 2011</xref>), implicating a possible genetic network involving RA and <italic>CHD7,</italic> where <italic>NTN1</italic> could directly mediate developmental fusion mechanisms from these hierarchical influences.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>How does Netrin-1 mediate fusion?</title><p>Netrin-1 is well-studied for its canonical roles in guidance of commissural and peripheral motor axons and growth-cone dynamics, with attraction or repulsion mediated depending on the co-expression of specific receptors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Larrieu-Lahargue et al., 2012</xref>). We found that axonal processes were absent from the chick fissure margin during fusion stages, suggesting that the normal function of NTN1 may be to prevent axon ingression into the OFM to permit fusion. However, the phenotypic evidence from both the palate and vestibular system strongly support the argument that NTN1 has a non-guidance mechanistic role duringÂ OFC. Netrin orthologues have been recently associated with the regulation of cell migration and epithelial plasticity in the apparent absence of co-localised canonical Netrin-1Â receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manhire-Heath et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yan et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, netrin acting together with its receptor neogenin combined to mediate close adhesion of cell layers in the developing terminal end buds during lung branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Srinivasan et al., 2003</xref>). Although we observed strong <italic>NTN1</italic> expression in cells lining the chick OFM, and similar localisation of Netrin-1 protein in chick, human and mouse, we did not observe reciprocal expression of any canonical NTN1 receptors in our RNAseq datasets (e.g. UNC5, DCC or Neogenin;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>).Â Indeed, the Netrin repulsive cue <italic>UNC5B</italic> was the most significantly downregulated DEG in fissure versus whole eye in our data and was alsoÂ downregulated in human OFM (Sowden and Patel; <italic>manuscript in preparation</italic>). Therefore, it will be vitally important for future studies to elucidate interaction partners of Netrin in fusing tissues, or to reveal if Nerin-1 can act autonomously in these contexts andÂ to provide deeper insight into its mechanistic function during fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The chick is a powerful model for OFC</title><p>The chick is one of the earliestÂ established models for developmental biology and has provided many key insights into human developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stern, 2018</xref>). Despite this, and extensive historical study of eye development in chicken embryos, the process of chickÂ OFC has not been well analysed until now. Indeed, the first study appeared only recently and specifically defined aspects of tissue fusion at the proximal (optic nerve and pecten) region of the OF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 2018</xref>), and did not observe complete fusion of epithelia in these regions. Indeed, closure of the proximal OF was characterised by intercalation of pecten and the lack of true epithelial continuum of neuroepithelial retina and RPE. By focusing on the epithelial fusion events in the distal and medial eye, our study complements the Bernstein et al study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 2018</xref>) to provide a comprehensive framework of OFC progression in the chick. Indeed, takenÂ together,Â our analyses clearly define three distinct and separate anatomical regions in the developing chick OFM: the iris, the medial OFM, and the pecten. InÂ addition,Â we present the spatial and temporal sequence of chick OFC at the anatomical and molecular level, and provide strict criteria for staging the process - based on a combination of broad embryonic anatomy, ocular, and fissure-specific features. Fusion initiated at the medial OFM at HH.St27/28 and continued until HH.St34, with predominantly distal to proximal directionality. In addition, we found that closure of the medial OFM is a true epithelial fusion process that occurs over a large time window of approximately 60 hr, involving two fusion plates, and that closes over 1.5 mm of complete fusion seam. This temporal window, the number of directly contributing cells, and the accurate staging of its progression allows unique opportunities for further experimentation. Importantly, one whole chick optic fissure (from HH.St29 onwards) can simultaneously provide data for unfused, fusing, and post-fused contexts.</p><p>In addition, our transcriptional profiling, including the identification of OFM-specific genes in the chick that include multiple human coloboma orthologues, builds on previous work that illustrate the chick as an excellent model for human eye development and the basis of embryonic malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wisely et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vergara and Canto-Soler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trejo-Reveles et al., 2018</xref>). These features, in combination with recent advances in chick transgenics and genetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davey et al., 2018</xref>), project the chick as a powerful to analyse cell behaviours during OFC and epithelial fusion. For example, the stable multi-fluorescent Cre-inducible lineage tracing line (the Chameleon chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davey et al., 2018</xref>]) will be valuable to determine how the fissure-lining cells contribute to the fusing epithelia, while the very-recent development of introducing gene-targeted or gene-edited primordial germ cells into sterile hosts for germ-line transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>) provides a rapid and cost-effective way to develop stable genetic lines to interrogate specific gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woodcock et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, our study illustrates the powerful utility of the chick as a model for investigating OFC and for the discovery of novel candidate genes for coloboma, and is perfectly timed to coincide with major new developmental biology techniques in avian systems to place the chick model as a powerful addition to OFC and fusion research.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Summary</title><p>This study provides the first detailed report of epithelial fusion during chickÂ OFC and illustrates the power of the embryonic chick eye to investigate the mechanisms guiding this important developmental process further and to provide insights into human eye development and broader fusion contexts. We clearly define the temporal framework for OFC progression and reveal that fusion is characterised by loss of epithelial cell types and a coincidental increase in apoptosis. We reveal the specific expression of orthologues of known coloboma-associated genes during chick OFC, and provide a broad transcriptomic dataset that can be used to improve the identification of candidate genes from human patient exome and whole-genome DNA sequencing datasets.

We then generated founder (G0) animals by zygotic microinjection of CRISPR/Cas9 components according to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dutta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Varshney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jao et al., 2013</xref>). G0 animals were genotyped and used for crosses to generate G1 embryos which were scored for coloboma phenotypes and genotyped individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). All experiments were conducted in agreement with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research (USA). Morpholinos were designed and generated by Gene Tools LLC (Oregon) to target the translation initiating site of <italic>ntn1a</italic>: 5â²-CATCAGAGACTCTCAACATCCTCGC-3â², and a Universal control MO sequence was used as a control: 5â²-ATCCAGGAGGCAGTTCGCTCATCTG-3â². One cell stage embryos were injected with 2.5 ng or 5.0 ng of ntn1a or control morpholino and allowed to develop to OFC stages (â¥48 hpf). Oligos used for <italic>ntn1a</italic> genotyping by sanger sequencing were: 5â²-TTACGACGAGAACGGACACC-3â² and 5â²-GGAGGTAATTGTCCGACTGC-3â².</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Transcriptional profiling</title><p>For RNA seq analysis, we carefully dissected regions of (i) fissure-margin, (ii) ventral eye, and (iii) dorsal eye, and (iv) whole eye tissue fromÂ â¥10 individual embryos for each HH stage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Samples were collected and pooled for each tissue type and stage to obtain <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 3 technical replicate RNA pools per tissue type per stage. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Thermo Scientific). Whole-transcriptome cDNA libraries were then prepared for each pool following initial mRNA enrichment using the Ion RNA-Seq Core Kit v2, Ion Xpress RNA-Seq Barcodes, and the Ion RNA-Seq Primer Set v2 (Thermo Scientific). cDNA quality was confirmed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraries were pooled, diluted, and templates were prepared for sequencing on the Ion Proton System using Ion PI chips (Thermo Scientific). Quantitative transcriptomics was performed using Kallisto psuedoalignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bray et al., 2016</xref>) to the Ensembl (release 89) chicken transcriptome. Kallisto transcript counts were imported into R using tximport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soneson et al., 2015</xref>) and differentially expressed transcripts identified using Limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). Genes not expressed in at least three samples were excluded. To identify the relationships between samples, Log2 transformed counts per million were then calculated using edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) and Spearmanâs rank correlation was used to identify the similarities in genome-wide expression levels between samples.

All chicken experiments, breeding and care procedures were approved and carried out under license from the UK Home Office (PPL 7008940 - Prof Helen Sang) and subject to local ethical review by the Roslin Institute AWERB. No regulated procedures were used in this study. Generation and maintenance of memGFP flock were in accordance with annex III of Directive 2010/63 EU and Home Office Codes of Practice. All mouse and zebrafish work was conducted in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Harvard Medical School, and at The NIH National Eye Institute. Mice were used from an existing study (Yung et al., Development. 2015). Ntn -/- (Ntn1tm1.1Good, MGI:5888900) and C57Bl/6J animals were maintained on a standard 12hr light-dark cycle. Mice received food and water ad lib and were provided with fresh bedding and nesting daily. All experiments were conducted in agreement with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Pregnant dams were anaesthetised by CO2 asphyxiation and euthanised by cervical dislocation. Embryos were collected at E11.5, E15.5 and E16.5. All embryos were immediately culled on ice by decapitation. All zebrafish embryos/larvae are taken at between 30 hpf-56 hpf and immediately anaesthetised with tricaine methane sulfonate (MS222, 168 mg/l) on ice. Embryos are then euthanised in bleach solution (sodium hypochlorite 6.15%) in water at 1 part bleach to 5 parts water. The larvae remain in this solution at least five minutes prior to disposal to ensure death.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Detailed analysis of chick optic fissure closure reveals Netrin-1 as a conserved mediator of epithelial fusion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stephan Heermann (Reviewer #2); Teri Belecky-Adams (Reviewer #3).</p><p>I am including the three reviews at the end of this letter, as there are a variety of specific and useful suggestions in them. Some of the comments have to do with clarity of presentation, critical interpretation of the data, and comparison with previously published data â these comments should be relatively straightforward to address. The more substantive ones relate to the experimental evidence that Netrin plays a causal role in fissure closure.</p><p>We appreciate that the reviewers' comments cover a broad range of suggestions for improving the manuscript. Please use your best judgment in deciding which of these can be accommodated in a reasonable period of time. We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript addresses the question of how epithelial fusion occurs within a specific structure in the eye, the optic/choroid fissure. Epithelial fusion is not well understood, and is a feature in the development of a number of different organ systems. The authors describe events that occur during optic fissure fusion in chick embryos, then carry out transcriptome analysis on microdissected tissues in an effort to identify factors that might be directly involved in the fusion process. They identify NTN1 as a factor enriched in the fissure, and then move to mouse and zebrafish for loss-of-function phenotypes.</p><p>The work to describe optic fissure fusion in chick is fundamentally sound, although more schematics are necessary to orient the reader (especially a broader audience), and editing should be done to more explicitly state how this work is different (more focused, finer time window; more quantitative analysis) from a recent publication of describing many aspects of chick optic fissure development (Bernstein et al., 2018). The transcriptome analyses are excellent, and the temporal comparisons are useful.</p><p>On the other hand, mechanistic conclusions are weaker and often correlative. For example, based on antibody staining at a single timepoint, roles for proliferation and apoptosis are inferred or suggested; conclusions would be much stronger if proliferation and apoptosis had been tested via inhibition (for example, with pharmacological reagents). The idea of netrin as an epithelial fusion factor is exciting and intriguing, but the results are difficult to interpret in this form. The netrin mouse mutant exhibits coloboma, but given that the authors review many direct and indirect causes of coloboma in the introduction, it is not clear that netrin acts in mouse in the way they hypothesize from chick data. Characterization of the mutant phenotype (along with controls) would be necessary to interpret the gross morphological phenotype. The zebrafish data are also difficult to interpret, and no molecular characterization of these novel mutant alleles is shown. Similarly, characterization and controls in zebrafish would be necessary to interpret these data.</p><p>Abstract: &quot;Our data reveal that NTN1 is a new locus for human colobomaâ¦&quot;</p><p>Unless there are human genetic data, this statement does not seem to be supported by the manuscript in this form.</p><p>More information is needed to understand the images (especially the fluorescent confocal images) in the manuscript. For example, in Figure 1C, is this a single confocal optical section? Or a projection? This is important especially for interpreting data such as in Figure 4 (netrin localization; see below).</p><p>Table 1 and Table 2: The authors have carried out quantitative analysis of optic fissure fusion in chick. Yet these tables are difficult to interpret, which makes this section of the results confusing. For example, subsection âOFC in the chick occurred within a wide spatial and temporal windowâ: &quot;FP2 displayed active movement in a posterior direction to create a fused seam between FP1-FP2 that extended until HH.St34 (Table 2)&quot;. FP1 and FP2 are not noted in the table, and in the table, the term &quot;fused collar&quot; is confusing. Inclusion of a schematic or a graphical representation of these data (including where these terms fit with respect to the measurements being taken) might help. In addition, the authors note four distinct phases of fusion, with #3 being &quot;active fusion as two FPs separate to generate a fused seam along the A-P axis&quot; (subsection âOFC in the chick occurred within a wide spatial and temporal windowâ). Can the authors comment on the variability of this in Table 1? The text suggests that there should be two FPs at these stages, but at all of these stages, 50% of the embryos have 1 FP.</p><p>Figure 1 and Figure 2 (and associated supplemental figures): regarding the proliferation and apoptosis analysis, the antibody staining is clear at the stage shown. But this is correlative and would not seem to be sufficient to exclude or support a role for either process in optic fissure fusion: can the authors use pharmacological reagents to inhibit proliferation or apoptosis to functionally test their roles?</p><p>Figure 2âfigure supplement 1: regarding RGC axons, in this orientation, it is difficult to interpret the localization of NF-145 staining. RGC axons, and their positions relative to the fusing fissure, might be easier to see in a fissure flatmount. This may be important, since the authors use these data to exclude a role for RGC axons (and possibly a role for netrin acting through RGC axon guidance) in optic fissure fusion.</p><p>Figure 3, also subsection âTranscriptional profiling reveals genetic conservation between chick and human OFCâ: the figure suggests that St28-32 was used to represent &quot;Active-fusion&quot;, but the results state Hh.st28-30. Please clarify.</p><p>Figure 4Bââ: the authors state that netrin protein is &quot;specifically enriched in open fissures but not in the fused seam&quot;. Although netrin protein may be missing from the specific site where fusion took place, it does still appear to be present in the basal lamina (although it seems absent in Figure 4B â was this a single confocal optical section, and is the remaining netrin &quot;inside&quot; after fusion?). Do the authors think that netrin may be carrying out a different function around the optic nerve after fusion? How does this fit with their model?</p><p>Figure 4, regarding netrin expression: more expression data is required, earlier in development. At this stage, netrin RNA is absent from the fused seam, but was it actually present earlier in this region's pre-fusion margins? Might it mark the first site of fusion? A fissure flatmount could be helpful for assessing expression.</p><p>Figure 4, regarding mouse mutant data: these data are intriguing, but not enough is shown to demonstrate that netrin is mediating fusion. What is the more detailed phenotype of the mutant mouse? Does loss of netrin affect localization and movement of periocular mesenchyme or RGC axons? Coloboma could be caused via indirect effects through many other factors.</p><p>Figure 4âfigure supplement 1: the zebrafish data are difficult to interpret, as no molecular characterization of these novel mutant alleles is included. Can the authors demonstrate that these are loss-of-function alleles (for example, via other phenotypes)? Is mRNA still present? In addition, the phenotypic penetrance seems unclear. In subsection âLoss of Netrin causes coloboma and multisystem fusion defects in vertebratesâ: &quot;We observed bilateral ocular coloboma in all homozygous mutant animal(s) analysedâ¦&quot;; whereas in subsection âImmunofluorescenceâ: &quot;In these crosses, we observed coloboma phenotypes in 4/28 offspring, giving approximately 50% penetranceâ¦&quot; Were zebrafish mutant embryos genotyped? This is not clear, and embryos should be genotyped. Other control experiments and further characterization of the mutant phenotype should be carried out (e.g. potential effects periocular mesenchyme migration or RGC axons) in order for the role of netrin as a fusion mediator to be more convincing.</p><p>Regarding both mouse and zebrafish mutant data: the move to the other organisms leads to basic questions about optic fissure fusion and netrin expression in those other organisms â are the same fusion mechanisms at play at a descriptive level? Is netrin really expressed along the entire optic fissure margins in mouse and zebrafish at the appropriate timepoints? More characterization of these other systems would be necessary to interpret these phenotypes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Detailed analysis of chick optic fissure closure reveals Netrin-1 as a conserved mediator of epithelial fusion&quot;, Hardy and colleagues carefully addressed the fusion process of the medial and distal optic fissure domain in chicken embryos and by analysis of fixed samples at different developmental stages identified the onset and the progression of fusion. They also show that cell proliferation was not increased in the fissure margins compared to other regions but that apoptosis could be found in and next to the progressing fusion site. Furthermore, they applied transcriptomic analysis in order to identify genes, which are important during fissure fusion. Among others they identified Netrin-1 (NTN1), which was found most specifically upregulated during fusion in chicken. NTN1 expression and protein localization was found in the fissure region mainly before and during fusion. Protein localization was then also checked in developing human- and mouse eyes. And the loss of NTN1 was addressed in mouse and zebrafish.</p><p>Per se this is an important contribution to the field. It is beneficial for the field to include also the chicken model for studying optic fissure fusion. In itself the data seem sound. However, the fusion of the fissure in chicken was addressed also recently (Bernstein et al., 2018). Notably, the data (e.g. onset of apposition, BM modulation and fusion) presented there was different to the presented work here. Could there be strain dependency? Hardy et al. state in the discussion that Bernstein et al. did not report fusion in anterior or midline region and mentioned that in the proximal regions fusion is happening via intercalation. Nevertheless, Bernstein et al. reported fusion. It should be pointed out which of the current findings is new, which is backing up previous data and which is potentially at odds. Along the lines of chicken as a model for fissure fusion, it would be helpful to address the role of the pecten. But beyond that, Hardy et al. provide transcriptional data from well-designed experiments and further addressed the necessity of NTN1.</p><p>A lot of effort was put into the analysis of loss of NTN1 in other species, mouse and zebrafish. Technically it would be possible to address the loss of NTN1 also in chicken. What was the rational to use the other species only?</p><p>It was proposed that the role of NTN1 would be the same in the different species. However, in zebrafish the remaining fissure seems a bit wider. What is the age of the embryo? It would be helpful to see also histological images to see that the margins were in &quot;apposition&quot; properly.</p><p>Is the work with human samples covered by the HDBR? In the ethics statement it is mentioned that in the UK most studies will not need specific approval, but is this study also covered?</p><p>In some cases, I was a bit lost in the images presented e.g. Figure 1C. How was the staining achieved? What exactly do we see? Are the cells in FP1 head to head and in FP2 side by side? What is the scale and orientation of the individual images? I will give more examples in the minor point section.</p><p>It would be good if the data mentioned in subsection âChick OFC was characterised by the breakdown of basement membranes, loss of epithelial morphology and localised apoptosisâ and subsection â<italic>Netrin-1</italic> is specifically and dynamically expressed in the fusing OFMâ could be shown.</p><p>In some cases, the citations seemed incorrect, e.g. subsection âTranscriptional profiling reveals genetic conservation between chick and human OFCâ, Cho and Cepko (2006).</p><p>Subsection âTranscriptional profiling reveals genetic conservation between chick and human OFCâ: what would be the definition of &quot;biologically significant&quot; in terms of differential gene expression? Would this not be dependent on the gene and gene product? Can this be generalized?</p><p>Subsection âTranscriptional profiling reveals genetic conservation between chick and human OFCâ: Table 2 is not showing this. Figure 3B shows the 12 increased only.</p><p>Figure 1A: Is the OFM really the unpigmented region? Could it be the fissure itself?</p><p>Figure 1B: To what extent is the iris developed at the stage of fissure fusion? The pecten could be explained more. On the images, it appears as a gap. Could the axes be renamed to proximal and distal?</p><p>Figure 1C: What is the orientation, magnification and how was the labelling achieved?</p><p>Figure 1E: Were this and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G independent datasets?</p><p>Figure 1F: Is the proliferation increased outside or reduced inside?</p><p>Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B: What is seen here?</p><p>Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C: Is this taken from flat mounted tissue? What is the orientation?</p><p>Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D: It is stated that at HH26 there is no fusion plate. Could higher magnifications be provided? In Figure 1âfigure supplement 1Di it is not totally clear, especially comparing it to Figure 2B.</p><p>Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G: The label &quot;G&quot; is missing in the figure. I do not understand the note that at HH29 the seam length was too small to quantify. The length itself was quantified in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F.</p><p>Table 1: Can an animal have FP1 and FP2? At stage HH29 n 5 were analyzed. 4 showed 2FP 5 showed 1FP. Could this be explained?</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>Without time-lapse analysis, the term dynamics is potentially misleading.</p><p>Figure 2A: Arrowheads in fusion plate image point to a domain in which the basal lamina is still visible.</p><p>Figure 2B: Can the authors be sure that the future NR and RPE are both contributing and are both remodeled? Could there be dynamic in the fissure margins?</p><p>Figure 2C: The image presented to show the apposition is not corresponding to Figure 2B.</p><p>Figure 2D: Which domain was used for quantification? What was considered seam and outside seam and what could be considered OFM and outside OFM (towards nasal and temporal directions respectively)?</p><p>Figure 2âfigure supplement 1: What is meant by medium? What is the orientation? What is considered central retina?</p><p>Figure 3B: Could the boxes be separated for the different stages? The annotation over the boxed could be misunderstood for statistical data. The annotation (.) should be included in the legend. The legends mention CHDL1 and not CHRDL1.</p><p>Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A: The images are appreciated. Were the individual regions dissected manually and in independent eyes also for fissure and ventral eye, meaning, is ventral eye including the fissure?</p><p>Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B: How was the dorsal data acquired? Is the transcriptional data available?</p><p>Figure 4A-C: What is the orientation?</p><p>Figure 4B: What is meant by whole mount? At the FP2, the NTN1 signal seems less intense. Is the arrow positioned correctly? A co-staining with a basal lamina marker would be helpful to conclude the localization.</p><p>Figure 4Bââ: What is NT? Is the overall annotation correct? Is NTN1 expressed also in the POM?</p><p>Figure 4C, D: Higher magnifications are needed and potentially a co-labelling with a basal lamina marker.</p><p>Figure 4F: What is shown in the second image?</p><p>Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B: The anti-laminin staining looks odd.</p><p>Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C: What was the age of the embryos? Arrows were used twice for different annotations. In the no antibody control, green signal can be seen. Was there a problem with color channel separation? It was stated that there was no staining.</p><p>Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D: Please add axes for orientation and landmarks for orientation.</p><p>Figure 4âfigure supplement 1F: If the penetrance of a phenotype is given, could it be also supported by genotyping besides by calculation? Was the phenotype consistent with the image in f? The margins seem farther apart? Where the margins in &quot;apposition&quot; correctly? Histology should be performed, or confocal analysis, to address this issue. What is the age of the embryo presented?</p><p>At the end of the legend there is a redundant text section.</p><p>It would be good if the data mentioned in subsection âChick OFC was characterised by the breakdown of basement membranes, loss of epithelial morphology and localised apoptosisâ and subsection â<italic>Netrin-1</italic> is specifically and dynamically expressed in the fusing OFMâ could be also shown.</p><p>The RNAseq data was shared. It would be best if it was accessible also without too much bioinformatics background.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic> </p><p>Summary: The authors have (1) characterized in detail the fusion of the coloboma in chick embryos, (2) identified sets of genes that change across several stages and in relation to other areas of the developing chick optic cup (dorsal, ventral, and whole optic cup), and (3) tested the role of netrin in chick, mouse, and zebrafish optic fissure closure.

We have made the following amendments to improve the interpretation and clarity of the measurement data: (i) we have included a schematic in Figure 1 to orientate the reader, which includes labelled anatomical features and axes for orientation; (ii) we have added more samples to our data and stratified the data in Table 1 to more clearly indicate the presence of either a single fusion point or two fusion points; (iii) we have removed the data for the âfused collarâ measurements in Table 2 as this does not add any useful additional information to the table or study; (iv) we have also significantly edited the text in the results paragraph relating to this data to improve clarity and interpretation. This now reads:</p><p>âFusion was first initiated between HH.St27-28 as confirmed by the definitive appearance of joined epithelial margins at a single fusion point (FP). [â¦] The process is active between HH.St27-HH.St34 and proceeds over ~66 hours.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors note four distinct phases of fusion, with #3 being &quot;active fusion as two FPs separate to generate a fused seam along the A-P axis&quot; (subsection âOFC in the chick occurred within a wide spatial and temporal windowâ).

The text suggests that there should be two FPs at these stages, but at all of these stages, 50% of the embryos have 1 FP.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point as we observed subtle variability in the progression of fusion within defined HH stages of development, despite using meticulous adherence to established staging criteria using developmental landmarks. Indeed, this variation should be taken into account when analysing chick OFC processes, as is the case with OFC in other model organisms. However, our model attempts to be inclusive of these variabilities and remains a useful staging framework for studies of chick OFC. For example, in our model âinitiationâ occurs between HH.St27-28 where 5/7 OFMs (&gt;70%) analysed had observable fusion plates. However, only one OFM (at HH.St28) had an expanded seam with two clear FPs, whereas the majority had only one observable FP. Two had no FPs and no FPs were identified prior to these stages. Subsequently, âactive fusionâ occurs from HH.St28-33. Our data now shows that in this range 19/24 OFMs (79%) analysed have 2x FPs (i.e. both FP1 and FP2 present). In contrast, by HHSt.34 (âcomplete fusionâ) we could not definitively identify any proximally open fissures in all samples analysed, indicating that the seam had met the pecten and active fusion had been completed (in 100% of samples).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 and Figure 2 (and associated supplemental figures): regarding the proliferation and apoptosis analysis, the antibody staining is clear at the stage shown. But this is correlative and would not seem to be sufficient to exclude or support a role for either process in optic fissure fusion: can the authors use pharmacological reagents to inhibit proliferation or apoptosis to functionally test their roles?</p></disp-quote><p>We were careful not to assign a functional role for either of these processes but believe both observations are important to accompany the fusion-progression data to establish the chick model of OFC. We specifically included the apoptosis data because the role and requirement for apoptosis during epithelial fusion has been controversial in other animal models of OFC and fusion. Whether apoptosis is indeed necessary or has a direct role in mediating fusion is still undetermined and may vary across divergent species, but our data shows strong spatial and temporal correlation between apoptosis and fusion in the chick OFC. We are currently developing tools to inhibit apoptosis at both the chemical and genetic level in chick, and to coincidentally manipulate Netrin-1 expression and function in this context. We feel these studies are beyond the scope of the current study but will provide valuable information of the specific pathways and processes that lead to cell-death in the chick fissure.</p><p>On reflection of the reviewerâs comment, we have moved the proliferation data into supporting data as although the analysis clearly showed fewer dividing cells in the fused seam, we feel that this observation, while interesting, requires additional analyses to reveal the exact mechanisms of seam expansion. Inhibition of cell-proliferation, as suggested by the reviewer, would need to specifically and reproducibly target cells within the OFM to formally rule out a requirement for proliferation in seam expansion. However, these tools are not yet available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2âfigure supplement 1: regarding RGC axons, in this orientation, it is difficult to interpret the localization of NF-145 staining. RGC axons, and their positions relative to the fusing fissure, might be easier to see in a fissure flatmount. This may be important, since the authors use these data to exclude a role for RGC axons (and possibly a role for netrin acting through RGC axon guidance) in optic fissure fusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have now included flat mounted brightfield OFM image data to help with orientation in this figure. We have also provided additional flat-mount immunofluorescence analyses, which confirm the absence of NF145 in the fusing and nascently fused OFM, supporting our previous conclusion that RGC axons do not have a direct role in mediating chick OFC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3, also subsection âTranscriptional profiling reveals genetic conservation between chick and human OFCâ: the figure suggests that St28-32 was used to represent &quot;Active-fusion&quot;, but the results state Hh.st28-30. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this observation. The segmental dissections for RNAseq were performed at HHSt.28-30, during the active fusion period. We did not dissect at any later stages during active fusion. We have amended these inconsistencies throughout the manuscript and figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4Bââ: the authors state that netrin protein is &quot;specifically enriched in open fissures but not in the fused seam&quot;. Although netrin protein may be missing from the specific site where fusion took place, it does still appear to be present in the basal lamina (although it seems absent in Figure 4B â was this a single confocal optical section, and is the remaining netrin &quot;inside&quot; after fusion?). Do the authors think that netrin may be carrying out a different function around the optic nerve after fusion? How does this fit with their model?</p></disp-quote><p>The dynamic nature of NTN1 is intriguing. The images the reviewer refers to are indeed single-plane confocal sections and this has been made clearer in the figure legend. The data shows the absence of NTN1 within the fused seam and is consistent with NTN1 mRNA localisation. In our mouse data (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2), we observed continual Ntn1 localisation in the optic nerve after fusion was completed. Although we have not analysed NTN1 localisation in the chick optic nerve at equivalent stages, we believe that in both species Netrin-1 has a role in the continued development of the optic nerve that progresses after fusion has completed in the medial OFM, consistent with a role in axonal guidance or neuronal migration. The exact relevance of our localisation data in the OFM is unclear but suggests there may be further multiple roles for NTN1 during the progression of fusion that are mediated by its differential localisation in the basal lamina and ECM. We are actively working on elucidating these roles using in vitro and our chick OFC model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4, regarding netrin expression: more expression data is required, earlier in development. At this stage, netrin RNA is absent from the fused seam, but was it actually present earlier in this region's pre-fusion margins? Might it mark the first</p><p>site of fusion? A fissure flatmount could be helpful for assessing expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added whole mount in situ hybridisation data showing NTN1 expression in the ventral optic cup before the OFM is established (HH.St22-24; Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). Our transcriptomic analysis had revealed NTN1 as the most highly-expressed fissure-specific gene in our dataset, including at pre-fusion stages (HH.St25-27). We also showed in situ data of NTN1 expression in cryosections at the open medial OFM immediately prior to fusion (Figure 4âfigure supplement1A), confirming its localisation in the OFM leading up to fusion. We have now added immunofluorescence data on cryosections confirming that NTN1 protein is also localised to this region immediately preceding fusion. In combination, these data show that NTN1 is expressed throughout the OFM long before fusion is initiated, and therefore is not specific to the fusion initiation point. This suggests that NTN1 has a role in mediating fusion at all points along the A-P axis and is important for establishing or maintaining the OFM in the developing ventral eye.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4, regarding mouse mutant data: these data are intriguing, but not enough is shown to demonstrate that netrin is mediating fusion. What is the more detailed phenotype of the mutant mouse? Does loss of netrin affect localization and movement of periocular mesenchyme or RGC axons? Coloboma could be caused via indirect effects through many other factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We were careful not to assign a specific mechanism for NTN1-mediated fusion in our manuscript as we are firmly aware that this will require significant additional work to elucidate. However, a requirement for Netrin-1 in the optic fissure was shown in zebrafish in a report published while our manuscript was under review (Richardson et al., 2019). In their study, transient morpholino gene knockdown experiments of the zebrafish orthologue <italic>ntn1a</italic> resulted in a coloboma phenotype. The authors provided some additional phenotypic characterisation that showed correct apposition of the fissure margins in <italic>ntn1</italic> deficient embryos. Consistent with this, and in further support of a direct role for Netrin-1 in the fusion process, we have added additional phenotypic data from sections of Ntn1<sup>-/-</sup> eyes at stages when fusion initiates in the mouse eye (E11.5; Figure 4âfigure supplement 2). This data showed that early growth of the eye in Ntn1<sup>-/-</sup> embryos was sufficiently normal to bring the opposing optic fissure margins in direct apposition. Furthermore, the tissue morphology in the OFM appeared indistinguishable from the wild type controls and there was no evidence of ectopic cells or axonal processes between the apposed OFM edges. We believe that these new data, in combination with (i) the highly-specific expression of Netrin-1 in multiple vertebrates species during fusion in our study, (ii) prior observations of fusion-specific defects in the vestibular system resulting from Netrin-1 mis-regulation, and (iii) our additional findings of palate fusion defects in the Ntn1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, all support a fusion-specific role for Netrin-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4âfigure supplement 1: the zebrafish data are difficult to interpret, as no molecular characterization of these novel mutant alleles is included. Can the authors demonstrate that these are loss-of-function alleles (for example, via other phenotypes)? Is mRNA still present? In addition, the phenotypic penetrance seems unclear. In subsection âLoss of Netrin causes coloboma and multisystem fusion defects in vertebratesâ: &quot;We observed bilateral ocular coloboma in all homozygous mutant animal(s) analysedâ¦&quot;; whereas in subsection âImmunofluorescenceâ: &quot;In these crosses, we observed coloboma phenotypes in 4/28 offspring, giving approximately 50% penetranceâ¦&quot; Were zebrafish mutant embryos genotyped? This is not clear, and embryos should be genotyped. Other control experiments and further characterization of the mutant phenotype should be carried out (e.g. potential effects periocular mesenchyme migration or RGC axons) in order for the role of netrin as a fusion mediator to be more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>The work presented in our first submission was performed on a gene edited (GE) line produced as part of a wider study, and both the <italic>ntn1a</italic> and <italic>ntn1b</italic> loci were targeted. This line therefore required a complex crossing and genotyping strategy to establish the causation of the colobomas observed (4/28) of all offspring. We had observed no colobomas in F1 crosses on the <italic>ntn1b</italic> mutant background and the colobomas were only present when the <italic>ntn1a</italic> allele was introduced to the cross. However, we were unable to maintain this line for subsequent analyses as the long-term viability and fertility of <italic>ntn1a<sup>+/-</sup>:ntn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals was very poor.</p><p>Therefore, we have now derived an additional line with only the <italic>ntn1a</italic> locus edited. Using the same sgRNA GE design we generated a frame-shift nonsense mutation (p.Cys90Ala.fs15; see Figure 4âfigure supplement 3), and the data presented in the revised manuscript is solely for this line, with all G0, F0 and F1 animals individually genotyped (either <italic>ntn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, <italic>ntn1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, or Wt). We also have applied morpholino gene-knockdown of <italic>ntn1a</italic> in zebrafish embryos. These experiments support the <italic>ntn1a</italic> GE data, that loss of <italic>ntn1a</italic> causes highly penetrant colobomas.</p><p>While our work was under review, a paper from the group of Mariya Moosajee (Richardson et al., 2019) described transcriptional profiling analyses in the zebrafish ventral optic cup during OFC. Remarkably, they revealed specific upregulation of <italic>ntn1a</italic> coincident with the progression of fusion, with subsequent down-regulation as fusion progressed, similar to our observations in chick. They also provided morpholino knockdown experiments of zebrafish <italic>ntn1a</italic> with an ocular coloboma phenotype. Consistent with our data from mouse and zebrafish, the mutant phenotype was associated with normal early growth of the ventral optic cup and the tips of the optic fissure margins coming into close contact with each-other. No intervening POM or axonal processes were observed. Therefore, the Richardson et al. study adds further evidence of a fusion-specific role for Netrin-1 in OFC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding both mouse and zebrafish mutant data: the move to the other organisms leads to basic questions about optic fissure fusion and netrin expression in those other organisms â are the same fusion mechanisms at play at a descriptive level? Is netrin really expressed along the entire optic fissure margins in mouse and zebrafish at the appropriate timepoints? More characterization of these other systems would be necessary to interpret these phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important question of the evolutionary conservation of fusion mechanisms and we agree with the questions that are raised. Our paper exists as a unique study of fusion at the tissue and genetic level and supports the chick as a solid model for ongoing fusion-specific research. Many additional studies are now emerging in other model organisms applying genetic and imaging data to elucidate fusion mechanisms that reveal both commonality and differences between divergent species. The recent study by Richardson et al. (2019) performed transcriptional profiling in the zebrafish OFM and showed <italic>ntn1a</italic> is expressed specifically during fusion stages. Our data in mouse also show this at the protein level, and both are consistent with the specific NTN1 expression we observed in the chick OFM. In combination with our phenotypic data, we believe these strongly support the hypothesis of a fusion-specific role for Netrin-1 that is common to all vertebrates. Further work is required to elucidate these mechanisms and address the points the reviewer raises â indeed these form the basis for the long-term research focus of our lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>[â¦]</p><p>A lot of effort was put into the analysis of loss of NTN1 in other species, mouse and zebrafish. Technically it would be possible to address the loss of NTN1 also in chicken. What was the rational to use the other species only?</p></disp-quote><p>While overexpression and morpholino analyses are indeed possible in the chick embryo, loss of function studies are more difficult and not well established in the literature. In particular, studies of genes that are secreted (such as Netrin-1) or are predicted to induce cell non-autonomous phenotypes will require highly consistent and widespread cellular transduction of plasmids or RNAi payloads. Current efforts are specifically focused on optimising such approaches and the development of germline knock-out chicken lines, however, these approaches require significant optimisation and costs, respectively and are not as yet âonlineâ. For the purpose of this paper, we chose the mouse and zebrafish knock-out models as they were readily available. However, the data from these models strongly suggests that the requirement for Netrin-1 is highly conserved among evolutionarily diverse vertebrates and our transcriptomic data is consistent with many other studies recently becoming available in these model organisms. Whether the functional mechanisms are consistent among these species remains to be proven but the localisation and then removal from netrin specifically in epithelial cells at the fissure margin in humans, mice and chick are intriguing and support a common mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It was proposed that the role of NTN1 would be the same in the different species. However, in zebrafish the remaining fissure seems a bit wider. What is the age of the embryo?

This new data is intriguing in the apparent phenotypic difference between zebrafish and mouse in the absence of Netrin-1. We are keen to understand the mechanisms that lead to coloboma in both zebrafish and mice lacking Netrin-1 but such work is out with the scope of this current study. We hope to provide robust phenotypic analyses in such future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the work with human samples covered by the HDBR?

The chick iris is apparently unique in among vertebrate models of OFC in that the pupillary region (the anterior-most part of the OFM) fuses early during development (~HH.St26) but remains distinct from the main epithelial fusion events described in our work. Indeed, the region posterior to this fused area remains open throughout development and is abutted by the static FP1. This open region in the iris allows a blood vessel to enter the eye to nourish the pecten, as described in our initial Results section. Other than this, the iris does not play a direct role in OFC in the chick but future studies could investigate the mechanisms by which the development of FP1 is arrested at the iris region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The pecten could be explained more.

Intriguingly, the RPE cells in this region are unpigmented and both cell types lose their normal epithelial organisation. Both of the cell types also express NTN1 (See Figure 4A), suggesting that NTN1 has a role is specifying these cells for fusion, or temporarily prevents them from differentiating into NR or RPE cells until fusion has occurred.
