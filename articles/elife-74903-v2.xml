supply and demand. These functions position mTORC1 as a central controller of cellular homeostasis, but the behavior of this system in individual cells has not been well characterized. Here, we provide measurements necessary to refine quantitative models for mTORC1 as a metabolic controller. We developed a series of fluorescent protein-TFEB fusions and a multiplexed immunofluorescence approach to investigate how combinations of stimuli jointly regulate mTORC1 signaling at the single-cell level. Live imaging of individual MCF10A cells confirmed that mTORC1-TFEB signaling responds continuously to individual, sequential, or simultaneous treatment with amino acids and the growth factor insulin. Under physiologically relevant concentrations of amino acids, we observe correlated fluctuations in TFEB, AMPK, and AKT signaling that indicate continuous activity adjustments to nutrient availability. Using partial least squares regression modeling, we show that these continuous gradations are connected to protein synthesis rate via a distributed network of mTORC1 effectors, providing quantitative support for the qualitative model of mTORC1 as a homeostatic controller and clarifying its functional behavior within individual cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>target of rapamycin (mTOR)</kwd><kwd>cellular metabolism</kwd><kwd>nutrient sensing</kwd><kwd>glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)</kwd><kwd>AKT</kwd><kwd>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM139621</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albeck</surname><given-names>John G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM115650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albeck</surname><given-names>John G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2136040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albeck</surname><given-names>John G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HL007013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeCuzzi</surname><given-names>Nicholaus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31GM120937</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sparta</surname><given-names>Breanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell data on cell signaling responses to nutrient variation enable quantitative models of cellular control over protein synthesis, formalizing the concept of mTOR as a homeostatic controller of cellular metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To adapt to continuously changing microenvironments, cells must perceive the availability of multiple nutrients and adjust anabolic and catabolic processes accordingly. The kinase mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) is the core of a regulatory network for sensing growth factors and metabolites, including amino acids, glucose, and cellular energy charge (ATP/ADP/AMP ratios). Collectively, these factors regulate the assembly and activity of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1), a heteromer of mTOR, Raptor, mLST8, PRAS40, and DEPTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Condon and Sabatini, 2019</xref>). Through both transcriptional control and direct protein modification, the kinase activity of this complex coordinates many downstream processes, including protein, nucleotide, and lipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shimobayashi and Hall, 2014</xref>). mTORC1 also regulates autophagy, the process of nutrient salvaging, and organelle biogenesis, via the kinase ULK1 and the transcription factor TFEB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Settembre et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>While mTORC1 regulates many essential processes in the cell, its activity is not required to sustain these processes at basal rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Valvezan and Manning, 2019</xref>). Cell lines lacking mTORC1 function can proliferate under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, where nutrients are in excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cybulski et al., 2012</xref>). However, mice die early in embryogenesis if they are either deficient for mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guertin et al., 2006</xref>) or maintain inappropriately high mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Efeyan et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that mTORC1 regulation is needed under physiological conditions. These observations suggest that the essential physiological role of mTORC1 is to act as a controller that aligns the rates of catabolic and anabolic processes within a cell, with similarities to an engineered homeostatic control loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Valvezan and Manning, 2019</xref>). However, current measurements of this controller’s function are insufficient to establish a viable quantitative model. Extensive work in homeostatic control across many fields has shown that understanding a controller’s function requires extensive characterization of its quantitative responses across its full range of operating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doyle et al., 1992</xref>). While many molecular details of mTORC1 activation have been elucidated, its response characteristics are sparsely mapped.</p><p>Regulation of mTORC1 activity is achieved spatially by the recruitment of mTORC1 and various adaptor components to the outer surface of the lysosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menon et al., 2014</xref>). When amino acids are abundant, the Ragulator-Rag complex dynamically scaffolds mTORC1 at the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lawrence et al., 2018</xref>), where Rheb, a lysosome-associated small GTPase, activates mTORC1 catalytic activity. Growth factors exert their effect on mTORC1 through regulation of Rheb by modulating the localization of the TSC1/2 complex, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), at the lysosomal membrane. Phosphorylation of TSC1/2 by the growth factor-induced kinases ERK and AKT promotes its dissociation from the lysosome, permitting Rheb to better activate mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menon et al., 2014</xref>). The energy-sensitive kinase AMPK can inhibit mTORC1 activity by both phosphorylating TSC1/2 to prevent its dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inoki et al., 2003</xref>) and by directly phosphorylating Raptor to inhibit mTORC1 assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gwinn et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, at the molecular level mTORC1 activation resembles the function of a digital ‘AND’ gate, where an individual mTORC1 complex is only ‘active’ when mTORC1 can assemble <italic>and</italic> scaffold to the Ragulator-Rag complex <italic>and</italic> a nearby Rheb is active. This is much more likely when both amino acids and growth factors have been sensed and cellular energy status is sufficiently favorable. However, the cellular average of mTORC1 activity is expected to vary continuously (i.e. more akin to a rheostat) as mTOR and its regulators are present in &gt;10<sup>3</sup> copies per cell and can cycle rapidly between multiple states within any individual cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lawrence et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Two major factors limit the ability of previous studies to evaluate the operation of mTORC1 within cells. First, past studies have not been able to resolve changes in mTORC1 activity over time. Most studies have used population averaging methods (such as immunoblots) or fixed single-cell snapshots (such as immunofluorescence), which can obscure the heterogeneous activity of single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birtwistle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Purvis and Lahav, 2013</xref>). Averaging helps to resolve main effects by mitigating cell-to-cell heterogeneity, but prevents observation of true progression within individual cells (the functional context for mTORC1). In an extreme example, the average response to two different stimuli could arise from one subset of cells being activated by one stimulus, while different cells are activated by the other, and no cell actually responds to both stimuli. Snapshots can resolve this uncertainty as they capture heterogeneity and true states of single cells, but they cannot reliably link pre- and post-stimulus cells or determine how quickly a signal changes over time. Compounding this situation, when multiple stimuli are included in studies of mTORC1, they are typically applied simultaneously, but this represents only a subset of the contexts in which a cell may receive stimuli. Addressing the spectrum of feasible system behaviors requires non-destructive time-series measurements at single-cell resolution, with varied stimulus conditions. Second, mTORC1 activity is usually quantified by measuring phosphorylation of select substrates, including S6K (or its substrate, ribosomal protein S6), 4E-BP1, or ULK1 using phospho-specific antibodies. The measurements may be of high quality, but they are not guaranteed to be either linearly proportional to mTORC1 activity or even comparable across targets and studies as each substrate may differ in sensitivity both to mTORC1 and to additional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A potential strategy to more reliably quantify mTORC1 activity in live cells involves the transcription factor TFEB, a member of the microphthalmia (MiTF-TFE) family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goding and Arnheiter, 2019</xref>). TFEB modulates the expression of genes required for lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mansueto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Settembre et al., 2013</xref>). Like many transcription factors, TFEB is regulated at the level of subcellular localization. mTORC1 phosphorylates TFEB at serines 122 and 211; phosphorylation at Ser-211 promotes binding to 14-3-3 proteins and sequestration of TFEB in the cytosol where it cannot access DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roczniak-Ferguson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Settembre et al., 2012</xref>). When not phosphorylated at these serines, TFEB accumulates in the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sardiello et al., 2009</xref>). The cytosolic-to-nuclear ratio of TFEB (hereafter TFEB<sub>C/N</sub>) has been frequently used as a surrogate measure of this phosphorylation, both by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marin Zapata et al., 2016</xref>) and by live-cell microscopy using a fluorescent protein (FP) fusion tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>). However, as with many substrates, TFEB<sub>C/N</sub> is also regulated by phosphorylation at additional sites. GSK3β is a potent regulator of TFEB<sub>C/N</sub>, phosphorylating Ser-134 and Ser-138 to enhance nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>). ERK and AKT have also been reported to phosphorylate TFEB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palmieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Settembre et al., 2012</xref>), with ambiguous impact on translocation. Using TFEB<sub>C/N</sub> as a live-cell readout for mTORC1 activity depends on disentangling these complicating factors.</p><p>In this study, we set out to characterize the homeostatic control function of mTORC1 at the cellular level. We used engineered versions of TFEB and immunostaining of multiple endogenous substrates to quantify the individual and combined effect of multiple inputs on mTORC1 activity at the single-cell level. Our data show that the response to amino acids and insulin varies among mTORC1 substrates, changes continuously and dose-dependently with both stimuli, and also continues adapting on the order of hours after major stimuli. With this knowledge in hand, we were able to use multiplexed immunofluorescence data to generate quantitative models of protein synthesis as a function of mTORC1 activity. These models revealed a degree of control at the single-cell level that is consistent with a homeostatic role for mTORC1, but which is strikingly distributed across the mTORC1 signaling network.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fluorescent reporters for TFEB localization enable continuous monitoring of mTORC1 activity in living cells</title><p>To investigate mTORC1 activity with high temporal resolution, we examined TFEB localization in live cells. The use of TFEB as a reporter for mTORC1 is complicated by non-mTORC1-specific aspects of its regulation, including sites potentially phosphorylated by GSK3β and AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palmieri et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore engineered multiple versions of TFEB fused to a fluorescent protein and expressed them stably in MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first compared full-length TFEB fused to mVenus (FL-TFEB-TR) to a truncated version (TFEB-TR) comprising residues 1–237, which lacks both the DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal AKT phosphorylation site. An advantage of this truncation is that it reduces the deleterious effects of overexpressing TFEB, which were evident in altered cellular morphology and low expression level of FL-TFEB-TR in stable clones. We also constructed phospho-site mutants to decouple GSK3β and mTORC1 regulation of TFEB. In 3xSA-TR, serines at positions 134, 138, and 142, which are involved in GSK3β and PKC control of TFEB<sub>C/N</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>), were converted to alanine. In 5xSA-TR, the aforementioned sites and the mTORC1 sites Ser-122 and Ser-211 were all converted to alanine to yield a reporter that is expected to be unresponsive to both GSK3β and mTORC1. Finally, as a parallel measurement of mTORC1-dependent translation, we constructed cell lines carrying TOP-H2B-YFP-DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2014</xref>). This reporter uses a chemically inhibited degron to quantify the translation rate of an mRNA carrying a 5′ terminal oligo-pyrimidine (TOP) motif, which is found in many mRNAs regulated by mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thoreen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fluorescent reporters for TFEB localization enable monitoring of mTORC1 activity in living cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of fluorescent protein reporters used in this study.

For all reporters, we quantified responses to treatment on a cell-by-cell basis using a metric, Δi, which computes the average change in reporter localization from baseline to the peak response, typically 30–60 min after treatment. Using this quantification, we observed that FL-TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub> and TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub> showed similar responses to a panel of mTORC1 modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), including the inhibitors Torin2 and rapamycin. Notably, in previous work, induction of TFEB nuclear localization by rapamycin was below the limit of detection based on either immunofluorescence or static images of TFEB-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roczniak-Ferguson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Settembre et al., 2012</xref>). The ability to detect responses to even low doses of rapamycin (5 nM) indicates the enhanced sensitivity that is possible using current image quantification methods and time-resolved data, which allow direct comparison of the drug-treated state to the pretreated baseline for each cell. Similarly, the response to insulin, which was previously undetected when fixed time points were analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Napolitano et al., 2020</xref>), was clearly detectable and significant using Δi as a metric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). FL-TFEB-TR localization was more biased toward the nucleus than TFEB-TR, but when expressed in the same cell, both reporters showed similar dynamic changes in C/N ratio and showed high similarity by cross-correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Based on this similarity and the reduced impact on cellular behavior, we subsequently focused on TFEB-TR.</p><p>Localization of TFEB-TR was compared to endogenous TFEB on a cell-by-cell basis using immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal region of TFEB that is absent in TFEB-TR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As with FL-TFEB-TR, endogenous TFEB localized more strongly in the nucleus than TFEB-TR did, but a linear relationship was retained between the C/N ratios of TFEB-TR and endogenous TFEB over a range of kinase inhibitor treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, TFEB-TR represents changes in the subcellular distribution of endogenous TFEB, without evidence of saturation. Although TFEB phosphorylation has been reported to alter TFEB protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sha et al., 2017</xref>), total TFEB-TR fluorescence changed on a slower time scale than changes in localization, suggesting that localization is the parameter most sensitive to time-dependent changes in mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). We also tested whether reporter expression alters the kinetics of mTORC1 substrate phosphorylation by measuring pS6 or p4E-BP1 in a time course, and we observed no difference in average phosphorylation kinetics between reporter-expressing and parental MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

Consistent with the reported role of the mutated serines in Crm1-mediated nuclear export of TFEB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>), the average C/N ratio was decreased for 3xSA-TR across all conditions. Like TFEB-TR, 3xSA-TR responded to amino acids and insulin, but did so with a reduced amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). C/N ratio decreased for both reporters in response to direct inhibitors of mTOR. This decrease was large relative to baseline for TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub>, whereas mTOR inhibition only returned 3xSA-TR<sub>C/N</sub> to its baseline, indicating a reduction in its overall dynamic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). To quantify this decrease in dynamic range, we directly compared Δi for the two reporters expressed in the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). Correlation between the reporters was strong given the expected variance in single-cell measurements. However, the slopes of the relationships were considerably lower (0.21, 0.26) than the slope of 1 expected for equivalent responses. These slopes indicate a smaller change in 3xSA-TR<sub>C/N</sub> than in TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub> across all conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that phosphorylation of TFEB by GSK3β expands the dynamic range of TFEB translocation in response to both increases and decreases in mTORC1 activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation by GSKβ amplifies cytosolic to nuclear ratio of TFEB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of kinase interactions regulating TFEB nuclear localization.

However, responses to different stimuli varied in magnitude, and in many cases were difficult to distinguish from the basal variability of TFEB-TR<sub>C/N.</sub> These data confirm that individual cells can respond incrementally to multiple mTORC1 stimuli, but also demonstrate variation in sensitivity to each, which may represent underlying heterogeneity in the metabolism of individual cells.</p><p>When the sequence of stimuli was modified, we noted changes in the average size of TFEB-TR responses. Notably, when insulin was added before amino acids, glucose, or glutamine, there was a minimal response of TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub>, despite a robust activation of AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). When glucose and glutamine were subsequently introduced, the resulting TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub> response reached a magnitude similar to that achieved by insulin following glucose and glutamine. This dependency may indicate that direct activation of mTORC1 by AKT-mediated phosphorylation is substantially weaker than by the AKT-stimulated uptake of glucose, which could directly activate mTORC1 and/or suppress AMPK activity. The activity profile for AMPK is consistent with this latter possibility. In contrast to this dependency, a substantial TFEB-TR response to amino acids was observed even prior to glucose/glutamine addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that Rag-mediated activation of mTORC1 is independent of extracellular glucose and glutamine. Finally, we alternated the order of amino acid and insulin stimuli in the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) of glucose and glutamine. In both cases, TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub> responses to insulin and amino acids were consistent regardless of their order in the sequence; we did not observe any enhancement of insulin or amino acid response by pretreatment with the other factor. Rather, we observed some attenuation of the response for the last stimulus when all others were present, consistent with reaching the saturation region of either the reporter or mTORC1 itself. When the same experiments were repeated with the 3xSA-TR biosensor, results were consistent with those of TFEB-TR, but the diminished range of the 3xSA reporter reduced the ability to distinguish shifts in reporter localization from noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To explore TFEB reporter responses in a different cell type, we performed a similar experiment with TFEB-TR in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). MEFs displayed a strong increase in TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub> when treated with amino acid stimuli, but unlike MCF10A cells had no detectable individual response to insulin, regardless of the presence of glucose and glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Similarly, pretreatment with an amino acid stimulus did not affect the TFEB-TR response to insulin. However, despite their unresponsiveness to insulin, AKT activity appeared to play a significant role in TFEB-TR localization, as pre-incubation with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 strongly limited the amino acid response. Moreover, treatment with MK-2206 induced a small, but measurable and immediate, decrease in TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub>, which suggests that baseline AKT activity is present in the absence of growth factor stimulation and contributes to TFEB-TR localization. These results are consistent with the interpretation that TFEB-TR generally provides a readout of mTORC1 activity as it adjusts to sequential amino acid and insulin stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Temporal fluctuations in mTORC1 activity track individual cell metabolic states</title><p>When monitoring cells over time, we noted that TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub> did not remain constant following each stimulus.

These transients imply that mTORC1-TFEB signaling and cellular metabolism continually adjust to metabolite availability.

Unlike pulsatile signals observed in some other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lahav et al., 2004</xref>), TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub> fluctuations were not sharply defined. Therefore, to quantify fluctuations, we calculated the coefficient of variation for each individual trajectory, over hours 1–6 after the amino acid spike. These calculations identified a trend in which the coefficient of variance (CV) per cell was reduced under increasing extracellular amino acid concentrations, such that cells showed the largest fluctuations in TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub> when amino acids are limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). In contrast, fluctuations remained similar across all concentrations of insulin. We infer that the abundant availability of amino acids precludes the need for adjustments to limiting mTORC1 activity, but under more physiological conditions (&lt;0.01×) nutrient stress is more common, rendering mTORC1 more sensitive to its regulators.</p><p>To understand the sources of time-dependent variation in the mTORC1 signaling network, we monitored TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub> correlation with AKT and AMPK activities in individual cells over time. We noted no trend in CV for FOXO-TR, and an increase in AMPKAR2 CV with increasing insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). Over an array of conditions designed to modulate mTORC1 input pathways, we observed correlated fluctuations in these activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Oligomycin, which induces energetic stress and large pulses in AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kosaisawe et al., 2021</xref>), provoked the most pronounced and apparently correlated activity changes in TFEB-TR, AMPK, and AKT. However, other conditions also produced fluctuations with visible relationships between the kinase activities. Cross-correlation analysis was performed to quantify these relationships between AKT and TFEB-TR, and between AMPK and TFEB-TR, revealing significant cellular co-variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Together, this analysis demonstrates that AKT, AMPK, and mTORC1 activity fluctuations are coupled at the cellular level, with the largest fluctuations (other than those produced by inhibitors) observed when amino acids are limited. These data reinforce that mTORC1 activity is continually and rapidly responsive to changes within its network of input pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>mTORC1 network phosphorylation states in single cells</title><p>Having clarified the time-dependent dynamics of mTORC1 via TFEB-TR, we questioned whether other mTORC1 substrates respond differently during dynamic activity changes, generating a dataset of quantitative cyclic immunofluorescence measurements for a panel of endogenous mTORC1 targets, including 4E-BP1 (phosphorylation at Thr-37/46), ULK1 (phosphorylation at Ser-757), S6K (phosphorylation at Thr-389), S6 (phosphorylation at Ser-240/244 or at Ser-235/236 by the direct mTORC1 target S6K1/2; note that Ser-235/236 is also regulated independently of mTOR by p90-Rsk), and TFEB (cytosolic/nuclear ratio), as well as related proteins including phosphorylated AKT, GSK3β, and ACC. Cells were cultured in minimal medium and fixed 1 hr after the introduction of stimulation conditions. We assessed protein synthesis activity in each case by pulsing cells with O-propargyl puromycin (OPP), which is incorporated into translating peptides, for 30 min prior to fixation, followed by fluorescence labeling with click chemistry. All stains were performed on the same samples using a bleach/stain cycle to yield a total of 16 measurements for each cell. We performed target staining under 16 stimulation conditions, comprising all present/absent combinations of saturating insulin, essential amino acids (at a concentration inducing the maximal effect), glucose, and glutamine.

This projection visualizes the approximate relationships of mTORC1 target phosphorylation and the interrelation of different treatment conditions within this space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with the concept that mTORC1 targets vary in their affinity for phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2013</xref>), several substrates showed enrichment within concentric subsets of cells. The most prominent examples of this ordering were pS6-235/236 and pS6-240/244, which shared similar locations of maximal intensity. While the intensity of p4E-BP1 staining in this projection appeared more dispersed and lacked a local region of maximal intensity, cells positive for p4E-BPI1 coincided with pS6-positive cells. Yet compared to pS6, p4E-BP1 staining extended to include progressively larger regions of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left column). This pattern is consistent with known mTORC1 substrate sensitivity, such that more sensitive targets (4E-BP1) are phosphorylated at intermediate levels of mTORC1 activity, while less sensitive targets (pS6-S235/236) are not. However, this ordering did not apply to other substrates, including pS6K1, pULK1, and TFEB<sub>C/N</sub>, each of which showed a pattern of intensity distinct from the pS6/p4E-BP1 axis. The maximal points for each of these stains were unique from one another and from the pS6/p4E-BP1 axis, implying that the overall phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate network does not occur along a singular axis.</p><p>We next examined the relationship of mTORC1 target phosphorylation to protein synthesis by examining OPP labeling. OPP showed an approximate correlation with pULK1, pS6, and p4-EBP1 but was not tightly associated with any one mTORC1 target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We used partial least-squares regression (PLSR) models to examine which measurements (and combinations thereof) best captured variance in OPP labeling. When population averages were used as inputs to the model, 98% of variance could be explained by using the complete set of stains, and 92% using only normalized mTORC1 targets – that is, the phosphorylated proteins scaled by their totals (p4E-BP1, pS6-235/236, pS6-240/244) and TFEB<sub>C/N</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This result suggests that mTORC1 activity can, in fact, almost completely explain the <italic>average</italic> changes in protein synthesis rate that arise from varying these nutrients (glucose, glutamine, essential amino acids, and insulin). Cell-to-cell variance in protein synthesis, however, is much greater as it includes all effects, not just those directly biased by these average nutrient differences. Nevertheless, all stains together predicted 60% of the cell-to-cell variance in OPP, while the normalized targets of mTORC1 predicted 25% of the variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, left). This modest predictivity is in line with other studies of cell-to-cell heterogeneity; we have previously observed the activity of gene expression signaling pathway providing ~30% prediction of cell-to-cell variance in its canonical targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gillies et al., 2017</xref>). We speculate in this case that because unnormalized measurements reflect differences in absolute abundance, they effectively act as integrated indicators of the protein synthesis rate. Individual mTORC1 targets showed predictivity ranging from &lt;1% to 18%, with pULK1 being the best single predictor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, right). Notably, the individual normalized mTORC1 phosphorylation targets (p4E-BP1, pS6-235/236, pS6-240/244, and TFEB<sub>C/N</sub>) each provided &lt;5% prediction individually but afforded much higher predictivity (~25%) when combined. Such cooperativity implies that, as a controller of protein synthesis, mTORC1 activity must be viewed as a network of processes rather than a single linear pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The data presented here provide two central insights that were previously unaddressed experimentally. First, live-cell imaging shows that mTORC1 activity changes within a cell are continuous, both in the sense that mTORC1 responds to various stimuli dose-dependently in continuous gradations rather than large abrupt shifts, and that mTORC1 activity can fluctuate continuously over time, changing on the order of minutes or faster. Second, immunofluorescence analysis demonstrates that different mTORC1 substrates are not co-linearly activated within individual cells. Instead, each responds with different sensitivity, and they are collectively correlated with the cellular protein synthesis rate. Together, these findings elaborate how mTORC1 operates as an analog homeostatic controller for cellular anabolic functions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A continuous model for multi-input sensing by mTORC1 at the cellular level</title><p>Prior to this work, several observations suggested that mTORC1 activity might be discontinuous. In a number of studies, phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates appeared to be much greater in response to combined amino acid and growth factor stimuli than in response to either stimulus alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carroll et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menon et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, immunofluorescence for pS6 often shows stark cell-to-cell variation in intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirashita et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rüschoff et al., 2022</xref>), which can imply all-or-none regulation. However, regardless of whether dose curves of amino acids or growth factors are presented individually or in combination, our live-cell data indicate that mTORC1 activity responds continuously, ruling out fundamentally ‘digital’ or ‘switch-like’ mechanisms where the response is focused on a sharp threshold. Our single-treatment experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>) support that mTORC1 presents an analog response, increasing proportionally with the addition of either amino acids or insulin.</p><p>While our findings might appear to conflict with the molecular AND gate model for mTORC1 regulation by Rheb and Rag, the difference can be reconciled by supposing that the basal levels of active Rag heterodimers and GTP-bound Rheb are low, but not zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, panel i). Given this scenario, increasing <italic>either</italic> the activated Rag-complex binding sites or reducing the number of TSC2 complexes on the lysosome would be sufficient to increase the number of active mTORC1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, panels ii and iii). However, both stimuli would be needed to reach maximal activity. In other words, activation of each individual mTORC1 behaves as a molecular AND gate requiring engagement with both an active Rag and active Rheb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>), but the number of such productive complexes within the cell would be widely variable, allowing the total cellular activity of mTORC1 to range continuously as a sort of cellular rheostat.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model of continuous integration of nutrient and growth factor status by mTORC1-TFEB signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of many molecular switches forming an analog integration of nutrient and growth factor abundance by mTORC1 assembly at the lysosome.

The boolean logic of individual mTORC1 complexes does not imply strict on/off responses at the cellular level, but there are important cellular implications for this molecular behavior. Our results using sequential stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggest that the spatial organization of mTORC1 activation creates a motif that prevents any single stimulus from exerting a saturating effect on mTORC1. For example, even if excess insulin saturates the insulin receptor or PI3K/AKT pathway, mTORC1 activity can remain sensitive to changes in amino acids by the independent interaction with Rag. If both growth factor and amino acid stimuli converged on the same molecular mechanism – effectively creating a molecular OR gate – it would be possible for one stimulus alone to saturate mTORC1, overriding regulation by the other stimulus. Thus, while the statistics of having many copies of each regulatory factor preclude a binary response, the molecular AND gate motif may yet be critical in protecting the ability of mTORC1 to remain responsive to multiple inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Differences in additive behavior among mTORC1 substrates</title><p>Our data also show that the appearance of synergistic mTORC1 activation depends on which substrate is used to track its activity, and whether phosphorylation is assessed at a single time point or over time. Notably, phosphorylation of S6K or its substrate S6 have been used in most studies that have observed a strict requirement for both amino acids and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carroll et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menon et al., 2014</xref>). However, we find that among the substrates we tested, pS6 is the most atypical at the single-cell level, with an unusually high degree of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. A broader view of multiple substrates suggests that the activity of mTORC1 itself is graded, while its substrates vary in their nonlinear response to this activity. Differences between mTORC1 substrates have been explored previously, revealing that the affinity of mTORC1 for different phosphorylation sites predicts their responses to pharmacological inhibition of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2013</xref>). These differences suggest a simple model for the variation we observe between substrates, based on typical sigmoidal dose–response curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). A super-additive effect would be expected for weaker substrates such as S6K because each individual stimulus would lie within the threshold region of the response curve, and the response to the combined stimuli would be amplified by the upward concavity of the sigmoid. For more sensitive substrates, both individual stimuli and their combination would lie within the approximately linear region of the response curve, resulting in an additive effect. Based on measurements of substrate affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2013</xref>), this model could explain the differences in additivity between 4E-BP1 or ULK1 and S6.</p><p>Additionally, it is possible that each of the nodes in the network is co-regulated by additional signals, which could explain the divergent behavior of pS6. For example, Ser 235/236 of S6 can be phosphorylated both by p70 S6K and by p90 RSK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pende et al., 2004</xref>), which is typically activated in response to MAPK signaling (though MAPK/RSK activity is canonically unexpected in the conditions used for this immunofluorescence study). In the case of TFEB, the response to mTORC1 is modulated by a cluster of phosphorylation sites that confer regulation by GSK3, mTORC2, and PKC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Napolitano et al., 2018</xref>). This cluster operates by regulating TFEB export from the nucleus by Crm1, in parallel to the regulation of cytoplasmic retention by 14-3-3 binding to Ser-211, allowing TFEB itself to integrate multiple inputs downstream of mTORC1. Notably, however, we observe that mutation of the GSK3β-linked sites, or withdrawal of glucose, does not abrogate the ability of TFEB to respond incrementally to multiple stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We infer that GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of TFEB is not strictly essential for integrating multiple stimuli, but rather serves to amplify the responsiveness of TFEB to mTORC1. An interpretation of previous data implied that GSK3β regulation is strictly required for TFEB nuclear export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>; however, we argue that the two studies are reconcilable, again by interpreting all of the available data quantitatively. TFEB exchanges continuously between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Napolitano et al., 2018</xref>), and nuclear export of Ser-142 or Ser-138 mutants is reduced partially (by 75%) rather than fully eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Napolitano et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, TFEB localization likely reflects a balance between the Ser-211/14-3-3 and Ser-142/Crm-1 mechanisms rather than a strict reliance on either one. In this view, GSK3β can be thought of as an amplifier for TFEB responsiveness, which parallels the finding that GSK3β enhances the activity of mTORC1 on other substrates, including S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shin et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with a general role for GSK3β as a signaling amplifier of previously primed motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hermida et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Operational analysis of mTORC1 and implications for physiology</title><p>Physiologically, mTORC1 activity is required for embryonic development, but its inactivation is also essential.

Our observation that TFEB-TR<sub>C/N</sub> correlates tightly with fluctuations in AMPK activity on the scale of minutes is consistent with this concept, indicating that mTORC1 plays a key role in tracking energetic challenges that might occur under physiological conditions. Further nuance is added by the finding that, under varying nutrient conditions, mTORC1 substrate phosphorylation can predict up to 25% of single-cell differences in protein synthesis. This fraction indicates significant control over cellular energy usage, sufficient to be physiologically essential during development, but it also indicates that mTORC1 alone does not dictate synthesis rates. On reflection, this is to be expected under the model of mTORC1 as a <italic>permissive</italic> controller, where it enforces soft limits on protein synthesis at any given time, but not does not force synthesis in the absence of other drivers of expression.</p><p>In summary, the multi-reporter measurements in this study help to conceptualize cell-intrinsic homeostasis mechanisms not as separate alarm-like pathways, but as a well-connected system of continuous controllers, akin to whole-body feedback systems such as glucose or electrolyte regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). To date, a major impediment to building on this more holistic concept has been the technical limitation on making detailed dynamic measurements at such small scales. Fortunately, a growing body of single-cell techniques is beginning to enable such characterization and empower the application of quantitative models. An immediate and critical challenge to address is further multiplexing single-cell techniques to expand the repertoire of live-cell datasets that link multiple signals with metabolic changes. A key future step will be to build formal quantitative models for how mTOR homeostatic control operates and interacts with other cellular systems. The strong coupling of signals (i.e. AMPK to mTORC1), but incomplete control over outputs (i.e. protein synthesis) demonstrates the need for a global view of the metabolic signaling network, especially in terms of interacting factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Our results are based largely on experiments conducted in a single, genetically stable, immortalized cell line, and thus the relevance of our conclusions for most other cell types or for any particular tissue within the body is not known.

TFEB-TR was constructed by truncating FL-TFEB to amino acids 1–237. 3xSA-TR was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues (S134A, S138A, and S142A) on the TFEB-TR construct. Similarly, 5xSA-TR was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues (S122A, S134A, S138A, S142A, and S211A) on the TFEB-TR construct. TOP-H2B-YFP-DD was received as a gift from the Meyer lab and is constructed and used as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2014</xref>. FOXO-TR was constructed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hung et al., 2017</xref> with the fluorophore changed to mOrange for spectral compatibility and expressed using retroviral transduction. AMPKAR2 construction is as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hung et al., 2017</xref> and was expressed in the pPBJ, piggyBAC transposase delivery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yusa et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell line creation</title><p>Retroviral or PiggyBac systems were used to generate stably expressing reporter cell lines. Following transfection, cells were selected using puromycin (1–2 μg/mL), G418 (200 μg/mL), or geneticin (300 μg/mL). To reduce variability in reporter expression, clonal cell lines were established using limited dilution cloning. In this study, data for each reporter is representative of behaviors that were consistent across at least three single-cell clones. Reporter cell lines were confirmed mycoplasma-negative through periodic monitoring by PCR and validation with ATCC testing of selected lines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell culture</title><p>MCF10A cells clone 5E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Janes et al., 2010</xref>) were routinely maintained in ‘DMEM/F12 growth media’ (see Media composition table) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Debnath et al., 2003</xref>. Wild-type MEF cells (a gift from Arnim Pause) were maintained in ‘DMEM MEF growth media.’ For live-cell time-lapse microscopy experiments, we used custom formulations, termed ‘Imaging base-DMEM/F12,’ which consists of DMEM/F12 lacking glucose, glutamine, riboflavin, folic acid, and phenol red (Life Technologies or UC Davis Veterinary Medicine Biological Media Service) to avoid fluorescence background. ‘Imaging base-DMEM/F12-noAA’ is the equivalent, but also excluding amino acids. All experiments that did not involve amino acid perturbation were performed in ‘Imaging medium’ (see Media table). ‘Imaging medium – noAA’ was used in experiments that involves amino acid perturbation (see Media table). ‘MEF imaging medium – noAA’ was used for experiments with MEF cells.</p><p>Before imaging, cells were washed twice with their respective imaging media and then cultured in imaging experiment media at least 2 hr prior to imaging. In experiments that involved amino acid perturbation, cells were pre-incubated with ‘Imaging medium – noAA’ for at least 6 hours prior to imaging to limit residual extra amino acids from the routine cell culture media.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>For all imaging experiments, cells were seeded in glass-bottom 96-well plates (Cellvis P96-1.5H-N, Mountain View, CA) 1 d prior to imaging. To increase the cell-to-media ratio, cells were plated in the center of the well by spotting 9000 cells on 3 uL of type I collagen (Gibco A10483-01). Following the treatment regimen, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min, and then permeabilized with 100% methanol for 15 min.</p><p>For immunostaining, cells were washed in PBS-T (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS) twice, blocked for 1 hr with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). A sequential staining protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gut et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2016</xref>) was used in which the sample was blocked (200 mM ammonium chloride, 300 mM maleimide, 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS), and incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C, followed by secondary antibodies and Hoechst-33342 (Life Technologies, H3570, diluted at 1:1000 in PBS). After image acquisition, antibodies were eluted using 0.5 M glycine, 3 M urea, 3 M guanidinium chloride, and 70 mM, and the sample was subjected to additional rounds of staining and imaging to acquire multiplexed images of the same cells. Images were collected with a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) 20/0.75 NA Plan Apo objective on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope, equipped with a Lumencor SOLA or Lumencor SPECTRA X light engine.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Live-cell fluorescence microscopy</title><p>For live-cell microscopy experiments, cells were cultured and seeded as described in previous sections. Time-lapse wide-field microscopy was performed as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tan and Huang, 2017</xref>, with cells maintained in 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C in an environmental chamber. Images were collected with a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) 20x/0.75 NA Plan Apo objective on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope, equipped with a Lumencor SOLA or Lumencor SPECTRA X light engine. Fluorescence filters used in the experiment are DAPI (custom ET395/25x – ET460/50m – T425lpxr, Chroma), CFP (49001, Chroma), YFP (49003, Chroma), Cherry (41043, Chroma), and Cy5 (49006, Chroma). Images were acquired using Andor Zyla 5.5 sCMOS camera every 6–7 min at 2 × 2 binning. Exposure times for each channel were 25–50 ms for DAPI; 150–250 ms for CFP; 150–250 ms for YFP; 300–500 ms for Cherry; and 300–500 ms for Cy5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image processing and time-series data selection criteria</title><p>Live-cell microscopy images were processed using the custom MATLAB procedure as described in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tan and Huang, 2017</xref>). In this procedure, the nuclear and cytoplasmic region of individual cells are segmented, and the fluorescent intensity of pixels within the masked regions are averaged. For this study, the segmentation protocol was modified to restrict the cytoplasmic masks to the region within 5 pixels from the nuclear border, and the nuclear masks were eroded 2 pixels away from the cytoplasmic border. For all imaging experiments shown, a minimum of 100 cells were imaged and tracked for each condition.</p><p>The single-cell time-series data were further filtered, requiring minimum fluorescent intensity more than two times background intensity, trace length of at least 8 hr, and no more than three contiguous missing datapoints.

mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) response to stimuli including glucose, amino acids, and insulin at the single-cell resolution. The authors found that mTORC1 activation is graded, which supports the model of continuous adjustment of mTORC1 signaling to changes in the cellular environment rather than an &quot;on/off&quot; mode of mTORC1 function. Considering the pivotal role of mTORC1 in sensing a plethora of signals to orchestrate metabolic programs impacting cell fate and organismal physiology, it was thought that this study will be of interest across a broad spectrum of biomedical disciplines.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74903.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Topisirovic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/056jjra10</institution-id><institution>Jewish General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Topisirovic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/056jjra10</institution-id><institution>Jewish General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.07.455512">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.07.455512v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ivan Topisirovic as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It was thought that presented data support the present view of mTORC1 regulation rather than establishing a previously unappreciated model of stimuli-sensing by mTORC1. As illustrated in the individual reviews, the claim that the present view in the field is that mTORC1 functions analogous to an AND gate was found to be somewhat inaccurate. To this end, it was thought that the authors should focus on highlighting the power of their quantitative approaches that allow time-resolved measurements of mTORC1 activity at the single cell resolution that drew substantial enthusiasm from the reviewers, while deemphasizing the claim that their study challenges current paradigms of mTORC1 regulation. Moreover, it was thought that the focus should also be shifted to what were found to be novel findings (i.e., results presented in figures 5 and 6).</p><p>2) Some important controls were deemed to be missing. For instance, it should be verified whether manipulations in glucose, amino acid or insulin levels affect expression of TFEB reporters. In addition, the activity of PI3K/AKT signaling should be examined across the conditions as it was thought that this may be crucial to determine the extent of the effects of starvation and amino acid stimulation on mTORC1 signaling in the absence of insulin. Moreover, pharmacological and/or genetic approaches to verify whether employed stimuli are still capable to activate mTORC1 signaling when PI3K/AKT signaling is debilitated appear to be warranted. Finally, monitoring Ser235/236 phosphorylation of rpS6 may not to reflect alterations in signaling via the mTORC1/S6K axis.</p><p>3) Some concerns were raised regarding the differences in cell density between baseline and treatment conditions in the examples of original imaging data that have been provided. Based on this, it was thought that more original data should be included to support the quantification plots.</p><p>4) In some instances, the information provided in the methodology section lacked sufficient detail.</p><p>5) The authors should acknowledge and/or experimentally address limitations of their study pertinent to relying on a single cell line and excluding physiological variables that are known to affect mTORC1 activity (e.g., oxygen levels).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The authors propose that the prevalent model of mTORC1 regulation is that analog to AND gate type of digital logic gate, whereby it is assumed mTORC1 is only active in the presence of both amino acids and growth factors under optimal cellular energy conditions. This is likely to be my subjective interpretation, but I do not think that such AND gate model of mTORC1 regulation is strongly supported by the literature. In contrary, I think that the prevailing model of mTORC1 regulation is that of a rheostat that is akin to the one proposed by the authors. With this in mind, my suggestion to the authors is not to claim the novelty of the model of mTORC1 regulation, but rather their ability to support the existing model by quantifying the effects of various stimuli on mTORC1 activity at the single-cell level, which at least I found to be quite exciting and warranted.</p><p>– The major limitation of the study is that it based on a single cell line.

The study proceeds with investigation of multiple signalling inputs, developing highly granular analysis of sequential additions. The biological mechanistic insight from these experiments remains unclear. Additional information may be gained from analysis of different combinations of simultaneous stimulation eg AA+insulin, as explored initially in the manuscript. Linking further with the initial part of the paper, it is interesting that TFEB responses differed with other MTOR downstream signalling, most notably with P-S6, but also with P-ULK1-S757. It would be interesting if further mechanistic insight could be demonstrated by modulation of responses by gene silencing of essential components of AA sensing, insulin signalling or TFEB signalling pathway. In addition, this paper would be greatly strengthened if some of the cell-based imaging readouts can be complemented by cell population immuno-blot analysis for key experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74903.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It was thought that presented data support the present view of mTORC1 regulation rather than establishing a previously unappreciated model of stimuli-sensing by mTORC1. As illustrated in the individual reviews, the claim that the present view in the field is that mTORC1 functions analogous to an AND gate was found to be somewhat inaccurate. To this end, it was thought that the authors should focus on highlighting the power of their quantitative approaches that allow time-resolved measurements of mTORC1 activity at the single cell resolution that drew substantial enthusiasm from the reviewers, while deemphasizing the claim that their study challenges current paradigms of mTORC1 regulation. Moreover, it was thought that the focus should also be shifted to what were found to be novel findings (i.e., results presented in figures 5 and 6).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this shift in perspective is helpful, and we have refocused the work on the quantitative gains of our live-cell measurements and sequential immunofluorescent stains. We also now provide more formal quantitative modeling to address how mTORC1 activity relates quantitatively to protein synthesis rates. The manuscript text has been edited and reorganized according to this newly refined focus. To provide a complete discussion of the existing literature, we have kept a short introduction to the AND gate concept, but we no longer claim that it is the predominant view of the field or that the novelty of our study lies in the refutation of this concept.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some important controls were deemed to be missing.

In this panel, cells received full amino acids; note that upon MK-2206 treatment, TFEB-TR localization returns to the C/N level for amino-acid stimulated cells (about 1.0), not to the amino acid starved baseline level (about 0.8) as observed in Figure 3B. If amino acids were unable to activate mTORC1 signaling in the presence of the inhibitor, we would expect the TFEB C/N ratio to drop to the starved baseline of 0.8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, monitoring Ser235/236 phosphorylation of rpS6 may not to reflect alterations in signaling via the mTORC1/S6K axis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the interpretation of data from this phospho-epitope needs to take into account the fact that it can be phosphorylated by both p70 S6K and p90 RSK. This convergence is one mode by which alternate regulation can come into play. In the revised manuscript, measurements of substrate phosphorylation are now provided all together in Figure 6, so that the signaling targets may be evaluated in a broader context. We have also now directly commented on this pathway convergence in the results and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some concerns were raised regarding the differences in cell density between baseline and treatment conditions in the examples of original imaging data that have been provided. Based on this, it was thought that more original data should be included to support the quantification plots.</p></disp-quote><p>Example images are now found in Figure 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1. The image data used in all of these experiments include much larger regions of cells than can be reasonably visualized in a figure panel, and each dataset is composed of multiple experiments. Image panels shown were chosen essentially at random and were cropped to a scale that would allow the viewer to assess the level of cellular detail present in the dataset, so the apparent density in these cases is arbitrary. We did not observe systematic differences in cell density across treatments, and we have now indicated this in the respective figure legend. We have revised the former Figure S1 (now Figure S6) to include larger fields of cells with more similar densities across conditions, but please note that these images still represent only a small fraction of the data (~78,000 cells across all conditions), all of which are represented in the summary plots and model and are included in the supplemental data file for Figure 6. Regarding the trends visible in the former Figure 2B,D (Now Figure 1B,D), we agree that the visible trend is subtle, but it is consistent with the trends shown in the quantification plots, which best represent the full dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In some instances, the information provided in the methodology section lacked sufficient detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reviewed and revised the methodology to ensure complete detail. We have included a description of and reference regarding the sequential staining technique employed to collect many immunofluorescent measurements in the same cells. We also include the customized media formulations in the materials tables. The base medium for all starvation conditions was lacking both glutamine and glucose; where noted (“noAA” formulation) the base medium was also lacking all amino acids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should acknowledge and/or experimentally address limitations of their study pertinent to relying on a single cell line and excluding physiological variables that are known to affect mTORC1 activity (e.g., oxygen levels).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included text specifically discussing the limitations that must be considered when interpreting our experiments. However, to mitigate the limited interpretability of data from a single cell line, we have also added experiments employing mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, a very different context from the MCF10As used previously. These experiments are presented in Figure 4G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The authors propose that the prevalent model of mTORC1 regulation is that analog to AND gate type of digital logic gate, whereby it is assumed mTORC1 is only active in the presence of both amino acids and growth factors under optimal cellular energy conditions.

We agree with this criticism of the original manuscript, where we did not fully articulate the new insights for a general signal transduction audience. We have now restructured the manuscript and rewritten the Introduction section to better emphasize what quantitative data were lacking in the mTOR field and how these data would be necessary to understand mTOR’s function as a regulator of homeostasis. We have also performed a substantial in-depth analysis of our multiplexed dataset (previously Figure 1, now Figure 6) in which we ask how mTORC1 activity relate to protein synthesis. In this analysis, we show that while mTORC1 readouts are sufficient to almost completely explain protein synthesis activity on average, these readouts only partially predict protein synthesis rate within individual cells, implying the existence of additional regulators that correlate with mTORC1 on the bulk level but not within single cells. We also show that normalized mTORC1 targets are poor individual predictors of protein synthesis within single cells but are highly synergistic, implying that control of protein synthesis by mTORC1 is achieved by regulation of a network of factors rather than any individual downstream effector. Both of these insights are important for fully understanding how mTORC1 acts as a homeostatic regulator of cellular anabolic activity, and we think they will be essential for future efforts to quantitatively model cellular homeostasis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
