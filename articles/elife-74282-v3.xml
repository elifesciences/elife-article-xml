by loading two Mcm2-7 helicases around DNA in a head-to-head conformation poised to initiate bidirectional replication. This process requires origin–recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1. Although different Cdc6 and Cdt1 molecules load each helicase, whether two ORC proteins are required is unclear. Using colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy combined with single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we investigated interactions between ORC and Mcm2-7 during helicase loading. In the large majority of events, we observed a single ORC molecule recruiting both Mcm2-7/Cdt1 complexes via similar interactions that end upon Cdt1 release. Between first- and second-helicase recruitment, a rapid change in interactions between ORC and the first Mcm2-7 occurs. Within seconds, ORC breaks the interactions mediating first Mcm2-7 recruitment, releases from its initial DNA-binding site, and forms a new interaction with the opposite face of the first Mcm2-7. This rearrangement requires release of the first Cdt1 and tethers ORC as it flips over the first Mcm2-7 to form an inverted Mcm2-7–ORC–DNA complex required for second-helicase recruitment. To ensure correct licensing, this complex is maintained until head-to-head interactions between the two helicases are formed. Our findings reconcile previous observations and reveal a highly coordinated series of events through which a single ORC molecule can load two oppositely oriented helicases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>origin licensing</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>ORC</kwd><kwd>Mcm2-7</kwd><kwd>Cdt1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM52339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM81648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gelles</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM007287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Shalini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-CA14051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A single origin–recognition complex (ORC) directs loading of a pair of head-to-head Mcm2-7 replicative DNA helicases by forming a protein tether to the first helicase, releasing from its initial DNA-binding site, and rebinding the origin DNA in the opposite orientation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The eukaryotic DNA replication machinery first assembles and initiates synthesis at DNA sites called origins of replication. During G1, all potential origins are licensed by loading two Mcm2-7 replicative DNA helicases around the origin DNA in an inactive, head-to-head fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abid Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). This conformation prepares the helicases to initiate bidirectional replication upon activation during S phase. The Mcm2-7 complex is the core enzyme of the eukaryotic replicative helicase and its loading onto DNA is restricted to G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aparicio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diffley et al., 1994</xref>). This constraint prevents helicases from being loaded onto replicated DNA, ensuring that no part of the genome is replicated more than once per cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Interactions between three proteins and the Mcm2-7 helicase direct eukaryotic helicase loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>). The origin–recognition complex (ORC) binds origin DNA and then recruits Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Speck et al., 2005</xref>). The resulting ORC–Cdc6 complex encircles the origin DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt and Bleichert, 2020</xref>). Mcm2-7 in complex with Cdt1 associates with ORC-Cdc6 and adjacent DNA to form the short-lived <underline>O</underline>RC–<underline>C</underline>dc6–<underline>C</underline>dt1–<underline>M</underline>cm2-7 (OCCM) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). Loading of a second Cdt1-bound-Mcm2-7 hexamer, oriented in the opposite direction of the first, completes formation of the Mcm2-7 ‘double hexamer’.</p><p>Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain how two oppositely oriented helicases are loaded at an origin. In addition to a primary ORC-binding site, natural origins include at least one additional weaker, inverted ORC-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palzkill and Newlon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilmes and Bell, 2002</xref>). These sequences can be located at a variety of distances from one another but are typically less than ~60 bp apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2011</xref>). One mechanism for helicase loading proposes that distinct ORC molecules bound at the inverted DNA sites recruit the two helicases. This model is supported by evidence that mutations in the Mcm3 C-terminus predicted to interfere with interactions between Mcm2-7 and the ORC–Cdc6 complex prevent recruitment of both the first and second helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frigola et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, for ensemble experiments two ORC DNA-binding sites are required for successful helicase loading in vitro and origin function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>). In contrast, single-molecule helicase-loading experiments with the <italic>ARS1</italic> origin showed that a single ORC molecule can direct loading of both Mcm2-7 helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). A single ORC model is also supported by time-resolved cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) experiments showing predominantly one ORC molecule bound to the DNA in each helicase-loading intermediate observed on the <italic>ARS1</italic> origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). A goal of the current studies is to address these apparently contradictory observations.</p><p>Structural studies have revealed important intermediates in helicase loading. ORC has been shown to bend DNA prior to Mcm2-7 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Cryo-EM studies of the OCCM intermediate show that the first Mcm2-7 hexamer interacts with and encircles the DNA adjacent to ORC–Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). These and related structures also reveal that interaction of the C-terminal region of ORC with the C-terminal region of Mcm2-7 mediates recruitment of the first Mcm2-7 hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>). ATP hydrolysis is required to proceed beyond the OCCM, and structures of intermediates on-pathway to the Mcm2-7 double hexamer had been elusive until a recent time-resolved cryo-EM study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, this study observed a complex in which an inverted ORC is engaged with the N-terminal region of the first Mcm2-7. Although it was suggested that formation of the inverted complex might be required to load double hexamers, whether one or two ORC molecules were required to form the complex and load the two Mcm2-7 helicases remained unresolved. Further, this study could not directly examine how the inverted complex was integrated into the sequence of events in helicase loading. A second goal of the current studies is to ask if a single ORC protein can mediate formation of all these stable intermediates and to understand how transitions between the intermediates are coordinated during helicase loading.</p><p>Single-molecule biochemical studies have provided kinetic and mechanistic insights into helicase loading that complement structural studies. Single-molecule studies demonstrated that the two Mcm2-7 complexes in each double-hexamer associate with origin DNA in a one-at-a-time manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). Single-molecule FRET (sm-FRET) has been used to monitor opening and closing of the interface between Mcm2 and Mcm5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bochman and Schwacha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Samel et al., 2014</xref>) that provides DNA access to the central channel of the Mcm2-7 ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ticau et al., 2017</xref>). These studies revealed that Mcm2-7 is recruited with an open gate that closes around origin DNA substantially after initial DNA association. Such approaches also revealed that recruitment and loading of each Mcm2-7 involves a separate set of Cdc6 and Cdt1 molecules. Following each Mcm2-7 recruitment, Cdc6 and Cdt1 are released sequentially, and the Mcm2-7 ring closes concomitant with Cdt1 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ticau et al., 2017</xref>). This connection between Cdt1 release and ring closing is consistent with structural data that suggest that Cdt1 holds the Mcm2-7 ring open at the Mcm2-5 gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frigola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism that drives recruitment of head-to-head Mcm2-7 hexamers remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis and Costa, 2020</xref>). Here, we generate data supporting a model that reconciles the apparently inconsistent observations regarding ORC and helicase loading and directly observe how a single ORC guides double-hexamer formation. We monitor ORC–Mcm2-7 interactions in real-time using sm-FRET and show that recruitment of each Mcm2-7 hexamer is accompanied by a short ‘OM’ interaction with the same ORC protein. Prior to recruiting the second Mcm2-7 hexamer, ORC forms a distinct intermediate (referred to as ‘MO’) with the initially loaded Mcm2-7. The transition between the OM and MO intermediates is rapid and requires Cdt1 release. Forming the MO intermediate allows ORC to release from its initial binding site and flip over the initially loaded Mcm2-7, positioning ORC to rebind DNA at an inverted binding site without release into solution. The resulting MO intermediate recruits the second Mcm2-7 and is only disrupted when Mcm2-7 double-hexamer formation is initiated. Our findings reveal a highly coordinated series of events that ensures two Mcm2-7 helicases are loaded as head-to-head pairs poised to initiate bidirectional replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monitoring ORC–Mcm2-7 interactions during helicase recruitment</title><p>To investigate the dynamics of ORC–Mcm2-7 interactions during helicase loading, we developed a sm-FRET assay for the initial interaction between these proteins based on previously described single-molecule helicase-loading experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). Using the structure of the OCCM as a guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>), we modified ORC and Mcm2-7 at sites that are proximal (~35 Å apart) during recruitment of the first Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). ORC was labeled with a donor fluorophore at the Orc5 C-terminus (ORC<sup>5C-549</sup>) and Mcm2-7 was labeled with an acceptor fluorophore at the Mcm2 C-terminus (Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649</sup>). Importantly, the fluorescent labels did not interfere with protein function in ensemble helicase-loading assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To monitor ORC–Mcm2-7 interactions during loading, purified ORC<sup>5C-549</sup>, Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649</sup>, Cdt1, and Cdc6 were incubated with fluorescently labeled surface-tethered origin DNA.

Mcm2-7 complexes associated with DNA in a one-at-a-time fashion as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). A fraction of the DNAs (~28% of total DNAs) showed two stepwise increases in Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649</sup> fluorescence intensity as expected for formation of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer. Of the DNAs with two Mcm2-7 associations, we limited further analysis to a subset showing two Mcm2-7 complexes that are retained on DNA for 20 or more frames of acquisition (&gt;48 s). These long-lived sequential associations occurred on 12% of DNAs and represent successful Mcm2-7 double-hexamer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). The remaining sequential associations (on 16% of DNAs) were short-lived (&lt;48 s), and we considered these to be unsuccessful instances of helicase loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Monitoring ORC and Mcm2-7 DNA association showed that for most double-hexamer formation events, one ORC molecule loaded two Mcm2-7 complexes. Specifically, we observed association of one ORC molecule with the DNA throughout the interval for sequential recruitment of two Mcm2-7 molecules in 81% of double-hexamer formation events. The observation of only one ORC is not due to incomplete ORC labeling as we determined that 88 ± 2% of the ORC<sup>5C-549</sup> protein was labeled (see Materials and methods). Thus, if a second ORC was required for recruiting the two helicases, we would expect to see association of two ORCs in 77% (0.88<sup>2</sup> = 0.77) of double-hexamer formation events. In contrast, we observed two ORC proteins during sequential Mcm2-7 recruitment in only 13% of the double-hexamer formation events (22/166). The remaining 6% of double-hexamer formation events had three associated ORC molecules, likely reflecting one or more nonspecific ORC DNA-binding events.</p><p>In the small fraction of double-hexamer formation events with two ORC molecules, the arrival of the second ORC was not coordinated with any other event we could observe during helicase loading. We found two types of two-ORC double-hexamer formation events. In 8/166 events, different ORC molecules were present during the two Mcm2-7 associations. The first ORC appeared to release from DNA following the recruitment of the first Mcm2-7, and a second ORC was present during the recruitment of the second Mcm2-7. These rare events provide the first direct evidence of helicase loading mediated by two separate ORC molecules. For 14/166 events, one ORC molecule was present throughout and an additional, second ORC associated between the first and second Mcm2-7 recruitment events. We note that for this category, it is possible that a single ORC molecule mediates both recruitment events with the second ORC being DNA bound but uninvolved (see ‘The same ORC molecule interacts with both Mcm2-7 helicases’).</p><p>We restricted subsequent analysis to the one ORC double-hexamer formation events for two reasons. First, they were the most frequent events observed.

Three findings give us confidence that these high <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> values arise from interactions between ORC and Mcm2-7. First, we positioned the fluorescent probes on ORC and Mcm2-7 to detect interactions between regions that are proximal in the complex presumed to represent the initially recruited Mcm2-7, the OCCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>).

This coordination indicates that the high <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> value monitors an interaction occurring during initial Mcm2-7 recruitment. Finally, we verified that observing high <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> was dependent on the placement of the fluorescent probes on Mcm2-7 and ORC. Moving the label on either ORC or Mcm2-7 to the opposite side of the protein relative to the C-terminal ORC–Mcm2-7 interface seen in the OCCM resulted in strong reductions in the associated <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The rare cases (2/106 and 7/106 for the first and second Mcm2-7, respectively) that were not simultaneous were all within 4.8 s of the corresponding Mcm2-7 arrival except for one (6 s).

Although both ORC and first Mcm2-7 remained associated with the DNA, the OM-FRET signal was lost before second Mcm2-7 arrival in 106/106 cases. Thus, there was always a period lacking OM interaction between the two Mcm2-7 recruitment events.

We confirmed this loss of donor fluorescence was typically not due to photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4b</xref>), indicating that the end of the second OM interaction in these cases was concomitant with the departure of ORC from the DNA.

Alternatively, ORC<sup>5C-549</sup> may instead interact with each of the two Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649</sup> complexes on arrival at the DNA (Model 2). To achieve the head-to-head conformation of the Mcm2-7 helicases in the double hexamer, Model 2 would require either ORC or the first Mcm2-7 to invert its orientation on the DNA. Since initial loading of the Mcm2-7 complex involves passing origin DNA through the Mcm2-5 gate followed by gate closing, inversion of Mcm2-7 on the DNA would require reopening of the Mcm2-5 gate. However, previous studies found no evidence of Mcm2-5 gate reopening during helicase loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ticau et al., 2017</xref>).

Importantly, in contrast to Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649</sup>, the N-terminally labeled Mcm2-7<sup>4N-650</sup> exhibits very low FRET with ORC<sup>5C-549</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mixing an equimolar ratio of these two modified Mcm2-7 complexes with ORC<sup>5C-549</sup> allows the formation of four distinct populations of double hexamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We will refer to the four populations of double hexamers by the position of the acceptor fluorophore on the first and second helicases in that order. Thus, a double hexamer formed where the first helicase is Mcm2-7<sup>2<underline>C</underline>-649</sup> and second is Mcm2-7<sup>4<underline>N</underline>-650</sup> will be referred to as ‘CN’ and a double hexamer where the first helicase is Mcm2-7<sup>4<underline>N</underline>-650</sup> and second is Mcm2-7<sup>2<underline>C</underline>-649</sup> is ‘NC’. Double hexamers with the same labeled Mcm2-7 for the first and second events would be ‘CC’ or ‘NN.’.</p><p>Depending on which mechanism is used, the four double-hexamer populations will generate distinct OM interaction profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). If the Re-FRET model is accurate, ORC would only interact with the first recruited helicase. Since the CC and CN double hexamers have Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649</sup> as the first helicase, these populations should have two sequential high FRET peaks corresponding to each helicase arrival. In contrast, because the NN and NC double hexamers have Mcm2-7<sup>4N-650</sup> as the first helicase, the Re-FRET model predicts these populations should not exhibit high FRET during double-hexamer formation.</p><p>If the ORC-flip model is correct, ORC would form an OM interaction sequentially with each Mcm2-7 helicase in the double hexamer. Thus, for this model only CC double hexamers should be associated with two sequential high FRET peaks. Importantly, for the ORC-flip model the mixed double hexamers (CN and NC) would exhibit a single high FRET peak when the C-terminally labeled Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649</sup> arrives. Thus, the observation of single OM interaction <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> (OM-FRET) peaks during loading of two helicases is unique to the ORC-flip model, allowing us to distinguish between the two models.</p><p>We observed four distinct patterns of OM interaction profiles at similar frequencies when the differently labeled Mcm2-7 complexes were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Of 90 double-hexamer formation events, we identified 25 events with 2 OM-FRET peaks and 21 events with no associated OM-FRET. Strikingly, approximately half the double-hexamer formation events had a single OM-FRET peak associated with them (44/90), consistent with the ORC-flip model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, CN and NC panels). Also consistent with this model, these single OM-FRET events are equally distributed between events in which FRET is associated with the first (22/90 events) or the second (22/90 events) Mcm2-7 arrival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Indeed, based on the <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> patterns, we were able to infer the underlying double-hexamer ‘type’ for each OM-FRET pattern revealing similar frequencies of CC, NN, CN, and NC double hexamers. Both the presence of the four patterns of FRET and their equal frequency strongly support the ORC-flip model. We note that these patterns cannot be explained by incomplete labeling of Mcm2-7 complexes, as we only analyzed events with two labeled Mcm2-7 and a labeled ORC.</p><p>In the experiment with only C-terminally labeled Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), most events exhibited two sequential OM-FRET peaks, but rare events did not. We observed 1/111 events in which only the first Mcm2-7 arrival exhibited FRET and 3/111 events in which only the second Mcm2-7 arrival exhibited FRET. We also observed 1/111 events with no FRET on either Mcm2-7 arrival. Although all five events appear to have a single ORC colocalized with DNA, these events are likely to arise from DNAs with two bound ORC molecules, one of which is unlabeled. Importantly, these events occur at very low frequency and cannot explain the frequent observation of one or no FRET peaks observed in reactions with mixed Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649</sup> and Mcm2-7<sup>4N-650</sup> complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

Two models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) could explain how ORC might interact with both Mcm2-7 helicases on recruitment in a manner that is consistent with our previous results. First, two ORCs could be involved in helicase loading, with a separate ORC molecule guiding the recruitment of each of the two Mcm2-7s. To be consistent with our previous observations, the two ORCs would need to exchange in a rapid and coordinated manner such that only one ORC appears colocalized with DNA at any time. We will refer to this as the ‘ORC-exchange’ model. An alternative model posits that the same ORC interacts with both the first and second helicases (‘one-ORC’ model). In this case, the same ORC would release from its initial DNA-binding site and rebind the DNA in the opposite orientation prior to recruitment of the second Mcm2-7.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The same ORC molecule interacts with both Mcm2-7 helicases.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Two models that can explain how ORC interacts with both Mcm2-7 helicases.

Analogous to the mixed-Mcm2-7-labeling used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we performed the helicase-loading reaction with Mcm2-7 labeled in a single position (Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649</sup>) and a mixture of ORC proteins labeled at distinct sites (ORC<sup>5C-549</sup> and ORC<sup>1N-550</sup>). Only the C-terminally labeled ORC protein shows significant FRET with Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the ORC-exchange model, four possible pairs of ORC molecules could mediate helicase loading. We will refer to these ORC pairs as CC, NN, CN, or NC based on the position of the fluorophore on the first and second ORC molecules, respectively. For example, the mixed ORC pair CN indicates ORC<sup>5<underline>C</underline>-549</sup> as the first ORC and ORC<sup>1<underline>N</underline>-550</sup> as the second. In contrast, the one-ORC model requires that a single ORC mediate both OM interactions. Thus, for this model, only two of the four possible ORC ‘pairs’ described above (CC and NN) are possible because the same ORC recruits the first and second Mcm2-7.</p><p>We observed two predominant patterns of OM interaction profiles in the experiment with the mixed ORC proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Of 82 double-hexamer formation events, 37 events had two OM-FRET peaks (fraction of events is 0.45 ± 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) and 41 events had no associated OM-FRET (0.50 ± 0.06). The profiles with two OM-FRET peaks can only come from CC ORC ‘pairs’ and those with no OM-FRET are characteristic of NN ORC ‘pairs’ (see CC and NN panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We identified 1/82 events that was consistent with a CN ORC pair (0.01 ± 0.01) and 3/82 events with NC ORC pairs (0.04 ± 0.02). The ORC-exchange model predicts that the fraction of events with CC and NN ORC pairs should be similar to those for the mixed ORC pairs (CN and NC). However, the vast majority of events are of CC and NN types (78/82), which is consistent with the same ORC interacting with both Mcm2-7 helicases. The rare CN and NC events are most likely two ORC events in which one ORC is unlabeled (see above). Based on these findings, we conclude that the majority of events involve one ORC molecule interacting sequentially with both helicases (one-ORC model).</p><p>The above analyses included only events in which a single fluorescent ORC was present throughout loading. We also analyzed 27 events in which more than one fluorescent ORC was present during the loading event. In a subset of these events (7/27) the first ORC disappeared before the second one arrived, suggesting a two-ORC mechanism. We also observed 20/27 events in which a second ORC associated between the first and second Mcm2-7 recruitment events while the first ORC remained present throughout. Interestingly, almost all (18/20) of those events showed either the CC or the NN pattern consistent with the first ORC mediating both recruiting events. These observations suggest that the fraction of helicase-loading events mediated by two ORCs is lower than the small fraction in which two ORCs were present.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cdt1 release corresponds with the end of OM interaction</title><p>Measuring the duration of OM interactions revealed a kinetic difference between the first and second OM interactions.

To this end, in addition to the previously described fluorescently labeled OM-FRET pair, we included Cdt1 labeled at its N-terminus with a red-excited acceptor fluorophore (Cdt1<sup>N-649</sup>). Mcm2-7 and Cdt1 arrive together at origin DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in this experiment each Mcm2-7/Cdt1 arrival results in the association of two red fluorophores with DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, red: <italic>A</italic><sub>ex</sub>, <italic>A</italic><sub>em</sub> panel). Successful helicase loading is associated with the release of Cdt1 while Mcm2-7 remains bound to the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). Such Cdt1-release events will result in the loss of one red fluorophore and appear as the reduction of the acceptor fluorescence intensity (red: <italic>A</italic><sub>ex</sub>, <italic>A</italic><sub>em</sub>). Although Cdt1<sup>N-649</sup> is also labeled with an acceptor fluorophore, this site of labeling does not exhibit strong FRET with ORC<sup>5C-549</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In a control experiment in which only Cdt1 is labeled with the acceptor fluorophore, the average <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> observed when Cdt1 is present was 0.358 ± 0.003, which is easily distinguished from that of the OM-FRET pair (average <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> 0.72 ± 0.01; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). However, the presence of Cdt1<sup>N-649</sup> does contribute to a slightly elevated <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> when the OM interaction is formed (mean <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> = 0.83 ± 0.01 with Cdt1<sup>N-649</sup> compared to ~0.72 with unlabeled Cdt1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Thus, if Cdt1 release is concomitant with OM interactions ending, the loss of half the acceptor fluorescence intensity due to Cdt1 release should occur simultaneously with the loss of FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, blue: <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> panel). If Cdt1 release is disconnected from OM interactions ending, we would observe only a small reduction (from ~0.83 to ~0.72) in <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> when Cdt1<sup>N-649</sup> is released.</p><p>We observed a clear correlation between the time that OM interactions end and the time of Cdt1 release on individual DNAs. We combined data from the first and second Mcm2-7 associations in 57 double-hexamer formation events, and observed 99 Cdt1 association and release events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the majority of these events (85/99), Cdt1 release is within experimental time resolution of the loss of OM-FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). In a smaller number of events (12/99), Cdt1 releases either immediately before or after OM-FRET ends (within ±7.2 s). We confirmed the loss of half the acceptor fluorescence cannot be consistently explained by photobleaching of the acceptor fluorophores on either Mcm2-7<sup>2C-650</sup> or Cdt1<sup>N-649</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The distribution of intervals separating the end of the high <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> state relative to the corresponding Cdt1 release is centered around 0 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).

Compared to wild-type Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649</sup> helicase, OM-FRET that began with Mcm2-7 arrival continued for much longer in the 5RA mutant helicase (average OM-FRET duration was 156 ± 14 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). In all cases (128/128), we observed OM-FRET for the entire duration that both ORC<sup>5C-549</sup> (donor) and Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649,5RA</sup> (acceptor) were present, consistent with its duration being limited by photobleaching or loss of both proteins due to sliding off the DNA end. In contrast, in reactions with wild-type Mcm2-7<sup>2C-649</sup>, the first OM interaction ends soon after the first Mcm2-7 arrival (mean 30 ± 2 s).

These MO interactions occurred only once during helicase loading, and formation of the MO high <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> state (MO-FRET) always anticipated the arrival of the second Mcm2-7 (94/94 events). Unlike the OM interactions we monitored previously, MO interactions do not begin simultaneously with the arrival of the first or second Mcm2-7.

Ensemble helicase-loading assays using this protein show a strong reduction in successful helicase loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). In single-molecule experiments with ORC<sup>6C-549,6∆N119</sup> and Mcm2-7<sup>3N-650</sup>, we nearly always observed association of a single Mcm2-7 helicase, but only 8/418 first Mcm2-7 association events went on to recruit a stable second Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Furthermore, ORC<sup>6C-549,6∆N119</sup> showed very few instances with MO-FRET (5/418 of first Mcm2-7 association events; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Both of these frequencies are much lower than what is observed with wild-type ORC<sup>6C-549</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e, f</xref>). These results are consistent with the MO-FRET signal being caused by formation of the MO complex and with formation of the MO interaction being critical for second Mcm2-7 recruitment.</p><p>Establishment of the MO interaction is likely to be a limiting step in helicase loading. Only a fraction (0.18 ± 0.02) of first Mcm2-7-binding events detected with wild-type ORC convert to stable second Mcm2-7 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, ORC<sup>6C-549</sup>). Strikingly, this frequency is similar to the fraction of first Mcm2-7-binding events that have MO-FRET (0.23 ± 0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, ORC<sup>6C-549</sup>). Consistent with the hypothesis that formation of the MO interaction is the step at which most unsuccessful helicase-loading attempts fail, formation of MO-FRET is a strong predictor of stable second Mcm2-7 association; 79 ± 3% (i.e., 0.18/0.23) of first Mcm2-7 association events with MO-FRET go on to recruit a stable second Mcm2-7.</p><p>A likely reason that MO formation is important for successful helicase loading is that the MO interaction stabilizes the first Mcm2-7 on the DNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that when MO formation is inhibited in the context of the ORC<sup>6C-549,6∆N119</sup> mutant, the first recruited Mcm2-7 dissociates rapidly after ORC is released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3a</xref>). Under this condition, the lifetime of Mcm2-7 complexes after ORC dissociation are short, with a median lifetime of 11 ± 4 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3b</xref>). This is not simply a consequence of the mutant ORC. Mcm2-7 complexes that are recruited by wild-type ORC but do not form an MO interaction show the same rapid release from DNA after ORC dissociation (median lifetime is 11 ± 2 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3c, d</xref>). In comparison, Mcm2-7 complexes that form the MO interaction have longer lifetimes. A small fraction (0.21 ± 0.03) of the Mcm2-7 complexes that form MO interactions are released from the DNA in contrast to the majority (0.79 ± 0.03) that go on to recruit a second Mcm2-7. For all the Mcm2-7 complexes that showed MO interactions we measured either (1) the time between the onset of the MO interaction and the Mcm2-7 departure from the DNA, or (2) the time between the onset of the MO interaction and the arrival of the second Mcm2-7. We note that because the latter measurement ends not with Mcm2-7 release but second Mcm2-7 arrival the resulting measured Mcm2-7 lifetimes are an underestimate. Nevertheless, the median lifetime for all first Mcm2-7 complexes that formed MO interactions was 35 ± 7 s, compared to the median lifetime of 11 ± 2 s following ORC departure for Mcm2-7 complexes that did not form the MO interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3d</xref>). Finally, we found that establishing MO interactions extends ORC dwell times on DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3e-f</xref>). Together, these findings are consistent with MO complex formation stabilizing both ORC and the first Mcm2-7 helicase on the DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Prebound ORC–Cdc6 can form double hexamers without additional ORC in solution</title><p>To further confirm that one ORC can mediate MO formation and recruit both Mcm2-7 helicases, we performed a staged helicase-loading reaction. We incubated slide-attached origin DNA with ORC<sup>6C-549</sup>/Cdc6, washed away unbound proteins and then performed the single-molecule helicase-loading reaction by adding all the helicase-loading proteins except ORC (see Materials and methods). Although the reaction did not contain any additional ORC, we observed second Mcm2-7 recruitment and MO-FRET in a fraction of first Mcm2-7 association events (0.26 ± 0.07 and 0.36 ± 0.08, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e, f</xref>, prebound ORC). Importantly, these ratios are similar to those seen for the unstaged reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e, f</xref>, WT-ORC). Consistent with our observations with the unstaged reaction, MO-FRET anticipated the recruitment of the second Mcm2-7 in all double-hexamer formation events (10/10 events) with prebound ORC<sup>6C-549</sup>/Cdc6. Thus, helicase loading proceeds similarly even when free ORC is removed prior to second Mcm2-7 recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Cdt1 release coordinates the ORC flip on DNA</title><p>To examine more directly the order of events surrounding MO formation, we monitored Cdt1 release and MO-FRET in a single experiment.

We confirmed that the loss of half the acceptor-excited acceptor fluorescence, which we infer as Cdt1 release, is unlikely to be due to photobleaching of the acceptor fluorophore on Cdt1<sup>C-650</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In 76/78 events, MO-FRET is either established simultaneously with release of the first Cdt1 (within the time resolution of the assay, i.e., ±2.4 s; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>) or occurs after the first Cdt1 is released. Strikingly, MO interactions began unambiguously after Cdt1 release (i.e., delayed by &gt;2.4 s) in a majority of these events (59/78 events; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). The average time to MO-FRET after first Cdt1 release is 8.3 ± 2.0 s indicating that establishment of MO-FRET is a separate, subsequent event from the end of the first OM-FRET, which is simultaneous with the first Cdt1 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).

We compared the distribution of times of loss of MO interaction relative to the arrival of the second Mcm2-7 to the previously determined times of each of these events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). The distribution of second Cdc6 and second Cdt1-release times are clearly distinct from the times of MO dissolution. In contrast, we observed a similar distribution for the end of the MO interaction after arrival of the second Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, 9.7 ± 1.5 s) relative to the time required for initial double-hexamer interactions after second Mcm2-7 arrival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). These data strongly suggest that formation of double-hexamer interactions between the first and second helicases accompany a structural reconfiguration that ends the MO interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By monitoring interactions between ORC and Mcm2-7 through two separate interfaces, the single-molecule experiments described here provide unique insights into helicase loading. We demonstrate that similar, if not identical, interactions between DNA-bound ORC and the C-terminal regions of Mcm2-7 occur during recruitment of the two helicases during double-hexamer formation (OM interactions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Importantly, we show that one ORC is sufficient to efficiently recruit both helicases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) but that in rare cases separate ORC molecules may recruit the two helicases. Between the two helicase recruitment events, ORC forms a distinct interface with the N-terminal region of the first recruited Mcm2-7 (MO interaction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) that mediates retention of ORC on the DNA and is required for recruitment of the second Mcm2-7.

This complex is maintained until the ATP-hydrolysis-dependent releases of Cdc6 and then Cdt1, forming the OM<sub>1</sub> state. Following release of the first Cdt1, ORC releases from its initial DNA- and Mcm2-7-binding sites to form a distinct interaction with the N-terminal region of the first Mcm2-7 (pre-M<sub>1</sub>O state). This tethered conformation prevents ORC from releasing into solution as it exchanges DNA-binding sites. As a consequence of the ORC inversion, the two helicases are recruited in opposite orientations (M<sub>1</sub>OC<sup>6</sup>C<sup>1</sup>M<sub>2</sub> state) and rapidly interact to form a head-to-head Mcm2-7 double hexamer (M<sub>1</sub>M<sub>2</sub>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for helicase loading mediated by one ORC molecule.</title><p>Designations in ovals are unique names for each intermediate using the abbreviations O, ORC; C<sup>6</sup>, Cdc6; C<sup>1</sup>, Cdt1; M<sub>1</sub>, first Mcm2-7; and M<sub>2</sub>, second Mcm2-7.

A single ORC making similar OM interactions during recruitment of both Mcm2-7 complexes is consistent with previous observations that Mcm2-7 mutations in this interface interfere with recruitment of both the first and second helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frigola et al., 2013</xref>). Further, the proposal that ORC recruits both helicases by rebinding DNA in an inverted orientation corresponds with a requirement for two ORC-binding sites at origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>). We show that the MO interaction is consistently present during recruitment of the second Mcm2-7. This finding is consistent with structural studies suggesting that an ORC molecule engaged with the N-terminal region of the first Mcm2-7 is responsible for recruiting the second Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). Because the MO complex holds ORC in close proximity to the first Mcm2-7 as the second Mcm2-7 is recruited, this finding explains the rapid formation of double-hexamer interactions after second Mcm2-7 arrival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, our observation that a single ORC molecule can guide helicase loading is consistent with previous single-molecule studies and time-resolved cryo-EM studies, both of which observed predominantly one ORC engaged with DNA during helicase loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments reveal that the events in helicase loading guided by a single ORC are highly coordinated. The first OM interaction begins simultaneously with arrival of the first Mcm2-7/Cdt1 and ends when the first Cdt1 is released. The MO interaction is formed shortly after the first Cdt1 is released and the OM interaction ends (mean 8.7 ± 2.0 s after Cdt1 release), and anticipates recruitment of the second Mcm2-7. Consistent with this ordering, preventing Cdt1 release with a Mcm2-7 ATPase mutant extends the duration of OM interactions (average OM duration after first Mcm2-7 arrival is 30 ± 2 s for wild type and 156 ± 14 s for the Mcm2-7<sup>5RA</sup> mutant) and prevents formation of MO interactions. The second OM interaction begins simultaneously with the second Mcm2-7 arrival (M<sub>1</sub>OC<sup>6</sup>C<sup>1</sup>M<sub>2</sub> state). We infer that establishment of the MO interaction is required to recruit the second Mcm2-7 helicase based on two observations. First, we consistently observe that the onset of the MO interaction anticipates recruitment of the second Mcm2-7. Second, disrupting the MO interaction using a mutant version of ORC prevents second Mcm2-7 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Finally, the temporal connection between the formation of double-hexamer interactions and the end of the MO interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), strongly suggests that formation of double-hexamer interactions breaks the MO interaction. This supports the existence of two complexes with the same set of proteins but distinct ORC–Mcm2-7 and Mcm2-7–Mcm2-7 interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, M<sub>1</sub>OC<sup>6</sup>C<sup>1</sup>M<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>1</sub>M<sub>2</sub>C<sup>1</sup>C<sup>6</sup>O states). The requirement to form the MO complex to recruit the second Mcm2-7 combined with the requirement to disrupt the MO complex to establish double-hexamer interactions together provide an ordered selection to ensure that successfully recruited second Mcm2-7 helicases go on to form double hexamers.</p><p>We propose that a single ORC molecule uses a tether to the first helicase to remain DNA associated while ORC locates and binds a second inverted DNA site. This mechanism is supported by the observation that ORC is not bound to the primary ORC-binding site on DNA in a structure of the MO complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). Although protein flipping has not been reported in other steps of DNA replication, multiple DNA-binding proteins have been shown to switch orientations on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ganji et al., 2016</xref>). In these previously reported systems, protein inversion is proposed to occur via dissociation into solution, followed by rapid reorientation and rebinding resulting in the flipped protein binding the same (quasi-)palindromic DNA site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marklund et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sasnauskas et al., 2011</xref>), or a closely spaced inverted binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryu et al., 2014</xref>). The ORC gymnastics observed here however are distinguished from other protein flipping events by the use of a protein tether between ORC and the first Mcm2-7 helicase.</p><p>The full role of ATP binding and hydrolysis during helicase loading remains to be determined. We have shown that a mutation in Mcm5 predicted to eliminate ATP hydrolysis at one of the six Mcm2-7 ATPases prevents Cdt1 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ticau et al., 2017</xref>) and OM complex dissolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Whether ATP hydrolysis by other Mcm2-7 ATPases catalyze the same or other events remains to be determined. ORC and/or Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis could also be involved in the release of ORC from the DNA. ORC binding to origin DNA is stimulated by ATP but not ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell and Stillman, 1992</xref>), suggesting ORC ATP hydrolysis could facilitate release of ORC from its initial binding site. Cdc6 completes the ORC–Cdc6 protein ring around the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>) and Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis is required to release Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that this hydrolysis event also is required for ORC DNA release.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Origin structure and helicase loading</title><p>A model in which the MO complex is required to recruit the second Mcm2-7 is consistent with origin architecture in budding yeast, wherein two ORC-binding sites with different affinities are required for helicase-loading in vivo. Previous studies have shown that in addition to the primary ORC-binding site (<underline>A</underline>RS <underline>c</underline>onsensus <underline>s</underline>equence or ACS), natural origins consistently have at least one (and sometimes multiple) additional weak, inverted ORC-binding sites referred to as B2 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marahrens and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palzkill and Newlon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rao et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilmes and Bell, 2002</xref>). Interestingly, even though two oppositely oriented strong ORC-binding sites support origin function both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>), natural origins have selected against this architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marahrens and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palzkill and Newlon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rao et al., 1994</xref>). This selection argues against a model in which ORC is prebound at both sites. Indeed, when B2 elements have been mapped they are frequently located at positions in which the presence of the OCCM (OC<sup>6</sup>C<sup>1</sup>M<sub>1</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) would clash with ORC binding at B2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marahrens and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rao et al., 1994</xref>). Along these lines, in the small number of two ORC events in our studies, we observe second ORC associations occur after the first, but before the second, Mcm2-7 arrives. Thus, we propose that, whether one or two ORCs mediate loading, the ORC mediating second Mcm2-7 recruitment would only stably associate with B2 after the first Mcm2-7 is recruited. Such a mechanism would ensure that these sites are only bound once the first Mcm2-7 is recruited, thus driving the reaction towards double-hexamer formation and preventing two ORC proteins independently recruiting ‘first’ Mcm2-7 complexes.</p><p>The relative placement of the two ORC-binding sites might influence the coordinated series of events we observe in helicase loading. Although the two oppositely oriented ORC-binding sites are very close in the <italic>ARS1</italic> origin used in our experiments, the distance between these sites is variable across natural origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palzkill and Newlon, 1988</xref>). We speculate that the pre-M<sub>1</sub>O slides in search of a second, inverted ORC-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and recruits the second Mcm2-7 only once an inverted ORC-binding site is found. As described above, for a number of origins for which B2 elements have been identified (including <italic>ARS1</italic>) this sliding would be required to expose the B2 element (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, sliding to the left). A number of helicase-loading intermediates slide in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sánchez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scherr et al., 2021</xref>), and experiments placing barriers to sliding at <italic>ARS1</italic> support a role for sliding to identify second inverted ORC-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Warner et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the argument that second Mcm2-7 recruitment only occurs when the sliding pre-M<sub>1</sub>O finds a second inverted ORC-binding site, helicase loading does not occur at artificial origins with a single strong ORC-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Comparison of one-ORC and twoORC mechanisms for helicase loading</title><p>Our data also demonstrate that two distinct ORC molecules are present in a small subset of helicase-loading events and provide information about the mechanism of these events. One insight comes from the analysis of first Mcm2-7 DNA retention in the absence of MO formation. Analyses of helicase loading with the ORC<sup>6∆N119</sup> mutant and first Mcm2-7 helicases that fail to form the MO interaction show that in both cases the Mcm2-7 molecules are rapidly released from the DNA after ORC release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This finding indicates that the first Mcm2-7 is unstable if the MO complex is not formed and that there would be only a short-time window for a second ORC molecule to form an MO complex before the first Mcm2-7 is released. It is also interesting to consider how the MO complex is formed by a second ORC. There are two possible ways for a second ORC to interact with the first Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is possible that the second ORC is recruited out of solution by MO-like interactions with the first Mcm2-7 and then identifies an appropriate B2 DNA-binding site. Alternatively, ORC could bind at the low-affinity B2 site first and then form the MO interaction with the first Mcm2-7. In both cases, there would be a short-time window for the second ORC to form the MO before the first Mcm2-7 is released. Analysis of the two-ORC events in our assay that detects the MO complex suggests both mechanisms are used.</p><p>It is likely that both one- and two-ORC mechanisms are used in vivo and it will be difficult to determine which mechanism is used more frequently. The low frequency of two-ORC events we observe (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) suggests that the first ORC has a higher probability of forming the MO complex through a helicase-tethered flip than a second ORC, consistent with the first ORC already being associated with the first Mcm2-7. On the other hand, our single-molecule experiments are necessarily performed at low ORC concentrations. Given the short-time window for a second ORC to act, higher ORC concentrations might increase the frequency of two-ORC events. Finally, we note that it is difficult to determine the free ORC concentration in vivo, particularly given the ability of ORC to interact nonspecifically with AT-rich DNA. Interestingly, metazoan ORC can sequester into a separated liquid phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hossain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parker et al., 2019</xref>). Because ORC phase separation requires DNA and may involve other proteins in vivo, it is not clear whether or not the free ORC concentration would be elevated in the predicted condensates. Nevertheless, consistent with ORC being limiting in cells, in vivo footprinting studies show that only a subset of the origin-associated stronger ACS-binding sites are occupied by ORC in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>). This finding suggests that the much weaker B2-binding sites are unlikely to stably bind ORC without additional interactions. Thus, we hypothesize that if a second ORC is involved in vivo it would only be recruited after the first Mcm2-7 is origin associated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cdt1 release coordinates the transition between OM and MO complexes</title><p>Our data show that release of the first Cdt1 is a critical regulatory step in helicase loading. There are two potential explanations for the simultaneous end of OM interactions and Cdt1 release observed here. Cdt1 binding could be required for OM interactions such that Cdt1 release reduces or eliminates these interactions. Consistent with this hypothesis, Cdt1 binding has been proposed to alleviate an autoinhibitory function of Mcm2-7, thereby allowing interaction with ORC-CdcDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández-Cid et al., 2013</xref>). A second possibility is that closure of the Mcm2-5 gate, which is concomitant with Cdt1 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ticau et al., 2017</xref>), induces a conformational change in the Mcm2-7 complex that disrupts the OM interaction. It is intriguing to note that ORC is frequently released from the DNA simultaneously with the second Cdt1 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that in addition to breaking the OM interaction, release of the first Cdt1 may stimulate ORC release from DNA.</p><p>Release of the first Cdt1 and the concomitant closure of the Mcm2-5 gate around DNA likely create a new interaction site on Mcm2-7 for Orc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ticau et al., 2017</xref>). The N- and C-terminal domains of Orc6 (Orc6N and Orc6C) interact with Cdt1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Bell, 2011</xref>). We propose that once the first Cdt1 is released, Orc6N is able to reach over the first Mcm2-7 and establish a tether with the Mcm2 N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). In this model, the extensive linker (~160 amino acids) between the Orc6N and Orc6C serves as flexible leash that facilitates a search for this new Orc6N-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Bell, 2011</xref>). Since ORC is not Cdc6 bound at this stage (OM<sub>1</sub> state), ORC forms an open ring around DNA and can release from its primary DNA-binding site. Additional events that could contribute to ORC release from its initial high-affinity-binding site, include the conformational changes driving dissolution of the OM complex and changes in ORC conformation upon binding to the N-terminal region of Mcm2-7. The closed Mcm2-5 gate in the M<sub>1</sub>O facilitates contacts between Orc6C and the Mcm5 N-terminal region such that the two domains of Orc6 form a latch across the Mcm2-5 gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2019</xref>), a likely mechanism for the MO complex stabilizing DNA association of the first Mcm2-7 after loss of the OM interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We show that Orc6N is required to form the MO interaction, and that release of the first Cdt1 and formation of the MO interaction occur in close succession. However, we could not determine the timing of establishment of the Orc6N tether (as in the pre-M<sub>1</sub>O intermediate) relative to the end of the first OM interaction (or the first Cdt1 release), as fluorophore modification of Orc6 N-terminal domain interfered with helicase loading.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications for origin licensing at non-sequence defined origins</title><p>A single-ORC mechanism for helicase loading has potential implications for DNA replication initiation in higher eukaryotes.

A mechanism in which two separate ORC molecules guide loading of the two helicases would require two independent nonspecific ORC-binding events. Each single Mcm2-7 helicase would then have to find an oppositely oriented helicase to complete helicase loading. In contrast, helicase loading guided by a single ORC that performs an inversion places fewer constraints on where helicases can be loaded and could still be supported with low ORC concentrations. Additionally, a full round of helicase loading completed by a single ORC could prevent non-productive loading of single helicases that cannot support bidirectional replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Champasa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification and labeling</title><p>Wild-type ORC and Cdc6 were purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frigola et al., 2013</xref>).

Complex (pre-RC) at all potential origins of DNA replication during the G1 phase of the cell division cycle. The pre-RC contains a double hexamer of Mcm2-7 subunits and each hexamer eventually becomes the core of the two replicative helicases during the initiation of DNA synthesis. The current paper addresses the role of ORC and Cdc6 in loading the Cdt1-bound Mcm2-7 hexamer onto origin DNA and the data show that a single ORC molecule can load two Mcm2-7 hexamers in a sequential loading reaction that involves ORC flipping on the origin DNA. The results nicely complement other studies that show a detailed pathway for pre-RC assembly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74282.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.10.06.463322">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.06.463322v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Helicase-tethered ORC Flip Enables Bidirectional Helicase Loading&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Bruce Stillman as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essentially there are some suggestions that request clarifications of the data and additions to the manuscript to make it more clear.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>These comments are mostly for clarification and discussion</p><p>1) While the abstract correctly states that a single ORC can load a double hexamer of Mcm2-7, their own data shows that at a low frequency, two ORC molecules can do the reaction. This should be so stated.</p><p>2) The abstract says &quot;quick succession&quot; – It might be more forceful to say &quot;within 8 seconds&quot;, considering that this step truly appears quick, compared to the first loading, and possibly the second.</p><p>3) In the early part of the Intro – it would be helpful to mention that yeast origins are heterogeneous in sequence, with ORC binding elements that have various distances from one another. Many readers could assume that each origin is identical in this respect, given that many bacterial origins, plasmid origins, and eukaryotic viral origins have very defined sequence and spacer requirements. True – this aspect is addressed in the Discussion to some extent – but the naïve reader should be more informed early on in the Intro.</p><p>4) In the 3rd paragraph of the intro – the Costa EM work (Miller 2019) is cited. It would be good to identify the origin used for that study.</p><p>5) Figure 2 results. The reader might have a hard time to understand that one is mixing all these proteins, and that all possible outcomes are being shown. This brings up the question of whether the reaction could be staged, for an easier interpretation of the entire paper (i.e. first bind ORC-Cdc6, or OCCM-ATPgS, and then proceed in the presence of excess unlabeled ORC). It is one reviewer's impression from E. Greene's work (maybe others?) that the ORC-Cdc6 is stably bound to ARS, and so is OCCM. So – it seems that this strategy could have been used. Is there a reason, for example regarding the instrumentation, that this is not the case? This question will come up in many readers minds, so it might as well be addressed early on.</p><p>6) On the bottom of page 6, the authors describe the SM events that occur. 28% of the molecules showed a two-step loading of Mcm2-7, and only 12% were analyzed because of the duration of the Mcm2-7 association. What are the remaining 88% of reactions? A comment on this is appropriate.</p><p>Of the 28% of DNA molecules with two increases in Mcm2-7 fluorescence, only 12% were long-lived and included in the data analysis (page 6). It is not entirely clear why the other 16% were excluded. Do they correspond to abortive loading events? A brief explanation in the main text would be helpful.</p><p>The Figure 1 results indicate 96 observables, which is fine – but is this all on one TIRF chip set-up, or does this number of observables require the sum of many different chip data sets? This same Q applies throughout. In this reviewer's mind, it the 96 observables are obtained for one TIRF chip set-up – the experiment should be repeated at least 3 times for a statistical reproducibility check.</p><p>7) Figure 1: The FRET results are shown in blue, but in fact it is red fluorophore emission that is excited by the green fluorophore excitation (correct?). In which case, it is a just a little bit confusing to see a blue line plot. It seems it should be red. This is the case in other Figures too. However, I like the blue. But – it should be stated in the legend that the blue line is the observed fluorescence for excitation at the green fluorophore, and the emission wavelength of the red fluorophore.</p><p>8) The inability of ORC-Orc6deltaN119 to form MO interactions would predict that the average dwell time of this mutant ORC on DNA should be shorter than that of WT ORC since it will not flip and rebind DNA after loading of the first MCM. Have the authors looked whether the data is consistent with this prediction? This could be added to Figure 5 – figure supplement 3.</p><p>9) On page 8 (second paragraph), the authors refer to three types of two-ORC double hexamer formation events, but only two of them, 8/166 and 14/166, are described. What is the third type?</p><p>10) In Figure 1c, can the authors indicate in the total emission trace the areas corresponding to protein-induced fluorescence enhancement? Given the noise in the traces, this enhancement is not easily recognizable to non-experts.</p><p>11) On page 9 (4th line from bottom) and in the legend of Figure 1-figure supplement 3, should 'Rem' be 'Aem'?</p><p>12) On page 18, the authors report that there is strong FRET between Cdt1 N-649 and ORC 5C-549, while Figure 4-figure supplement 1 states and shows the opposite. Can the authors clarify this inconsistency?</p><p>13) Figure 6 – figure supplement 3a should probably refer to Figure 6b instead of Figure 6c. In the legend of Figure 6 – figure supplement 3b, it seems that Mcm2-7 2C-650 should be Mcm2-7 3N-650.</p><p>14) Diffley/Dekker single molecule experiments, published recently (this year) indicate that they see single hexamers of MCM loading. Do the authors of the current study ever see single MCM loading?</p><p>15) Where are the ATP steps? Have the authors examined this? There are so many ATP requiring proteins in this system, and it would be good to have the discussion summarize the one, or more ATP sites, in which subunits, are needed for the steps in Figure 7. Alternatively, for the authors to summarize what is not yet known about ATP site identity or stoichiometry.</p><p>16) Figure 7. This is a very detailed model and will likely be reproduced in reviews. I suggest that the authors include ORC-Cdc6 induced DNA bending in the model because this is critical for the loading reaction as demonstrated by Feng et. al 2021. Indeed, DNA bending could place the second Mcm2-7 molecule in the correct orientation for the double hexamer formation.</p><p>17) Doesn't ORC bind throughout the cell cycle? Yet, it is indicated that ORC is ejected in the process of double hexamer formation. If possible, it would be nice to shed more light on this (i.e. by discussion, not experimentation).</p><p>18) They find that OM rapidly moves to a MO that anticipates a second M. This is supported by an ORC mutant? I find this pretty amazing. They presume O uses the first M as a tether while searching for a second O site. Do they see if one MCM is loaded – ever? (i.e. this overlaps with # 13).</p><p>118 Under the title &quot;Comparison of one-ORC and two-ORC mechanisms for helicase loading&quot;&quot; the concentration of ORC in the cell is touched upon. It would be good to let readers know that replication occurs in nuclear foci, and that intracellular concentration, which is dependent on proximity effects, cannot be known by simply determining the cellular abundance of a protein.</p><p>Two comments from the reviewers suggested additional experiments and while the consensus was that these experiments are not essential, nevertheless they are reported below to the authors so that they can consider them.</p><p>1) The authors propose that the N-terminal domain of Orc6 establishes a tether with Mcm2-7 to prevent ORC release into solution before MO and B2 interactions are formed but were not able to investigate the timing of Orc6N binding because N-terminal labeling of Orc6 interfered with protein function. Can the authors use an internal label to establish the timing of these events? It seems that forming such a tether prior to ORC release from the original DNA binding site would be key to prevent ORC dissociation into solution before MO interactions can occur.</p><p>2) Related to the previous point, the linker between Orc6 NTD and CTD is much shorter in higher eukaryotes, which would make it unlikely that Orc6N could tether ORC to the first MCM during the flip and prior to MO formation in these systems. Have the authors tried reducing Orc6 linker length? Does this still support Mcm2-7 loading by the proposed one-ORC-flip mechanism or does it shift loading towards a two-ORC mechanism?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74282.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>These comments are mostly for clarification and discussion</p><p>1) While the abstract correctly states that a single ORC can load a double hexamer of Mcm2-7, their own data shows that at a low frequency, two ORC molecules can do the reaction.

We performed a staged experiment in which we pre-bound ORC/Cdc6 to <italic>ARS1</italic> DNA, washed away all unbound proteins, and then added all the helicase loading proteins (Mcm2-7, Cdt1 and Cdc6) except ORC. Although the number of Mcm2-7 binding events observed under these conditions was reduced (likely due to ORC/Cdc6 dissociation from DNA during the wash step), we observed clear instances of double-hexamer formation. Importantly, in all double hexamer formation events with pre-bound ORC/Cdc6, MO formation was observed and it anticipated recruitment of the second Mcm2-7. Additionally, the fraction of first Mcm2-7 molecules with MO-FRET establishment and double hexamer formation was similar to that observed for reactions in which ORC was continuously present. We have added these results to the paper (see new section on page 25 “Pre-bound ORC/Cdc6 can form double hexamers without additional ORC in solution”, and modified Figure 5e and 5f). These results are as predicted for helicase loading mediated by a single ORC DNA-binding event.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) On the bottom of page 6, the authors describe the SM events that occur. 28% of the molecules showed a two-step loading of Mcm2-7, and only 12% were analyzed because of the duration of the Mcm2-7 association.

A brief explanation in the main text would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>As this reviewer points out, 28% of the total DNA molecules have two sequential increases in Mcm2-7 fluorescence. 12% of these events have long-lived second Mcm2‑7 associations ( &gt;= 20 frames or 48 seconds). The remaining 16% events are instances in which the second Mcm2-7 is associated for a short period of time (&lt;20 frames of acquisition). Since we observed OM-FRET throughout the second Mcm2-7 association in most of the short events, we conclude that these are unsuccessful helicase-loading events where the second Mcm2-7 is recruited but fails to remain associated with the origin. We have added the following clarification (italic portion) to the main text (bottom of page 6):</p><p>“These long-lived sequential associations occurred on 12% of DNAs and represent successful Mcm2-7 double-hexamer formation (Ticau et al., 2015). The remaining sequential associations (on 16% of DNAs) were short-lived (&lt;48 s), and we considered these to be unsuccessful instances of helicase loading (Ticau et al., 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Figure 1 results indicate 96 observables, which is fine – but is this all on one TIRF chip set-up, or does this number of observables require the sum of many different chip data sets?

For example, in Figure 1 we have 106 such replicates of the reaction. The data in that and most figures in the manuscript comes from combining data from multiple instances of an experiment, each being the result of a separate helicase-loading reaction (Author response Table 1). The only exceptions are the data for the ORC<sup>6∆N119</sup> mutant in Figure 5e-f where we had 418 Mcm2-7 associations from a single replicate, and the experiment we added in response to reviewer comment 5 (pre-bound ORC; Figure 5e-f).

We show that the ORC<sup>6∆N119</sup> mutant has shorter ORC dwell times on DNA compared to wild-type ORC. Further, in the wild-type ORC dataset, we find that establishing MO interactions is what extends ORC dwell times during helicase loading.

Can the authors clarify this inconsistency?</p></disp-quote><p>The average <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> observed when Cdt1 is present was 0.358 ± 0.003, which is easily distinguished from that of the OM-FRET pair (average <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> 0.72 ± 0.01). The text should say “Although Cdt1<sup>N‑649</sup> is also labeled with an acceptor fluorophore, this site of labeling does <italic>not</italic> exhibit strong FRET with ORC<sup>5C‑549”</sup>.

Do the authors of the current study ever see single MCM loading?</p></disp-quote><p>As we reported in our original single-molecule studies of helicase loading (Ticau et al., 2015), we observe associations of single loaded Mcm2-7 molecules. In our experiments, only a fraction (0.18 ± 0.02) of first Mcm2‑7 binding events convert to stable second Mcm2‑7 recruitment. Although many of these Mcm2-7 molecules are released, a subset have longer dwell times and may represent loaded single hexamers (Figure 5—figure supplement 3c). We did not investigate these events further as the current studies were focused on the mechanism of double-hexamer formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) -Where are the ATP steps? Have the authors examined this? There are so many ATP requiring proteins in this system, and it would be good to have the discussion summarize the one, or more ATP sites, in which subunits, are needed for the steps in Figure 7. Alternatively, for the authors to summarize what is not yet known about ATP site identity or stoichiometry.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph to the discussion that addresses the potential roles for ATP hydrolysis during helicase loading (Page 32).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Figure 7. This is a very detailed model and will likely be reproduced in reviews. I suggest that the authors include ORC-Cdc6 induced DNA bending in the model because this is critical for the loading reaction as demonstrated by Feng et. al 2021. Indeed, DNA bending could place the second Mcm2-7 molecule in the correct orientation for the double hexamer formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this change to the model in Figure 7 and Figure 7 —figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Doesn't ORC bind throughout the cell cycle? Yet, it is indicated that ORC is ejected in the process of double hexamer formation. If possible, it would be nice to shed more light on this (i.e. by discussion, not experimentation).</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous single-molecule studies established that ORC is released with the second Cdt1 molecule during helicase loading (Ticau et al., 2015, 2017). However, once the double-hexamer has formed, it is certainly possible that ORC re-associates with DNA. The original ChIP studies of ORC showed reduced ORC binding during G1 (vs G2/M), suggesting that having loaded Mcm2-7 reduces ORC binding (Aparicio et al., 1997). We suggest that this is due to a combination of ORC release after loading and obscuring of the ACS by loaded Mcm2-7 after helicase loading. It is also worth noting that although ChIP detects ORC binding to origins throughout the cell cycle, this assay does not distinguish between long and short associations with the DNA. Although interesting, we do feel that adding this discussion would be distracting since it is fairly distant from the main points of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) They find that OM rapidly moves to a MO that anticipates a second M. This is supported by an ORC mutant? I find this pretty amazing. They presume O uses the first M as a tether while searching for a second O site. Do they see if one MCM is loaded – ever? (i.e. this overlaps with # 13).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to point 13 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>118 Under the title &quot;Comparison of one-ORC and two-ORC mechanisms for helicase loading&quot;&quot; the concentration of ORC in the cell is touched upon. It would be good to let readers know that replication occurs in nuclear foci, and that intracellular concentration, which is dependent on proximity effects, cannot be known by simply determining the cellular abundance of a protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a discussion on liquid phase-separation recently reported for metazoan ORC (Parker et al., 2019; Hossain et al., 2021) on Page 34-35.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Two comments from the reviewers suggested additional experiments and while the consensus was that these experiments are not essential, nevertheless they are reported below to the authors so that they can consider them.</p><p>1) The authors propose that the N-terminal domain of Orc6 establishes a tether with Mcm2-7 to prevent ORC release into solution before MO and B2 interactions are formed but were not able to investigate the timing of Orc6N binding because N-terminal labeling of Orc6 interfered with protein function. Can the authors use an internal label to establish the timing of these events? It seems that forming such a tether prior to ORC release from the original DNA binding site would be key to prevent ORC dissociation into solution before MO interactions can occur.</p></disp-quote><p>Although very interesting, this is a difficult experiment as we have yet to obtain a labeled form of the Orc6 N-terminal domain that is functional for helicase loading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the previous point, the linker between Orc6 NTD and CTD is much shorter in higher eukaryotes, which would make it unlikely that Orc6N could tether ORC to the first MCM during the flip and prior to MO formation in these systems. Have the authors tried reducing Orc6 linker length? Does this still support Mcm2-7 loading by the proposed one-ORC-flip mechanism or does it shift loading towards a two-ORC mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and this is indeed a set of experiments that we would like to do in the future. However, we think that the addition of this data would not provide further evidence to support the conclusion we make in the current manuscript about whether one ORC can load both Mcm2-7 complexes in a double hexamer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
